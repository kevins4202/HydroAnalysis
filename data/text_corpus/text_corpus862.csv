4310,ahead forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration et0 is of great significance for real time irrigation decision making water resources allocation and hydrological drought assessment this study for the first time evaluated the forecasting performances of 16 d ahead daily weather variables and subsequent et0 at 51 weather stations across various climatic zones of china using the global ensemble reforecast v2 data provided by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep global ensemble forecast system gefs model particularly a novel machine learning model i e extreme gradient boosting xgboost was proposed to downscale and bias correct the gefs forecasts the results showed that the gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the inverse distance weighting idw and equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching edcdfm methods with decreases in mean rmse of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity rh wind speed ws and solar radiation rs by 36 2 33 5 35 7 75 0 and 27 0 and by 11 2 13 3 14 0 26 4 and 13 2 resulting in decreases in mean rmse of et0 by 35 0 and 18 2 respectively the overall forecasting performance of tmin nrmse 0 14 0 27 r2 0 82 0 95 was best followed by tmax nrmse 0 11 0 26 r2 0 74 0 94 rs nrmse 0 23 0 41 r2 0 34 0 77 rh nrmse 0 18 0 26 r2 0 27 0 72 and finally ws nrmse 0 34 0 46 r2 0 22 0 58 and their forecasting performances decreased with the increase in lead time nationally averaged rmse values of daily et0 for 16 d lead time 1 0 mm d 1 and 8 d lead time 0 9 mm d 1 were approximately 1 7 and 1 5 times of that for 1 d lead time 0 6 mm d 1 respectively average r2 values of et0 across china varied 0 56 0 85 for 1 16 d lead times while the corresponding nrmse values ranged 0 22 0 38 with more accurate et0 estimates in the temperate continental zone tcz and mountain plateau zone mpz than the temperate monsoon zone tmz and sub tropical monsoon zone smz the forecasting performance of seasonal et0 was generally better in summer followed by autumn spring and winter the greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of daily et0 was produced by the forecasting error of rs in all climatic zones followed by ws tmax and rh in tcz and mpz and by rh ws and tmax in tmz and smz however the influence of tmin was marginal in all climatic zones the results indicated that daily et0 across china can be satisfactorily forecasted using the gefs outputs downscaled by the xgboost model particularly for 1 8 d lead times keywords forecasting lead time reference evapotranspiration numerical weather prediction xgboost model 1 introduction medium range 1 2 weeks ahead forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration et0 is of crucial for irrigation scheduling design water resources allocation and hydrological drought assessment shrestha and shukla 2015 pelosi et al 2016 feng et al 2017a rhee and im 2017 jiang et al 2019a 2019b medina and tian 2020 because it provides more time for decision making in comparison to the short term forecasts and produces much more reliable estimates than the monthly and seasonal et0 forecasts thielen et al 2009 medina et al 2018 to enhance the reliability of decision making in agricultural water planning and management more accurate et0 forecasts are thus needed to estimate crop

2019 zhu et al 2020 given that et0 varies greatly with the weather forecasting et0 is crucial for making real time irrigation decisions the simplest approach for forecasting possible future daily et0 is to utilize the long term monthly mean et0 value time series approaches e g autoregressive integrated moving average arima have also been applied to forecast monthly weekly or daily et0 landeras et

adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis nourani et al 2020 are alternatives to time series models for forecasting et0 based on historical meteorological data or lagged et0 data generally the lagged et0 data based machine learning models outperform the history weather data based models mehdizadeh 2018 in addition machine learning models coupled with wavelet transfer and ensemble methods produce more accurate et0 estimates than the corresponding single model karbasi 2018 nourani et al 2020 previous studies have mainly focused on et0 forecasting with historical meteorological data but these may be not accurate enough for future water planning and management due to the large variability in historical and future climates alternatively meteorological variables required for et0 calculations can be obtained by public weather forecasts cai et al 2007 2009 guo et al 2011 luo et al 2015 traore et al 2016 2017 li et al 2018 yang et al 2016 2019a 2019b jiang et al 2019a 2019b which are further used to forecast et0 using empirical analytical or machine learning models e g hargraves hargreaves and samani 1985 penman monteith allen et al 1998 and ann traore et al 2017

temperatures weather types and wind scales cai et al 2007 2009 yang et al 2016 2019b machine learning models have also been successfully applied to forecast near future daily et0 with public weather forecasts worldwide guo et al 2011 luo et al 2015 traore et al 2017 nevertheless complete public weather forecasts required by the fao 56 pm model are always not available tian and martinez 2014 while numerical weather prediction nwp or global climate models gcm can generate sufficient meteorological variables for the fao 56 pm model over large regions at relatively high resolutions in recent years the outputs of nwp or gcm models have been used to forecast et0 in various countries such as the united states tian and martinez 2012a 2012b 2014 tian et al 2014 medina et al 2018 medina and tian 2020 australia perera et al 2014 zhao et al 2019a 2019b canada yan and mohammadian 2020 italy pelosi et al 2016 the united kingdom srivastava et al 2013 and chile silva et al 2010 however the outputs of nwp models generally cover large regions tens of kilometers and suffer from systematic errors which need to be downscaled to a local scale and bias corrected to improve the reliability linear regression methods medina et al 2018 interpolation based methods tian et al 2014 analog based methods tian and martinez 2012a 2012b nonhomogeneous gaussian regression approach medina and tian 2020 bayesian modeling approach zhao et al 2019a 2019b and probabilistic post processing methods medina and tian 2020 have been proposed to downscale or post process the outputs of the penn state ncar mm5 mesoscale model ncep cfsv2 model european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and national centers for environmental prediction ncep models forecasted daily and weekly et0 estimates across australia and the united states using nwp outputs were superior to those obtained with the conventional long term et0 average and the linear regression bias correction method perera et al 2014 medina and tian 2020 ahead forecasting of et0 with the outputs of nwp models has become increasingly popular due to their availability of complete weather variables required by the fao 56 pm model but they are still confined to a small number of countries e g the united states canada australia and the united kingdom and to relatively short lead time up to 10 d liu et al 2020b have recently forecasted 3 d ahead daily meteorological variables in china using china s nwp product i e the global regional assimilation and prediction system grapes and the t639 global medium term numerical forecast model t639l60 however due to the lack or limited availability of high resolution climate forecasting systems to the public medium range daily et0 forecasting using their own nwp outputs has been rare in developing counties and the applicability of global climate forecast products for et0 forecasting thus needs to be explored besides previous studies have not downscaled the nwp outputs liu et al 2020b or mainly focused on conventional downscaling methods such as the linear regression method medina et al 2018 interpolation based methods tian et al 2014 analog techniques tian and martinez 2012a and nonhomogeneous gaussian regression approach when applying the nwp outputs for et0 forecasting medina and tian 2020 but machine learning models have been rarely evaluated in downscaling the nwp outputs for et0 forecasting folberth et al 2019 im et al 2016 liu et al 2020a b sachindra et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the forecasting performances of 16 d ahead daily weather variables and et0 at 51 weather stations across china based on the outputs of a leading global nwp model i e ncep gefs model 2 propose a novel extreme gradient boosting xgboost model for downscaling and bias correcting the gefs forecasts and compared its performance with an interpolation based method and a quantile based mapping method 3 explore the regional and seasonal variations of daily et0 forecasting performance 4 quantify the contributions of errors in each et0 related meteorological variable to the error of et0 forecasting in various climatic zones of china to the best of our knowledge this is the first study examining the forecasting performance of daily et0 for up to 16 d lead time across china by downscaling the nwp outputs with a machine learning model 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area covered four distinct climatic zones of mainland china fig 1 i e the temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz and sub tropical monsoon zone smz fan et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 according to the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 tcz is characterized by the semi arid bs bw climate with a long term average annual precipitation of 269 mm and pan evaporation of 2148 mm tmz mpz and smz are characterized by the humid continental dw tundra et and humid subtropical cw cf climates respectively the long term average annual precipitation is 585 382 and 1320 mm in tmz mpz and smz while the corresponding pan evaporation is 1475 1883 and 1545 mm respectively the average altitude is 912 288 4236 and 611 m in tcz tmz mpz and smz respectively fig 1 2 2 data collection and post processing 2 2 1 observed meteorological data from automatic weather stations daily maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity rh wind speed ws at 10 m height and solar radiation rs during 2005 2015 were collected from 51 automatic weather stations across various climatic zones of china including 12 1 12 13 13 25 4 26 29 and 22 30 51 stations in tcz tmz mpz and smz respectively fig 1 more information on these stations are given in table 1 these meteorological data were observed by the national meteorological information center nmic of china meteorological administration cma who has strictly controlled the quality of meteorological data 2 2 2 numerical weather prediction outputs from the ncep gefs model the forecast datasets of meteorological variables used in this study were obtained from the noaa global ensemble reforecast v2 data issued by the ncep global ensemble forecast system gefs model these forecasts are freely available in the netcdf 4 format https psl noaa gov forecasts reforecast2 download html over the period from december 1984 to present the horizontal resolution of gefs is t254 0 5 50 km between grid points out to 8 d but it reduces to t190 1 0 70 km from 9 up to 16 d the retrieved variables included maximum and minimum air temperatures at 2 m height k u component and v component of wind speed at 10 m height m s 1 specific humidity at 2 m height g kg 1 and surface downward short wave radiation flux w m 2 for all the grid cells across china 3 53 n 73 135 e the obtained dataset included the 00 utc coordinated universal time control forecasts archived between january 1 and december 31 from 2005 to 2015 reforecast data were saved every 3 h for 1 3 d lead times and every 6 h from 4 up to 16 d 2 2 3 data processing and downscaling forecasted ws was obtained as the composite value of the u component and v component of ws at 10 m height which was further converted to ws at 2 m height using a logarithmic function allen et al 1998 rh was attained by developing relationships between air temperatures and specific humidity at 2 m height the surface downward short wave radiation flux was taken as rs forecasts from netcdf 4 data files were downscaled to the 51 selected weather stations within the grid cells the forecasted values of meteorological variables at the four grid points around each weather station were used as the inputs of the downscaling methods while the measured value at each weather station was taken as the output three methods were used to downscale the gefs forecasts i e the inverse distance weighting idw equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching edcdfm and extreme gradient boosting xgboost the idw method is an interpolation based downscaling method that derives the value of a meteorological variable at a specified location using data obtained from surrounding locations based on the weights computed from distances the edcdfm method is a quantile based mapping method which establishes a transfer function between the distribution of simulated variables and that of the observed variables during the control period and then employs this transfer function to adjust the distribution of future climate for all given percentiles the xgboost model is an efficient algorithm for cart type tree boosting the xgboost model consists of multiple decision trees each of which pays attention to the residuals of the previous tree and uses the gradient algorithm to find a new decision tree establishment method to reduce the residuals of model training yan et al 2021 the previous predictors are redeveloped to decrease the residuals at each iteration the xgboost model independently determines the type of loss function for model assessment the scores of all trees are averaged to be the predictive value for regression in short the model performance change caused by a node splitting in the cart tree can be evaluated according to the change of objective function value that is to say if the model performance of decision tree after node splitting is improved then it is adopted otherwise the splitting will stop more details about the idw edcdfm and xgboost downscaling methods are introduced by lu and wong 2008 li et al 2010 chen and guestrin 2016 respectively the edcdfm and xgboost models were trained using meteorological data during 2005 2010 and the developed models were used to downscale the gefs forecasts during 2011 2015 while the gefs forecasts during 2005 2015 were directly downscaled by the idw method a five fold cross validation temporal data partitioning strategy was applied to prevent model over fitting shiri 2019 kazemi et al 2020 the raw inputs and output data were normalized 0 1 with the maximum minimum normalization method to minimize the impact of absolute scales on the forecasting performances of the xgboost model fan et al 2019 the xgboost model was implemented in the r packages xgboost the key parameters of the xgboost model were identified by the trial and error method and optimized by the grid search method the maximum depth of trees max depth learning rate eta maximum number of boosting iteration nrounds and subsample ratio of the training instance subsample in xgboost models were optimized with them ranging from 5 to 15 at 1 intervals from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals respectively additional parameters were taken as the default values in the r package 2 2 4 calculation of daily et0 using fao 56 pm equation daily et0 mm d 1 was calculated using the fao 56 pm equation based on measured or downscaled metrological variables allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r

et0 the performances of the forecasted daily meteorological variables and et0 were evaluated by four widely utilized statistical indices i e coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse

meteorological variables or fao 56 et0 respectively n is the observation number for models with the same dataset lower values of rmse generally indicate good forecasting performances of daily weather variables or et0 and vice versa model performance is considered excellent when nrmse 10 good when 10 nrmse 20 fair when 20 nrmse 30 and poor when nrmse 30 jamieson et al 1991 higher r2 close to 1 implies better relationship between the forecasted and measured variables and vice versa pbias illustrates whether the model underestimates pbias 0 or overestimates pbias 0 daily weather variables or et0 3 results 3 1 comparison of downscaled meteorological variables by the idw edcdfm and xgboost methods the box plots of rmse of tmax tmin rh ws rs and subsequent et0 obtained by the three downscaling methods idw edcdfm and xgboost at the 51 stations for up to 16 d lead time are given in fig 2 rmse values of tmax tmin rh ws rs and subsequent et0 downscaled by the idw method ranged 1 8 15 3 c 1 7 14 1 c 8 3 49 0 0 7 6 3 m s 1 2 9 10 9 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 7 2 9 mm d 1 while the corresponding values ranged 1 9 7 3 c 1 9 7 8 c 7 1 25 0 0 4 2 0 m s 1 3 3 10 5 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 6 1 8 mm d 1 for the edcdfm method and ranged 1 6 6 4 c 1 2 6 6 c 5 6 19 8 0 3 1 1 m s 1 2 9 8 5 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 4 1 3 mm d 1 for the xgboost method compared with those obtained by the idw and edcdfm methods the mean rmse of tmax tmin rh ws and rs was decreased by 36 2 33 5 35 7 75 0 and 27 0 and by 11 2 13 3 14 0 26 4 and 13 2 resulting in decreases in mean rmse of et0 by 35 0 and 18 2 respectively the corresponding decreases in median rmse of tmax tmin rh ws rs and subsequent et0 were 28 8 26 4 31 4 74 9 27 9 and 32 8 compared with the idw method and 10 8 12 2 12 5 26 4 11 3 and 16 0 relative to the edcdfm method all these indicated that the overall performance of the xgboost model was best followed by the edcdfm and idw downscaling methods therefore the following results were analyzed based on the gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model 3 2 forecasting performances of weather variables downscaled by the xgboost model 3 2 1 maximum and minimum air temperatures the statistical results of forecasted daily maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures for up to 16 d lead time are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively as expected the forecasting performances of tmax and tmin

larger values 5 7 to 0 7 in tcz 3 2 3 wind speed the statistical results of forecasted daily ws for up to 16 d lead time are presented in fig 6 as expected the forecasting performance of ws gradually slowed down with the increase in lead time at all stations with very small variations rmse values of ws for 16 and 8 d lead times were approximately 1 4 and 1 3 times of that for 1 d lead time respectively average rmse values of ws varied from 0 5 to 0 7 m s 1 across china specifically larger average rmse values of ws 0 6 to 0 9 m s 1 were observed in tmz while smaller average rmse values

forecasted weather variables the forecasting performance of et0 declined with the increasing lead time at all stations but the increasing rate gradually slowed down with the increasing lead time especially after 8 d lead time rmse values of et0 for 16 and 8 d lead times were approximately 1 7 and 1 5 times of those for 1 d lead time respectively average rmse values of et0 varied from 0 6 to 1

values in summer 0 21 to 0 35 autumn 0 23 to 0 37 and spring 0 22 to 0 38 were smaller than the annual values 0 24 to 0 40 while the corresponding values in winter 0 28 to 0 43 were higher than the annual values for all lead times pbias values in autumn 3 0 to 5 9 and winter 4 0 to 9 6 were positive for all lead times while annual pbias values 2 8 to 0 5 and those in spring 2 3 to 3 5 and summer 1 9 to 2 7 varied from positive values to negative ones after about 3 d lead time 3 5 influences of forecasted weather variables on daily et0 forecasts to quantify the contributions of errors in each et0 related weather variable to the errors of et0 forecasting daily et0 forecasting were further conducted by replacing one of the five observed weather variables tmax tmin rh ws and rs each time with the corresponding forecasted values for up to 16 d lead time the performances of forecasted weather variables and et0 were represented by nrmse the greater the nrmse obtained when substituting a weather variable the larger error of the corresponding variable contributed to the et0 forecasts average nrmse values of forecasted daily et0 when replacing one corresponding forecasted weather variable each time in the four climatic zones of china for up to 16 d lead time are given in fig 11 as indicated by nrmse values the greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of et0 was obtained by substituting observed rs in all the climatic zones 0 13 to 0 35 followed by ws tmax and rh in tcz 0 11 to 0 14 0 04 to 0 11 and 0 05 to 0 08 respectively and mpz 0 06 to 0 07 0 05 to 0 08 and 0 03 to 0 07 respectively and by rh ws and tmax in tmz 0 08 to 0 13 0 08 to 0 12 and 0 04 to 0 07 respectively and smz 0 06 to 0 10 0 05 to 0 07 and 0 03 to 0 07 respectively however the reduction of tmin was marginal in all climatic zones 0 02 to 0 05 in tcz and mpz ws had the largest forecasting error among the five weather variables and its contribution to et0 error was also relatively high no 2 rh had the second largest forecasting error but its contribution to et0 error was relatively low no 4 rs had the moderate forecasting error no 3 but its contribution to et0 error was largest no 1 tmax had the lowest or relatively low forecasting error and its contribution to et0 error was moderate no 3 or relatively low no 4 tmin had the relatively low or lowest forecasting error and its

second largest forecasting error and its contribution to et0 error was largest no 1 tmax had the lowest forecasting errors and its contribution to et0 error was relatively low no 4 tmin had relative low or moderate forecasting errors and its contribution to et0 error was lowest no 5 rh had the moderate or relative low forecasting error but its contribution to et0 error was relatively high no 2 4 discussion downscaling of climate models is an important step when using the nwp or gcm forecasts which is aimed to remove the systematic bias of models and convert the simulated climate field from a coarse resolution to finer spatial resolution regression and interpolation based methods are the most widely used statistical downscaling methods due to their simplicity de caceres et al 2018 jeong et al 2020 the edcdfm method is a relative new quantile based mapping method that considers the climate changes over time li et al 2010 which generally performs better than the conventional statistical downscaling methods su et al 2016 yang et al 2018 machine learning models have become increasingly popular in developing statistical relationships between the outputs of model simulation and observed datasets before correcting the projections in this study gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the idw and edcdfm methods goly et al 2014 and shirkhani et al 2016 have also found that the svm model and mapping method outperformed the simple linear and nonlinear regression based models when applied for downscaling ws and precipitation the superiority of machine learning models e g xgboost and svm over the other two methods was largely attributed to their excellent capability in mapping the complex and nonlinear relationships between the meteorological variable at the station of interest and those at surrounding stations sachindra et al 2018 li et al 2020 van abel et al 2020 the xgboost model has been recommended for daily et0 estimation due to its comparable accuracy and stability but much less computational costs compared with the svm model fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 rmse values of tmax 2 0 5 1 c and tmin 1 8 4 7 c in tmz and smz of china in our study were generally smaller than or similar to the corresponding values of yang et al 2016 obtained from the public weather forecasts in china 3 2 5 0 c and 2 1 4 6 c respectively rmse and r2 values of forecasted rh varied 10 1 14 8 and 0 27 0 72 across china respectively which were generally similar to the corresponding values 4 5 12 9 and 0 0025 0 81 obtained across canada by yan and mohammadian 2020 rmse values of forecasted ws varied 0 5 0 7 m s 1 which were considerably smaller than the corresponding values 2 0 3 8 m s 1 obtained by yang et al 2016 from converting wind scales in china traore et al 2016 obtained low accuracy and large uncertainty in rs for up to 15 d lead time due to the poor forecasting performance of sunshine duration and subsequent rs obtained by the analytical method of cai et al 2007 and the empirical angström prescott model angstrom 1924 liu et al 2020b have recently forecasted 3 d ahead daily meteorological variables across china using the public weather forecasts and china s nwp product i e the global regional assimilation and prediction system grapes and the t639 global medium term numerical forecast model t639l60 it was found that that the forecasting performance of nwp was worse than that of public weather forecasts in terms of tmax and tmin while the forecasting performance of nwp was better in terms of ws and net radiation rn however the mean rmse values of 3 d ahead meteorological variables 4 22 c 3 95 c 1 43 m s 1 and 4 11 mj m 2 d 1 for tmax tmin ws and rn respectively obtained by china s nwp forecasts were much higher than those forecasted in our study 2 36 c 2 45 c 0 56 m s 1 and 4 26 mj m 2 d 1 for tmax tmin ws and rs respectively due to their lack of nwp downscaling the overall forecasting performances of tmin and tmax were best followed by rs rh and finally ws and their forecasting performances decreased with the increase in lead time these generally agreed well with previous studies perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 2019a the spatial variations of tmin and tmax within a region are generally small but ws rh and rs can vary greatly due to the large influences of topography elevation distance and cloud cover yuan et al 2015 fick and hijmans 2017 li and zha 2018 that s why the forecasting performances of rs rh and ws were generally worse than those of tmin and tmax the forecasting performance of tmin was relatively better than that of tmax and they had low impact on et0 estimation which agreed with earlier studies in china luo et al 2015 yang et al 2016 and in canada yan and mohammadian 2020 although the forecasting performances of ws and rh were worst or relatively poor their contributions to et0 error were relatively low similar findings have also been reported in previous studies pelosi et al 2016 yang et al 2016 medina et al 2018 rs had the moderate forecasting error but it contributed most to et0 error rs was thus the most influential meteorological variable on the calculation of et0 whose forecasting accuracy was crucial for improvements in et0 forecasts feng et al 2016 shiri 2017 fan et al 2018 karimi et al 2020 perera et al 2014 forecasted daily et0 up to 9 d lead time at 40 stations across australia using the nwp outputs the mean rmse and r2 of forecasted et0 were 0 73 mm d 1 and 0 85 for 1 d lead time and 1 45 mm d 1 and 0 38 for 9 d lead time while the corresponding values in our study were 0 6 mm d 1 and 0 87 for 1 d lead time and 0 9 mm d 1 and 0 67 for 9 d lead time liu et al 2020b found that better et0 estimates were obtained by china s nwp forecasts in tcz and mpz while public weather forecast provided more accurate et0 forecasts than nwp in tmz and smz however the mean rmse values of 3 d ahead et0 1 94 0 86 1 39 and 1 68 mm d 1 in tcz mpz tmz and smz respectively obtained by china s nwp forecasts were much higher than those forecasted in our study 0 63 0 57 0 62 and 0 77 mm d 1 respectively due to their lack of nwp downscaling which further highlighted the importance of downscaling when using the nwp outputs these results indicated that satisfactory et0 forecasts were obtained across china using the necp outputs downscaled by the xgboost model spatially the smallest rmse values of et0 were observed in mpz while the largest values occurred in smz r2 values were largest in tcz and smallest in smz while nrmse values were smallest in mpz and largest in tmz with regards to seasonal et0 rmse values were largest in summer and smallest in winter which was closely related to the proportionality between rmse and magnitude of seasonal et0 perera et al 2014 r2 values were smaller than the annual values as a result of smaller overall variability with the largest and smallest r2 values in autumn and summer among the seasons respectively the statistical variations of seasonal et0 were in good agreement with the findings of perera et al 2014 although the four statistical indices did not give consistent results the forecasting performance of daily et0 was generally better in tcz by region and in summer by season in terms of nrmse tcz is characterized by the semi arid bs bw climate with a long term average annual precipitation of 269 mm and pan evaporation of 2148 mm therefore the forecasted et0 can be better used for precision irrigation during the hot and dry summer in tmz in this study the obtained daily weather variables and et0 across various climatic zones of china from the ncep gefs model downscaled by the xgboost model generally produced higher performances compared with those in previous studies in china using china s nwp products and public weather forecasts luo et al 2015 yang et al 2019a 2019b however previous studies have suggested that the nwp outputs from ecmwf attained better performance than those from ncep in weather variables and et0 forecasting medina et al 2018 therefore the performances of other leading nwp models like ecmwf need to be further evaluated control forecasts of weather variables by the nwp models were used in this study and disturbed forecasts of weather variables should be explored to improve the forecasting performance in addition additional information such as elevation distance and cloud cover should be further incorporated in the xgboost model when downscaling the nwp forecasts to improve the performance in estimating meteorological variables especially rs 5 conclusions medium range et0 forecasting is fundamental in making real time irrigation decisions this study explored the forecasting performances of daily et0 at 51 stations across china up to 16 d lead time using weather variables from the global ensemble reforecast v2 data derived from the ncep global ensemble forecast system gefs model the results showed that gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the idw and edcdfm methods the forecasting performance of tmin was best followed by tmax rs rh and finally ws nationally averaged rmse values of et0 for 16 d and 8 d lead times were approximately 1 7 and 1 5 times of that for 1 d lead time respectively more accurate et0 estimates were obtained in tcz and mpz than tmz and smz of china the forecasting performance of seasonal et0 generally followed the order of summer autumn spring winter in terms of nrmse the greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of et0 was obtained by rs in all climatic zones followed by ws tmax and rh in tcz and mpz and by rh ws and tmax in tmz and smz however the influence of tmin was minimal in all climatic zones the results indicated that daily et0 across china can be satisfactorily forecasted using gefs outputs downscaled by the xgboost model for real time irrigation decisions and water

4310,ahead forecasting of daily reference evapotranspiration et0 is of great significance for real time irrigation decision making water resources allocation and hydrological drought assessment this study for the first time evaluated the forecasting performances of 16 d ahead daily weather variables and subsequent et0 at 51 weather stations across various climatic zones of china using the global ensemble reforecast v2 data provided by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep global ensemble forecast system gefs model particularly a novel machine learning model i e extreme gradient boosting xgboost was proposed to downscale and bias correct the gefs forecasts the results showed that the gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model were more accurate than those

and 8 d lead time 0 9 mm d 1 were approximately 1 7 and 1 5 times of that for 1 d lead time 0 6 mm d 1 respectively average r2 values of et0 across china varied 0 56 0 85 for 1 16 d lead times while the corresponding nrmse values ranged 0 22 0 38 with more accurate et0 estimates in the temperate continental zone tcz and mountain plateau zone mpz than the temperate monsoon zone tmz and sub tropical monsoon zone smz the forecasting performance of seasonal et0 was generally better in summer followed by autumn spring and winter the greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of daily et0 was produced by the forecasting error of rs in all climatic zones followed by ws tmax and rh in tcz and mpz and by rh ws and tmax in tmz and smz however the influence of tmin was marginal in all climatic zones the results indicated that daily et0 across china can be satisfactorily forecasted using the gefs outputs downscaled by the xgboost model particularly for 1 8 d lead times keywords

numerical weather prediction nwp or global climate models gcm can generate sufficient meteorological variables for the fao 56 pm model over large regions at relatively high resolutions in recent years

t639l60 however due to the lack or limited availability of high resolution climate forecasting systems to the public medium range daily et0 forecasting using their own nwp outputs has been rare in developing counties and the applicability of global climate forecast products for et0 forecasting thus needs to be explored besides previous studies have not downscaled the nwp outputs liu et al 2020b

methodology 2 1 study area the study area covered four distinct climatic zones of mainland china fig 1 i e the temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz and sub tropical monsoon zone smz fan et al 2016 zheng et al 2019 according to the köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 tcz is characterized by the semi arid bs bw climate with a long term average annual precipitation of 269 mm and pan evaporation of 2148 mm tmz mpz and smz are characterized by the humid continental dw tundra et and humid subtropical cw cf climates respectively the long term average annual precipitation is 585 382 and 1320 mm in tmz mpz and smz while the corresponding pan evaporation is 1475 1883 and 1545 mm respectively the average altitude is 912 288 4236 and 611 m in tcz tmz mpz and smz respectively fig 1 2 2 data collection and post processing 2 2 1 observed meteorological data from automatic weather stations daily maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity rh wind speed ws at 10 m height and solar radiation rs during 2005 2015 were collected from 51 automatic weather stations across various climatic zones of china including 12 1 12 13 13 25 4 26 29 and 22 30 51 stations in tcz tmz mpz and smz respectively fig 1 more information on these stations are given in table 1 these meteorological data were observed by the national meteorological information center nmic of china meteorological administration cma who has strictly controlled the quality of meteorological data 2 2 2 numerical weather prediction outputs from the ncep gefs model the forecast datasets of meteorological variables used in this study were obtained from the noaa global ensemble reforecast v2 data issued by the ncep global ensemble forecast system gefs model these forecasts are freely available in the netcdf 4 format https psl noaa gov forecasts reforecast2 download html over the period from december 1984 to present the horizontal resolution of gefs is t254 0 5 50 km between grid points out to 8 d but it reduces to t190 1 0 70 km from 9 up to 16 d the retrieved variables included maximum and minimum air temperatures at 2 m height k u component and v component of wind speed at 10 m height m s 1 specific humidity at 2 m height g kg 1 and surface downward short wave radiation flux w m 2 for all the grid cells across china 3 53 n 73 135 e the obtained dataset included the 00 utc coordinated universal time control forecasts archived between january 1 and december 31 from 2005 to 2015 reforecast data were saved every 3 h for 1 3 d lead times and every 6 h from 4 up to 16 d 2 2 3 data processing and downscaling forecasted ws was obtained as the composite value of the u component and v component of ws at 10 m height which was further converted to ws at 2 m height using a logarithmic function allen et al 1998 rh was attained by developing relationships between air temperatures and specific humidity at 2 m height the surface downward short wave radiation flux was taken as rs forecasts from netcdf 4 data files were downscaled to the 51 selected weather stations within the grid cells the forecasted values of meteorological variables at the four grid points around each weather station were used as the inputs of the downscaling methods while the measured value at each weather station was taken as the output three methods were used to downscale the gefs forecasts i e the inverse distance weighting idw equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching edcdfm and extreme gradient boosting xgboost the idw method is an interpolation based downscaling method that derives the value of a meteorological variable at a specified location using data obtained from surrounding locations based on the weights computed from distances the edcdfm method is a quantile based mapping method which establishes a transfer function between the distribution of simulated variables and that of the observed variables during the control period and then employs this transfer function to adjust the distribution of future climate for all given percentiles the xgboost model is an efficient algorithm for cart type tree boosting the xgboost model consists of multiple decision trees each of which pays attention to the residuals of the previous tree and uses the gradient algorithm to find a new decision tree establishment method to reduce the residuals of model training yan et al 2021 the previous predictors are redeveloped to decrease the residuals at each iteration the xgboost model independently determines the type of loss function for model assessment the scores of all trees are averaged to be the predictive value for regression in short the model performance change caused by a node splitting in the cart tree can be evaluated according to the change of objective function value that is to say if the model performance of decision tree after node splitting is improved then it is adopted otherwise the splitting will stop more details about the idw edcdfm and xgboost downscaling methods are introduced by lu and wong 2008 li et al 2010 chen and guestrin 2016 respectively the edcdfm and xgboost models were trained using meteorological data during 2005 2010 and the developed models were used to downscale the gefs forecasts during 2011 2015 while the gefs forecasts during 2005 2015 were directly downscaled by the idw method a five fold cross validation temporal data partitioning strategy was applied to prevent model over fitting shiri 2019 kazemi et al 2020 the raw inputs and output data were normalized 0 1 with the maximum minimum normalization method to minimize the impact of absolute scales on the forecasting performances of the xgboost model fan et al 2019 the xgboost model was implemented in the r packages xgboost the key parameters of the xgboost model were identified by the trial and error method and optimized by the grid search method the maximum depth of trees max depth learning rate eta maximum number of boosting iteration nrounds and subsample ratio of the training instance subsample in xgboost models were optimized with them ranging from 5 to 15 at 1 intervals from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 0 1 to 1 0 at 0 1 intervals respectively additional parameters were taken as the default values in the r package 2 2 4

mean rmse of tmax tmin rh ws and rs was decreased by 36 2 33 5 35 7 75 0 and 27 0 and by 11 2 13 3 14 0 26 4 and 13 2 resulting in decreases in mean rmse of et0 by 35 0 and 18 2 respectively the corresponding decreases in median rmse of tmax tmin rh ws rs and subsequent et0 were 28 8 26 4 31 4 74 9 27 9 and 32 8 compared with the idw method and 10 8 12 2 12 5 26 4 11 3 and 16 0 relative to the edcdfm method all these indicated that the overall performance of the xgboost model was best followed by the edcdfm and idw downscaling methods therefore the following results were analyzed based on the gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model 3 2 forecasting performances of weather variables downscaled by the xgboost model 3 2 1 maximum and minimum air temperatures the statistical results of forecasted daily maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures for up to 16 d lead time are presented in figs 3 and 4 respectively as expected the forecasting performances of tmax and tmin declined with the increasing lead time at all stations but the increasing rate gradually slowed down with the increasing lead time especially after 8 d the rmse of tmax and tmin approximately doubled as the lead time increased from 1 to 16 d averaged over all stations rmse of tmax varied from 2 2 to 4 8 c while that of tmin ranged between 2 4 and 4 0 c specifically larger mean rmse values of tmax

values of ws were smaller than 0 40 after 4 d lead time at most stations average nrmse values of ws varied from 0 34 to 0 46 across china indicating an overall poor forecasting performance in ws for up to 16 d lead time with smaller values 0 32 to 0 43 in smz and larger values 0 32 to 0 49 in tcz and tmz average pbias values of ws across china varied from 1 9 to 3 5 with smaller pbias values 1 1 to 3 2 in smz and larger values 4 5 to 5 9 in tmz 3 2 4 solar radiation the statistical results of forecasted daily rs for up to16 d lead time are shown in fig 7 as expected the forecasting performances of rs declined with the increasing lead time at all stations but the increasing rate gradually decreased with the increase in lead time especially after 8 d lead time rmse values of rs for 16 and 8 d lead times were approximately 1 6 and 1 5 times of that for 1 d lead time respectively average rmse values of rs across china varied from 3 9 to 6 3 mj m 2 d 1 specifically larger

forecasted weather variables the forecasting performance of et0 declined with the increasing lead time at all stations but the increasing rate gradually slowed down with the increasing lead time especially after 8 d lead time rmse values of et0 for 16 and 8 d lead times were approximately 1 7 and 1 5 times of those for 1 d lead time respectively average rmse values of et0 varied from 0 6 to 1 0 mm d 1 across china fig 9 specifically larger average rmse values of et0 0 7 to 1 2 mm d 1 were observed in smz while smaller average rmse values of et0 0 5 to 0 8 mm d 1 were obtained in mpz average r2 values of et0 varied from 0 56 to 0 85 across china with larger values in tcz 0 82 to 0 93 and smaller values in smz 0 35 to 0 77 especially r2 values of et0 were smaller than 0 50 after 8 d lead time at most stations in smz average nrmse values of et0 across china varied from 0 22 to 0 38 indicating an overall fair forecasting performance in et0 for 1 8 d lead times and a poor

3 to 2 1 in tcz and larger values 1 3 to 3 0 in mpz et0 was slightly over forecasted at most stations in tcz and mpz and the over forecasting gradually increased with the increasing lead time fig 9 however et0 was slightly under forecasted for up to 16 d lead time at most stations in tmz and smz and the under forecasting gradually decreased as the lead time increased afterwards et0 was slightly over forecasted and the over forecasting gradually increased with the increasing lead time 3 4 forecasting performance of seasonal reference evapotranspiration this section investigated the forecasting performances of daily et0 in spring mam summer jja autumn sdn and winter djf fig 10 shows the statistical results of forecasted daily et0 at the 51 stations during each season and the whole year for up to 16 d lead time rmse values of seasonal et0 followed the order of summer 0 9 to 1 4 mm d 1 spring 0 7 to 1 2 mm d 1 autumn 0 5 to 0 8 mm d 1 winter 0 3 to 0 4 mm d 1 and the former two rmse values were greater than the annual values 0 6 to 1 0 mm d 1 rmse values in summer spring and autumn were approximately 3 0 3 5 and 2 0 times of those in winter for all lead times respectively seasonal r2 values 0 02 to 0 79 were smaller than the annual values 0 56 to 0 84 the largest and smallest r2 values occurred in autumn 0 45 to 0 79 and summer 0 02 to 0 58 among the seasons for all lead times respectively particularly r2 in summer was greatly reduced from 0 58 for 1 d lead time to 0 37 for 3 d lead time and further to 0 12 for 8 d lead time in general nrmse values in summer 0 21 to 0 35 autumn 0 23 to 0 37 and spring 0 22 to 0 38 were smaller than the annual values 0 24 to 0 40 while the corresponding values in winter 0 28 to 0 43 were higher than the annual values for all lead times pbias values in autumn 3 0 to 5 9 and winter 4 0 to 9 6 were positive for all lead times while annual pbias values 2 8 to 0 5 and those in spring 2 3 to 3 5 and summer 1 9 to 2 7 varied from positive values to negative ones after about 3 d lead time 3 5 influences of forecasted weather variables on daily et0 forecasts to quantify the contributions of errors in each et0 related weather variable to the errors of et0 forecasting daily et0 forecasting were further conducted by replacing one of the five observed weather variables tmax tmin rh ws and rs each time with the corresponding forecasted values for up to 16 d lead time the performances of forecasted weather variables and et0 were represented by nrmse the greater the nrmse obtained when substituting a weather variable the larger error of the corresponding variable contributed to the et0 forecasts average nrmse values of forecasted daily et0 when replacing one corresponding forecasted weather variable each time in the four climatic zones of china for up to 16 d lead time are given in fig 11 as indicated by nrmse values the greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of et0 was obtained by substituting observed rs in all the climatic zones 0 13 to 0 35 followed by ws tmax and rh in tcz 0 11 to 0 14 0 04 to 0 11 and 0 05 to 0 08 respectively and mpz 0 06 to 0 07 0 05 to 0 08 and 0 03 to 0 07 respectively and by rh ws and tmax in tmz 0 08 to 0 13 0 08 to 0 12 and 0 04 to 0 07 respectively and smz 0 06 to 0 10 0 05 to 0 07 and 0 03 to 0 07 respectively however the reduction of tmin was marginal in all climatic zones 0 02 to 0 05 in tcz and mpz ws had the largest forecasting error among the five weather variables and its contribution to et0 error was also relatively high no 2 rh had the second largest forecasting error but its contribution to et0 error was relatively low no 4 rs had the moderate forecasting error no 3 but its contribution to et0 error was largest no 1 tmax had the lowest or relatively low forecasting error and its contribution to et0 error was moderate no 3 or relatively low no 4 tmin had the relatively low or lowest forecasting error and its contribution to et0 error was lowest no 5 in tmz and smz ws also had the largest forecasting error among the five weather variables but its contribution to et0 error was moderate no 3 rs had the second largest forecasting error and its contribution to et0 error was largest no 1 tmax had the lowest forecasting errors and its contribution to et0 error was relatively low no 4 tmin had relative low or moderate forecasting errors and its contribution to et0 error was lowest no 5 rh had the moderate or relative low forecasting error but its contribution to et0 error was relatively high no 2 4 discussion downscaling of climate models is an important step when using the nwp or gcm forecasts which is aimed to remove the systematic bias of models and convert the simulated climate field from a coarse resolution to finer spatial resolution regression and interpolation based methods are the most widely used statistical downscaling methods due to their simplicity de caceres et al 2018 jeong et al 2020 the edcdfm method is a relative new quantile based mapping method that considers the climate changes over time li et al 2010 which generally performs better than the conventional statistical downscaling methods su et al 2016 yang et al 2018 machine learning models have become increasingly popular in developing statistical relationships between the outputs of model simulation and observed datasets before correcting the projections in this study gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the idw and edcdfm methods goly et al 2014 and shirkhani et al 2016 have also found that the svm model and mapping method outperformed the simple linear and nonlinear regression based models when applied for downscaling ws and precipitation the superiority of machine learning models e g xgboost and svm over the other two methods was largely attributed to their excellent capability in mapping the complex and nonlinear relationships between the meteorological variable at the station of interest and those at surrounding stations sachindra et al 2018 li et al 2020 van abel et al 2020 the xgboost model has been recommended for daily et0 estimation due to its comparable accuracy and stability but much less computational costs compared with the svm model fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 rmse values of tmax 2 0 5 1 c and tmin 1 8 4 7 c in tmz and smz of china in our study were generally smaller than or similar to the corresponding values of yang et al 2016 obtained from the public weather forecasts in china 3 2 5 0 c and 2 1 4 6 c respectively rmse and r2 values of forecasted rh varied 10 1 14 8 and 0 27 0 72 across china respectively which were generally similar to the corresponding values 4 5 12 9 and 0 0025 0 81 obtained across canada by yan and mohammadian 2020 rmse values of forecasted ws varied 0 5 0 7 m s 1 which were considerably smaller than the corresponding values 2 0 3 8 m s 1 obtained by yang et al 2016 from converting wind scales in china traore et al 2016 obtained low accuracy and large uncertainty in rs for up to 15 d lead time due to the poor forecasting performance of sunshine duration and subsequent rs obtained by the analytical method of cai et al 2007 and the empirical angström prescott model angstrom 1924 liu et al 2020b have recently forecasted 3 d ahead daily meteorological variables across china using the public weather forecasts and china s nwp product i e the global regional assimilation and prediction system grapes and the t639 global medium term numerical forecast model t639l60 it was found that that the forecasting performance of nwp was worse than that of public weather forecasts in terms of tmax and tmin while the forecasting performance of nwp was better in terms of ws and net radiation rn however the mean rmse values of 3 d ahead meteorological variables 4 22 c 3 95 c 1 43 m s 1 and 4 11 mj m 2 d 1 for tmax tmin ws and rn respectively obtained by china s nwp forecasts were much higher than those forecasted in our study 2 36 c 2 45 c 0 56 m s 1 and 4 26 mj m 2 d 1 for tmax tmin ws and rs respectively due to their lack of nwp downscaling the overall forecasting performances of tmin and tmax were best followed by rs rh and finally ws and their forecasting performances decreased with the increase in lead time these generally agreed well with previous studies perera et al 2014 yang et al 2016 2019a the spatial variations of tmin and tmax within a region are generally small but ws rh and rs can vary greatly due to the large influences of topography elevation distance and cloud cover yuan et al 2015 fick and hijmans 2017 li and zha 2018 that s why the forecasting performances of rs rh and ws were generally worse than those of tmin and tmax the forecasting performance of tmin was relatively better than that of tmax and they had low impact on et0 estimation which agreed with earlier studies in china luo et al 2015 yang et al 2016 and in canada yan and mohammadian 2020 although the forecasting performances of ws and rh were worst or relatively poor their contributions to et0 error were relatively low similar findings have also been reported in previous studies pelosi et al 2016 yang et al 2016 medina et al 2018 rs had the moderate forecasting error but it contributed most to et0 error rs was thus the most influential meteorological variable on the calculation of et0 whose forecasting accuracy was crucial for improvements in et0 forecasts feng et al 2016 shiri 2017 fan et al 2018 karimi et al 2020 perera et al 2014 forecasted daily et0 up to 9 d lead time at 40 stations across australia using the nwp outputs the mean rmse and r2 of forecasted et0 were 0 73 mm d 1 and 0 85 for 1 d lead time and 1 45 mm d 1 and 0 38 for 9 d lead time while the corresponding values in our study were 0 6 mm d 1 and 0 87 for 1 d lead time and 0 9 mm d 1 and 0 67 for 9 d lead time liu et al 2020b found that better et0 estimates were obtained by china s nwp forecasts in tcz and mpz while public weather forecast provided more accurate et0 forecasts than nwp in tmz and smz however the mean rmse values of 3 d ahead et0 1 94 0 86 1 39 and 1 68 mm d 1 in tcz mpz tmz and smz respectively obtained by china s nwp forecasts were much higher than those forecasted in our study 0 63 0 57 0 62 and 0 77 mm d 1 respectively due to their lack of nwp downscaling which further highlighted the importance of downscaling when using the nwp outputs these results indicated that satisfactory et0 forecasts were obtained across china using the necp outputs downscaled by the xgboost model spatially the smallest rmse values of et0 were observed in mpz while the largest values occurred in smz r2 values were largest in tcz and smallest in smz while nrmse values were smallest in mpz and largest in tmz with regards to seasonal et0 rmse values were largest in summer and smallest in winter which was closely related to the proportionality between rmse and magnitude of seasonal et0 perera et al 2014 r2 values were smaller than the annual values as a result of smaller overall variability with the largest and smallest r2 values in autumn and summer among the seasons respectively the statistical variations of seasonal et0 were in good agreement with the findings of perera et al 2014 although the four statistical indices did not give consistent results the forecasting performance of daily et0 was generally better in tcz by region and in summer by season in terms of nrmse tcz is characterized by the semi arid bs bw climate with a long term average annual precipitation of 269 mm and pan evaporation of 2148 mm therefore the forecasted et0 can be better used for precision irrigation during the hot and dry summer in tmz in this study the obtained daily weather variables and et0 across various climatic zones of china from the ncep gefs model downscaled by the xgboost model generally produced higher performances compared with those in previous studies in china using china s nwp products and public weather forecasts luo et al 2015 yang et al 2019a 2019b however previous studies have suggested that the nwp outputs from ecmwf attained better performance than those from ncep in weather variables and et0 forecasting medina et al 2018 therefore the performances of other leading nwp models like ecmwf need to be further evaluated control forecasts of weather variables by the nwp models were used in this study and disturbed forecasts of weather variables should be explored to improve the forecasting performance in addition additional information such as elevation distance and cloud cover should be further incorporated in the xgboost model when downscaling the nwp forecasts to improve the performance in estimating meteorological variables especially rs 5 conclusions medium range et0 forecasting is fundamental in making real time irrigation decisions this study explored the forecasting performances of daily et0 at 51 stations across china up to 16 d lead time using weather variables from the global ensemble reforecast v2 data derived from the ncep global ensemble forecast system gefs model the results showed that gefs forecasts downscaled by the xgboost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the idw and edcdfm methods the forecasting performance of tmin was best followed by tmax rs rh and finally ws nationally averaged rmse values of et0 for 16 d and 8 d lead times were approximately 1 7 and 1 5 times of that for 1 d lead time respectively more accurate et0 estimates were obtained in tcz and mpz than tmz and smz of china the forecasting performance of seasonal et0 generally followed the order of summer autumn spring winter in terms of nrmse the greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of et0 was obtained by rs in all climatic zones followed by ws tmax and rh in tcz and mpz and by rh ws and tmax in tmz and smz however the influence of tmin was minimal in all climatic zones the results indicated that daily et0 across china can be satisfactorily forecasted using gefs outputs downscaled by the xgboost model for real time irrigation decisions and water

4311,a well constructed drainage network is essential for hydrological modeling agricultural watersheds with heavy human alternations often contain man made features like terraced fields and ponds incorporating these features in the drainage network in these watersheds is extremely important for hydrological modeling this study proposed a novel hybrid vector raster approach to drainage network construction in this type of regions first a watershed is discretized using a hybrid vector raster data model to accurately represent the shapes and areas of irregular geographical entities then the flow directions among discretized units are determined firstly within each land use type and then on the boundaries of different land use types based on elevation and land use specific boundary rules after that loops among units are processed to make sure each unit can flow out of the watershed a small agricultural watershed in jiangsu province china was selected to conduct a case study and the results showed that the proposed method can obtain a more realistic drainage network than traditional methods both in terms of geometric shapes and spatial topology keywords drainage network hybrid vector raster data model spatial discretization flow direction watershed rice terraces and ponds 1 introduction water is an important medium for mass transport in a watershed to characterize the processes such as soil erosion and nutrient migration at the watershed scale adequate modeling of the drainage network is a prerequisite heathwaite et al 2005 wu and lane 2017 chen et al 2020a there are usually two steps for constructing a drainage network first the watershed is discretized into basic spatial units and then the flow directions among these units are determined choi et al 2011 duke et al 2006 spatial discretization can be conducted using raster based models like regular grid cells or vector based models such as contour line based flow tubes triangulated irregular network tin and arbitrary polygons lu et al 2019 discretization using regular grid cells is the most commonly used approach because the involved data structure and algorithm are simple liu et al 2014 wang et al 2019 however a very fine resolution needs to be adopted to represent irregular features such as terraced fields and ditches using the grid based data model dehotin and braud 2008 thomas et al 2017 which will lead to high storage and computational burden so the gird based approach is more suitable for natural watersheds other than for watersheds affected by human activities contour line based flow tubes can simplify the flow relationships among spatial units into one dimension but it is also not suitable to represent irregular features grayson et al 1992 vertessy et al 1993 maunder 1999 the tin approach is good at characterizing the geometry of terrain and man made objects but it is not effective in representing the functions of some geographic entities taking a pond as an example rather than discretizing it as multiple triangles treating it as a whole is more straightforward and effective for hydrological modeling discretization using appropriate arbitrary polygons can both characterize the geometry of features well and be flexible to reflect their functions although the related data structure and algorithms are more complex than the grid based approach band et al 2001 lagacherie et al 2010 sanzana et al 2017 in agricultural watersheds because of the irregular shapes of man made features such as fields and ditches constructing drainage networks based on arbitrary polygons is thought to be suitable for drainage network construction for example aurousseau et al 2009 proposed a method to build a field based drainage network by identifying the inlets and outlets for surface water flow on each field according to elevation lagacherie et al 2010 divided a catchment into irregularly sized and shaped polygons considering field boundaries ditch network sub catchment limits and natural limits e g soil geology and then determined the flow relationships among the discretized units this type of approach can give an improved functional spatial representation for water flow in agricultural watersheds for the arbitrary polygon based approach the characteristics of different types of features should be considered when determining the flow relationships among polygons current research mostly focuses on watersheds with sloping farmlands aurousseau et al 2009 lagacherie et al 2010 and new methods are still needed for other types of watersheds this paper focuses on the watersheds with rice terraces and ponds which are widely spread in the hilly regions of south china and many other regions in asia liu et al 2019 there are small ditches around every rice field which are connected to larger ditches and then to ponds and rivers these artificial features combined with natural land covers in the watershed like forests form a unique drainage network fig 1 considering that it is suitable to use different discretization methods for natural and artificial landscapes this study aims to propose a hybrid vector raster approach to drainage network construction in agricultural watersheds with terraced fields and ponds in section 2 we present the methodology for spatial discretization and flow direction determination section 3 applies and validates this method in a small agricultural watershed in jiangsu province china and the implication of the proposed method is discussed the conclusions and future research directions are presented in section 4 2 methodology compared with the drainage network construction in natural watersheds this study s main challenges include 1 how to represent the irregular shapes of rice terraces and ponds and 2 how to determine the flow directions among polygons ditches with irregular shapes in this study we proposed a hybrid vector raster approach to the spatial discretization and corresponding methods for flow direction determination which are described as following 2 1 spatial discretization there are three steps in the spatial discretization including 1 polygonal representation of objects with flat interiors i e terraced fields and ponds 2 raster representation of areas with varying elevation 3 linking the two areas by resolving slivers for terraced rice fields fig 2 a ridges are used as boundaries and each field is treated as one unit there are usually small ditches around each field which are represented as lines because the ditches are very narrow we assume that they have the same location as ridges for ponds each pond is treated as a single spatial unit fig 2b the land use types such as grassland forest residential land and roads are discretized as grid cells fig 2c and d the polygons of these types in a land use map are intersected with a grid lattice which will generate grid units in the interior of each polygon and incomplete grid units around the boundaries of polygons there may exist some sliver polygons which should be merged with adjacent units to make sure the discretized units have reasonable sizes the merging rule for grassland forest and residential land is that if the area of a polygon is less than a threshold i e half of the area of a grid cell it will be merged a sliver polygon will be merged to the adjacent grid cell with the longest common edge with it to make the shape more compact for roads because of their narrow shapes the discretized units usually have small areas so the perimeter threshold is used as the merging criterion instead of the area threshold in addition to avoid the case that a road is divided lengthways fig 2d two polygons are merged if the length of their adjacent line is close to the edge length of the grid cell 2 2 determination of flow direction considering the characteristics of flow paths are often different for different land use types flow directions among discretized units are first determined within each land use type the flow directions on the boundaries of different land use types are determined according to predefined rules as presented in section 2 2 2 finally the loops among units are processed so that each discretized unit can flow into a river or outside of the basin in this way the drainage network can be constructed it should be noted that the rivers in this study were extracted from high resolution aerial images rather than morphometric analysis but the rivers can still be encoded by geomorphology based methods such as the widely used horton strahler method strahler 1964 2 2 1 determination of flow direction within each land use type for terraced rice fields there are usually small ditches around each field it is assumed that each rice field s runoff flows into a surrounding ditch from the lowest point on its boundary based on dem digital elevation model and then flows along ditches depression filling is used to remove local sinks in the ditch network prior to flow direction determination wang et al 2019 the mv algorithm which was originally proposed for the raster data model moran and vezina 1993 was applied to the ditch network this algorithm s basic idea is to superimpose each unit with a sufficiently thick water layer and then gradually strip the water layer according to heuristic rules to make sure that each unit can flow to one of its neighboring units when applied to a ditch network the nodes in the ditch network are compared with the grid cells in the original algorithm and the nodes that lie near the boundaries between rice fields and their adjacent units that have other land use types are set as boundary points water can flow out of the ditch network from these boundary points after depression filling the maximum downslope gradient principle is used to determine the flow directions among nodes in the ditch network which means water will flow from one node to its neighboring node with the largest downslope gradient when each node s flow direction is determined the runoff from each field can find a pathway leaving the rice field area as shown in fig 3 for roads with ditches alongside them runoff from a road will first enter the ditches by the roadside and then flow along the ditches it is assumed that the ditches on both sides of a road follow the same flow direction for simplicity each discretized road unit and the ditches along it are taken as a whole and water will flow from one road unit to another considering the construction of roads and ditches will remove small scale topographic relief local depressions in the road ditch network are filled if they are shallower than a defined threshold for roads without ditches alongside them and the other land use types discretized by grid cells e g forest grassland and residential land the flow direction is determined by the d8 algorithm from a depression filled dem o callaghan and mark 1984 2 2 2 determination of flow direction on the boundaries of different land use types there are some boundary units within each land use type that receive water from other units but do not flow to other units these units are supposed to flow to adjacent units of other land use types and are called outlet units in this paper a directed graph can be used to model the flow relationships among units the discretized areal units or the nodes in ditches are expressed as nodes in the graph and the flow directions are expressed as links for each type of land use the outlet units can be picked out by selecting the nodes with an out degree of zero for these outlet units rules are defined to determine the flow directions if an outlet unit is adjacent to a river water from this unit will preferentially flow into the river otherwise water is supposed to flow towards the adjacent areal unit with the lowest elevation there are some special cases that need to be handled if the outlet unit is an areal unit and its lowest adjacent unit is rice field water will flow to the ditch between the two areal units from the lowest intersected node if the outlet unit is a ditch point and it is adjacent to a pond water will flow to that pond the logic of these rules is presented in algorithm 1 using natural language and python like grammar algorithm 1 the rules to determine flow directions on the boundaries of different land use types 1 rule 1 2 if outlet unit is adjacent to a river unit river unit 3 water flows from outlet unit to river unit 4 rule 2 5 if outlet unit is an areal unit 6 find the lowest adjacent areal unit lowest adj unit 7 if lowest adj unit is a paddy field unit 8 water flows from outlet unit to the lowest ditch point on the intersection line between outlet unit and lowest adj unit 9 else 10 water flows from outlet unit to lowest adj unit 11 rule 3 12 if outlet unit is a ditch point 13 if outlet unit is adjacent to a pond adj pond 14 water flows from outlet unit to adj pond 15 else 16 find the lowest adjacent areal unit lowest adj unit 17 water flows from outlet unit to lowest adj unit 2 2 3 loop processing as local rules are used to determine the flow directions on the boundaries of different land use types there may exist loops among units especially in flat areas a loop processing algorithm was proposed to break these loops the idea is to first divide the units in a watershed into two sets the units that can flow into a river or out of the watershed called as solved units in this paper and the units that are in a loop called as loop units and then change the direction of some loop units to break the loops we referred to the priority flood algorithm ehlschlaeger 1989 to design the method to break loops the solved units are sorted by elevation and visited in sequence from low to high if an adjacent unit of a solved unit is a loop unit let it flow to this solved unit and mark it and its upslope units as solved units repeat the above operations until there is no loop unit left the logic of this algorithm is presented in algorithm 2 using natural language and python like grammar algorithm 2 loop processing 1 divide the units in a watershed into two sets the units that can flow into a river or out of the watershed solved set and the units that are in a loop loop set 2 solved set 3 loop set 4 for each unit u in the watershed 5 find a downslope pathway from u to a river or boundary unit by visiting downslope units recursively 6 if a river or boundary unit can be reached 7 add all the units in the pathway to solved set 8 elif there is a loop in the pathway 9 add all the units in the pathway to loop set 10 change the direction of some units in loop set to break the loops 11 while loop set is not empty 12 sort units in solved set by elevation and get the lowest unit u 13 remove u from solved set 14 for each adjacent unit adj unit of u 15 if adj unit in loop set 16 water flow from adj unit to u 17 remove adj unit and its upslope units from loop set and add them to solved set 3 case study 3 1 study area the zhongtianshe watershed a hilly watershed located in liyang jiangsu province china was selected as the study area fig 4 it has an area of 42 km2 and the length of the main stream is 10 4 km this watershed has a subtropical monsoon climate with a multiyear average temperature of 15 9 0 8 and a multi year average precipitation amount of 1145 245 mm based on long term observations 1953 2019 at the liyang weather station the main land use types include woodlands paddy rice fields settlements ponds rivers and roads woodlands have the largest area accounting for 76 8 of the total area and paddy fields are mainly distributed along the river account for 10 of the total area the dem data was interpolated based on the contour lines in 1 10000 topographic maps from the jiangsu anhui bureau of surveying and mapping with a spatial resolution of 5 m the land use type and the boundaries of paddy fields and ponds were digitized based on the geometrically corrected high resolution 0 24 m per pixel aerial images from the national platform for common geospatial information services of china https www tianditu gov cn 3 2 the drainage network in a typical subbasin fig 5 shows the drainage network constructed using the proposed hybrid vector raster approach in a typical subbasin of zhongtianshe watershed including the spatial discretization and flow directions this subbasin has relatively large proportions of rice fields and ponds and its location can be found in fig 4a we can see that the shapes of geographical entities such as paddy fields ponds and roads were well retained and the flow directions among spatial units reflected our understandings of the water movement in this region in the woodlands in the southwest of the subbasin water flows following the directions among grid cells determined using the d8 algorithm most of the water from these woodlands flows into the ditches around paddy fields in the downslope and then flow into the river through the bottomlands for the paddy fields water first flows into the ditches around fields and then flows along the ditches into downslope units ponds were treated as a whole instead of the combination of several grid cells in this way their inflow and outflow can be represented conveniently for example the southernmost pond in the subbasin collects inflow from its upslope paddy fields and its outflow goes to another pond downslope through ditches there are a few roads located in the north of the subbasin water flows along these roads until entering a river or reaching a local depression segment from which water flows to a unit of another land use type every unit in a drainage network can find a flow path to a river the red lines in fig 5 show two typical flow paths in the zhongtianshe watershed in this region the upslope area is often covered by woodland and the valley is usually used as paddy fields see fig 4b ponds are often constructed around paddy fields for irrigation as shown in the flow path no 1 fig 5 water from a woodland grid cell may first flow into ditches around paddy fields and then flow into a river via bottomland sometimes water from upslope units may flow into a pond and cannot further flow downslope until the pond is filled as shown in the flow path no 2 in fig 5 when a pond is full water will spill over to downslope units in the flow path no 2 water in the pond will flow into the field ditches and runs along the ditches into a river via bottomland during dry periods the stored water in the ponds can be used to irrigate the downslope or neighboring paddy fields a detailed representation of these process can be performed in a hydrological model based on the constructed drainage network in this study the above examples showed that the drainage network constructed in this study can represent the flow relationships among units explicitly and in detail which is valuable for the studies related to the migration of water sediments and nutrients at a fine scale 3 3 comparison between the hybrid vector raster approach and grid based approach drainage network construction based on grid cells has been widely used in existing studies we compared the drainage network constructed using the hybrid vector raster approach proposed in this paper and the traditional d8 algorithm based on grid dem as shown in fig 6 the hybrid vector raster approach can represent the locations and shapes of the rivers ponds and paddy fields more accurately than the grid based approach the paddy fields in this region are mostly terraces a prominent feature of this landscape is that each field has a uniform elevation and water from a field flows along the ditches among fields in the grid based drainage network a field may consist of several grid cells with different elevations and water flows from polygon to polygon instead of flowing along ditches which is not realistic the flow relationships between ponds and their surrounding units also cannot be well represented by the grid based method while the hybrid vector raster approach proposed in this paper can represent ponds and related flow relationships effectively roads can impede water flow because they are often higher than the surrounding units and have ditches alongside them for drainage the hybrid vector raster drainage network can depict the collection of water by roads and the flow pathway along roads which cannot be resolved by the grid based approach in the example shown in fig 7 the water collected by the roads flows into a field ditch and flow further downslope along the ditch network which also demonstrated the capability of the hybrid vector raster drainage network in depicting detailed flow relationship among units at a fine scale as the same dem with 5 m resolution was used to obtain the elevations of units in the two approaches the improved performance of the proposed hybrid vector raster approach can be attributed to the incorporation of land use plot maps and flow rules in drainage network construction this is especially true for relatively flat regions where the activities of human beings are intense and the drainage network is often artificially altered compared with traditional dem based methods the proposed method relies on high resolution land use map as input in which the boundaries of rice fields and ponds need to be explicitly represented in this paper this type of land use map was digitized manually which is time consuming and limits the large scale application of the proposed method with the development of high resolution remote sensing including unmanned aerial vehicles and artificial intelligence techniques high resolution land use data is expected to be obtained automatically in the future which will promote the application of our method it should be noted that standard land use and land cover lulc classes should be used in these land use maps because the semantics of land use classes must be understood during the drainage network construction 3 4 implications for watershed modeling watershed modeling has become an indispensable approach for hydrological studies and watershed management liu et al 2016 li et al 2018 zhu et al 2019a chen et al 2020b in hydrological modeling the migration of water and the materials it carries are calculated along the drainage network de roo et al 1996 so the accuracy of the drainage network to a large extent determines the reliability of simulation results lagacherie et al 2010 compared with traditional methods for drainage network construction the hybrid vector raster approach proposed in this paper can characterize the shapes and areas of geographical entities such as paddy fields and ponds more accurately and the flow relationships among units are more realistic than those obtained using a grid based approach this is especially important for modeling the residence time of water sediments and nutrients at both the hillslope and watershed scale mcguire et al 2005 for example a pond can intercept water and the materials it carries from its upslope areas these intercepted materials will stay in the pond until the pond is full of water or pumped for irrigation some water will percolate into underground aquifers some sediments will deposit and the nutrients may be transformed during their stay in the pond golden et al 2014 yin and shan 2001 these processes cannot be simulated properly without a well constructed drainage network of course this study mainly focuses on the geometric shape and spatial topology of the drainage network and more research is needed to determine at least three parameters i e the storage capacity of ponds irrigation time and amount to facilitate the application of the drainage network in watershed modeling it also should be noted that the drainage network in agricultural watersheds is dynamic rather than static because of agricultural water management activities for example the ditches around rice fields are used for irrigation during some growing periods of rice in this case farmers block these ditches to divert water to fill the rice fields in the future these dynamics should be incorporated into the drainage network to characterize the man made features and human activities more comprehensively some related researches such as the development of the time specific flow accumulation method choi 2012 yi et al 2017 can provide valuable reference for the further studies a drainage network is also crucial for the model based design and optimization of management practices to control soil erosion and water pollution this is because that different spatial arrangements of management units may lead to different benefits even if the types and amounts of management practices are the same wu et al 2018 zhu et al 2019b the simulation of which relies on the accurate representation of flow relationship among spatial units in the constructed drainage network in this study figs 5 7 we can clearly see that field ditches play an important role in collecting and transport water sediments and nutrients therefore more attention should be paid to ditch oriented management practices like ecological ditches in this type of region chen et al 2015 the ponds in this region can also serve as a type of management practice for water pollution control yin et al 2001 the interaction between ponds and the management practices in ditches can well be represented in the constructed drainage network in this study 4 conclusions a representation of the drainage network contains our understandings of water movement across geospatial space and provides fundamental information for hydrological analysis and watershed modeling existing methods cannot properly represent the unique drainage network in agricultural watersheds with rice terraces and ponds which are very common in many parts of the world in this study we propose a hybrid vector raster approach to drainage network construction considering the characteristics of such watersheds rice terraces and ponds first the watershed is discretized using the hybrid vector raster model arbitrary polygons are used to discretize farmland and ponds considering their irregular shapes regular quadrates are used for natural land covers like forest and lines are used to represent ditches then the flow directions among discretized units are determined following three steps the first step determines the flow directions within each land use type the second step determines the flow directions on the boundaries of different land use types and the third step processes the loops among units so that each discretized unit can flow into a river or outside of the basin the drainage network constructed by the proposed method can characterize the shapes and areas of irregular geographical entities such as paddy fields and ponds more accurately and the flow relationships among units are more realistic than those obtained from a grid based approach this kind of drainage network is crucial for simulating the residence time of water sediments and nutrients at the hillslope and watershed scales and for model based optimization of management practices considering spatial topology the proposed method has the potential to be applied to other regions with a landscape heavily affected by human activities and thus can provide a valuable reference to the broad community of drainage network modeling credit authorship contribution statement

4311,a well constructed drainage network is essential for hydrological modeling agricultural watersheds with heavy human alternations often contain man made features like terraced fields and ponds incorporating these features in the drainage network in these watersheds is extremely important for hydrological modeling this study proposed a novel hybrid vector raster approach to drainage network construction in this type of regions first a watershed is discretized using a hybrid vector raster data model to accurately represent the shapes and areas of irregular geographical entities then the flow directions among discretized units are determined firstly within each land use type and then on the boundaries of different land use types based on elevation and land use specific boundary rules after that loops among units are processed to make sure each unit can flow out of the watershed a small agricultural watershed in jiangsu province china was selected to conduct a case study and the results showed that the proposed method can obtain a more realistic drainage network than traditional methods both in terms of geometric shapes and spatial topology keywords drainage network hybrid vector raster data model spatial discretization flow direction watershed rice terraces and ponds 1 introduction water is an important medium for mass transport in a watershed to characterize the processes such as soil erosion and nutrient migration at the watershed scale adequate modeling of the drainage network is a prerequisite heathwaite et al 2005 wu and lane 2017 chen et al 2020a there are usually two steps for constructing a drainage network first the watershed is discretized into basic spatial units and then the flow directions among these units are determined choi et al 2011 duke et al 2006 spatial discretization can be conducted using raster based models like regular grid cells or vector based models such as contour line based flow tubes triangulated irregular network tin and arbitrary polygons lu et al 2019 discretization using regular grid cells is the most commonly used approach because the involved data structure and algorithm are simple liu et al 2014 wang et al 2019 however a very fine resolution needs to be adopted to represent irregular features such as terraced fields and ditches using the grid based data model dehotin and braud 2008 thomas et al 2017 which will lead to high storage and computational burden so the gird based approach is more suitable for natural watersheds other than for watersheds affected by human activities contour line based flow tubes can simplify the flow relationships among spatial units into one dimension but it is also not suitable to represent irregular features grayson et al 1992 vertessy et al 1993 maunder 1999 the tin approach is good at characterizing the geometry of terrain and man made objects but it is not effective in representing the functions of some geographic entities taking a pond as an example rather than discretizing it as multiple triangles treating it as a whole is more straightforward and effective for hydrological modeling discretization using appropriate arbitrary polygons can both characterize the geometry of features well and be flexible to reflect their functions although the related data structure and algorithms are more complex than the grid based approach band et al 2001 lagacherie et al 2010 sanzana et al 2017 in agricultural watersheds because of the irregular shapes of man made features such as fields and ditches constructing drainage networks based on arbitrary polygons is thought to be suitable for drainage network construction for example aurousseau et al 2009 proposed a method to build a field based drainage network by identifying the inlets and outlets for surface water flow on each field according to elevation lagacherie et al 2010 divided a catchment into irregularly sized and shaped polygons considering field boundaries ditch network sub catchment limits and natural limits e g soil geology and then determined the flow relationships among the discretized units this type of approach can give an improved functional spatial representation for water flow in agricultural watersheds for the arbitrary polygon based approach the characteristics of different types of features should be considered when determining the flow relationships among polygons current research mostly focuses on watersheds with sloping farmlands aurousseau et al 2009 lagacherie et al 2010 and new methods are still needed for other types of watersheds this paper focuses on the watersheds with rice terraces and ponds which are widely spread in the hilly regions of south china and many other regions in asia liu et al 2019 there are small ditches around every rice field which are connected to larger ditches and then to ponds and rivers these artificial features combined with natural land covers in the watershed like forests form a unique drainage network fig 1 considering that it is suitable to use different discretization methods for natural and artificial landscapes this study aims to propose a hybrid vector raster approach to drainage network construction in agricultural watersheds with terraced fields and ponds in section 2 we present the methodology for spatial discretization and flow direction determination section 3 applies and validates this method in a small agricultural watershed in jiangsu province china and the implication of the proposed method is discussed the conclusions and future research directions are presented in section 4 2 methodology compared with the drainage network construction in natural watersheds this study s main challenges include 1 how to represent the irregular shapes of rice terraces and ponds and 2 how to determine the flow directions among polygons ditches with irregular shapes in this study we proposed a hybrid vector raster approach to the spatial discretization and corresponding methods for flow direction determination which are described as following 2 1 spatial discretization there are three steps in the spatial discretization including 1 polygonal representation of objects with flat interiors i e terraced fields and ponds 2 raster representation of areas with varying elevation 3 linking the two areas by resolving slivers for terraced rice fields fig 2 a ridges are used as boundaries and each field is treated as one unit there are usually small ditches around each field which are represented as lines because the ditches are very narrow we assume that they have the same location as ridges for ponds each pond is treated as a single spatial unit fig 2b the land use types such as grassland forest residential land and roads are discretized as grid cells fig 2c and d the polygons of these types in a land use map are intersected with a grid lattice which will generate grid units in the interior of each polygon and incomplete grid units around the boundaries of polygons there may exist some sliver polygons which should be merged with adjacent units to make sure the discretized units have reasonable sizes the merging rule for grassland forest and residential land is that if the area of a polygon is less than a threshold i e half of the area of a grid cell it will be merged a sliver polygon will be merged to the adjacent grid cell with the longest common edge with it to make the shape more compact for roads because of their narrow shapes the discretized units usually have small areas so the perimeter threshold is used as the merging criterion instead of the area threshold in addition to avoid the case that a road is divided lengthways fig 2d two polygons are merged if the length of their adjacent line is close to the edge length of the grid cell 2 2 determination of flow direction considering the characteristics of flow paths are often different for different land use types flow directions among discretized units are first determined within each land use type the flow directions on the boundaries of different land use types are determined according to predefined rules as presented in section 2 2 2 finally the loops among units are processed so that each discretized unit can flow into a river or outside of the basin in this way the drainage network can be constructed it should be noted that the rivers in this study were extracted from high resolution aerial images rather than morphometric analysis but the rivers can still be encoded by geomorphology based methods such as the widely used horton strahler method

raster approach can be attributed to the incorporation of land use plot maps and flow rules in drainage network construction this is especially true for relatively flat regions where the activities of human beings are intense and the drainage network is often artificially altered compared with traditional dem based methods the proposed method relies on high resolution land use map as input in which the boundaries of rice fields and ponds need to be explicitly represented in this paper this type of land use map was digitized manually which is time consuming and limits the large scale application of the proposed method with the development of high resolution remote sensing including unmanned aerial vehicles and artificial intelligence techniques high resolution land use data is expected to be obtained automatically in the future which will promote the application of our method it should be noted that standard land use and land cover lulc classes should be used in these land use maps because the semantics of land use classes must be understood during the drainage network construction 3 4 implications for watershed modeling watershed modeling has become an indispensable approach for hydrological studies and watershed management liu et al 2016 li et al 2018 zhu et al 2019a chen et al 2020b in hydrological modeling the migration of water and the materials it carries are calculated along the drainage network de roo et al 1996 so the accuracy of the drainage network to a large extent determines the reliability of simulation results lagacherie et al 2010 compared with traditional methods for drainage network construction the hybrid vector raster approach proposed in this paper can characterize the shapes and areas of geographical entities such as paddy fields and ponds more accurately and the flow relationships among units are more realistic than those obtained using a grid based approach this is especially important for modeling the residence time of water sediments and nutrients at both the hillslope and watershed scale mcguire et al 2005 for example a pond can intercept water and the materials it carries from its upslope areas these intercepted materials will stay in the pond until the pond is full of water or pumped for irrigation some water will percolate into underground aquifers some sediments will deposit and the nutrients may be transformed during their stay in the pond golden et al 2014 yin and shan 2001 these processes cannot be simulated properly without a well constructed drainage network of course this study mainly focuses on the geometric shape and spatial topology of the drainage network and more research is needed to determine at least three parameters i e the storage capacity of ponds irrigation time and amount to facilitate the application of the drainage network in watershed modeling it also should be noted that the drainage network in agricultural watersheds is dynamic rather than static because of agricultural water management activities for example the ditches around rice fields are used for irrigation during some growing periods of rice in this case farmers block these ditches to divert water to fill the rice fields in the future these dynamics should be incorporated into the drainage network to characterize the man made features and human activities more comprehensively some related researches such as the development of the time specific flow accumulation method choi 2012 yi et al 2017 can provide valuable reference for the further studies a drainage network is also crucial for the model based design and optimization of management practices to control soil erosion and water pollution this is because that different spatial arrangements of management units may lead to different benefits even if the types and amounts of management practices are the same wu et al 2018 zhu et al 2019b the simulation of which relies on the accurate representation of flow relationship among spatial units in the constructed drainage network in this study figs 5 7 we can clearly see that field ditches play an important role in collecting and transport water sediments and nutrients therefore more attention should be paid to ditch oriented management practices like ecological ditches in this type of region chen et al 2015 the ponds in this region can also serve as a type of management practice for water pollution control yin et al 2001 the interaction between ponds and the management practices in ditches can well be represented in the constructed drainage network in this study 4 conclusions a representation of the drainage network contains our understandings of water movement across geospatial space and provides fundamental information for hydrological analysis and watershed modeling existing methods cannot properly represent the unique drainage network in agricultural watersheds with rice terraces and ponds which are very common in many parts of the world in this study we propose a hybrid vector raster approach to drainage network construction considering the characteristics of such watersheds rice terraces and ponds first the watershed is discretized using the hybrid vector raster model arbitrary polygons are used to discretize farmland and ponds considering their irregular shapes regular quadrates are used for natural land covers like forest and lines are used to represent ditches then the flow directions among discretized units are determined following three steps the first step determines the flow directions within each land use type the second step determines the flow directions on the boundaries of different land use types and the third step processes the loops among units so that each discretized unit can flow into a river or outside of the basin the drainage network constructed by the proposed method can characterize the shapes and areas of irregular geographical entities such as paddy fields and ponds more accurately and the flow relationships among units are more realistic than those obtained from a grid based approach this kind of drainage network is crucial for simulating the residence time of water sediments and nutrients at the hillslope and watershed scales and for model based optimization of management practices considering spatial topology the proposed method has the potential to be applied to other regions with a landscape heavily affected by human activities and thus can provide a valuable reference to the broad community of drainage network modeling credit authorship contribution statement

4312,the seasonal predictability of hydrological variables at high resolution across australia was assessed using a new national seasonal ensemble forecasting system for soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff the system consists of a gridded water balance model awra l forced with downscaled and calibrated seasonal climate forecasts from a climate modelling system access s1 here we evaluate the hydrological forecasts at one to six months lead time relative to a historical reference simulation forced with observed climate inputs deterministic and probabilistic skill accuracy and reliability of the forecast ensemble were assessed with a specific focus on forecasts of hydrological extremes additionally we assess the performance of the hindcast for selected use cases particularly focusing on agriculture and water management nationally our assessment of the hydrological forecasts indicated good skill for all variables at one month lead time and up to three months lead time for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration in many key regions in australia regarding hydrological extremes we find particularly high skill at longer lead times for low soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration events highlighting the potential value for applications such as hydrological drought prediction or bushfire risk assessments bias of the hydrological forecasts based on calibrated seasonal climate forecasts was shown to be close to zero for all variables regions and lead times and insignificant with a minor exception for potential evapotranspiration more detailed evaluation across economically important regions and river basins in particular the australian wheatbelt and the murray darling basin the largest river basin in australia and an economically and environmentally critical region highlights promising potential for the soil moisture and evapotranspiration forecast to be used in applications in agriculture such as for optimising irrigation or scheduling sowing and harvesting dates for hydrologically important headwater regions across the great dividing range and the alpine regions of victoria the forecasts of runoff show good skill at longer lead times indicating the value of the forecasts for reservoir management overall we conclude that the forecasting system shows sufficient skill for a wide range of applications and regions up to a lead time of three months we outline limitations of the presented system and highlight potential future research directions keywords seasonal forecasts hydrological forecasting ensemble forecasts drought flood bushfire risk 1 introduction hydrological extremes such as droughts or floods can have devastating effects on many aspects of human societies and the natural environment ipcc 2012 the use of seasonal forecasting information is one way to help adapt to and increase the resilience towards hydroclimatic variability and extremes by providing the opportunity to prepare for potentially harmful events and optimise decisions in advance klopper et al 2006 rodwell and doblas reyes 2006 winsemius et al 2014 in australia s highly variable climate the ability to forecast hydrological variables several months ahead would support improved decision making in many sectors including water management agriculture energy production emergency services e g flood and bushfire risk assessments human health infrastructure and the management of environmental risks 1 1 existing seasonal hydrological forecasting systems at global and continental scales the australian bureau of meteorology produces operational seasonal climate forecasts of precipitation and temperature based on the access s1 system hudson et al 2017 as do many other forecasting centres e g ecmwf seas5 system johnson et al 2019 the uk met office glosea5 system maclachlan et al 2014 and multiple north american modelling centres including ncep saha et al 2014 an overview of global producing centres for long range forecasts is provided by the world meteorological organization via http www wmo int pages prog wcp wcasp gpc gpc php however hydrological impacts changes in soil moisture streamflow or evaporative demand depend on the interaction between current hydrological conditions climate variables soil and vegetation properties and topography these processes are generally better captured in hydrological models and forecasting systems that combine hydrological models with post processed climate forecasts yuan et al 2015 with advancements in climate forecasting using sophisticated coupled atmosphere ocean land general circulation models gcms new approaches to hydrological predictions have become available yuan et al 2015 climate model driven seasonal hydrological forecasts use large scale gridded hydrological models forced with outputs from seasonal climate forecasting systems e g arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 pechlivanidis et al 2017 the advantages of this approach are that 1 such forecasts benefit from seasonal predictability of atmospheric conditions e g the predictability of air temperature from sea surface temperatures or large scale rossby waves 2 they use process based hydrological models that capture and can forecast multiple aspects of the hydrological cycle including soil water stores evapotranspiration runoff catchment aggregated streamflow and 3 outputs are provided for every location for which climate forecasts are available implementing climate model driven seasonal hydrological forecasts at regional to global scales is challenging as they are computationally intensive and require a significant amount of data and resources to configure therefore to date only a few climate model driven seasonal hydrological forecast systems at continental to global scales have been implemented operationally emerton et al 2016 hao et al 2017 in addition many forecasting systems and published analyses thereof focus on one specific hydrological aspect e g seasonal forecasts of streamflow drought or flood risk but very few systems focus on multiple aspects of the hydrological cycle existing operational seasonal hydrological forecasting systems at the continental or global scale that use a combination of seasonal climate ensemble forecasts and hydrological impact models include glofas emerton et al 2018 efas arnal et al 2018 e hype donnelly et al 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2017 and ww hype arheimer et al 2019 noting that these systems cover both short term flood forecasting as well as seasonal forecasting 1 2 the need for an integrated seasonal hydrological ensemble forecasting system for australia while australia has been at the forefront of seasonal streamflow forecasting at the catchment scale bennett et al 2017 mcinerney et al 2017 woldemeskel et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 see http www bom gov au water ssf for the bureau s seasonal streamflow forecasts a continental scale internally consistent hydrological forecasting system for australia covering multiple aspects of the water cycle does not yet exist forecast products issued by such a system are in high demand by a range of customers including agriculture water management and emergency services which prompted the development of this system by the bureau such a system would complement existing site specific systems for example streamflow forecasts for particular catchments by providing large scale situational awareness the gap in australia s continental seasonal hydrological capability could be addressed using seasonal hydrological forecasts that are available at the global scale e g ww hype glofas however the spatial resolution of global hydrological forecasts tends to be too coarse e g glofas is run at 0 1 0 1 resolution ww hype simulates catchments with an average resolution of 1000 km2 to be of great value for specific applications where there is a mismatch between product resolution and the spatial scale needed by customers for decision making e g for agricultural modelling catchment management also global systems may not capture regional climate and hydrological features as well as a forecasting system specifically developed and tested for australia another potential shortcoming is that most existing continental scale seasonal hydrological forecasting systems are predominantly developed in and focused on europe and northern america and its associated climates and experiences in these systems may not always be transferable to the australian context australia is unique in terms of its hydroclimate and topography the country s climate is highly variable johnson et al 2016 kiem et al 2016 and influenced by surrounding oceans and sea surface temperatures indices describing large scale climate oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation enso or the indian ocean dipole iod are an important source of seasonal climate forecasting skill in the region chiew et al 1998 stone and de hoedt 2000 australia is also the driest inhabited continent on earth with many regions and months of zero precipitation and zero runoff which complicate the development and evaluation of climate and hydrological forecasts geographically there are several hydrological regimes which are dominated by varying climate drivers and processes e g water limited regions with ephemeral watercourses and wetter regions and months dominated by evapotranspiration another difference when comparing to mid latitude regions in north america and europe is australia s comparatively flat topography increasing the relative importance of evapotranspiration compared to runoff very low to no snow cover reducing any predictability related to snow and ice and vegetation characteristics moore et al 2016 1 3 aim of the study and research questions a continental scale seasonal hydrological forecasting system would fill the operational and research gaps described above by forecasting multiple key aspects of the hydrological cycle across the whole of the country in a consistent way while capturing regional climate and hydrological characteristics at high resolution the aim of this study is to develop and test a seasonal hydrological ensemble forecasting system for australia using the australian bureau of meteorology s dynamical seasonal climate forecasting system access s1 and the bureau s national hydrological model awra l frost et al 2018 frost and wright 2018 described in section 2 1 research questions of this study are 1 how well are hydrological variables soil moisture potential and actual evapotranspiration and runoff predicted across australia at lead times from one to six months these variables were selected as they are key variables relevant for water management agriculture and emergency management e g for bushfire or flood risk assessments 2 how skilful is the forecast in terms of predicting dry and wet extremes including meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought 3 what is the performance of the forecast for important end uses agriculture and water management with a focus on a major wheat producing regions b the murray darling basin the longest and economically most important river system in australia and c major urban and rural water supply catchments across australia 2 methods an overview of the methodology used in this study is presented in fig 1 and described in the following sections we first present the hydrological model awra l section 2 1 and the configuration of the hindcasts using the seasonal climate forecasting system access s1 section 2 2 subsequently the reference simulation used for the verification section 2 3 is described before introducing the approach for the verification at gridded section 2 4 and regional scales section 2 5 2 1 the awra l landscape water balance model this study uses the gridded landscape water balance model awra l v6 frost et al 2018 available via https github com awracms awra cms which underpins the australian landscape water balance website www bom gov au water landscape and provides data on australia s water resources from 1911 until the present the model simulates hydrological fluxes and stores including runoff actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture in three soil depth intervals s 0 0 0 1 m s s 0 1 1 m s d 1 6 m on a 5 km grid resolution fig 2 this study uses root zone soil moisture defined as the soil available water at 0 1 0 m soil depth i e the sum of soil water across the first two soil layers a brief description of each variable is included in table 2 awra l v6 was calibrated to observed river streamflow satellite soil moisture and evapotranspiration the performance of the model with respect to all key aspects of the water balance was comprehensively assessed against hydrological observations including gauged streamflow in situ measurements of soil moisture groundwater recharge data and flux tower based evapotranspiration frost and wright 2018 awra l performs well for a wide range of variables at observation sites across the country e g holgate et al 2016 khan et al 2020 and was therefore selected for this study a summary of key evaluation metrics for awra l v6 is presented in table 1 the details on the model evaluation information on benchmarking datasets and a comparison against other hydrological models can be found in frost and wright 2018 2 2 generation of hindcast data this section describes the generation of the retrospective hydrological forecasts referred to as hindcasts which are used to evaluate the performance of the forecasting system see middle column in fig 1 2 2 1 climate forcings seasonal forecasts of precipitation temperature and solar radiation were generated with the bureau s forecasting system access s1 access s1 is an earth system model with atmospheric ocean land surface and sea ice components and underpins the seasonal climate prediction system of the australian bureau of meteorology hudson et al 2017 it uses the uk met office glosea5 gc2 model with enhancements to the ensemble generation scheme hudson et al 2017 the seasonal forecast skill of access s1 has been comprehensively evaluated and found to be suitable for seasonal climate predictions for australia hudson et al 2017 raw access s1 outputs are available at 60 km grid resolution whereas awra l uses data at 0 05 degree approx 5 km 5 km resolution based on the scale of the gridded historical daily climate input data used to drive the historical model jones et al 2009 in addition to addressing scale issues bias correction of input variables is critical before input into calibrated hydrological models as they are sensitive to small biases in rainfall in particular consequently access s1 hindcasts were regridded to a 0 05 degree grid using bilinear interpolation and calibrated using quantile mapping bom 2019 to provide the same resolution and similar statistical properties mean and variance as historical climate observations precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperature sourced from the australian water availability project dataset jones et al 2009 solar radiation from grant et al 2008 calibrated access s1 hindcasts are available for the period 1990 2012 with four forecast start dates per month 1st 9th 17th and 25th and 11 ensemble members per forecast start date 2 2 2 hindcast configuration daily scale gridded hindcasts of root zone soil moisture 0 1 0 m soil depth potential and actual evapotranspiration and runoff were produced by forcing awra l with calibrated access s1 seasonal climate hindcasts of precipitation minimum and maximum air temperature and solar radiation bom 2019 the climate forcings are available at daily time scale for lead times of up to seven months a lagged ensemble was used combining hindcasts starting on the 1st of each month as well as the 25th and 17th of the previous month resulting in a 33 members ensemble additionally a daily varying wind speed climatology based on interpolated wind speed observations at 2 m height calculated over the 1975 2017 period as used in the operational awra l v6 model mcvicar et al 2008 was used the hydrological hindcasts cover the period 1990 2012 starting on the 1st of each month using hindcasts starting on the first of every month was chosen to closely resemble the planned operational system which will produce forecasts once a month at the start of each month the hindcasts were initialised with state variables from the day before the forecast start date obtained from the historical reference simulation section 2 3 for example the hydrological forecast starting on 1st january 2000 was initialised using model states from 31st december 1999 as produced by the historical reference run and forced with calibrated climate forecast data starting from 1st january 2000 each hydrological hindcast consists of 33 ensemble members and has a length of 217 days approximately 7 months the 33 ensemble members are based on the 33 access s1 ensemble members for each start date consisting of a lagged ensemble as described above with their spread representing the uncertainty in atmospheric forecasts daily outputs were aggregated to monthly totals of runoff potential and actual evapotranspiration and the monthly mean for soil moisture we refer to the first month of the forecast as lead 1 with subsequent forecast months numbered sequentially up to lead 6 2 3 generation of historical reference used to benchmark forecasts this section outlines the generation of the historical reference simulation used to benchmark the hindcasts see leftmost column in fig 1 the hindcast configuration described in section 2 2 generates continental gridded forecasts of runoff soil moisture and evapotranspiration for which no corresponding observed data at continental scale exist therefore the hindcast performance was evaluated against historical reference simulations generated using observed climate data while it is generally preferable to compare the hindcasts against independent observations we instead calculate the theoretical skill using a historical reference simulation to assess the skill for all locations in australia this approach is commonly used for the evaluation of continental or global scale climate and hydrological forecasting systems e g greuell et al 2018 mo et al 2012 pechlivanidis et al 2017 shukla and lettenmaier 2011 thober et al 2015 wanders et al 2019 our approach captures the skill derived from the initial conditions and the seasonal climate forecasts and evaluates how errors in the climate forcings translate into errors in the hydrological predictions forecast errors related to systematic biases in the hydrological model are not captured according to van dijk et al 2013b actual forecast skill compared against observations can be estimated from the theoretical skill and historical model performance for an evaluation of the historical model performance against observed data see frost and wright 2018 daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the bureau s daily gridded climate dataset built from interpolating station based data onto a 5 km grid awap dataset jones et al 2009 further remotely sensed solar radiation data grant et al 2008 and wind speed data derived from station based 2 metre wind speed observations provided by the bureau of meteorology were interpolated to the awap grid mcvicar et al 2008 using these climate inputs awra l v6 was run during the hindcast period 1990 2012 at a daily time step further details about the historical simulations are provided by frost et al 2018 daily outputs from the historical reference simulations were aggregated to months by calculating the monthly sum for runoff potential and actual evapotranspiration or mean for soil moisture 2 4 forecast verification at gridded scale we assessed the theoretical skill of the hindcasts by comparing the access s1 based hydrological hindcasts section 2 2 against the historical reference simulation using observed climate forcings section 2 3 see rightmost column in fig 1 to trace back sources of forecast skill to climate inputs we present verification metrics for the access s1 precipitation forecasts as the most influential climate driver for the hydrological forecasts alongside the verification metrics for the awra l hydrological output variables root zone soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff please note all gridded verification analysis at australia wide scale and regional scale excluded very remote regions of the continent where the observing networks of rainfall and other weather variables are lacking reliable interpolation of the observed data used to force the reference hydrological simulation could not be done in these locations consequently grid cells for these regions have been masked out in verification plots and were excluded when calculating regional averages of verification metrics 2 4 1 deterministic performance metrics computed from ensemble mean the performance of the forecast ensemble mean was assessed using annual and seasonal relative bias and the anomaly correlation coefficient the presentation of the seasonal results is focused on the warm and cold seasons december to february djf and june to august jja the relative bias was calculated as bia s rel l i 1 n y i l x i i 1 n x i 100 where i 1 n are the monthly time steps all months or only months of a given season l is the lead time x i is the historical simulation using observed climate inputs y i l is the hindcast for the time step i at lead time l and is an adjustment factor to avoid singularity or inflated relative biases when the sum of historical simulations is equal to or close to 0 this adjustment is needed for ephemeral water courses with zero flows for part of the year the adjustment factor was used only for computing bias in runoff and set to 1 mm in this case it was set to 0 for other variables the anomaly correlation coefficient was calculated by subtracting the monthly climatology from the hydrological forecasts and the historical reference respectively the anomalies of the historical reference x i m and the hindcast anomalies y i m l were calculated as follows x j m x j m 1 n i 1 n x i m y j m l y j m l 1 n i 1 n y i m l where x j m is the historical observation for year j and month m and y j m l indicates the hindcast for year j and month m at lead time l n describes the total number of years in the hindcast period 23 subsequently the anomaly correlation was calculated as the pearson correlation coefficient between anomalies of the historical reference x i m and the hindcast anomalies y i m l 2 4 2 probabilistic performance metrics computed from ensemble data ensemble forecasts enable users to assess uncertainties associated with the forecast and risks of a specific negative impact for example a livestock manager might buy additional feed when forecasts show a high risk of a soil moisture drought which could inhibit pasture growth such decisions depend on the forecast being accurate and the ensemble spread being reliable a forecast that is over or under confident i e having a too narrow or too wide ensemble spread respectively can lead to maladaptation and costly decisions as well as a loss of confidence in the forecasting product statistical reliability wilks 2011 of a forecast ensemble relates to agreement between forecast probabilities and observed probabilities for example if a forecast predicts a probability of a certain event e g a percentile threshold exceedance as 80 in a reliable forecast the event should occur on average in approximately 80 of the cases weisheimer and palmer 2014 one way to test forecast reliability is by assessing rank histograms which visualise the distribution of the ranks of each observation relative to the forecast ensemble wilks 2011 in a reliable forecast the rank histogram is flat meaning the ranks are uniformly distributed wilks 2011 we tested the reliability of the forecast ensemble for all grid cells by applying a statistical test that checks whether the distribution of the ranks is a uniform distribution the test applied is the kolmogorov smirnov ks test if the p value is below the threshold of p 0 05 the distribution of ranks deviates significantly from a uniform distribution and the forecast is not reliable unlike all other verification metrics used in this study we present the results of the ks test for individual months as consecutive months are not statistically independent due to temporal autocorrelation which would violate the assumptions of the statistical test additionally we computed the continuous rank probability score crps which captures the difference between the forecast cumulative distribution function cdf and the empirical cdf hersbach 2000 zamo and naveau 2018 the score was normalised to obtain a skill score continuous rank probability skill score crpss by comparing the crps of the forecast ensemble to the crps of the climatology ensemble and calculating any relative improvement in crps the climatology ensemble was obtained by combining all observation values for a given month for example the climatology ensemble for january for a given grid cell and variable is obtained from all january values between 1990 and 2012 using the historical observations for precipitation or reference simulation for hydrological model outputs it has to be noted that the ensemble forecast and climatology ensemble have different ensemble sizes 33 vs 23 respectively which affect the resolution of the forecast and can influence the crpss ferro et al 2008 generally a climatology ensemble forecast covering a longer time period could be constructed to capture more of the climate variability and provide a larger ensemble however we restricted the reference climatology ensemble to the hindcast period 1990 2012 to create a reference forecast that is unbiased compared to the observations in this period to have a fair comparison and not artificially increase the crpss while the metrics described above looked at overall skill we also examined the skill in predicting extreme conditions which are relevant for many applications of seasonal forecasting i e in assessing the risk of adverse conditions with potentially higher impacts occurring skill of the forecast ensemble in predicting the probability of hydrological extremes very dry months as well as very wet months was assessed using two percentile based event definitions values that fall into the lowest decile i e being below the 10th percentile of monthly values or the highest decile i e exceeding the 90th percentile for precipitation soil moisture and runoff the lowest decile event captures short duration meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought while the highest decile event captures very wet months in terms of rainfall soil moisture and runoff percentiles of monthly aggregated from daily values were calculated separately for the observation dataset gridded historical precipitation and awra l historical reference simulation for the other variables and the hindcast data calibrated access s1 data for precipitation and awra l forced with calibrated access s1 data for the other variables the percentile thresholds were calculated for each month separately i e the likelihood of a variable to be in the highest or lowest decile was equal in each month the probabilistic forecasts of hydrological extremes were evaluated using the brier skill score bss wilks 2011 the brier score bs is equivalent to the mean squared error mse for probabilistic forecasts the bss compares the bs of a forecast ensemble against the mean absolute error of a naïve reference forecast in this case a climatology forecast for the reference forecast we used a probability of 10 of an extreme event occurring in every grid cell and month as this is the expected probability of being in the lowest or highest decile the bss was used in addition to the crpss as the metric is more intuitive to many end users and focuses on one specific exceedance threshold it considers the distribution of the historical observations and hindcast separately and as such can identify whether the forecast is useful in predicting extreme events even if there are biases in the probabilities for example if the 90th percentile in the observations differs from the 90th percentile in the hindcast but the exceedance of the percentile threshold in the hindcast corresponds well with the exceedance of the threshold in the observations the forecast may still be useful for predicting such events which will be reflected in the bss it has to be noted that the data for calculating the bss is limited as there are 23 values for each month and grid cell over the 1990 2012 period i e the extreme dry or wet event occurs on average 2 3 times per grid cell and month this was addressed by calculating the average bss across all calendar months increasing the events from 2 to 3 times to 28 times on average per grid cell 10 probability 23 years 12 months additionally the small ensemble of 33 members leads to relatively discrete probabilities with increments of approximately 3 these could lead to an over estimation of the error and an under estimation of the bss due to the low resolution of the predicted probabilities the analyses presented here provides first estimates of the bss for hydrological extremes but future work might explore the performance of the forecast in predicting extremes using a larger ensemble and or longer hindcast periods 2 5 aggregation of forecast metrics at regional and catchment scales in addition to calculating gridded verification metrics we aggregated the skill metrics across important eco climatic agricultural and water management regions including natural resources management regions the australian wheatbelt and 11 national water account catchments to assess the skill at the regional and catchment scale we calculated the spatial average of the skill metrics across all grid cells within a region or catchment 2 5 1 verification for natural resources management nrm regions we aggregated the skill metrics across four eco climatic zones referred to as nrm super clusters to describe the spatial variation in skill across broad climate and biophysical regions in australia each super cluster is unique in terms of geography hydrology and climate the four super clusters are 1 northern australia 2 rangelands 3 eastern australia and 4 southern australia fig 3 a complete description of the ecosystems and characteristics of these clusters can be found on the climate change in australia website https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au en climate projections future climate regional climate change explorer super clusters and is summarised in table 3 2 5 2 verification for critical agriculture and water management regions in addition to the general forecast verification we assessed the skill for two potential uses of the forecasts agriculture and water management australian agriculture is an important sector economically and socially contributing about 2 2 of gdp and employing 2 6 of people in rural areas up to 7 jackson et al 2020 wheat is one of the most important crops grown in australia with australia being among the top ten producers of wheat worldwide agricultural production is particularly reliant on climate and hydrological conditions and hydrological extremes such as the millennium drought van dijk et al 2013a can be particularly damaging for agricultural production major wheat producing regions in australia were identified using the australian bureau of statistics agricultural commodities 2015 2016 dataset at sa2 statistical areas 2 level accessible via https www abs gov au ausstats abs nsf detailspage 7121 02015 16 sa2 regions with an area harvested wheat for grain greater than 10 000 ha were included in this analysis see fig 4 a for map the murray darling basin is another region that is particularly important for agriculture see fig 4b for a map showing the location of the murray darling basin the forecast performance across major agricultural regions was assessed using regionally averaged anomaly correlations and crpss values with a particular focus on soil moisture actual and potential evapotranspiration moreover we investigated the skill of hindcasts of runoff across eleven basins covering major urban and rural water supply catchments to provide an overview of forecast skill for nationally significant water regions http www bom gov au water nwa about shtml adelaide burdekin canberra daly fitzroy melbourne the murray darling basin ord perth south east queensland and sydney fig 4b the skill of runoff forecasts at the catchment scale was assessed by calculating regional averages of anomaly correlation and crpss for each catchment and lead time 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the forecast ensemble mean we assessed the performance of the hindcast ensemble mean by calculating the mean relative bias and anomaly correlations at annual and seasonal time scales section 2 4 1 3 1 1 relative bias the hydrological forecasts have an overall bias close to zero for all variables and lead times which suggests that calibration of the access s1 hindcasts section 2 2 was successful in removing most of the climate model biases and also performed well for forcing the hydrological model fig 5 see tables a 1 and a 3 in the appendix for seasonal and nrm regional results a small dry bias of approximately 5 on average 1 8 mm per month and grid cell remains in the precipitation hindcasts leading to a small dry bias in soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration however these biases are not significant at the p 0 05 level see section 6 significance testing of the mean bias in the appendix the remaining bias in precipitation after quantile mapping could be due to two potential reasons 1 quantile mapping bias correction was applied using leave one out cross validation in years with extreme precipitation events that were outside of the probability density distribution used for quantile mapping the bias corrected values were extrapolated from the maximum precipitation value this scaling approach might have a tendency to underestimate the most extreme events leading to a small dry bias overall 2 quantile mapping at daily scale was applied using a moving window of 11 days around each day therefore the corrected values in every month are not entirely independent from other months potentially introducing a small bias when aggregated to the monthly scale runoff biases are more spatially variable with some larger relative biases in monsoon affected parts of the country however similar to the previous variables significance testing revealed that the bias in runoff is not significant at the p 0 05 level for all grid cells for potential evapotranspiration some parts of australia show a statistically significant but minimal bias section 6 in the appendix overall the mean bias is small across all variables lead times and seasons see table a 1 bias at annual and seasonal scale for australia table a 3 for bias at nrm regional scale 3 1 2 anomaly correlation coefficient fig 6 shows maps of anomaly correlations for lead 1 to lead 6 see tables a 1 and a 4 in the appendix for seasonal and nrm regional results for each grid cell the correlation coefficient is significant at the p 0 05 level if it is greater than or equal to 0 12 for the annual results based on n 276 data points across 23 years and 12 months per year and 0 24 for the seasonal results based on n 69 data points across 23 years and 3 months per year as there is no commonly agreed threshold of what is considered a good correlation value we use correlation categories broadly based on the significance threshold these are 0 2 to 0 2 for non significant or low correlation 0 25 to 0 25 at seasonal scale 0 2 to 0 6 for significant correlation 0 25 to 0 6 at seasonal scale and 0 6 to 1 0 for high correlation for each grid cell as well for regional averages negative correlation coefficients indicate that the forecast is inversely correlated with the observations suggesting issues in the forecast such grid cells were also classified as having no meaningful correlation anomaly correlations for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration are high in the first forecast month with a mean value across australia of 0 78 and 0 9 respectively at two months lead time the correlation is significant with mean values across australia of 0 3 and 0 51 and for actual evapotranspiration the anomaly correlation is significant up to lead 6 with a mean anomaly correlation of 0 21 precipitation and runoff show significant anomaly correlation values at one month lead time with a mean value of approximately 0 3 and higher values at nrm regional scale except for the dry rangelands cluster e g with mean values of 0 43 and 0 45 for northern australia for precipitation and runoff respectively see table a 4 in the appendix at longer lead times the nationally averaged anomaly correlation is below 0 2 for precipitation and runoff and hence considered to be low however these values are dominated by the dry inland regions contained in the rangelands cluster and aggregated to the annual scale there are important water management regions with significant anomaly correlations for precipitation and runoff at longer lead times including within the great dividing range australia s most important mountain range in east and south east australia where inflows to many water storages are generated see section 3 3 2 for a detailed assessment of runoff skill across eleven important water supply catchments additionally these results are aggregated to the annual scale some seasons provide higher predictability than others see table a 1 in the appendix the anomaly correlation for runoff follows closely the correlation values of precipitation with significant correlations in the first month of the forecast but low or no correlation subsequently here we assess the skill of the forecast in terms of quantity how much rainfall or runoff is likely to occur over the next season but also timing in which month will rainfall or runoff most likely occur and location in which grid cells rainfall events are highly localised and while seasonal forecasts may have skill in predicting the likelihood of above or below median precipitation for the upcoming season they may not always precisely predict the exact month or location that receives high rainfall amounts therefore the forecast at the monthly scale might be similar to climatology but may have better skill when aggregated over space and time to test this assumption we additionally calculated the anomaly correlation at 3 monthly aggregation i e the forecast values and historical reference were first aggregated to 3 monthly scale for each forecast issue date and the anomalies were calculated by subtracting the mean seasonal value for each issue date at this temporal scale the anomaly correlation of precipitation and runoff provides higher values at longer lead times overall especially in regions that are close to the coastlines with the exception of the coastal regions in south east and south west australia for precipitation fig 7 this suggests that precipitation and runoff forecasts may provide valuable information about whether the upcoming season will be wetter or drier than average however because the forecasts are probabilistic the exact timing and location may not always be predicted precisely especially at longer lead times the difference in anomaly correlation values between precipitation and runoff on the one hand and soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration on the other hand provides insights into the relative importance of initial conditions and soil memory and climate forcings for the forecast skill the soil moisture forecasts derive a large proportion of skill from soil memory i e high temporal auto correlation in soil moisture under water limited conditions actual evapotranspiration is largely determined by soil water availability and hence soil memory leads to good forecasting skill for evapotranspiration 3 2 performance of the ensemble forecast we assessed the accuracy and reliability of the ensemble forecast using the ks test for the uniformity of the rank of observations relative to the forecast ensemble and the crpss calculated for all grid cells in australia section 2 4 3 2 1 reliability the kolmogorov smirnov test of observation rank uniformity was used to assess the reliability of the forecasts see fig 8 for results for january figs a 1 a 3 in the appendix present the results for the months of april july and october respectively a p value below 0 05 indicates that the ranks of the observations relative to the forecast ensemble are not uniformly distributed suggesting the forecast is not reliable the results show that the forecast ensemble is reliable across most regions for all variables except for pet in all months especially at longer lead times a visual inspection of time series plots and rank histograms at randomly selected locations across australia not shown suggest that the forecasts for pet are not reliable in some regions due to a very small but significant bias in pet combined with a very narrow spread of pet across years i e the inter annual variability in monthly pet is small the small but consistent bias is likely related to the wind speed data as the hindcasts use a daily varying wind speed climatology calculated from the years 1975 2017 section 2 2 2 whereas the historical reference simulation is forced with observed wind speed data section 2 3 leading to a minimal but consistent bias 3 2 2 continuous ranked probability skill score the crps captures both the reliability and resolution of a forecast hersbach 2000 the crpss shows relative improvement of the forecast performance compared against a climatology forecast a positive crpss means the forecast performs better than a climatology ensemble forecast whereas a crpss that is close to zero or negative indicates no improvement or worse forecast performance respectively the crpss maps show positive skill for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across most regions in australia up to lead 2 fig 9 see tables a 1 and a 5 in the appendix for results at seasonal and nrm regional scales at three months lead time soil moisture forecasts show positive skill across south east australia whereas for actual evapotranspiration positive skill is found in northern parts of the country potential evapotranspiration and runoff show positive crpss in key regions in the first month of the forecast particularly tasmania south east australia northern australia and parts of western australia for runoff soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration have the highest crpss values at lead 1 among all variables highlighting the importance of initial conditions for forecast skill of these variables there are considerable regional variations in crpss across regions table a 5 in the appendix in jja soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration show positive skill up to lead 2 across all regions and in some cases up to lead 3 table a 5 the negative skill of pet after the first month of the forecast is related to the same effect described in section 3 2 1 a visual inspection of the data at different locations showed a very small but significant bias in pet likely related to different wind speed configurations between the hindcast setup and the historical reference simulation combined with a very small inter annual variability in monthly pet the results for the reliability and crpss for pet show that the forecast does not perform better than climatology mainly due to the comparatively narrow spread of pet across years 3 3 anomaly correlation and crpss over regions important for agriculture and water management regions 3 3 1 australian wheatbelt and murray darling basin the following section focuses on two agriculturally important regions in australia the australian wheatbelt and the murray darling basin and investigates forecast skill across the two regions with a particular focus on soil moisture potential and actual evapotranspiration forecasts as these are particularly relevant for predicting agricultural drought and evaporative stress which can impact crop yield the anomaly correlation and crpss averaged over major wheat producing regions in australia is shown in fig 10 a the same statistics averaged over the murray darling basin are presented in fig 10b see tables a 8 and a 10 in the appendix for results at the seasonal scale across both regions soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration show high anomaly correlation values greater than 0 6 in the first month of the forecast and significant anomaly correlation greater than 0 2 up to lead 3 using anomaly correlation categories as outlined in section 3 1 2 the deterministic forecast of potential evapotranspiration shows a significant anomaly correlation greater than 0 2 up to lead 2 in terms of average crpss across the wheatbelt region and murray darling basin the forecasts of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration have positive skill up to two months lead time however the crpss of the ensemble forecast of potential evapotranspiration is close to zero in the first month of the forecast and negative in subsequent months this suggests that while the ensemble mean for pet shows some positive performance the skill of the forecast ensemble is not better than climatology the results for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration and to some extent potential evapotranspiration if used as a deterministic forecast indicate promising potential for the use of the seasonal hydrological forecasts in agricultural management across the australian wheatbelt and murray darling basin 3 3 2 major urban and rural water supply catchments while runoff at the national scale did not show high skill at longer lead times due to the areal dominance of dryland regions with low or no runoff there is varying skill across several of the major urban and rural water supply catchments see fig 11 for the anomaly correlation and crpss for runoff across these catchments numerical results can be found in table a 12 anomaly correlation and table a 13 crpss in the appendix overall the mean runoff skill is better than at a nationally averaged scale the mean anomaly correlation across all the national water account catchments is 0 47 at lead 1 the mean crpss is 0 17 at lead 1 compared to the national average of 0 33 for the anomaly correlation and 0 13 for the crpss table a 12 in some catchments there are significant correlations up two to three months lead time with an anomaly correlation greater than 0 2 these include melbourne and perth up to lead 3 and the rural daly ord schemes of northern australia up to lead 2 table a 12 the correlation varies by season the hindcast anomaly correlation for runoff in djf is significant i e greater than 0 25 for melbourne up to lead 2 whereas for jja it is highest in melbourne up to lead 4 perth up to lead 2 table a 12 the crpss shows positive skill for all catchments at 1 month lead time when including all months and at longer lead times in jja particularly for melbourne as well as the rural daly and ord catchments table a 13 overall these results indicate that the forecasts have promising potential to predict runoff for major urban and rural water supply catchments one month ahead 3 4 prediction of hydrological extremes hydrological extremes including extreme dry and wet conditions are particularly challenging for many sectors as they can depending on their severity increase the risk of flooding bushfires crop failures or negative health impacts this section focuses specifically on forecast performance in predicting hydrological extremes defined here as rainfall soil moisture and runoff being in the lowest or highest decile based on the 1990 2012 distribution fig 12 presents the brier skill score for predicting extreme dry months i e months with rainfall soil moisture or runoff in the lowest decile fig 13 shows the results for extreme wet months i e months with rainfall soil moisture or runoff in the highest decile the results at regional and seasonal scale will not be discussed in this section however the numerical results for the brier skill score at regional and seasonal scale are included in the appendix see table a 2 a 6 and a 7 for brier skill scores at seasonal and nrm super cluster scale table a 9 for the brier skill scores for the australian wheatbelt a 11 for the murray darling basin and a 13 for national water account catchments there is positive skill in predicting extreme dry soil moisture conditions in some regions up to the second and third month of the forecast with important applications for example for agriculture or bushfire risk assessments for runoff there are widespread regions of positive skill in the first month of the forecast in terms of wetter extremes especially in northern parts of western australia the northern territory and queensland as well as the alpine regions in victoria and parts of tasmania this indicates that awra l runoff forecasts may support predictions of flood risk for up to a month ahead in some regions in terms of predicting lowest decile runoff conditions there is widespread skill in the first month of the forecast and some skill in parts of australia in the second month especially in northern parts of the country extreme high runoff events are associated with extreme precipitation and wet soil moisture conditions whereas low runoff events are associated with the absence of rainfall but are greatly influenced by initial soil moisture conditions and high evapotranspiration this lower reliance on predicting the location and month that receives high rainfall amounts might explain the extended skill in predicting hydrological drought compared to high runoff events which suggests that hydrological forecasts of shorter lead times may be suitable for both drought and flood risk predictions whereas the longer term outlooks are more suitable to support drought risk assessments this section provided a first assessment of the performance of the forecasts in predicting hydrological extremes with a focus on simple percentile based event definitions however in order to predict events with extreme impacts e g flooding drought it is important to relate hydrological conditions e g soil moisture in the lowest decile runoff in the highest decile with impacts such as agricultural crop losses road flooding and assess the performance of the forecast in predicting these these more tailored analyses were beyond the scope of this study but may be addressed in future research 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the performance of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system for australia combining the bureau of meteorology s access s1 seasonal climate prediction system with the awra l hydrological model using a range of verification metrics australia is a large continent over which the hydroclimate is highly variable in both time and space providing challenging conditions for hydrological forecasts at the continental scale a large part of the interior is arid and small forecast errors can appear large when presented in a relative sense urban and rural water resources infrastructure is concentrated around the coastal fringe and the murray darling basin in the south east and major cropping regions are located in south east australia and south western parts of western australia therefore our study investigated the skill of the hydrological forecasts for important end uses agriculture and water management across major wheat producing regions the murray darling basin and across important urban and rural water supply catchments deterministic and probabilistic skill exceeded climatology out to two to three months for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration for most key regions of the country importantly for agricultural regions including the murray darling basin and major wheat producing regions there was a significant skill for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration up to two and three months lead time and significant anomaly correlation values for potential evapotranspiration up to lead 2 forecasts of soil moisture could be used to estimate wheat yields in australia several months ahead or to optimise irrigation planning and the timing of sowing fertilisation and harvest as well as the management of water reservoirs for environmental and agricultural benefits forecasts of potential and actual evapotranspiration along with soil moisture could be used to predict the risk of flash droughts nguyen et al 2019 and hydrological stress for crops anderson et al 2016 which may help mitigate the adverse effects of hydrological extremes seasonal forecasts of runoff showed positive skill across major urban and rural water supply catchments the crpss across all 11 national water account catchments was positive for all catchments at one month lead time and at longer lead times for jja for melbourne ord and daly these results suggest that the ensemble forecasts could be used for predicting runoff into major water supply catchments one month ahead and at longer lead times for some catchments and seasons while the hindcasts show promising potential for lead times up to three months they generally show no added or worse skill than climatology at longer lead times beyond lead 3 without post processing of the forecasts use at longer lead times is therefore not recommended in this study we developed and tested the skill of seasonal landscape hydrological forecasts for australia using the climate ensemble prediction system access s1 and the hydrological model awra l v6 our study provides avenues for several additional analyses and improvements to the system that will be outlined below and could be addressed in future research the main aim of this study was to provide an overview of the forecast performance across australia and across large scale regions due to the lack of observations with continental coverage a historical reference simulation based on observed climate inputs was used as pseudo truth for the forecast verification as is typically used when assessing global and continental scale climate and hydrological forecasts to some extent the skill of the forecast compared against in situ observations can be estimated by combining information on historical model performance with information on hindcast performance van dijk et al 2013b however more detailed analyses are needed to investigate the performance of the forecasts at catchment scale e g against observations from the australian hydrologic reference stations http www bom gov au water hrs and compare them against existing catchment scale forecasts e g the bureau of meteorology s seasonal streamflow forecasts http www bom gov au water ssf additionally applications of the forecasts for tailored end uses e g for predictions of inflow into water supply catchments predictions of flood risk along critical infrastructure or water demand forecasts require an evaluation of the performance of the forecast using independent in situ observations e g streamflow gauging data water level time series time series of municipal water use which could be performed in future tailored studies in collaboration with stakeholders this paper presented a general verification of forecast performance at continental and regional scale with focus on two potential end uses and including hydrological extremes however tailored forecasts for a range of sectors which have not been assessed in this study could be explored in future research these include for example predictions of bushfire risk using seasonal forecasts of soil moisture as a proxy for fuel availability forecasts of evapotranspiration could be used in demand forecasting in water supply management and by irrigators gridded runoff forecasts provide opportunities for the prediction of flood risk especially in ungauged catchments and remote locations with sparse observations complementary to streamflow and flood forecasts in gauged locations the positive skill in predicting extreme dry and wet events in terms of the bss for lowest und highest decile events especially at one month lead time and for soil moisture up to lead 2 suggest opportunities for continental and regional scale drought and flood risk predictions which could be assessed further in future research other avenues for future improvements are related to the post processing of the climate inputs and hydrological outputs the current calibration of the seasonal forecasting data is based on quantile mapping and the awra l hydrological hindcasts were not post processed quantile mapping is a simple and effective bias correction method crochemore et al 2016 but may not be suitable in regions where there is no or low correlation between the hindcast and observations zhao et al 2017 future versions of the system could use improved downscaling and bias correction methods and additionally apply post processing to the hydrological outputs particularly to runoff forecasts at the catchment scale our results show the highest skill for soil moisture and evapotranspiration for most key regions and lead times highlighting the critical role of initial states and soil memory for the skill of the forecast future studies could quantify the sources of skill numerically by comparing the hindcast against alternative forecasts for example a climatology ensemble forecast or a persistence forecast shukla and lettenmaier 2011 in addition future research could investigate the sources of predictability e g related to large scale climate oscillations such as the el nino southern oscillation or the indian ocean dipole e g king et al 2020 such information would provide guidance on the sensitivity of the skill of the forecasting system to improvements to the initial states e g through data assimilation or the climate forecasting system the initialisation of both the climate forecasts and the hydrological forecasts are scheduled to be enhanced through a improved initial ocean and land states in the access s climate forecasts which are planned for the upcoming access s2 system release and b assimilation of soil moisture e g tian et al submitted and other observation types such as vegetation total water storage into the awra l hydrological model to update

4312,the seasonal predictability of hydrological variables at high resolution across australia was assessed using a new national seasonal ensemble forecasting system for soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff the system consists of a gridded water balance model awra l forced with downscaled and calibrated seasonal climate forecasts from a climate modelling system access s1 here we evaluate the hydrological forecasts at one to six months lead time relative to a historical reference simulation forced with observed climate inputs deterministic and probabilistic skill accuracy and reliability of the forecast ensemble were assessed with a specific focus on forecasts of hydrological extremes additionally we assess the performance of the hindcast for selected use cases particularly focusing on agriculture and water management nationally our assessment of the hydrological forecasts indicated good skill for all variables at one month lead time and up to three months lead time for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration in many key regions in australia regarding hydrological extremes we find particularly high skill at longer lead times for low soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration events highlighting the potential value for applications such as hydrological drought prediction or bushfire risk assessments bias of the hydrological forecasts based on calibrated seasonal climate forecasts was shown to be close to zero for all variables regions and lead times and insignificant with a minor exception for potential evapotranspiration more detailed evaluation across economically important regions and river basins in particular the australian wheatbelt and the murray darling basin the largest river basin in australia and an economically and environmentally critical region highlights promising potential for the soil moisture and evapotranspiration forecast to be used in applications in agriculture such as for optimising irrigation or scheduling sowing and harvesting dates for hydrologically important headwater regions across the great dividing range and the alpine regions of victoria the forecasts of runoff show good skill at longer lead times indicating the value of the forecasts for reservoir management overall we conclude that the forecasting system shows sufficient skill for a wide range of applications and regions up to a lead time of three months we outline limitations of the presented system and highlight potential future research directions keywords seasonal forecasts hydrological forecasting ensemble forecasts drought flood bushfire risk 1 introduction hydrological extremes such as droughts or floods can have devastating effects on many aspects of human societies and the natural environment ipcc 2012 the use of seasonal forecasting information is one way to help adapt to and increase the resilience towards hydroclimatic variability and extremes by providing the opportunity to prepare for potentially harmful events and optimise decisions in advance klopper et al 2006 rodwell and doblas reyes 2006 winsemius et al 2014 in australia s highly variable climate the ability to forecast hydrological variables several months ahead would support improved decision making in many sectors including water management agriculture energy production emergency services e g flood and bushfire risk assessments human health infrastructure and the management of environmental risks 1 1 existing seasonal hydrological forecasting systems at global and continental scales the australian bureau of meteorology produces operational seasonal climate forecasts of precipitation and temperature based on the access s1 system hudson et al 2017 as do many other forecasting centres e g ecmwf seas5 system johnson et al 2019 the uk met office glosea5 system maclachlan et al 2014 and multiple north american modelling centres including ncep saha et al 2014 an overview of global producing centres for long range forecasts is provided by the world meteorological organization via http www wmo int pages prog wcp wcasp gpc gpc php however hydrological impacts changes in soil moisture streamflow or evaporative demand depend on the interaction between current hydrological conditions climate variables soil and vegetation properties and topography these processes are generally better captured in hydrological models and forecasting systems that combine hydrological models with post processed climate forecasts yuan et al 2015 with advancements in climate forecasting using sophisticated coupled atmosphere ocean land general circulation models gcms new approaches to hydrological predictions have become available yuan et al 2015 climate model driven seasonal hydrological forecasts use large scale gridded hydrological models forced with outputs from seasonal climate forecasting systems e g arnal et al 2018 emerton et al 2018 pechlivanidis et al 2017 the advantages of this approach are that 1 such forecasts benefit from seasonal predictability of atmospheric conditions e g the predictability of air temperature from sea surface temperatures or large scale rossby waves 2 they use process based hydrological models that capture and can forecast multiple aspects of the hydrological cycle including soil water stores evapotranspiration runoff catchment aggregated streamflow and 3 outputs are provided for every location for which climate forecasts are available implementing climate model driven seasonal hydrological forecasts at regional to global scales is challenging as they are computationally intensive and require a significant amount of data and resources to configure therefore to date only a few climate model driven seasonal hydrological forecast systems at continental to global scales have been implemented operationally emerton et al 2016 hao et al 2017 in addition many forecasting systems and published analyses thereof focus on one specific hydrological aspect e g seasonal forecasts of streamflow drought or flood risk but very few systems focus on multiple aspects of the hydrological cycle existing operational seasonal hydrological forecasting systems at the continental or global scale that use a combination of seasonal climate ensemble forecasts and hydrological impact models include glofas emerton et al 2018 efas arnal et al 2018 e hype donnelly et al 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2017 and ww hype arheimer et al 2019 noting that these systems cover both short term flood forecasting as well as seasonal forecasting 1 2 the need for an integrated seasonal hydrological ensemble forecasting system for australia while australia has been at the forefront of seasonal streamflow forecasting at the catchment scale bennett et al 2017 mcinerney et al 2017 woldemeskel et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 see http www bom gov au water ssf for the bureau s seasonal streamflow forecasts a continental scale internally consistent hydrological forecasting system for australia covering multiple aspects of the water cycle does not yet exist forecast products issued by such a system are in high demand by a range of customers including agriculture water management and emergency services which prompted the development of this system by the bureau such a system would complement existing site specific systems for example streamflow forecasts for particular catchments by providing large scale situational awareness the gap in australia s continental seasonal hydrological capability could be addressed using seasonal hydrological forecasts that are available at the global scale e g ww hype glofas however the spatial resolution of global hydrological forecasts tends to be too coarse e g glofas is run at 0 1 0 1 resolution ww hype simulates catchments with an average resolution of 1000 km2 to be of great value for specific applications where there is a mismatch between product resolution and the spatial scale needed by customers for decision making e g for agricultural modelling catchment management also global systems may not capture regional climate and hydrological features as well as a forecasting system specifically developed and tested for australia another potential shortcoming is that most existing continental scale seasonal hydrological forecasting systems are predominantly developed in and focused on europe and northern america and its associated climates and experiences in these systems may not always be transferable to the australian context australia is unique in terms of its hydroclimate and topography the country s climate is highly variable johnson et al 2016 kiem et al 2016 and influenced by surrounding oceans and sea surface temperatures indices describing large scale climate oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation enso or the indian ocean dipole iod are an important source of seasonal climate forecasting skill in the region chiew et al 1998 stone and de hoedt 2000 australia is also the driest inhabited continent on earth with many regions and months of zero precipitation and zero runoff which complicate the development and evaluation of climate and hydrological forecasts geographically there are several hydrological regimes which are dominated by varying climate drivers and processes e g water limited regions with ephemeral watercourses and wetter regions and months dominated by evapotranspiration another difference when comparing to mid latitude regions in north america and europe is australia s comparatively flat topography increasing the relative importance of evapotranspiration compared to runoff very low to no snow cover reducing any predictability related to snow and ice and vegetation characteristics moore et al 2016 1 3 aim of the study and research questions a continental scale seasonal hydrological forecasting system would fill the operational and research gaps described above by forecasting multiple key aspects of the hydrological cycle across the whole of the country in a consistent way while capturing regional climate and hydrological characteristics at high resolution the aim of this study is to develop and test a seasonal hydrological ensemble forecasting system for australia using the australian bureau of meteorology s dynamical seasonal climate forecasting system access s1 and the bureau s national hydrological model awra l frost et al 2018 frost and wright 2018 described in section 2 1 research questions of this study are 1 how well are hydrological variables soil moisture potential and actual evapotranspiration and runoff predicted across australia at lead times from one to six months these variables were selected as they are key variables relevant for water management agriculture and emergency management e g for bushfire or flood risk assessments 2 how skilful is the forecast in terms of predicting dry and wet extremes including meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought 3 what is the performance of the forecast for important end uses agriculture and water management with a focus on a major wheat producing regions b the murray darling basin the longest and economically most important river system in australia and c major urban and rural water supply catchments across australia 2 methods an overview of the methodology used in this study is presented in fig 1 and described in the following sections we first present the hydrological model awra l section 2 1 and the configuration of the hindcasts using the seasonal climate forecasting system access s1 section 2 2 subsequently the reference simulation used for the verification section 2 3 is described before introducing the approach for the verification at gridded section 2 4 and regional scales section 2 5 2 1 the awra l landscape water balance model this study uses the gridded landscape water balance model awra l v6 frost et al 2018 available via https github com awracms awra cms which underpins the australian landscape water balance website www bom gov au water landscape and provides data on australia s water resources from 1911 until the present the model simulates hydrological fluxes and stores including runoff actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture in three soil depth intervals s 0 0 0 1 m s s 0 1 1 m s d 1 6 m on a 5 km grid resolution fig 2 this study uses root zone soil moisture defined as the soil available water at 0 1 0 m soil depth i e the sum of soil water across the first two soil layers a brief description of each variable is included in table 2 awra l v6 was calibrated to observed river streamflow satellite soil moisture and evapotranspiration the performance of the model with respect to all key aspects of the water balance was comprehensively assessed against hydrological observations including gauged streamflow in situ measurements of soil moisture groundwater recharge data and flux tower based evapotranspiration frost and wright 2018 awra l performs well for a wide range of variables at observation sites across the country e g holgate et al 2016 khan et al 2020 and was therefore selected for this study a summary of key evaluation metrics for awra l v6 is presented in table 1 the details on the model evaluation information on benchmarking datasets and a comparison against other hydrological models can be found in frost and wright 2018 2 2 generation of hindcast data this section describes the generation of the retrospective hydrological forecasts referred to as hindcasts which are used to evaluate the performance of the forecasting system see middle column in fig 1 2 2 1 climate forcings seasonal forecasts of precipitation temperature and solar radiation were generated with the bureau s forecasting system access s1 access s1 is an earth system model with atmospheric ocean land surface and sea ice components and underpins the seasonal climate prediction system of the australian bureau of meteorology hudson et al 2017 it uses the uk met office glosea5 gc2 model with enhancements to the ensemble generation scheme hudson et al 2017 the seasonal forecast skill of access s1 has been comprehensively evaluated and found to be suitable for seasonal climate predictions for australia hudson et al 2017 raw access s1 outputs are available at 60 km grid resolution whereas awra l uses data at 0 05 degree approx 5 km 5 km resolution based on the scale of the gridded historical daily climate input data used to drive the historical model jones et al 2009 in addition to addressing scale issues bias correction of input variables is critical before input into calibrated hydrological models as they are sensitive to small biases in rainfall in particular consequently access s1 hindcasts were regridded to a 0 05 degree grid using bilinear interpolation and calibrated using quantile mapping bom 2019 to provide the same resolution and similar statistical properties mean and variance as historical climate observations precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperature sourced from the australian water availability project dataset jones et al 2009 solar radiation from grant et al 2008 calibrated access s1 hindcasts are available for the period 1990 2012 with four forecast start dates per month 1st 9th 17th and 25th and 11 ensemble members per forecast start date 2 2 2 hindcast configuration daily scale gridded hindcasts of root zone soil moisture 0 1 0 m soil depth potential and actual evapotranspiration and runoff were produced by forcing awra l with calibrated access s1 seasonal climate hindcasts of precipitation minimum and maximum air temperature and solar radiation bom 2019 the climate forcings are available at daily time scale for lead times of up to seven months a lagged ensemble was used combining hindcasts starting on the 1st of each month as well as the 25th and 17th of the previous month resulting in a 33 members ensemble additionally a daily varying wind speed climatology based on interpolated wind speed observations at 2 m height calculated over the 1975 2017 period as used in the operational awra l v6 model mcvicar et al 2008 was used the hydrological hindcasts cover the period 1990 2012 starting on the 1st of each month using hindcasts starting on the first of every month was chosen to closely resemble the planned operational system which will produce forecasts once a month at the start of each month the hindcasts were initialised with state variables from the day before the forecast start date obtained from the historical reference simulation section 2 3 for example the hydrological forecast starting on 1st january 2000 was initialised using model states from 31st december 1999 as produced by the historical reference run and forced with calibrated climate forecast data starting from 1st january 2000 each hydrological hindcast consists of 33 ensemble members and has a length of 217 days approximately 7 months the 33 ensemble members are based on the 33 access s1 ensemble members for each start date consisting of a lagged ensemble as described above with their spread representing the uncertainty in atmospheric forecasts daily outputs were aggregated to monthly totals of runoff potential and actual evapotranspiration and the monthly mean for soil moisture we refer to the first month of the forecast as lead 1 with subsequent forecast months numbered sequentially up to lead 6 2 3 generation of historical reference used to benchmark forecasts this section outlines the generation of the historical reference simulation used to benchmark the hindcasts see leftmost column in fig 1 the hindcast configuration described in section 2 2 generates continental gridded forecasts of runoff soil moisture and evapotranspiration for which no corresponding observed data at continental scale exist therefore the hindcast performance was evaluated against historical reference simulations generated using observed climate data while it is generally preferable to compare the hindcasts against independent observations we instead calculate the theoretical skill using a historical reference simulation to assess the skill for all locations in australia this approach is commonly used for the evaluation of continental or global scale climate and hydrological forecasting systems e g greuell et al 2018 mo et al 2012 pechlivanidis et al 2017 shukla and lettenmaier 2011 thober et al 2015 wanders et al 2019 our approach captures the skill derived from the initial conditions and the seasonal climate forecasts and evaluates how errors in the climate forcings translate into errors in the hydrological predictions forecast errors related to systematic biases in the hydrological model are not captured according to van dijk et al 2013b actual forecast skill compared against observations can be estimated from the theoretical skill and historical model performance for an evaluation of the historical model performance against observed data see frost and wright 2018 daily precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the bureau s daily gridded climate dataset built from interpolating station based data onto a 5 km grid awap dataset jones et al 2009 further remotely sensed solar radiation data grant et al 2008 and wind speed data derived from station based 2 metre wind speed observations provided by the bureau of meteorology were interpolated to the awap grid mcvicar et al 2008 using these climate inputs awra l v6 was run during the hindcast period 1990 2012 at a daily time step further details about the historical simulations are provided by frost et al 2018 daily outputs from the historical reference simulations were aggregated to months by calculating the monthly sum for runoff potential and actual evapotranspiration or mean for soil moisture 2 4 forecast verification at gridded scale we assessed the theoretical skill of the hindcasts by comparing the access s1 based hydrological hindcasts section 2 2 against the historical reference simulation using observed climate forcings section 2 3 see rightmost column in fig 1 to trace back sources of forecast skill to climate inputs we present verification metrics for the access s1 precipitation forecasts as the most influential climate driver for the hydrological forecasts alongside the verification metrics for the awra l hydrological output variables root zone soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff please note all gridded verification analysis at australia wide scale and regional scale excluded very remote regions of the continent where the observing networks of rainfall and other weather variables are lacking reliable interpolation of the observed data used to force the reference hydrological simulation could not be done in these locations consequently grid cells for these regions have been masked out in verification plots and were excluded when calculating regional averages of verification metrics 2 4 1 deterministic performance metrics computed from ensemble mean the performance of the forecast ensemble mean was assessed using annual and seasonal relative bias and the anomaly correlation coefficient the presentation of the seasonal results is focused on the warm and cold seasons december to february djf and june to august jja the relative bias was calculated as bia s rel l i 1 n y i l x i i 1 n x i 100 where i 1 n are the monthly time steps all months or only months of a given season l is the lead time x i is the historical simulation using observed climate inputs y i l is the hindcast for the time step i at lead time l and is an adjustment factor to avoid singularity or inflated relative biases when the sum of historical simulations is equal to or close to 0 this adjustment is needed for ephemeral water courses with zero flows for part of the year the adjustment factor was used only for computing bias in runoff and set to 1 mm in this case it was set to 0 for other variables the anomaly correlation coefficient was calculated by subtracting the monthly climatology from the hydrological forecasts and the historical reference respectively the anomalies of the historical reference x i m and the hindcast anomalies y i m l were calculated as follows x j m x j m 1 n i 1 n x i m y j m l y j m l 1 n i 1 n y i m l where x j m is the historical observation for year j and month m and y j m l indicates the hindcast for year j and month m at lead time l n describes the total number of years in the hindcast period 23 subsequently the anomaly correlation was calculated as the pearson correlation coefficient between anomalies of the historical reference x i m and the hindcast anomalies y i m l 2 4 2 probabilistic performance metrics computed from ensemble data ensemble forecasts enable users to assess uncertainties associated with the forecast and risks of a specific negative impact for example a livestock manager might buy additional feed when forecasts show a high risk of a soil moisture drought which could inhibit pasture growth such decisions depend on the forecast being accurate and the ensemble spread being reliable a forecast that is over or under confident i e having a too narrow or too wide ensemble spread respectively can lead to maladaptation and costly decisions as well as a loss of confidence in the forecasting product statistical reliability wilks 2011 of a forecast ensemble relates to agreement between forecast probabilities and observed probabilities for example if a forecast predicts a probability of a certain event e g a percentile threshold exceedance as 80 in a reliable forecast the event should occur on average in approximately 80 of the cases weisheimer and palmer 2014 one way to test forecast reliability is by assessing rank histograms which visualise the distribution of the ranks of each observation relative to the forecast ensemble wilks 2011 in a reliable forecast the rank histogram is flat meaning the ranks are uniformly distributed wilks 2011 we tested the reliability of the forecast ensemble for all grid cells by applying a statistical test that checks whether the distribution of the ranks is a uniform distribution the test applied is the kolmogorov smirnov ks test if the p value is below the threshold of p 0 05 the distribution of ranks deviates significantly from a uniform distribution and the forecast is not reliable unlike all other verification metrics used in this study we present the results of the ks test for individual months as consecutive months are not statistically independent due to temporal autocorrelation which would violate the assumptions of the statistical test additionally we computed the continuous rank probability score crps which captures the difference between the forecast cumulative distribution function cdf and the empirical cdf hersbach 2000 zamo and naveau 2018 the score was normalised to obtain a skill score continuous rank probability skill score crpss by comparing the crps of the forecast ensemble to the crps of the climatology ensemble and calculating any relative improvement in crps the climatology ensemble was obtained by combining all observation values for a given month for example the climatology ensemble for january for a given grid cell and variable is obtained from all january values between 1990 and 2012 using the historical observations for precipitation or reference simulation for hydrological model outputs it has to be noted that the ensemble forecast and climatology ensemble have different ensemble sizes 33 vs 23 respectively which affect the resolution of the forecast and can influence the crpss ferro et al 2008 generally a climatology ensemble forecast covering a longer time period could be constructed to capture more of the climate variability and provide a larger ensemble however we restricted the reference climatology ensemble to the hindcast period 1990 2012 to create a reference forecast that is unbiased compared to the observations in this period to have a fair comparison and not artificially increase the crpss while the metrics described above looked at overall skill we also examined the skill in predicting extreme conditions which are relevant for many applications of seasonal forecasting i e in assessing the risk of adverse conditions with potentially higher impacts occurring skill of the forecast ensemble in predicting the probability of hydrological extremes very dry months as well as very wet months was assessed using two percentile based event definitions values that fall into the lowest decile i e being below the 10th percentile of monthly values or the highest decile i e exceeding the 90th percentile for precipitation soil moisture and runoff the lowest decile event captures short duration meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought while the highest decile event captures very wet months in terms of rainfall soil moisture and runoff percentiles of monthly aggregated from daily values were calculated separately for the observation dataset gridded historical precipitation and awra l historical reference simulation for the other variables and the hindcast data calibrated access s1 data for precipitation and awra l forced with calibrated access s1 data for the other variables the percentile thresholds were calculated for each month separately i e the likelihood of a variable to be in the highest or lowest decile was equal in each month the probabilistic forecasts of hydrological extremes were evaluated using the brier skill score bss wilks 2011 the brier score bs is equivalent to the mean squared error mse for probabilistic forecasts the bss compares the bs of a forecast ensemble against the mean absolute error of a naïve reference forecast in this case a climatology forecast for the reference forecast we used a probability of 10 of an extreme event occurring in every grid cell and month as this is the expected probability of being in the lowest or highest decile the bss was used in addition to the crpss as the metric is more intuitive to many end users and focuses on one specific exceedance threshold it considers the distribution of the historical observations and hindcast separately and as such can identify whether the forecast is useful in predicting extreme events even if there are biases in the probabilities for example if the 90th percentile in the observations differs from the 90th percentile in the hindcast but the exceedance of the percentile threshold in the hindcast corresponds well with the exceedance of the threshold in the observations the forecast may still be useful for predicting such events which will be reflected in the bss it has to be noted that the data for calculating the bss is limited as there are 23 values for each month and grid cell over the 1990 2012 period i e the extreme dry or wet event occurs on average 2 3 times per grid cell and month this was addressed by calculating the average bss across all calendar months increasing the events from 2 to 3 times to 28 times on average per grid cell 10 probability 23 years 12 months additionally the small ensemble of 33 members leads to relatively discrete probabilities with increments of approximately 3 these could lead to an over estimation of the error and an under estimation of the bss due to the low resolution of the predicted probabilities the analyses presented here provides first estimates of the bss for hydrological extremes but future work might explore the performance of the forecast in predicting extremes using a larger ensemble and or longer hindcast periods 2 5 aggregation of forecast metrics at regional and catchment scales in addition to calculating gridded verification metrics we aggregated the skill metrics across important eco climatic agricultural and water management regions including natural resources management regions the australian wheatbelt and 11 national water account catchments to assess the skill at the regional and catchment scale we calculated the spatial average of the skill metrics across all grid cells within a region or catchment 2 5 1 verification for natural resources management nrm regions we aggregated the skill metrics across four eco climatic zones referred to as nrm super clusters to describe the spatial variation in skill across broad climate and biophysical regions in australia each super cluster is unique in terms of geography hydrology and climate the four super clusters are 1 northern australia 2 rangelands 3 eastern australia and 4 southern australia fig 3 a complete description of the ecosystems and characteristics of these clusters can be found on the climate change in australia website https www climatechangeinaustralia gov au en climate projections future climate regional climate change explorer super clusters and is summarised in table 3 2 5 2 verification for critical agriculture and water management regions in addition to the general forecast verification we assessed the skill for two potential uses of the forecasts agriculture and water management australian agriculture is an important sector economically and socially contributing about 2 2 of gdp and employing 2 6 of people in rural areas up to 7 jackson et al 2020 wheat is one of the most important crops grown in australia with australia being among the top ten producers of wheat worldwide agricultural production is particularly reliant on climate and hydrological conditions and hydrological extremes such as the millennium drought van dijk et al 2013a can be particularly damaging for agricultural production major wheat producing regions in australia were identified using the australian bureau of statistics agricultural commodities 2015 2016 dataset at sa2 statistical areas 2 level accessible via https www abs gov au ausstats abs nsf detailspage 7121 02015 16 sa2 regions with an area harvested wheat for grain greater than 10 000 ha were included in this analysis see fig 4 a for map the murray darling basin is another region that is particularly important for agriculture see fig 4b for a map showing the location of the murray darling basin the forecast performance across major agricultural regions was assessed using regionally averaged anomaly correlations and crpss values with a particular focus on soil moisture actual and potential evapotranspiration moreover we investigated the skill of hindcasts of runoff across eleven basins covering major urban and rural water supply catchments to provide an overview of forecast skill for nationally significant water regions http www bom gov au water nwa about shtml adelaide burdekin canberra daly fitzroy melbourne the murray darling basin ord perth south east queensland and sydney fig 4b the skill of runoff forecasts at the catchment scale was assessed by calculating regional averages of anomaly correlation and crpss for each catchment and lead time 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the forecast ensemble mean we assessed the performance of the hindcast ensemble mean by calculating the mean relative bias and anomaly correlations at annual and seasonal time scales section 2 4 1 3 1 1 relative bias the hydrological forecasts have an overall bias close to zero for all variables and lead times which suggests that calibration of the access s1 hindcasts section 2 2 was successful in removing most of the climate model biases and also performed well for forcing the hydrological model fig 5 see tables a 1 and a 3 in the appendix for seasonal and nrm regional results a small dry bias of approximately 5 on average 1 8 mm per month and grid cell remains in the precipitation hindcasts leading to a small dry bias in soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration however these biases are not significant at the p 0 05 level see section 6 significance testing of the mean bias in the appendix the remaining bias in precipitation after quantile mapping could be due to two potential reasons 1 quantile mapping bias correction was applied using leave one out cross validation in years with extreme precipitation events that were outside of the probability density distribution used for quantile mapping the bias corrected values were extrapolated from the maximum precipitation value this scaling approach might have a tendency to underestimate the most extreme events leading to a small dry bias overall 2 quantile mapping at daily scale was applied using a moving window of 11 days around each day therefore the corrected values in every month are not entirely independent from other months potentially introducing a small bias when aggregated to the monthly scale runoff biases are more spatially variable with some larger relative biases in monsoon affected parts of the country however similar to the previous variables significance testing revealed that the bias in runoff is not significant at the p 0 05 level for all grid cells for potential evapotranspiration some parts of australia show a statistically significant but minimal bias section 6 in the appendix overall the mean bias is small across all variables lead times and seasons see table a 1 bias at annual and seasonal scale for australia table a 3 for bias at nrm regional scale 3 1 2 anomaly correlation coefficient fig 6 shows maps of anomaly correlations for lead 1 to lead 6 see tables a 1 and a 4 in the appendix for seasonal and nrm regional results for each grid cell the correlation coefficient is significant at the p 0 05 level if it is greater than or equal to 0 12 for the annual results based on n 276 data points across 23 years and 12 months per year and 0 24 for the seasonal results based on n 69 data points across 23 years and 3 months per year as there is no commonly agreed threshold of what is considered a good correlation value we use correlation categories broadly based on the significance threshold these are 0 2 to 0 2 for non significant or low correlation 0 25 to 0 25 at seasonal scale 0 2 to 0 6 for significant correlation 0 25 to 0 6 at seasonal scale and 0 6 to 1 0 for high correlation for each grid cell as well for regional averages negative correlation coefficients indicate that the forecast is inversely correlated with the observations suggesting issues in the forecast such grid cells were also classified as having no meaningful correlation anomaly correlations for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration are high in the first forecast month with a mean value across australia of 0 78 and 0 9 respectively at two months lead time the correlation is significant with mean values across australia of 0 3 and 0 51 and for actual evapotranspiration the anomaly correlation is significant up to lead 6 with a mean anomaly correlation of 0 21 precipitation and runoff show significant anomaly correlation values at one month lead time with a mean value of approximately 0 3 and higher values at nrm regional scale except for the dry rangelands cluster e g with mean values of 0 43 and 0 45 for northern australia for precipitation and runoff respectively see table a 4 in the appendix at longer lead times the nationally averaged anomaly correlation is below 0 2 for precipitation and runoff and hence considered to be low however these values are dominated by the dry inland regions contained in the rangelands cluster and aggregated to the annual scale there are important water management regions with significant anomaly correlations for precipitation and runoff at longer lead times including within the great dividing range australia s most important mountain range in east and south east australia where inflows to many water storages are generated see section 3 3 2 for a detailed assessment of runoff skill across eleven important water supply catchments additionally these results are aggregated to the annual scale some seasons provide higher predictability than others see table a 1 in the appendix the anomaly correlation for runoff follows closely the correlation values of precipitation with significant correlations in the first month of the forecast but low or no correlation subsequently here we assess the skill of the forecast in terms of quantity how much rainfall or runoff is likely to occur over the next season but also timing in which month will rainfall or runoff most likely occur and location in which grid cells rainfall events are highly localised and while seasonal forecasts may have skill in predicting the likelihood of above or below median precipitation for the upcoming season they may not always precisely predict the exact month or location that receives high rainfall amounts therefore the forecast at the monthly scale might be similar to climatology but may have better skill when aggregated over space and time to test this assumption we additionally calculated the anomaly correlation at 3 monthly aggregation i e the forecast values and historical reference were first aggregated to 3 monthly scale for each forecast issue date and the anomalies were calculated by subtracting the mean seasonal value for each issue date at this temporal scale the anomaly correlation of precipitation and runoff provides higher values at longer lead times overall especially in regions that are close to the coastlines with the exception of the coastal regions in south east and south west australia for precipitation fig 7 this suggests that precipitation and runoff forecasts may provide valuable information about whether the upcoming season will be wetter or drier than average however because the forecasts are probabilistic the exact timing and location may not always be predicted precisely especially at longer lead times the difference in anomaly correlation values between precipitation and runoff on the one hand and soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration on the other hand provides insights into the relative importance of initial conditions and soil memory and climate forcings for the forecast skill the soil moisture forecasts derive a large proportion of skill from soil memory i e high temporal auto correlation in soil moisture under water limited conditions actual evapotranspiration is largely determined by soil water availability and hence soil memory leads to good forecasting skill for evapotranspiration 3 2 performance of the ensemble forecast we assessed the accuracy and reliability of the ensemble forecast using the ks test for the uniformity of the rank of observations relative to the forecast ensemble and the crpss calculated for all grid cells in australia section 2 4 3 2 1 reliability the kolmogorov smirnov test of observation rank uniformity was used to assess the reliability of the forecasts see fig 8 for results for january figs a 1 a 3 in the appendix present the results for the months of april july and october respectively a p value below 0 05 indicates that the ranks of the observations relative to the forecast ensemble are not uniformly distributed suggesting the forecast is not reliable the results show that the forecast ensemble is reliable across most regions for all variables except for pet in all months especially at longer lead times a visual inspection of time series plots and rank histograms at randomly selected locations across australia not shown suggest that the forecasts for pet are not reliable in some regions due to a very small but significant bias in pet combined with a very narrow spread of pet across years i e the inter annual variability in monthly pet is small the small but consistent bias is likely related to the wind speed data as the hindcasts use a daily varying wind speed climatology calculated from the years 1975 2017 section 2 2 2 whereas the historical reference simulation is forced with observed wind speed data section 2 3 leading to a minimal but consistent bias 3 2 2 continuous ranked probability skill score the crps captures both the reliability and resolution of a forecast hersbach 2000 the crpss shows relative improvement of the forecast performance compared against a climatology forecast a positive crpss means the forecast performs better than a climatology ensemble forecast whereas a crpss that is close to zero or negative indicates no improvement or worse forecast performance respectively the crpss maps show positive skill for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across most regions in australia up to lead 2 fig 9 see tables a 1 and a 5 in the appendix for results at seasonal and nrm regional scales at three months lead time soil moisture forecasts show positive skill across south east australia whereas for actual evapotranspiration positive skill is found in northern parts of the country potential evapotranspiration and runoff show positive crpss in key regions in the first month of the forecast particularly tasmania south east australia northern australia and parts of western australia for runoff soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration have the highest crpss values at lead 1 among all variables highlighting the importance of initial conditions for forecast skill of these variables there are considerable regional variations in crpss across regions table a 5 in the appendix in jja soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration show positive skill up to lead 2 across all regions and in some cases up to lead 3 table a 5 the negative skill of pet after the first month of the forecast is related to the same effect described in section 3 2 1 a visual inspection of the data at different locations showed a very small but significant bias in pet likely related to different wind speed configurations between the hindcast setup and the historical reference simulation combined with a very small inter annual variability in monthly pet the results for the reliability and crpss for pet show that the forecast does not perform better than climatology mainly due to the comparatively narrow spread of pet across years 3 3 anomaly correlation and crpss over regions important for agriculture and water management regions 3 3 1 australian wheatbelt and murray darling basin the following section focuses on two agriculturally important regions in australia the australian wheatbelt and the murray darling basin and investigates forecast skill across the two regions with a particular focus on soil moisture potential and actual evapotranspiration forecasts as these are particularly relevant for predicting agricultural drought and evaporative stress which can impact crop yield the anomaly correlation and crpss averaged over major wheat producing regions in australia is shown in fig 10 a the same statistics averaged over the murray darling basin are presented in fig 10b see tables a 8 and a 10 in the appendix for results at the seasonal scale across both regions soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration show high anomaly correlation values greater than 0 6 in the first month of the forecast and significant anomaly correlation greater than 0 2 up to lead 3 using anomaly correlation categories as outlined in section 3 1 2 the deterministic forecast of potential evapotranspiration shows a significant anomaly correlation greater than 0 2 up to lead 2 in terms of average crpss across the wheatbelt region and murray darling basin the forecasts of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration have positive skill up to two months lead time however the crpss of the ensemble forecast of potential evapotranspiration is close to zero in the first month of the forecast and negative in subsequent months this suggests that while the ensemble mean for pet shows some positive performance the skill of the forecast ensemble is not better than climatology the results for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration and to some extent potential evapotranspiration if used as a deterministic forecast indicate promising potential for the use of the seasonal hydrological forecasts in agricultural management across the australian wheatbelt and murray darling basin 3 3 2 major urban and rural water supply catchments while runoff at the national scale did not show high skill at longer lead times due to the areal dominance of dryland regions with low or no runoff there is varying skill across several of the major urban and rural water supply catchments see fig 11 for the anomaly correlation and crpss for runoff across these catchments numerical results can be found in table a 12 anomaly correlation and table a 13 crpss in the appendix overall the mean runoff skill is better than at a nationally averaged scale the mean anomaly correlation across all the national water account catchments is 0 47 at lead 1 the mean crpss is 0 17 at lead 1 compared to the national average of 0 33 for the anomaly correlation and 0 13 for the crpss table a 12 in some catchments there are significant correlations up two to three months lead time with an anomaly correlation greater than 0 2 these include melbourne and perth up to lead 3 and the rural daly ord schemes of northern australia up to lead 2 table a 12 the correlation varies by season the hindcast anomaly correlation for runoff in djf is significant i e greater than 0 25 for melbourne up to lead 2 whereas for jja it is highest in melbourne up to lead 4 perth up to lead 2 table a 12 the crpss shows positive skill for all catchments at 1 month lead time when including all months and at longer lead times in jja particularly for melbourne as well as the rural daly and ord catchments table a 13 overall these results indicate that the forecasts have promising potential to predict runoff for major urban and rural water supply catchments one month ahead 3 4 prediction of hydrological extremes hydrological extremes including extreme dry and wet conditions are particularly challenging for many sectors as they can depending on their severity increase the risk of flooding bushfires crop failures or negative health impacts this section focuses specifically on forecast performance in predicting hydrological extremes defined here as rainfall soil moisture and runoff being in the lowest or highest decile based on the 1990 2012 distribution fig 12 presents the brier skill score for predicting extreme dry months i e months with rainfall soil moisture or runoff in the lowest decile fig 13 shows the results for extreme wet months i e months with rainfall soil moisture or runoff in the highest decile the results at regional and seasonal scale will not be discussed in this section however the numerical results for the brier skill score at regional and seasonal scale are included in the appendix see table a 2 a 6 and a 7 for brier skill scores at seasonal and nrm super cluster scale table a 9 for the brier skill scores for the australian wheatbelt a 11 for the murray darling basin and a 13 for national water account catchments there is positive skill in predicting extreme dry soil moisture conditions in some regions up to the second and third month of the forecast with important applications for example for agriculture or bushfire risk assessments for runoff there are widespread regions of positive skill in the first month of the forecast in terms of wetter extremes especially in northern parts of western australia the northern territory and queensland as well as the alpine regions in victoria and parts of tasmania this indicates that awra l runoff forecasts may support predictions of flood risk for up to a month ahead in some regions in terms of predicting lowest decile runoff conditions there is widespread skill in the first month of the forecast and some skill in parts of australia in the second month especially in northern parts of the country extreme high runoff events are associated with extreme precipitation and wet soil moisture conditions whereas low runoff events are associated with the absence of rainfall but are greatly influenced by initial soil moisture conditions and high evapotranspiration this lower reliance on predicting the location and month that receives high rainfall amounts might explain the extended skill in predicting hydrological drought compared to high runoff events which suggests that hydrological forecasts of shorter lead times may be suitable for both drought and flood risk predictions whereas the longer term outlooks are more suitable to support drought risk assessments this section provided a first assessment of the performance of the forecasts in predicting hydrological extremes with a focus on simple percentile based event definitions however in order to predict events with extreme impacts e g flooding drought it is important to relate hydrological conditions e g soil moisture in the lowest decile runoff in the highest decile with impacts such as agricultural crop losses road flooding and assess the performance of the forecast in predicting these these more tailored analyses were beyond the scope of this study but may be addressed in future research 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the performance of a seasonal hydrological forecasting system for australia combining the bureau of meteorology s access s1 seasonal climate prediction system with the awra l hydrological model using a range of verification metrics australia is a large continent over which the hydroclimate is highly variable in both time and space providing challenging conditions for hydrological forecasts at the continental scale a large part of the interior is arid and small forecast errors can appear large when presented in a relative sense urban and rural water resources infrastructure is concentrated around the coastal fringe and the murray darling basin in the south east and major cropping regions are located in south east australia and south western parts of western australia therefore our study investigated the skill of the hydrological forecasts for important end uses agriculture and water management across major wheat producing regions the murray darling basin and across important urban and rural water supply catchments deterministic and probabilistic skill exceeded climatology out to two to three months for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration for most key regions of the country importantly for agricultural regions including the murray darling basin and major wheat producing regions there was a significant skill for soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration up to two and three months lead time and significant anomaly correlation values for potential evapotranspiration up to lead 2 forecasts of soil moisture could be used to estimate wheat yields in australia several months ahead or to optimise irrigation planning and the timing of sowing fertilisation and harvest as well as the management of water reservoirs for environmental and agricultural benefits forecasts of potential and actual evapotranspiration along with soil moisture could be used to predict the risk of flash droughts nguyen et al 2019 and hydrological stress for crops anderson et al 2016 which may help mitigate the adverse effects of hydrological extremes seasonal forecasts of runoff showed positive skill across major urban and rural water supply catchments the crpss across all 11 national water account catchments was positive for all catchments at one month lead time and at longer lead times for jja for melbourne ord and daly these results suggest that the ensemble forecasts could be used for predicting runoff into major water supply catchments one month ahead and at longer lead times for some catchments and seasons while the hindcasts show promising potential for lead times up to three months they generally show no added or worse skill than climatology at longer lead times beyond lead 3 without post processing of the forecasts use at longer lead times is therefore not recommended in this study we developed and tested the skill of seasonal landscape hydrological forecasts for australia using the climate ensemble prediction system access s1 and the hydrological model awra l v6 our study provides avenues for several additional analyses and improvements to the system that will be outlined below and could be addressed in future research the main aim of this study was to provide an overview of the forecast performance across australia and across large scale regions due to the lack of observations with continental coverage a historical reference simulation based on observed climate inputs was used as pseudo truth for the forecast verification as is typically used when assessing global and continental scale climate and hydrological forecasts to some extent the skill of the forecast compared against in situ observations can be estimated by combining information on historical model performance with information on hindcast performance van dijk et al 2013b however more detailed analyses are needed to investigate the performance of the forecasts at catchment scale e g against observations from the australian hydrologic reference stations http www bom gov au water hrs and compare them against existing catchment scale forecasts e g the bureau of meteorology s seasonal streamflow forecasts http www bom gov au water ssf additionally applications of the forecasts for tailored end uses e g for predictions of inflow into water supply catchments predictions of flood risk along critical infrastructure or water demand forecasts require an evaluation of the performance of the forecast using independent in situ observations e g streamflow gauging data water level time series time series of municipal water use which could be performed in future tailored studies in collaboration with stakeholders this paper presented a general verification of forecast performance at continental and regional scale with focus on two potential end uses and including hydrological extremes however tailored forecasts for a range of sectors which have not been assessed in this study could be explored in future research these include for example predictions of bushfire risk using seasonal forecasts of soil moisture as a proxy for fuel availability forecasts of evapotranspiration could be used in demand forecasting in water supply management and by irrigators gridded runoff forecasts provide opportunities for the prediction of flood risk especially in ungauged catchments and remote locations with sparse observations complementary to streamflow and flood forecasts in gauged locations the positive skill in predicting extreme dry and wet events in terms of the bss for lowest und highest decile events especially at one month lead time and for soil moisture up to lead 2 suggest opportunities for continental and regional scale drought and flood risk predictions which could be assessed further in future research other avenues for future improvements are related to the post processing of the climate inputs and hydrological outputs the current calibration of the seasonal forecasting data is based on quantile mapping and the awra l hydrological hindcasts were not post processed quantile mapping is a simple and effective bias correction method crochemore et al 2016 but may not be suitable in regions where there is no or low correlation between the hindcast and observations zhao et al 2017 future versions of the system could use improved downscaling and bias correction methods and additionally apply post processing to the hydrological outputs particularly to runoff forecasts at the catchment scale our results show the highest skill for soil moisture and evapotranspiration for most key regions and lead times highlighting the critical role of initial states and soil memory for the skill of the forecast future studies could quantify the sources of skill numerically by comparing the hindcast against alternative forecasts for example a climatology ensemble forecast or a persistence forecast shukla and lettenmaier 2011 in addition future research could investigate the sources of predictability e g related to large scale climate oscillations such as the el nino southern oscillation or the indian ocean dipole e g king et al 2020 such information would provide guidance on the sensitivity of the skill of the forecasting system to improvements to the initial states e g through data assimilation or the climate forecasting system the initialisation of both the climate forecasts and the hydrological forecasts are scheduled to be enhanced through a improved initial ocean and land states in the access s climate forecasts which are planned for the upcoming access s2 system release and b assimilation of soil moisture e g tian et al submitted and other observation types such as vegetation total water storage into the awra l hydrological model to update

assimilation da systems can provide high resolution real time soil state analyses however soil state representations from regional continuously cycling da systems have not been examined this study evaluates soil moisture and temperature estimates and spread characteristics from a real time limited area continuously cycling ensemble kalman filter enkf data assimilation da system run at the national center for atmospheric research ncar for 2 7 years over the conterminous united states conus soil moisture and temperature data from both the enkf and operational global forecast system gfs analysis are compared against the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 soil state estimates results demonstrate the continuously cycling enkf was generally able to represent the

of soil moisture and temperature soil state estimates from the ncar ensemble exhibited lower bias and rmse compared to gfs analyses over west and southeast conus additionally the ensemble spread characteristics suggest that future limited area continuously cycling enkf systems could successfully assimilate both in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture and temperature observations to further improve soil state analyses keywords soil moisture soil temperature lsm model comparison 1 introduction soil moisture is an important component of the water cycle that controls several hydroclimatic processes thus influencing the spatial and temporal variability of weather and climate specifically soil water content impacts the partitioning of land surface heat flux between the sensible and latent components dirmeyer et al 1999 affecting both energy and water balances moreover several studies khodayar and schädler 2013 tuttle and salvucci 2016 koukoula et al 2019 keil et al 2019 have examined the impact of soil moisture on precipitation finding varied relationships of sign and magnitude that depend on the characteristics of the region and atmospheric conditions in addition soil moisture plays a key role in climate change projections ipcc 2014 by affecting runoff generation wei et al 2007 clark and gedney 2008 nikolopoulos et al 2011 heat waves lorenz et al 2010 whan et al 2015 and the carbon cycle seneviratne et al 2010 therefore accurate characterization of soil moisture is imperative for climate research atmospheric and hydrological modeling agriculture water resources management and drought monitoring soil temperature also plays a critical role in land atmosphere interactions by directly affecting the surface radiation budget through upward longwave radiation and ground heat flux as with soil moisture soil temperature can have a large impact on weather godfrey and stensrud 2008 mahanama et al 2008 and climate hillel 1980 simulations additionally soil temperature influences vegetation growth mcmichael and burke 1998 despite the crucial role of soil state characteristics in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature are limited and insufficient to capture soil state dynamics at various temporal and spatial scales while remote sensing retrievals of soil state can be used to quantify soil moisture and temperature spatio temporal variability remotely sensed products generally provide information only for the upper few centimeters of the land surface furthermore topography roughness vegetation and atmospheric conditions influence the accuracy of remote sensing derived soil moisture and temperature datasets vinnikov et al 1999 entekhabi et al 2010 thus in lieu of adequate soil moisture and temperature observations model simulated soil state products have been widely used for several applications including flood drought and agricultural monitoring there are several model estimated soil moisture and temperature datasets derived from various land surface or hydrological models with different meteorological forcing spatial and temporal extents and spatial resolutions for example a number of global soil state products are derived from numerical weather prediction nwp models atmospheric models with fully coupled land surface models lsms dutra et al 2010 ek et al 2003 in these models the lsms are forced with modeled meteorological conditions and while meteorological fields benefit from the assimilation of conventional and satellite derived atmospheric observations drusch and viterbo 2007 de rosnay et al 2014 soil states evolve freely however products derived from lsms coupled with atmospheric models are limited by errors related to uncertainties in modeled meteorological forcing roads 2003 thus there are several model based soil moisture and temperature products derived from uncoupled offline lsms driven by bias corrected reanalyses or observation based meteorological forcing that may have improved soil state analyses through better representation of meteorological forcing schellekens et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012a yet while the observations and bias corrected atmospheric reanalyses used as forcing for the offline models can improve soil state accuracy the lsm does not interact with the model atmosphere which theoretically can compensate for some lsm biases robock et al 2000 specifically interactions between the atmosphere and underlying land surface can trigger mesoscale circulations weaver and avissar 2001 and affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of precipitation koukoula et al 2019 and thus affect the soil moisture and temperature simulations in addition to global coupled models and the uncoupled systems limited area data assimilation da systems fillion et al 2010 schwartz et al 2015 benjamin et al 2016 can function as another source of soil state information these systems have the potential to offer real time soil state analyses with higher resolution than those currently available as limited area da systems move toward convection permitting scales in experimental and operational settings e g schraff et al 2016 schwartz 2016 gustafsson et al 2018 in particular limited area continuously cycling da systems are becoming more common in research and real time forecasting e g schwartz et al 2015 2019 schraff et al 2016 hagelin et al 2017 raynaud and bouttier 2017 pantillon et al 2018 keresturi et al 2019 because of their many attractive properties e g dynamically consistent initial conditions potential to alleviate spin up issues especially for short term forecast applications yet these continuously cycling da systems are still being developed and come with the risk that accumulation of biases through assimilation cycles may degrade forecasts compared to those initialized from a global model e g hsiao et al 2012 torn and davis 2012 romine et al 2014 schwartz et al 2019 2020 wong et al 2020 moreover most operational continuously cycling limited area da systems do not assimilate either remotely sensed or in situ soil state observations meaning soil states are solely constrained by meteorology and it is unclear whether meteorological biases in continuously cycling limited area da systems ultimately negatively impact soil state estimates therefore to advance understanding of the skill of limited area continuously cycling da systems to represent soil state characteristics this study evaluates soil moisture and temperature products and spread from a quasi operational real time continuously cycling ensemble kalman filter enkf da system run at ncar schwartz et al 2015 2019 for 2 7 years that ultimately initialized novel 10 member ensemble forecasts over the conus with 3 km horizontal grid spacing evaluating the analysis system ensemble spread and simulation accuracy of soil moisture and temperature states will allow us to understand the strengths and limitations of such a system in simulating soil state characteristics in addition soil states derived from gfs were compared to the enkf based soil estimates using as reference the nldas 2 xia et al 2012a 2012b soil moisture and temperature products we chose to use the gfs analysis and nldas 2 datasets for two reasons first both products are widely used and second because the soil moisture and temperature estimates from all products used in this study are derived from the same lsm noah as koster et al 2009 pointed out model simulated soil moisture is highly model dependent meaning there are fundamental inconsistencies between lsms the next section briefly describes the soil state datasets we used section 3 presents the methodology we adopted for the analysis while section 4 presents the main results of the evaluation and comparison of the soil moisture and temperature datasets lastly section 5 discusses our main findings and summarizes our conclusions 2 datasets we examined soil moisture and temperature from the analysis component of ncar s real time convection allowing ensemble prediction system schwartz et al 2015 2019 ncep s operational gfs and the nldas 2 the ncar ensemble analysis system employed a limited area continuously cycling enkf with 15 km horizontal grid spacing that covered the conus fig 1 all ensemble members used version 3 6 1 of the advanced research weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock and klemp 2008 powers et al 2017 with 40 vertical levels coupled with the noah lsm chen and dudhia 2001 in the lsm the soil was discretized in four layers of 10 30 60 and 100 cm depths from top to bottom and soil states evolved freely based on meteorological forcing no soil moisture or temperature da was performed the land use and vegetation classification was based on the noah modified 21 category igbp modis friedl et al 2010 dataset and the soil type based on the statsgo soil dataset from usda miller and white 1998 from 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 new enkf analyses were produced every 6 h that updated 50 member 80 member beginning 2 may 2016 ensembles of 6 hour forecasts by assimilating a set of conventional meteorological observations e g rawinsonde aircraft surface etc see table 1 in schwartz et al 2015 soil states were not included in the enkf state vector so assimilation of screen level temperature and moisture observations does not directly affect update soil state variables schwartz et al 2015 in this study we evaluate the soil moisture and temperature from only 10 members of the 15 km analysis ensemble the choice to examine just 10 members was because these 10 analysis members were ultimately used to initialize real time 48 h 10 member ensemble forecasts with 3 km horizontal grid spacing over the conus that have been the subject of much investigation schwartz et al 2019 and references therein although 15 km enkf analyses are rather coarse higher resolution analyses from continuously cycling enkfs are currently unavailable over the conus and future convection permitting enkfs face the same challenges as coarser resolution enkfs regarding accumulation of biases thus there is much to learn by examining 15 km enkf based soil states we also examined soil moisture and temperature from 0 25 gfs analyses initial conditions for the gfs are obtained through a hybrid variational ensemble da system wang and lei 2014 kleist and ide 2015a 2015b that assimilates many satellite and conventional observations every 6 h like the ncar ensemble da system the gfs uses the four soil layer 10 30 60 and 100 cm noah lsm and soil states evolve freely the gfs vegetation and soil type classification are also the same as in the ncar ensemble we compared the gfs and ncar ensemble soil states against the nldas 2 noah lsm soil moisture and temperature analysis nldas 2 is an offline da system featuring four uncoupled lsms executed over a domain with 1 8 horizontal grid spacing covering the conus the vegetation classification was derived from the global 1 km avhrr based 13 class vegetation database of university of maryland hansen and reed 2000 while the soil texture was derived from the 1 km statsgo database with 16 texture classes the majority of nldas atmospheric forcing data was derived from the north american regional reanalysis narr which has 32 km horizontal grid spacing xia et al 2012a 2012b however satellite derived downward shortwave radiation pinker et al 2003 is used to adjust the narr simulated downward shortwave radiation data wherein a bias correction algorithm is applied to the narr surface downward shortwave radiation furthermore the precipitation forcing was derived from the cpc unified gauge based precipitation analysis higgins et al 2000 chen et al 2008 with the monthly parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism topographical adjustment daly et al 1994 for this study we used only the soil moisture and temperature estimates from the 4 layer noah lsm the choice to use the nldas 2 noah soil moisture and temperature estimates as a reference was driven by the fact that nldas 2 is a state of the art dataset that compares well with in situ observations xia et al 2012a 2012b 2013 2014 for example xia et al 2014 compared the nldas 2 noah lsm soil moisture estimates against ground based soil moisture and temperature observations from the illinois climate network and the soil climate analysis network scan schaefer et al 2007 and found the model was able to skillfully capture wet and dry events furthermore xia et al 2013 found that the nldas 2 noah lsm generally matches observed soil temperature well for different soil layers and time scales additionally nldas provides a consistent integrated product in space and time that can be used to evaluate the two systems gfs and ncar ensemble compared to in situ and remotely sensed data e g smap that can only capture parts of the soil moisture state and thus are inconsistent with the four soil layers used in the ncar ensemble and gfs neither the nldas 2 ncar ensemble or gfs products assimilate soil moisture or temperature observations soil state is constrained indirectly though meteorology to further assess the suitability of nldas 2 as our reference we compared nldas 2 analyses and version 4 of the soil moisture active and passive smap level 4 soil moisture and temperature product reichle et al 2017 2019 to near surface measurements 5 cm from 194 stations across the conus collected from scan from 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 excluding stations with more than 40 of missing data during the evaluation period the smap level 4 product provides 3 hourly global 9 km resolution estimates of surface 0 5 cm and root zone 0 100 cm soil moisture and temperature among other land surface conditions based on the assimilation of smap l band brightness temperature observations into a version of nasa s goddard earth observing system version 5 geos 5 land data assimilation system ldas reichle et al 2018 we compared only the first layer of nldas and smap analyses because it is the only one consistent with the in situ measurements at 5 cm from the surface results indicate that both nldas and smap compared similarly with scan observations in terms of centered root mean square error crmse and correlation r soil moisture estimates from the smap yielded crmse and r of 0 055 m3 m3 and 0 737 respectively while nldas had very similar crmse and r of 0 056 m3 m3 and 0 725 respectively in terms of soil temperature smap exhibited crmse of 2 9 k and r of 0 921 while the crmse and r of the nldas soil temperature estimates when compared with in situ observations was 2 93 k and 0 915 respectively thus differences between the two products both in terms of crmse and r were very small these results suggest that overall nldas represents the soil state realistically and because nldas has soil layers consistent with the ncar ensemble and gfs nldas is a more natural reference than smap for our study moreover comparing gfs and ncar ensemble soil states at the top layer to smap level 4 analyses generally corroborated results comparing the forecast models against nldas analyses given these collective considerations we do not further discuss comparisons with smap and focus on comparing forecasts to nldas in the remainder of this study 3 methodology we used several metrics to intercompare the ncar ensemble gfs and nldas soil states between 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 over the conus using daily values we estimated the daily values by averaging over the 6 hourly values 4 values per day at 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 utc for both the ncar ensemble and gfs and over the hourly values for nldas 2 the three datasets have different horizontal grid spacing so to compare them we bilinearly interpolated the ncar ensemble and gfs analyses to the same spatial resolution as our reference nldas 2 for the first part of the analysis domain average statistics we chose to exclude snow covered areas because the ncar ensemble performed poorly over areas with snow cover for reasons not yet understood additionally for the soil state evaluation we only used one member of the ncar ensemble given that we found there are not large differences among the members in a domain average sense we strongly believe that using one member instead of the ensemble mean will not affect the results of the study we assessed the performance of the ncar ensemble and gfs with the bias and root mean squared error rmse given as 1 bias s i m r e f and 2 rmse i 1 n ref i sim i 2 n where simi is the daily simulated soil moisture and temperature for the ith day refi is the daily reference data for each soil layer i e nldas 2 and n is the number of days for each grid point the overbars indicate average values over the n days to investigate the impact of precipitation forcing on top layer soil moisture and temperature simulations we calculated the mean relative error of precipitation soil moisture and soil temperature for areas with total accumulated precipitation from 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 higher than the 75th 3 009 0 mm and 90th 3 604 6 mm percentiles based on nldas 2 precipitation estimates as 3 mre s i m r e f r e f lastly to assess spread characteristics of the ncar ensemble s soil state we calculated the standard deviation sd of soil moisture and temperature estimates from 10 members of the ncar enkf da system as 4 sd 1 m 1 i 1 m x i x 2 where xi is the daily soil moisture or temperature estimate from the ith of 10 members at a given point x is the mean value of soil moisture or temperature from the 10 members for each grid point and m is the number of ensemble members 10 4 results 4 1 domain averaged soil state there are clear differences in soil moisture and temperature estimates among the products figs 2 5 specifically all soil layers are typically wetter in the gfs analysis compared to the ncar ensemble and nldas 2 over the entire domain domain averaged fig 2 during the warm dry period april september gfs soil moisture for all layers is in closer agreement with nldas 2 while except for the second layer ncar ensemble soil moisture is closest to the nldas 2 during the cold wet period october march furthermore at the deepest soil layer there is a time lag of around three months between the maxima and minima of the gfs analysis and the ncar ensemble and the reference data nldas 2 fig 2d in terms of soil temperature at the first layer there are minor differences between the three products mainly during the cold wet period fig 3a however the differences are more substantial at deeper layers fig 3b d where during the warm dry period the ncar ensemble soil temperature values are lower than the other two products while the gfs agrees well with nldas 2 at the second and third layers additionally during the cold wet period the ncar ensemble and gfs soil temperature values are higher compared to nldas 2 as with soil moisture at the deepest soil layer there is a time lag between the gfs analysis and the ncar ensemble and the nldas 2 soil temperature estimates fig 3d despite these timing and amplitude errors both the ncar ensemble and gfs capture the seasonality of soil moisture and temperature at the top three layers figs 2 and 3 however the ncar ensemble and gfs analysis soil moisture have slightly higher intra annual variability compared to the nldas 2 soil moisture fig 2 the opposite is the case for soil temperature where mainly at the deeper layers the ncar ensemble soil temperature estimates have much lower intra annual variability compared to the nldas 2 and gfs fig 3 overall during the cold wet period the domain averaged soil moisture and temperature estimates from the ncar ensemble are in closer agreement with nldas compared to gfs while during the warm dry period gfs exhibited better representation of soil state 4 2 soil state distributions as with the domain averaged soil moisture compared to nldas 2 there is a general overestimation of soil moisture in all four layers from the gfs analysis in both the warm dry and cold wet seasons fig 4 the opposite is the case for the ncar ensemble which overall underestimates soil moisture fig 4 with the highest underestimation occurring at the upper quantiles during the cold wet season at the first soil layer fig 4a however at the second and third layers the upper quantiles of soil moisture estimates from the ncar ensemble during both the cold wet and warm dry periods are higher compared to the nldas 2 soil moisture fig 4b c compared to soil moisture differences in the soil temperature distributions among the ncar ensemble and gfs are smaller there is a systematic overestimation of soil temperature in all layers during the cold wet period consistent with the domain averaged time series fig 3 additionally there is underestimation of soil temperature from the ncar ensemble for the entire domain during the warm dry period at the lower quantiles at the deeper layers fig 5b d while at the upper quantiles there is an overestimation the opposite is the case for gfs which during the warm dry period overestimates the lower quantiles of soil temperature while at the upper quantiles is in good agreement with the observations overall the gfs exhibits overestimation of soil moisture at all layers while the opposite is the case for the ncar ensemble at the upper quantiles during the cold wet period gfs is in closer agreement with the nldas compared to the ncar ensemble in terms of soil temperature both datasets exhibit overestimation during the cold wet season 4 3 spatial characteristics of soil state bias and rmse in terms of spatial variability there was an overall overestimation of soil moisture over the west and southeast conus and an underestimation over the central conus from both the ncar ensemble and gfs with an increase in bias with depth fig 6 the overall underestimation of soil moisture in the central conus from both datasets compared to the nldas might be attributed to differences in vegetation parameters in this area the dominant vegetation cover is a mixture of cropland and grasslands in all three models however due to differences in the vegetation datasets between the nldas and the other two products there might be differences in the vegetation parameters affecting soil moisture estimates e g stomatal resistance roughness length etc the ncar ensemble exhibits better performance lower bias compared to gfs at all four soil layers over areas with the highest amounts of accumulated precipitation the northeast and western conus on the contrary there is good performance over the drier central conus from the gfs especially at the first layer we also found overestimation underestimation over the northeast conus at the second and third fourth soil layer from the ncar ensemble fig 6b d likely due to issues with how the lsm in the ncar ensemble performed in areas with snow cover moreover there is a high positive bias over the big cities from the ncar ensemble mainly over the southeast conus which might be attributed to potential differences in the land cover parameters used for the urban areas from the three datasets additionally in terms of rmse fig 7 soil moisture estimates from the gfs analysis are in closer agreement with nldas 2 for the four soil layers over the central conus however in the southeast and west conus especially at the first soil layer fig 7a the ncar ensemble exhibits better representation of soil moisture compared to the gfs analysis for soil temperature as indicated from the quantile quantile plots fig 5a at the first soil layer there are not large bias differences between the ncar ensemble and gfs fig 8 a b however at the deeper layers soil temperature is underestimated over the north northeast conus from the ncar ensemble fig 8b d while the gfs analysis has a relatively high bias over the southwest conus and rocky mountains similar to soil moisture the ncar ensemble overestimates soil temperature over the big cites unlike soil moisture gfs exhibits better performance over areas with higher precipitation southeast and western conus compared to the ncar ensemble overall the ncar ensemble is in closer agreement with nldas 2 at the first layer in terms of rmse fig 9 a additionally over most of the conus the ncar ensemble exhibits lower rmse compared to the gfs analysis however at the deeper layers the ncar ensemble exhibits higher rmse compared with the gfs analysis over the rocky mountains and the north northeast conus fig 9b d despite poor performance over areas with snow cover the ncar ensemble was able to represent the spatial and temporal soil state characteristics specifically it exhibits lower biases and rmses over the southeast and west conus for both soil state variables on the contrary gfs is in closer agreement with nldas 2 over the rocky mountains the northeast and central conus 4 4 meteorological forcing one of the most important components that drives the variability of modeled soil moisture is the meteorological forcing guo et al 2006 found that uncertainty in the lsm soil moisture simulations strongly dependents on the meteorological forcing more specific they found that the differences among soil moisture simulations with the same land surface model and different meteorological forcing are as high as those among different land surface models driven with the same meteorological forcing we assessed the impact of the meteorological forcing on soil state estimates based on the 6 hour forecasts from the previous cycle for the ncar ensemble and gfs we used the corresponding 6 hour forcing variables for nldas 2 since soil state is affected by the meteorological characteristics from the previous timesteps overall there are not large differences between the 2 m temperature and longwave radiation of the three products in terms of magnitude for both the cold wet and warm dry seasons fig 10 b d however precipitation and shortwave radiation vary considerably among the datasets fig 10a c specifically at the lower quantiles of shortwave radiation the ncar ensemble is in closer agreement with nldas 2 while the gfs generally overestimates fig 10c conversely at the upper quantiles the ncar ensemble underestimates while gfs overestimates shortwave radiation fig 10c in terms of precipitation the ncar ensemble is in closer agreement with the nldas 2 precipitation estimates especially during the warm dry season however there is an overall overestimation with respect to nldas 2 despite that the impact of the mres of precipitation on the soil temperature is very small over areas with the highest amounts of accumulated precipitation fig 11 yet the better representation of precipitation lower mre from gfs over the wetter regions southeast and western conus results in a slightly better performance of soil temperature however this is not the case for the soil moisture the underestimation of precipitation over the wet regions fig 12 from the ncar ensemble results in lower soil moisture mres while a more accurate precipitation forcing lower mre from gfs leads to poorer performance high positive mre in terms of soil moisture representation fig 11 this behavior might be attributed to the differences in soil properties between the datasets 4 5 spread characteristics of the ncar ensemble soil state lastly the sd of soil moisture among the 10 ensemble members for the four soil layers ranges from 0 to 0 7 m3 m3 fig 13 specifically there is little spread sd of 0 0 01 m3 m3 among the members at the first layer fig 13a we note higher sds at the deeper layers and mainly over the northeast and central conus fig 13b d with the highest values at the second layer 0 7 m3 m3 similar to soil moisture the spread of soil temperature among the ensemble members is very small 0 0 9 k at the first layer while at deeper layers relatively higher sds up to 4 1 k at the 3rd layer are limited to the north northeast conus fig 14 5 discussion and conclusions in this study we conducted a validation of the soil state representation from the ncar ensemble enkf da system and gfs over the conus for 2 7 years using the nldas 2 data as reference we also evaluated spread characteristics of the 10 member ncar ensemble s soil state results demonstrate the ncar ensemble continuously cycling limited area mesoscale enkf was able to represent the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture and temperature across the conus despite the poor performance over snow covered areas soil state estimates from the ncar ensemble were more accurate than gfs analyses over some areas specifically the ncar ensemble obtained the closest agreement with the nldas 2 soil moisture estimates during the cold wet period in all four layers however the ncar ensemble underestimated soil moisture and temperature mainly at the deeper soil layers during the warm dry season while gfs showed an overall overestimation of both variables additionally the ncar ensemble had large soil moisture and temperature discrepancies in snow covered areas high bias and rmse over the northeast conus and rocky mountains specifically we noted low intra annual variability of soil moisture and temperature over areas with snow cover however since we excluded snow covered areas from the domain average validation this poor performance does not fundamentally impact the results of this work and overall the performance of the ncar ensemble da system demonstrates the feasibility of using limited area continuously cycling enkfs as a method to credibly simulate soil moisture and temperature furthermore results demonstrated the sensitivity of soil moisture and temperature estimates to differences in meteorological forcing datasets vegetation classes and soil properties while the ncar ensemble and gfs analysis have the same vegetation and soil properties the nldas 2 dataset uses different vegetation classifications and despite the same soil type categories different soil properties are applied in nldas 2 more specifically wilting point field capacity and porosity for all soil type categories except sand and loamy sand are higher in the nldas 2 modeling system table 1 which keeps all layers relatively wet additionally saturated hydraulic conductivity for most soil categories is one order of magnitude higher than the one used in the ncar ensemble table 1 this might be the reason that both the ncar ensemble and gfs analysis soil moisture were relatively close to the nldas 2 soil moisture estimates especially over areas with higher amounts of precipitation despite the overestimation of precipitation in the two datasets the lesser overestimation of the higher quantiles of precipitation in the ncar ensemble in comparison with the gfs analysis might be the reason for the ncar ensemble s better representation of soil moisture during the wet season additionally the underestimation of soil moisture during the warm dry period from the ncar ensemble might be attributed to its overestimation of the upper quantiles of shortwave radiation which may have resulted in higher amounts of evapotranspiration and thus drier soil moreover the shortwave radiation forcing and the resulting evapotranspiration might be the reason for the higher accuracy in soil moisture representation exhibited by the ncar ensemble despite the higher uncertainty underestimation of the precipitation when compared to the gfs analysis over wetter areas southeast conus and the northwest coast the overall overestimation of soil moisture from the gfs might be attributed to a combination of the overestimation of precipitation and the lower shortwave radiation and thus lower evapotranspiration compared to the other two datasets we also noticed a time lag of around three months between the ncar ensemble and gfs and the reference data nldas 2 at the deepest soil layer the higher persistence of soil moisture at the deepest layer of the nldas 2 dataset is likely related to its larger maximum active water holding capacity as pointed out by xia et al 2014 a large maximum active water holding capacity may lead to longer soil moisture persistence therefore the soil moisture simulation is not only affected by the uncertainty in meteorological forcing but also by soil properties in terms of soil temperature overall as expected the ability of the three modeling systems to simulate the soil temperature is affected by their soil moisture representation because in the noah lsm heat capacity is a function of soil moisture and soil porosity and thermal conductivity is a function of soil moisture chen and dudhia 2001 therefore soil moisture affects the soil temperature and the time lag noticed in the deepest layer is due to the time lag noticed between the nldas and the other two datasets in the soil moisture estimates previous studies godfrey and stensrud 2008 have pointed out that a soil moisture error of 0 1 m3 m3 may lead to an error of more than 1 6 k for maximum or minimum daily soil temperature furthermore the small differences among the datasets at the first soil layer despite the higher soil moisture variability might be attributed to the atmospheric temperature da performed in all three forcing datasets air temperature is highly correlated with soil temperature because both are determined by the energy balance at the ground surface lastly based on the spread characteristics sd among the 10 ensemble members continuously cycling enkfs similar to the ncar ensemble can probably successfully assimilate soil moisture and temperature observations xia et al 2013 and xia et al 2015 found that the difference between the nldas 2 noah lsm soil moisture and temperature estimates and in situ observations across the conus did not exceed 0 056 m3 m3 and 5 k respectively so if we consider the observation error as the difference between nldas 2 noah and in situ observations truth the spread among the ensemble members e g figs 13 and 14 is similar to the typical observation error in some areas thus forecast error statistics i e ensemble spread from the ncar ensemble could properly adjust the ensemble toward soil state observations during enkf da e g houtekamer and mitchell 1998 in some regions of the study area additionally for the areas with small spread among the ensemble members there are several approaches to increase land surface spread in a cycling enkf which have been used for soil moisture da including random gaussian noise e g kumar et al 2012 or adding synthetic model error fields to state variables related to soil moisture and generating spatially uncorrelated errors reichle and koster 2005 these techniques could potentially be applied to the ncar ensemble to increase its sd for purposes of soil moisture and temperature da and as long as enkf spread is sufficient assimilation of soil moisture and temperature observations in situ and remotely sensed measurements would likely improve performance of continuously cycling enkfs like the ncar ensemble as evidenced by several previous studies that used enkfs to assimilate soil moisture e g pan and wood 2006 reichle and koster 2005 reichle et al 2008 reichle 2008 kumar et al 2009 liu et al 2010 yin et al 2014 lievens et al 2015 blankenship et al 2018 and temperature e g reichle et al 2010 that collectively found improvements in soil moisture surface fluxes evapotranspiration runoff simulations and soil temperature findings from this study provide information on the strengths and limitations of a limited area continuously

4313,accurate characterization of soil state is imperative for weather and climate research hydrological modeling agriculture water resources management and drought monitoring limited area data assimilation da systems can provide high resolution real time soil state analyses however soil state representations from regional continuously cycling da systems have not been examined this study evaluates soil moisture and temperature estimates and spread characteristics from a real time limited area continuously cycling ensemble kalman filter enkf data assimilation da system run at the national center for atmospheric research ncar for 2 7 years over the conterminous united states conus soil moisture and temperature data from both the enkf and operational global forecast system gfs analysis are compared against the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 soil state estimates results demonstrate the continuously cycling enkf was generally able to represent the

of soil moisture and temperature soil state estimates from the ncar ensemble exhibited lower bias and rmse compared to gfs analyses over west and southeast conus additionally the ensemble spread characteristics suggest that future limited area continuously cycling enkf systems could successfully assimilate both in situ and remotely sensed soil moisture and temperature observations to further improve soil state analyses keywords soil moisture soil temperature lsm model comparison 1 introduction soil moisture is an important component of the water cycle that controls several hydroclimatic processes thus influencing the spatial and temporal variability of weather and climate specifically soil water content impacts the partitioning of land surface heat flux between the sensible and latent components dirmeyer et al 1999 affecting both energy and water balances moreover several studies khodayar and schädler 2013 tuttle and salvucci 2016 koukoula et al 2019 keil et al 2019 have examined the impact of soil moisture on precipitation finding varied relationships of sign and magnitude that depend on the characteristics of the region and atmospheric conditions in addition soil moisture plays a key role in climate change projections ipcc 2014 by affecting runoff generation wei et al 2007 clark and gedney 2008 nikolopoulos et al 2011 heat waves lorenz et al 2010 whan et al 2015 and the carbon cycle seneviratne et al 2010 therefore accurate characterization of soil moisture is imperative for climate research atmospheric and hydrological modeling agriculture water resources management and drought monitoring soil temperature also plays a critical role in land atmosphere interactions by directly affecting the surface radiation budget through upward longwave radiation and ground heat flux as with soil moisture soil temperature can have a large impact on weather godfrey and stensrud 2008 mahanama et al 2008 and climate hillel 1980 simulations additionally soil temperature influences vegetation growth mcmichael and burke 1998 despite the crucial role of soil state characteristics in situ observations of soil moisture and temperature are limited and insufficient to capture soil state dynamics at various temporal and spatial scales while remote sensing retrievals of soil state can be used to quantify soil moisture and temperature spatio temporal variability remotely sensed products generally provide information only for the upper few centimeters of the land surface furthermore topography roughness vegetation and atmospheric conditions influence the accuracy of remote sensing derived soil moisture and temperature datasets vinnikov et al 1999 entekhabi et al 2010 thus in lieu of adequate soil moisture and temperature observations model simulated soil state products have been widely used for several applications including flood drought and agricultural monitoring there are several model estimated soil moisture and temperature datasets derived from various land surface or hydrological models with different meteorological forcing spatial and temporal extents and spatial resolutions for example a number of global soil state products are derived from numerical weather prediction nwp models atmospheric models with fully coupled land surface models lsms dutra et al 2010 ek et al 2003 in these models the lsms are forced with modeled meteorological conditions and while meteorological fields benefit from the assimilation of conventional and satellite derived atmospheric observations drusch and viterbo 2007 de rosnay et al 2014 soil states evolve freely however products derived from lsms coupled with atmospheric models are limited by errors related to uncertainties in modeled meteorological forcing roads 2003 thus there are several model based soil moisture and temperature products derived from uncoupled offline lsms driven by bias corrected reanalyses or observation based meteorological forcing that may have improved soil state analyses through better representation of meteorological forcing schellekens et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012a yet while the observations and bias corrected atmospheric reanalyses used as forcing for the offline models can improve soil state accuracy the lsm does not interact with the model atmosphere which theoretically can compensate for some lsm biases robock et al 2000 specifically interactions between the atmosphere and underlying land surface can trigger mesoscale circulations weaver and avissar 2001 and affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of precipitation koukoula et al 2019 and thus affect the soil moisture and temperature simulations in addition to global coupled models and the uncoupled systems limited area data assimilation da systems fillion et al 2010 schwartz et al 2015 benjamin et al 2016 can function as another source of soil state information these systems have the potential to offer real time soil state analyses with higher resolution than those currently available as limited area da systems move toward convection permitting scales in experimental and operational settings e g schraff et al 2016 schwartz 2016 gustafsson et al 2018 in particular limited area continuously cycling da systems are becoming more common in research and real time forecasting e g schwartz et al 2015 2019 schraff et al 2016 hagelin et al 2017 raynaud and bouttier 2017 pantillon et al 2018 keresturi et al 2019 because of their many attractive properties e g dynamically consistent initial conditions potential to alleviate spin up issues especially for short term forecast applications yet these continuously cycling da systems are still being developed and come with the risk that accumulation of biases through assimilation cycles may degrade forecasts compared to those initialized from a global model e g hsiao et al 2012 torn and davis 2012 romine et al 2014 schwartz et al 2019 2020 wong et al 2020 moreover most operational continuously cycling limited area da systems do not assimilate either remotely sensed or in situ soil state observations meaning soil states are solely constrained by meteorology and it is unclear whether meteorological biases in continuously cycling limited area da systems ultimately negatively impact soil state estimates therefore to advance understanding of the skill of limited area continuously cycling da systems to represent soil state characteristics this study evaluates soil moisture and temperature products and spread from a quasi operational real time continuously cycling ensemble kalman filter enkf da system run at ncar schwartz et al 2015 2019 for 2 7 years that ultimately initialized novel 10 member ensemble forecasts over the conus with 3 km horizontal grid spacing evaluating the analysis system ensemble spread and simulation accuracy of soil moisture and temperature states will allow us to understand the strengths and limitations of such a system in simulating soil state characteristics in addition soil states derived from gfs were compared to the enkf based soil estimates using as reference the nldas 2 xia et al 2012a 2012b soil moisture and temperature products we chose to use the gfs analysis and nldas 2 datasets for two reasons first both products are widely used and second because the soil moisture and temperature estimates from all products used in this study are derived from the same lsm noah as koster et al 2009 pointed out model simulated soil moisture is highly model dependent meaning there are fundamental inconsistencies between lsms the next section briefly describes the soil state datasets we used section 3 presents the methodology we adopted for the analysis while section 4 presents the main results of the evaluation and comparison of the soil moisture and temperature datasets lastly section 5 discusses our main findings and summarizes our conclusions 2 datasets we examined soil moisture and temperature from the analysis component of ncar s real time convection allowing ensemble prediction system schwartz et al 2015 2019 ncep s operational gfs and the nldas 2 the ncar ensemble analysis system employed a limited area continuously cycling enkf with 15 km horizontal grid spacing that covered the conus fig 1 all ensemble members used version 3 6 1 of the advanced research weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock and klemp 2008 powers et al 2017 with 40 vertical levels coupled with the noah lsm chen and dudhia 2001 in the lsm the soil was discretized in four layers of 10 30 60 and 100 cm depths from top to bottom and soil states evolved freely based on meteorological forcing no soil moisture or temperature da was performed the land use and vegetation classification was based on the noah modified 21 category igbp modis friedl et al 2010 dataset and the soil type based on the statsgo soil dataset from usda miller and white 1998 from 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 new enkf analyses were produced every 6 h that updated 50 member 80 member beginning 2 may 2016 ensembles of 6 hour forecasts by assimilating a set of conventional meteorological observations e g rawinsonde aircraft surface etc see table 1 in schwartz et al 2015 soil states were not included in the enkf state vector so assimilation of screen level temperature and moisture observations does not directly affect update soil state variables schwartz et al 2015 in this study we evaluate the soil moisture and temperature from only 10 members of the 15 km analysis ensemble the choice to examine just 10 members was because these 10 analysis members were ultimately used to initialize real time 48 h 10 member ensemble forecasts with 3 km horizontal grid spacing over the conus that have been the subject of much investigation schwartz et al 2019 and references therein although 15 km enkf analyses are rather coarse higher resolution analyses from continuously cycling enkfs are currently unavailable over the conus and future convection permitting enkfs face the same challenges as coarser resolution enkfs regarding accumulation of biases thus there is much to learn by examining 15 km enkf based soil states we also examined soil moisture and temperature from 0 25 gfs analyses initial conditions for the gfs are obtained through a hybrid variational ensemble da system wang and lei 2014 kleist and ide 2015a 2015b that assimilates many satellite and conventional observations every 6 h like the ncar ensemble da system the gfs uses the four soil layer 10 30 60 and 100 cm noah lsm and soil states evolve freely the gfs vegetation and soil type classification are also the same as in the ncar ensemble we compared the gfs and ncar ensemble soil states against the nldas 2 noah lsm soil moisture and temperature analysis nldas 2 is an offline da system featuring four uncoupled lsms executed over a domain with 1 8 horizontal grid spacing covering the conus the vegetation classification was derived from the global 1 km avhrr based 13 class vegetation database of university of maryland hansen and reed 2000 while the soil texture was derived from the 1 km statsgo database with 16 texture classes the majority of nldas atmospheric forcing data was derived from the north american regional reanalysis narr which has 32 km horizontal grid spacing xia et al 2012a 2012b however satellite derived downward shortwave radiation pinker et al 2003 is used to adjust the narr simulated downward shortwave radiation data wherein a bias correction algorithm is applied to the narr surface downward shortwave radiation furthermore the precipitation forcing was derived from the cpc unified gauge based precipitation analysis higgins et al 2000 chen et al 2008 with the monthly parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism topographical adjustment daly et al 1994 for this study we used only the soil moisture and temperature estimates from the 4 layer noah lsm the choice to use the nldas 2 noah soil moisture and temperature estimates as a reference was driven by the fact that nldas 2 is a state of the art dataset that compares well with in situ observations xia et al 2012a 2012b 2013 2014 for example xia et al 2014 compared the nldas 2 noah lsm soil moisture estimates against ground based soil moisture and temperature observations from the illinois climate network and the soil climate analysis network scan schaefer et al 2007 and found the model was able to skillfully capture wet and dry events furthermore xia et al 2013 found that the nldas 2 noah lsm generally matches observed soil temperature well for different soil layers and time scales additionally nldas provides a consistent integrated product in space and time that can be used to evaluate the two systems gfs and ncar ensemble compared to in situ and remotely sensed data e g smap that can only capture parts of the soil moisture state and thus are inconsistent with the four soil layers used in the ncar ensemble and gfs neither the nldas 2 ncar ensemble or gfs products assimilate soil moisture or temperature observations soil state is constrained indirectly though meteorology to further assess the suitability of nldas 2 as our reference we compared nldas 2 analyses and version 4 of the soil moisture active and passive smap level 4 soil moisture and temperature product reichle et al 2017 2019 to near surface measurements 5 cm from 194 stations across the conus collected from scan from 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 excluding stations with more than 40 of missing data during the evaluation period the smap level 4 product provides 3 hourly global 9 km resolution estimates of surface 0 5 cm and root zone 0 100 cm soil moisture and temperature among other land surface conditions based on the assimilation of smap l band brightness temperature observations into a version of nasa s goddard earth observing system version 5 geos 5 land data assimilation system ldas reichle et al 2018 we compared only the first layer of nldas and smap analyses because it is the only one consistent with the in situ measurements at 5 cm from the surface results indicate that both nldas and smap compared similarly with scan observations in terms of centered root mean square error crmse and correlation r soil moisture estimates from the smap yielded crmse and r of 0 055 m3 m3 and 0 737 respectively while nldas had very similar crmse and r of 0 056 m3 m3 and 0 725 respectively in terms of soil temperature smap exhibited crmse of 2 9 k and r of 0 921 while the crmse and r of the nldas soil temperature estimates when compared with in situ observations was 2 93 k and 0 915 respectively thus differences between the two products both in terms of crmse and r were very small these results suggest that overall nldas represents the soil state realistically and because nldas has soil layers consistent with the ncar ensemble and gfs nldas is a more natural reference than smap for our study moreover comparing gfs and ncar ensemble soil states at the top layer to smap level 4 analyses generally corroborated results comparing the forecast models against nldas analyses given these collective considerations we do not further discuss comparisons with smap and focus on comparing forecasts to nldas in the remainder of this study 3 methodology we used several metrics to intercompare the ncar ensemble gfs and nldas soil states between 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 over the conus using daily values we estimated the daily values by averaging over the 6 hourly values 4 values per day at 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 utc for both the ncar ensemble and gfs and over the hourly values for nldas 2 the three datasets have different horizontal grid spacing so to compare them we bilinearly interpolated the ncar ensemble and gfs analyses to the same spatial resolution as our reference nldas 2 for the first part of the analysis domain average statistics we chose to exclude snow covered areas because the ncar ensemble performed poorly over areas with snow cover for reasons not yet understood additionally for the soil state evaluation we only used one member of the ncar ensemble given that we found there are not large differences among the members in a domain average sense we strongly believe that using one member instead of the ensemble mean will not affect the results of the study we assessed the performance of the ncar ensemble and gfs with the bias and root mean squared error rmse given as 1 bias s i m r e f and 2 rmse i 1 n ref i sim i 2 n where simi is the daily simulated soil moisture and temperature for the ith day refi is the daily reference data for each soil layer i e nldas 2 and n is the number of days for each grid point the overbars indicate average values over the n days to investigate the impact of precipitation forcing on top layer soil moisture and temperature simulations we calculated the mean relative error of precipitation soil moisture and soil temperature for areas with total accumulated precipitation from 19 march 2015 to 30 december 2017 higher than the 75th 3 009 0 mm and 90th 3 604 6 mm percentiles based on nldas 2 precipitation estimates as 3 mre s i m r e f r e f lastly to assess spread characteristics of the ncar ensemble s soil state we calculated the standard deviation sd of soil moisture and temperature estimates from 10 members of the ncar enkf da system as 4 sd 1 m 1 i 1 m x i x 2 where xi is the daily soil moisture or temperature estimate from the ith of 10 members at a given point x is the mean value of soil moisture or temperature from the 10 members for each grid point and m is the number of ensemble members 10 4 results 4 1 domain averaged soil state there are clear differences in soil moisture and temperature estimates among the products figs 2 5 specifically all soil layers are typically wetter in the gfs analysis compared to the ncar ensemble and nldas 2 over the entire domain domain averaged fig 2 during the warm dry period april september gfs soil moisture for all layers is in closer agreement with nldas 2 while except for the second layer ncar ensemble soil moisture is closest to the nldas 2 during the cold wet period october march furthermore at the deepest soil layer there is a time lag of around three months between the maxima and minima of the gfs analysis and the ncar ensemble and the reference data nldas 2 fig 2d in terms of soil temperature at the first layer there are minor differences between the three products mainly during the cold wet period fig 3a however the differences are more substantial at deeper layers fig 3b d where during the warm dry period the ncar ensemble soil temperature values are lower than the other two products while the gfs agrees well with nldas 2 at the second and third layers additionally during the cold wet period the ncar ensemble and gfs soil temperature values are higher compared to nldas 2 as with soil moisture at the deepest soil layer there is a time lag between the gfs analysis and the ncar ensemble and the nldas 2 soil temperature estimates fig 3d despite these timing and amplitude errors both the ncar ensemble and gfs capture the seasonality of soil moisture and temperature at the top three layers figs 2 and 3 however the ncar ensemble and gfs analysis soil moisture have slightly higher intra annual variability compared to the nldas 2 soil moisture fig 2 the opposite is the case for soil temperature where mainly at the deeper layers the ncar ensemble soil temperature estimates have much lower intra annual variability compared to the nldas 2 and gfs fig 3 overall during the cold wet period the domain averaged soil moisture and temperature estimates from the ncar ensemble are in closer agreement with nldas compared to gfs while during the warm dry period gfs exhibited better representation of soil state 4 2 soil state distributions as with the domain averaged soil moisture compared to nldas 2 there is a general overestimation of soil moisture in all four layers from the gfs analysis in both the warm dry and cold wet seasons fig 4 the opposite is the case for the ncar ensemble which overall underestimates soil moisture fig 4 with the highest underestimation occurring at the upper quantiles during the cold wet season at the first soil layer fig 4a however at the second and third layers the upper quantiles of soil moisture estimates from the ncar ensemble during both the cold wet and warm dry periods are higher compared to the nldas 2 soil moisture fig 4b c compared to soil moisture differences in the soil temperature distributions among the ncar ensemble and gfs are smaller there is a systematic overestimation of soil temperature in all layers during the cold wet period consistent with the domain averaged time series fig 3 additionally there is underestimation of soil temperature from the ncar ensemble for the entire domain during the warm dry period at the lower quantiles at the deeper layers fig 5b d while at the upper quantiles there is an overestimation the opposite is the case for gfs which during the warm dry period overestimates the lower quantiles of soil temperature while at the upper quantiles is in good agreement with the observations overall the gfs exhibits overestimation of soil moisture at all layers while the opposite is the case for the ncar ensemble at the upper quantiles during the cold wet period gfs is in closer agreement with the nldas compared to the ncar ensemble in terms of soil temperature both datasets exhibit overestimation during the cold wet season 4 3 spatial characteristics of soil state bias and rmse in terms of spatial variability there was an overall overestimation of soil moisture over the west and southeast conus and an underestimation over the central conus from both the ncar ensemble and gfs with an increase in bias with depth fig 6 the overall underestimation of soil moisture in the central conus from both datasets compared to the nldas might be attributed to differences in vegetation parameters in this area the dominant vegetation cover is a mixture of cropland and grasslands in all three models however due to differences in the vegetation datasets between the nldas and the other two products there might be differences in the vegetation parameters affecting soil moisture estimates e g stomatal resistance roughness length etc the ncar ensemble exhibits better performance lower bias compared to gfs at all four soil layers over areas with the highest amounts of accumulated precipitation the northeast and western conus on the contrary there is good performance over the drier central conus from the gfs especially at the first layer we also found overestimation underestimation over the northeast conus at the second and third fourth soil layer from the ncar ensemble fig 6b d likely due to issues with how the lsm in the ncar ensemble performed in areas with snow cover moreover there is a high positive bias over the big cities from the ncar ensemble mainly over the southeast conus which might be attributed to potential differences in the land cover parameters used for the urban areas from the three datasets additionally in terms of rmse fig 7 soil moisture estimates from the gfs analysis are in closer agreement with nldas 2 for the four soil layers over the central conus however in the southeast and west conus especially at the first soil layer fig 7a the ncar ensemble exhibits better representation of soil moisture compared to the gfs analysis for soil temperature as indicated from the quantile quantile plots fig 5a at the first soil layer there are not large bias differences between the ncar ensemble and gfs fig 8 a b however at the deeper layers soil temperature is underestimated over the north northeast conus from the ncar ensemble fig 8b d while the gfs analysis has a relatively high bias over the southwest conus and rocky mountains similar to soil moisture the ncar ensemble overestimates soil temperature over the big cites unlike soil moisture gfs exhibits better performance over areas with higher precipitation southeast and western conus compared to the ncar ensemble overall the ncar ensemble is in closer agreement with nldas 2 at the first layer in terms of rmse fig 9 a additionally over most of the conus the ncar ensemble exhibits lower rmse compared to the gfs analysis however at the deeper layers the ncar ensemble exhibits higher rmse compared with the gfs analysis over the rocky mountains and the north northeast conus fig 9b d despite poor performance over areas with snow cover the ncar ensemble was able to represent the spatial and temporal soil state characteristics specifically it exhibits lower biases and rmses over the southeast and west conus for both soil state variables on the contrary gfs is in closer agreement with nldas 2 over the rocky mountains the northeast and central conus 4 4 meteorological forcing one of the most important components that drives the variability of modeled soil moisture is the meteorological forcing guo et al 2006 found that uncertainty in the lsm soil moisture simulations strongly dependents on the meteorological forcing more specific they found that the differences among soil moisture simulations with the same land surface model and different meteorological forcing are as high as those among different land surface models driven with the same meteorological forcing we assessed the impact of the meteorological forcing on soil state estimates based on the 6 hour forecasts from the previous cycle for the ncar ensemble and gfs we used the corresponding 6 hour forcing variables for nldas 2 since soil state is affected by the meteorological characteristics from the previous timesteps overall there are not large differences between the 2 m temperature and longwave radiation of the three products in terms of magnitude for both the cold wet and warm dry seasons fig 10 b d however precipitation and shortwave radiation vary considerably among the datasets fig 10a c specifically at the lower quantiles of shortwave radiation the ncar ensemble is in closer agreement with nldas 2 while the gfs generally overestimates fig 10c conversely at the upper quantiles the ncar ensemble underestimates while gfs overestimates shortwave radiation fig 10c in terms of precipitation the ncar ensemble is in closer agreement with the nldas 2 precipitation estimates especially during the warm dry season however there is an overall overestimation with respect to nldas 2 despite that the impact of the mres of precipitation on the soil temperature is very small over areas with the highest amounts of accumulated precipitation fig 11 yet the better representation of precipitation lower mre from gfs over the wetter regions southeast and western conus results in a slightly better performance of soil temperature however this is not the case for the soil moisture the underestimation of precipitation over the wet regions fig 12 from the ncar ensemble results in lower soil moisture mres while a more accurate precipitation forcing lower mre from gfs leads to poorer performance high positive mre in terms of soil moisture representation fig 11 this behavior might be attributed to the differences in soil properties between the datasets 4 5 spread characteristics of the ncar ensemble soil state lastly the sd of soil moisture among the 10 ensemble members for the four soil layers ranges from 0 to 0 7 m3 m3 fig 13 specifically there is little spread sd of 0 0 01 m3 m3 among the members at the first layer fig 13a we note higher sds at the deeper layers and mainly over the northeast and central conus fig 13b d with the highest values at the second layer 0 7 m3 m3 similar to soil moisture the spread of soil temperature among the ensemble members is very small 0 0 9 k at the first layer while at deeper layers relatively higher sds up to 4 1 k at the 3rd layer are limited to the north northeast conus fig 14 5 discussion and conclusions in this study we conducted a validation of the soil state representation from the ncar ensemble enkf da system and gfs over the conus for 2 7 years using the nldas 2 data as reference we also evaluated spread characteristics of the 10 member ncar ensemble s soil state results demonstrate the ncar ensemble continuously cycling limited area mesoscale enkf was able to represent the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture and temperature across the conus despite the poor performance over snow covered areas soil state estimates from the ncar ensemble were more accurate than gfs analyses over some areas specifically the ncar ensemble obtained the closest agreement with the nldas 2 soil moisture estimates during the cold wet period in all four layers however the ncar ensemble underestimated soil moisture and temperature mainly at the deeper soil layers during the warm dry season while gfs showed an overall overestimation of both variables additionally the ncar ensemble had large soil moisture and temperature discrepancies in snow covered areas high bias and rmse over the northeast conus and rocky mountains specifically we noted low intra annual variability of soil moisture and temperature over areas with snow cover however since we excluded snow covered areas from the domain average validation this poor performance does not fundamentally impact the results of this work and overall the performance of the ncar ensemble da system demonstrates the feasibility of using limited area continuously cycling enkfs as a method to credibly simulate soil moisture and temperature furthermore results demonstrated the sensitivity of soil moisture and temperature estimates to differences in meteorological forcing datasets vegetation classes and soil properties while the ncar ensemble and gfs analysis have the same vegetation and soil properties the nldas 2 dataset uses different vegetation classifications and despite the same soil type categories different soil properties are applied in nldas 2 more specifically wilting point field capacity and porosity for all soil type categories except sand and loamy sand are higher in the nldas 2 modeling system table 1 which keeps all layers relatively wet additionally saturated hydraulic conductivity for most soil categories is one order of magnitude higher than the one used in the ncar ensemble table 1 this might be the reason that both the ncar ensemble and gfs analysis soil moisture were relatively close to the nldas 2 soil moisture estimates especially over areas with higher amounts of precipitation despite the overestimation of precipitation in the two datasets the lesser overestimation of the higher quantiles of precipitation in the ncar ensemble in comparison with the gfs analysis might be the reason for the ncar ensemble s better representation of soil moisture during the wet season additionally the underestimation of soil moisture during the warm dry period from the ncar ensemble might be attributed to its overestimation of the upper quantiles of shortwave radiation which may have resulted in higher amounts of evapotranspiration and thus drier soil moreover the shortwave radiation forcing and the resulting evapotranspiration might be the reason for the higher accuracy in soil moisture representation exhibited by the ncar ensemble despite the higher uncertainty underestimation of the precipitation when compared to the gfs analysis over wetter areas southeast conus and the northwest coast the overall overestimation of soil moisture from the gfs might be attributed to a combination of the overestimation of precipitation and the lower shortwave radiation and thus lower evapotranspiration compared to the other two datasets we also noticed a time lag of around three months between the ncar ensemble and gfs and the reference data nldas 2 at the deepest soil layer the higher persistence of soil moisture at the deepest layer of the nldas 2 dataset is likely related to its larger maximum active water holding capacity as pointed out by xia et al 2014 a large maximum active water holding capacity may lead to longer soil moisture persistence therefore the soil moisture simulation is not only affected by the uncertainty in meteorological forcing but also by soil properties in terms of soil temperature overall as expected the ability of the three modeling systems to simulate the soil temperature is affected by their soil moisture representation because in the noah lsm heat capacity is a function of soil moisture and soil porosity and thermal conductivity is a function of soil moisture chen and dudhia 2001 therefore soil moisture affects the soil temperature and the time lag noticed in the deepest layer is due to the time lag noticed between the nldas and the other two datasets in the soil moisture estimates previous studies godfrey and stensrud 2008 have pointed out that a soil moisture error of 0 1 m3 m3 may lead to an error of more than 1 6 k for maximum or minimum daily soil temperature furthermore the small differences among the datasets at the first soil layer despite the higher soil moisture variability might be attributed to the atmospheric temperature da performed in all three forcing datasets air temperature is highly correlated with soil temperature because both are determined by the energy balance at the ground surface lastly based on the spread characteristics sd among the 10 ensemble members continuously cycling enkfs similar to the ncar ensemble can probably successfully assimilate soil moisture and temperature observations xia et al 2013 and xia et al 2015 found that the difference between the nldas 2 noah lsm soil moisture and temperature estimates and in situ observations across the conus did not exceed 0 056 m3 m3 and 5 k respectively so if we consider the observation error as the difference between nldas 2 noah and in situ observations truth the spread among the ensemble members e g figs 13 and 14 is similar to the typical observation error in some areas thus forecast error statistics i e ensemble spread from the ncar ensemble could properly adjust the ensemble toward soil state observations during enkf da e g houtekamer and mitchell 1998 in some regions of the study area additionally for the areas with small spread among the ensemble members there are several approaches to increase land surface spread in a cycling enkf which have been used for soil moisture da including random gaussian noise e g kumar et al 2012 or adding synthetic model error fields to state variables related to soil moisture and generating spatially uncorrelated errors reichle and koster 2005 these techniques could potentially be applied to the ncar ensemble to increase its sd for purposes of soil moisture and temperature da and as long as enkf spread is sufficient assimilation of soil moisture and temperature observations in situ and remotely sensed measurements would likely improve performance of continuously cycling enkfs like the ncar ensemble as evidenced by several previous studies that used enkfs to assimilate soil moisture e g pan and wood 2006 reichle and koster 2005 reichle et al 2008 reichle 2008 kumar et al 2009 liu et al 2010 yin et al 2014 lievens et al 2015 blankenship et al 2018 and temperature e g reichle et al 2010 that collectively found improvements in soil moisture surface fluxes evapotranspiration runoff simulations and soil temperature findings from this study provide information on the strengths and limitations of a limited area continuously cycling da system in representing the soil moisture and temperature spatio temporal variability across the conus this improved understanding of soil state modeling uncertainty characterization

4314,evapotranspiration links land surface hydrological processes with the atmosphere and has an important influence on regional water cycles and the water balance research has shown that urbanization can impact the hydrological balance leading to urban wet and dry island effects however the mechanisms driving these phenomena remain uncertain in this study the humidity levels of urban areas in china were compared with the surrounding areas prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization to determine the drivers and mechanisms of urban wet and dry island effects monthly observational datasets of temperature water vapor pressure and relative humidity from 613 meteorological stations were combined with the processes of urban artificial water dissipation to analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of urban dry wet islands results showed that cold and dry urban areas tended to have wet island effects while warm and humid urban areas had dry island effects the dry wet island intensity was less than 3 5 in most cities furthermore urban areas tended to be dry islands during summer and wet islands during winter coastal cities were an exception being dry islands throughout the year comparisons of humidity prior to and following rapid urbanization revealed that absolute humidity had generally increased during winter all regions displayed increased absolute humidity by as much as 8 16 in northern china this was despite an overall trend towards increased dry island intensity and was attributed to intensifying urban heat island effects these results provide valuable information to help understand the causes of dry wet island effects in urban areas keywords urban dry island urban wet island absolute humidity urbanization china artificial water dissipation 1 introduction air humidity is an important indicator of climate change that can also lead to global warming and recent studies have shown that humidity in urban areas is heavily influenced by the degree of urbanization willett et al 2007 more than 50 of the world s population currently live in urban areas schiller et al 2020 and this number is certain to increase urbanization changes the natural underlying surface by transforming permeable bare soil grassland and woodland into impervious hard ground and buildings gao et al 2020 lin et al 2019 urban areas are responsible for climate impacts including heat yang et al 2020 huang et al 2006 rain island effects and urban flooding yang et al 2019 richards and edwards 2018 dry and wet island phenomena have also been detected in urban areas alekseeva et al 2019 and research is required to understand their impact on the natural ecological environment vegetation restoration atmospheric visibility industrial and agricultural production and people s livelihoods in urban areas hao et al 2018 in the context of climate change bosilovich et al 2005 urban heat and rain island impacts have been studied extensively however systematic studies regarding dry and wet island effects are rare liu et al 2014 qiu et al 2013 based on hourly humidity datasets from meteorological stations in the united states brown and degaetano analyzed trends of surface humidity from 1930 to 2010 they found that absolute humidity generally increased while changes to relative humidity differed in urban areas and suburbs brown and degaetano 2013 the impact of urban dry wet islands has been investigated in china however most of these studies have focused on typical urban and northern arid areas and few studies have considered dry wet island conditions at a national scale zhou et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b investigated urban evapotranspiration using indoor and outdoor monitoring experiments and concluded that urban areas were characterized by high artificial water dissipation urban water dissipation refers to the evapotranspiration of underlying surface such as hardened ground soil vegetation water surface etc as well as the water dissipation in the process of water conveyance and dissipation by human beings zhou et al 2019b the city is a typical natural society dual water cycle area zhou et al 2020 the natural side water dissipation mainly refers to the evaporation of soil vegetation water surface and other natural underlying surfaces the social side water dissipation mainly refers to various forms of water vapor dissipation in human water use activities due to the high density of buildings and human activity zhou et al 2018 artificial water dissipation in urban areas is much higher compared to evapotranspiration in suburbs and from natural underlying surfaces consequently the anthropogenic water flux in cities cannot be ignored in wet and dry climate zones especially in urbanized areas the mechanisms through which climate change impacts urban dry wet islands are uncertain in this study we address this uncertainty and explore the factors influencing urban wet dry islands in china to achieve this we analyze two time periods prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization observational data were collected throughout china including monthly meteorological datasets of temperature water vapor pressure and relative humidity from 613 meteorological stations relative and absolute humidity were calculated and the data were combined with urban artificial water dissipation to systematically analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of dry wet island effects in urban areas and the factors driving these changes an understanding of the factors driving urban dry and wet climate variations in the context of a warming climate can aid urban planning and climate change adaptation 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources and classification meteorological data from two time periods prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization were collected from 613 meteorological stations throughout china as shown in fig 1 a meteorological data was derived from the monthly datasets of chinese surface climate data in the china meteorological data service center url http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html following quality control and inspection using matlab the datasets were found to be generally complete and of good quality missing temperature and water vapor pressure data were improved using linear regression methods and missing relative humidity data was calculated from these variables hu et al 2017 absolute humidity was calculated from monthly average air temperature and water vapor pressure and dry wet island effects were analyzed by combining the relative humidity datasets meteorological stations located in prefecture level cities municipal districts and county level cities areas with high urbanization rates were considered to be urban stations and those located in counties autonomous counties and towns areas with low urbanization rates were considered to be suburban stations these classifications are summarized in table 1 urbanization rate is a measure of urbanization generally using demographic indicators that is the proportion of urban population in the total population including agricultural and non agricultural for example the average urbanization rate of urban meteorological stations wanzhou and shapingba in chongqing was 80 3 and the average urbanization rate of the surrounding suburban meteorological stations fengjie and youyang was 38 0 by comparing humidity data from meteorological stations in urban and the surrounding suburban areas the dry wet island tendency of each urban area was established data from all the urban areas in a province were then used to determine the dry wet island tendency of each province compared with other regions the urbanization rate is slower in northwestern china such as the xizang xinjiang and gansu provinces 2 2 research methods and data processing 2 2 1 calculation of absolute humidity absolute humidity is the quantity of water vapor per unit of volume and reflects the actual water vapor content in the air jiang et al 2015 the amount of water vapor is directly dependent on surface evaporation referred to as urban water dissipation urban water dissipation includes both natural vegetation transpiration and evaporation and artificial irrigation practices and sprinkler operation water dissipation zhou et al 2018 2019a 2019b urban artificial water dissipation has a considerable impact on humidity according to the relationship between water vapor pressure and temperature the absolute humidity is calculated as follows ρ vap m vap v p vap r vap t where ρvap is the absolute humidity g m3 mvap is the mass of dissolved water in the air g v is the air volume m3 pvap is the water vapor pressure pa rvap is the gas constant of water vapor rvap 461 5 j kg k and t is temperature k absolute humidity is influenced by temperature and the water consumed in the local area and can be used to quantify the actual amount of water vapor in the air by comparing the absolute humidity before and after urbanization we assume that the differences reveal changes in urban artificial water dissipation 2 2 2 calculation of relative humidity to explain the degree of dry or humid air chen et al 2020 relative humidity differences between urban and the surrounding suburban stations were used to illustrate the dry wet island strength index relative humidity is the ratio of absolute humidity to the absolute humidity of saturated air at the same temperature calculated as follows φ t p vap p s 100 where ps is the saturated vapor pressure pa and φt is the relative humidity at temperature t the difference between the relative humidity of urban areas and their surrounding suburbs was used to analyze dry wet island effects if urban relative humidity was lower higher than suburban relative humidity it was referred to as a dry wet island effect the monthly average absolute humidity of each meteorological station was calculated and missing data was supplemented according to the methods described in section 2 1 then the average values of absolute and relative humidity at different time scales were calculated and the average values of the urban and surrounding suburban stations were obtained in each province spring was from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november and winter from december to february 2 3 mechanisms of urban water dissipation fig 1 b and c show the different types of water dissipation in urban areas blue arrows represent natural water dissipation nwd and red arrows artificial water dissipation awd awdtot is the total amount of artificial water dissipation and nwdtot the total amount of natural water dissipation awdurb is the amount of artificial water dissipation in urban areas including artificial water use in buildings roofs residential indoor sprinkler evaporation on hardened ground pervious impervious and irrigation water for soil and vegetation nwdurb is the amount of natural water dissipation in urban areas including soil water evaporation water surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration with rapid urbanization the amount and proportion of urban artificial water dissipation are also increasing under the action of solar radiation various forms of water in natural and human water dissipation are transformed from liquid to gas into the air participate in the urban hydrological cycle process increase the latent heat and have a direct impact on the water balance of urban areas 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatial distribution of dry wet island intensity cities were classified according to their average relative humidity as arid and semi arid 60 semi humid 60 70 and humid 70 to show the classification results more clearly the monthly average relative humidity of the 302 urban stations were statistically analyzed from 2010 to 2019 and the average values of the urban stations in each province were used to represent the overall relative humidity of cities in that province as shown in fig 2 a all the meteorological stations 302 urban and 311 suburban stations were then used to weight the average monthly relative humidity of urban areas from 2010 to 2019 to obtain the spatial distribution of dry wet island intensity by province as shown in fig 2 b differences in average relative humidity between urban areas and the surrounding suburbs were used to represent the intensity distribution of dry wet islands throughout china fig 2 a shows that arid and semi arid cities were mainly distributed in western and northern china semi humid cities were mainly distributed in the northeast and humid cities were mainly distributed in the south and southeast shen et al 2020 dry wet island effects were mostly distributed in humid cities in eastern and southern china at low and middle latitudes exceptional dry island phenomenon occurred in the northwest including the xinjiang and qinghai provinces wet islands were mostly distributed in arid semi arid and semi humid cities in northern northeast and southwest china at middle and high latitudes fig 2 b according to our calculation formula the intensity of the dry wet island effect was less than 3 5 in most cities cold and dry cities are prone to wet island effects while warm and humid neighboring cities are prone to dry island effects essentially dry wet island effects reflect the relative intensity of urban and suburban water vapor sources urban and suburban water dissipation relative humidity depends on both water content and temperature in arid semi arid and semi humid cities with low relative humidity moisture will be increased due to artificial water dissipation zhou et al 2019b furthermore the intensity of the urban heat island effect is lower in arid cities therefore most arid semi arid and semi humid cities appear to be wet islands with the water vapor content predominating although urban artificial water dissipation will produce more vapor compared to suburban areas the absolute humidity of saturated humid air will also increase due to higher temperatures in urban areas hence humid cities tend to be dry islands hao et al 2018 with temperature heat island effect being the predominant driver 3 2 seasonal characteristics of dry wet island effects fig 3 shows that the spatial distribution of dry wet islands during summer and winter varies markedly table 2 shows the intensity of urban dry and wet islands during summer and winter by province in summer three quarters of the cities tend to be dry islands because urban areas are mainly composed of buildings and hardened ground zhou et al 2018 they have high heat capacity and heat conduction during summer urban surfaces absorb and store more solar radiation under the same wind speeds strong mechanical turbulence and heat island effects will promote the rise of water vapor forming a dry island during winter dry wet islands tend to form during the day night resulting in an overall wet island phenomenon because there are fewer daylight hours both urban areas and the surrounding suburbs are relatively short of water and have few sources of water vapor due to artificial water dissipation in urban areas evapotranspiration is higher than that in surrounding suburbs leading to a higher water content furthermore higher temperatures in urban areas melts the snow and the evaporation of snow melt increases the water vapor pressure compared to the surrounding suburbs favoring the formation of wet islands ackerman 1987 hage 1975 with the water vapor content predominating coastal cities tend to display dry island effects over winter one reason for this is that the overall humidity of coastal cities is higher the average relative humidity of urban areas and the surrounding suburban air in coastal regions is above 70 consequently water vapor produced by urban artificial water dissipation accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total water vapor zhou et al 2020 conversely population density and industrial intensity is higher in chinese coastal cities and air pollution is intensified high rise buildings will make air pollutants unsuitable for diffusion leading to increased surface temperatures intensification of the urban heat island effect and a subsequent dry island effect in winter with temperature being the predominant driver 3 3 characteristics of dry wet island effects before and after urbanization fig 4 a shows changes in urban relative humidity prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization generally relative humidity in urban areas has decreased however the extent of this decline varies markedly relative humidity in the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing showed the largest decline 5 representing an increase in the intensity of the dry island effect inland cities showed a moderate decline in relative humidity while coastal cities and the northwest region which characterized by a slower rate of urbanization had the smallest decline 2 5 because urban areas are predominantly impervious surfaces rainwater tends to be lost quickly through drainage infrastructure consequently the ground in urban areas is relatively dry furthermore vegetation cover tends to be low leading to less natural evaporation in the surrounding suburbs surfaces tend to hold more moisture and vegetation covers a larger area leading to more water vapor near the surface coupled with the impact of large scale urbanization urban heat island intensity is increasing throughout china higher temperatures mean that the air can hold more water further decreasing the relative humidity therefore dry island intensity due to urbanization continues to increase fig 4 b shows changes in urban absolute humidity prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization except for the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing and the ningxia province absolute humidity has generally increased with urbanization despite increases in dry island intensity heilongjiang province has the highest increase in absolute humidity 8 98 following large scale urbanization water vapor in urban areas has increased although natural evaporation has decreased in urban areas due to vegetation loss the water vapor generated by artificial water dissipation has increased these artificial water sources include humans themselves industrial cooling towers and sprinkler operation water vapor pressure in the urban near surface air layer has increased over time the result shows that when urbanization reaches a certain intensity the total water dissipation will exceed the evapotranspiration intensity of the original natural state 3 4 seasonal characteristics of absolute humidity before and after urbanization to evaluate seasonal changes in artificial water dissipation following rapid urbanization changes in absolute humidity during summer and winter were compared in fig 5 a and b respectively during summer absolute humidity in the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing and the ningxia province decreased by more than 3 while the remaining provinces showed small decreases or marked increases during winter all regions displayed increased absolute humidity by as much as 8 16 in northern china absolute humidity is impacted by the combined effects of vegetation transpiration and artificial water dissipation natural water dissipation vegetation transpiration plays an important role in highly urbanized areas during summer while the impact of artificial water dissipation is relatively small in summer the overall temperature of highly urbanized areas has increased over time and absolute humidity is mainly controlled by temperature in urban areas with higher temperatures transpiration increases and exceeds artificial water dissipation therefore natural water dissipation vegetation transpiration plays an important role in highly urbanized areas during summer while the impact of artificial water dissipation is relatively small during winter both temperature and precipitation are lower in urban areas transpiration is reduced and the absolute humidity is mainly controlled by water availability due to urbanization water vapor from artificial water dissipation has increased over time however compared to transpiration urban artificial water dissipation shows less seasonality and becomes more apparent during winter increasing the absolute humidity in urban areas 4 discussion some arid areas of china including the xinjiang qinghai and ningxia provinces showed urban dry island phenomena which were contrary to the main findings in this study hence urban and suburban stations in these regions were analyzed in more detail xinjiang province has more than 570 rivers and some suburban meteorological stations are located beside these rivers e g the haba fuhai and jinghe rivers leading to increased relative humidity 60 in suburban compared to urban areas the average relative humidity of suburban stations not located near rivers was 47 1 which was lower than in urban areas 48 3 consequently we attribute dry island effects in xinjiang province to the riverside locations of some meteorological stations in surrounding suburbs golmud city in qinghai province has a plateau interior basin climate characterized by aridity low rainfall high sunshine hours and strong evaporation in the past ten years the city s annual average rainfall was 55 mm there were 2904 sunshine hours and evaporation was 2173 mm monthly average relative humidity was 32 2 in golmud city compared to 55 7 in other cities moreover there were only five urban and 23 suburban stations in qinghai province so the relative humidity of urban stations was easily skewed by the extreme values from golmud city and our statistical results indicated a dry island effect if golmud city and its surrounding suburban stations were exploded from the analysis qinghai province shows a wet island effect ningxia province has a temperate continental climate with a large latitude span consequently rainfall in the province is greater less in the south north the north of the province is largely arid while the south is semi humid in the north shizuishan and yinchuan cities have long sunshine hours throughout the year and a monthly average relative humidity of 46 there are only four urban stations in the province so the relative humidity of urban stations was easily impacted by extreme values furthermore most suburban stations were located in middle and southern areas therefore we attribute the dry island effect in this province to the distribution of the limited urban stations in the province based on the ecological hydrological process hao et al 2018 analyzed dry island effects in the southern humid regions of china and found that in conjunction with rapid urbanization the heat island effect and vapor pressure deficit were increasing causing a decline in relative humidity willett et al 2007 analyzed monthly global surface humidity data from 1973 to 2003 and found that urbanization and human activities increased water vapor absolute humidity furthermore zhou et al 2020 analyzed the obvious seasonal differences in the water dissipation intensity of urban and built up land the natural side water dissipation taking the main part in summer and the social side water dissipation in winter the results of our study are consistent with those of hao et al 2018 willett et al 2007 and zhou et al 2020 providing evidence to support our findings with respect to dry wet island effects and artificial water dissipation 5 conclusion in this study a set of criteria to characterize dry wet islands at a national scale was proposed we combined these data with urban artificial water dissipation to compare temporal and spatial changes in absolute and relative humidity before and after large scale urbanization our conclusions are as follows 1 in arid to semi arid cities artificial water dissipation produces evaporation in urban areas which in turn increases humidity however urban heat island intensity tends to be lower so arid cities usually display wet island effects conversely humid cities have more water apour and a more intense urban heat island so humid cities usually display dry island effects the dry wet island intensity was less than 3 5 in most cities 2 heat island effects during summer increase the dynamic and thermal turbulence in urban areas compared to the surrounding suburbs furthermore there is less natural water storage e g soil aquifers in urban areas consequently cities are prone to dry island effects during summer higher winter temperatures in urban areas during winter can lead to snow water evaporation resulting in rapid increases in water content there is also more artificial water apour in urban areas so wet island intensity tends to be relatively high during winter 3 the intensification of urbanization has increased urban temperatures over time which has in turn increased dry island intensity furthermore increased artificial water dissipation has increased the apour pressure in the near surface air in urban areas heilongjiang province has the highest increase in absolute humidity 8 98 4 absolute humidity is influenced by the combined effects of vegetation transpiration and artificial water dissipation during summer vegetation transpiration played an important role in the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing and in the ningxia province conversely transpiration is low during winter and artificial water dissipation predominates throughout urban china all regions displayed increased absolute humidity by as much as 8 16 in northern china the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of dry wet island effects were obtained by analyzing data from meteorological stations throughout china in the future research should incorporate regional climate models to quantify the enhancement of absolute humidity by urban artificial water dissipation in different climate zones facilitating a more comprehensive evaluation with respect to the hydrological effects of urbanization credit authorship contribution statement zhuoran luo methodology data

4314,evapotranspiration links land surface hydrological processes with the atmosphere and has an important influence on regional water cycles and the water balance research has shown that urbanization can impact the hydrological balance leading to urban wet and dry island effects however the mechanisms driving these phenomena remain uncertain in this study the humidity levels of urban areas in china were compared with the surrounding areas prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization to determine the drivers and mechanisms of urban wet and dry island effects monthly

however systematic studies regarding dry and wet island effects are rare liu et al 2014 qiu et al 2013 based on hourly humidity datasets from meteorological stations in the united states brown and degaetano analyzed trends of surface humidity from 1930 to 2010 they found that absolute humidity generally increased while changes to relative humidity differed in urban areas and suburbs brown and degaetano 2013 the impact of urban dry wet islands has been investigated in china however most of these studies have focused on typical urban and northern arid areas and few studies have considered dry wet island conditions at a national scale zhou et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b investigated urban evapotranspiration using indoor and outdoor monitoring experiments and concluded that urban areas were characterized by high artificial water dissipation urban water dissipation refers to the evapotranspiration of underlying surface such as hardened ground soil vegetation water surface etc as well as the water dissipation in the process of water conveyance and dissipation by human beings zhou et al 2019b the city is a typical natural society dual water cycle area zhou et al 2020 the natural side water dissipation mainly refers to the evaporation of soil vegetation water surface and other natural underlying surfaces the social side water dissipation mainly refers to various forms of water vapor dissipation in human water use activities due to the high density of buildings and human activity zhou et al 2018 artificial water dissipation in urban areas is much higher compared to evapotranspiration in suburbs and from natural underlying surfaces consequently the anthropogenic water flux in cities cannot be ignored in wet and dry climate zones especially in urbanized areas the mechanisms through which climate change impacts urban dry wet islands are uncertain in this study we address this uncertainty and explore the factors influencing urban wet dry islands in china to achieve this we analyze two time periods prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization observational data were collected throughout china including monthly meteorological datasets of temperature water vapor pressure and relative humidity from 613 meteorological stations relative and absolute humidity were calculated and the data were combined with urban artificial water dissipation to systematically analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of dry wet island effects in urban areas and the factors driving these changes an understanding of the factors driving urban

from two time periods prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization were collected from 613 meteorological stations throughout china as shown in fig 1 a meteorological data was derived from the monthly datasets of chinese surface climate data in the china meteorological data service center url http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html following quality control and inspection using matlab the datasets were found to be generally complete and of good quality missing temperature and water vapor pressure data were improved using linear regression methods and missing relative humidity data was calculated from these variables hu et al 2017 absolute humidity was calculated from monthly average air temperature and water vapor pressure and dry wet island effects were analyzed by combining the relative humidity datasets meteorological stations located in prefecture level cities municipal districts and county level cities areas with high urbanization rates were considered to be urban stations and those located in counties autonomous counties and towns areas with low urbanization rates were considered to be suburban stations these classifications are summarized in table 1 urbanization rate is a measure of urbanization generally using demographic indicators that is the proportion of urban population in the total population including agricultural and non agricultural for example the average urbanization rate of urban meteorological stations wanzhou and shapingba in chongqing was 80 3 and the average urbanization rate of the surrounding suburban meteorological stations fengjie and youyang was 38 0 by comparing humidity data from meteorological stations in urban and the surrounding suburban areas the dry wet island tendency of each urban area was established data from all the urban areas in a province were then used to determine the dry wet island tendency of each province compared with other regions the urbanization rate is slower in northwestern china such as the xizang xinjiang and gansu provinces 2 2 research methods and data processing 2 2 1 calculation of absolute humidity absolute humidity is the quantity of water vapor per unit of volume and reflects the actual water vapor content in the air jiang et al 2015 the amount of water vapor is directly dependent on surface evaporation referred to as urban water dissipation urban water dissipation includes both natural vegetation transpiration and evaporation and artificial irrigation practices and sprinkler operation water dissipation zhou et al 2018 2019a 2019b urban artificial water dissipation has a considerable impact on humidity according to the relationship between water vapor pressure and temperature the absolute humidity is calculated as follows ρ vap m vap v p vap r vap t where ρvap is the absolute humidity g m3 mvap is the mass of dissolved water in the air g v is the air volume m3 pvap is the water vapor pressure pa rvap is the gas constant of water vapor rvap 461 5 j kg k and t is temperature k absolute humidity is influenced by temperature and the water consumed in the local area and can be used to quantify the actual amount of water vapor in the air by comparing the absolute humidity before and after urbanization we assume that the differences reveal changes in urban artificial water dissipation 2 2 2 calculation of relative humidity to explain the degree of dry or humid air chen et al 2020 relative humidity differences between urban and the surrounding suburban stations were used to illustrate the dry wet island strength index relative humidity is the ratio of absolute humidity to the absolute humidity of saturated air at the same temperature calculated as follows φ t p vap p s 100 where ps is the saturated vapor pressure pa and φt is the relative humidity at temperature t the difference between the relative humidity of urban areas and their surrounding suburbs was used to analyze dry wet island effects if urban relative humidity was lower higher than suburban relative humidity it was referred to as a dry wet island effect the monthly average absolute humidity of each meteorological station was calculated and missing data was supplemented according to the methods described in section 2 1 then the average values of absolute and relative humidity at different time scales were calculated and the average values of the urban and surrounding suburban stations were obtained in each province spring was from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november and winter from december to february 2 3 mechanisms of urban water dissipation fig 1 b and c show the different types of water dissipation in urban areas blue arrows represent natural water

the amount and proportion of urban artificial water dissipation are also increasing under the action of solar radiation various forms of water in natural and human water dissipation are transformed

spatial distribution of dry wet island intensity cities were classified according to their average relative humidity as arid and semi arid 60 semi humid 60 70 and humid 70 to show the classification results more clearly the monthly average relative humidity of the 302 urban stations were statistically analyzed from 2010 to 2019 and the average values of the urban stations in each province were used to represent the overall relative humidity of cities in that province as shown in fig 2 a all the meteorological stations 302 urban and 311 suburban stations were then used to weight the average monthly relative humidity of urban areas from 2010 to 2019 to obtain the spatial distribution of dry wet island intensity by province as shown in fig 2 b differences in average relative humidity between urban areas and the surrounding suburbs were used to represent the intensity distribution of dry wet islands throughout china fig 2 a shows that arid and semi arid cities were mainly distributed in western and northern china semi humid cities were mainly distributed in the northeast and humid cities were mainly distributed in the south and southeast shen et al 2020 dry wet island effects were mostly distributed in humid cities in eastern and southern china at low and middle latitudes exceptional dry island phenomenon occurred in the northwest including the xinjiang and qinghai provinces wet islands were mostly distributed in arid semi arid and semi humid cities in northern northeast and southwest china at middle and high latitudes fig 2 b according to our calculation formula the intensity of the dry wet island effect was less than 3 5 in most cities cold and dry cities are prone to wet island effects while warm and humid neighboring cities are prone to dry island effects essentially dry wet island effects reflect the relative intensity of urban and suburban water vapor sources urban and suburban water dissipation relative humidity depends on both water content and temperature in arid semi arid and semi humid cities with low relative humidity moisture will be increased due to artificial water dissipation zhou et al 2019b furthermore the intensity of the urban heat island effect is lower in arid cities therefore most arid semi arid and semi humid cities appear to be wet islands with the water vapor content predominating although urban artificial water dissipation will produce more vapor compared to suburban areas the absolute humidity of saturated humid air will also increase due to higher temperatures in urban areas hence humid cities tend to be dry islands hao et al 2018 with temperature heat island effect being the predominant driver 3 2 seasonal characteristics of dry wet island effects fig 3 shows that the spatial distribution of dry wet islands during summer and winter varies markedly table 2 shows the intensity of urban dry and wet islands during summer and winter by province in summer three quarters of the cities tend to be dry islands because urban areas are mainly composed of buildings and hardened ground zhou et al 2018 they have high heat capacity and heat conduction during summer urban surfaces absorb and store more solar radiation under the same wind speeds strong mechanical turbulence and heat island effects will promote the rise of water vapor forming a dry island during winter dry wet islands tend to form during the day night resulting in an overall wet island phenomenon because there are fewer daylight hours both urban areas and the surrounding suburbs are relatively short of water and have few sources of water vapor due to artificial water dissipation in urban areas evapotranspiration is higher than that in surrounding suburbs leading to a higher water content furthermore higher temperatures in urban areas melts the snow and the evaporation of snow melt increases the water vapor pressure compared to the surrounding suburbs favoring the formation of wet islands ackerman 1987 hage 1975 with the water vapor content predominating coastal cities tend to display dry island effects over winter one reason for this is that the overall humidity of coastal cities is higher the average relative humidity of urban areas and the surrounding suburban air in coastal regions is above 70 consequently water vapor produced by urban artificial water dissipation accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total water vapor zhou et al 2020 conversely population density and industrial intensity is higher in chinese coastal cities and air pollution is intensified high rise buildings will make air pollutants unsuitable for diffusion leading to increased surface temperatures intensification of the urban heat island effect and a subsequent dry island effect in winter with temperature being the predominant driver 3 3 characteristics of dry wet island effects before and after urbanization fig 4 a shows changes in urban relative humidity prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization generally relative humidity in urban areas has decreased however the extent of this decline varies markedly relative humidity in the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing showed the largest decline 5 representing an increase in the intensity of the dry island effect inland cities showed a moderate decline in relative humidity while coastal cities and the northwest region which characterized by a slower rate of urbanization had the smallest decline 2 5 because urban areas are predominantly impervious surfaces rainwater tends to be lost quickly through drainage infrastructure consequently the ground in urban areas is relatively dry furthermore vegetation cover tends to be low leading to less natural evaporation in the surrounding suburbs surfaces tend to hold more moisture and vegetation covers a larger area leading to more water vapor near the surface coupled with the impact of large scale urbanization urban heat island intensity is increasing throughout china higher temperatures mean that the air can hold more water further decreasing the relative humidity therefore dry island intensity due to urbanization continues to increase fig 4 b shows changes in urban absolute humidity prior to 1960 1969 and following 2010 2019 rapid urbanization except for the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing and the ningxia province absolute humidity has generally increased with urbanization despite increases in dry island intensity heilongjiang province has the highest increase in absolute humidity 8 98 following large scale urbanization water vapor in urban areas has increased although natural evaporation has decreased in urban areas due to vegetation loss the water vapor generated by artificial water dissipation has increased these artificial water sources include humans themselves industrial cooling towers and sprinkler operation water vapor pressure in the urban near surface air layer has increased over time the result shows that when urbanization reaches a certain intensity the total water dissipation will exceed the evapotranspiration intensity of the original natural state 3 4 seasonal characteristics of absolute humidity before and after urbanization to evaluate seasonal changes in artificial water dissipation following rapid urbanization changes in absolute humidity during summer and winter were compared in fig 5 a and b respectively during summer absolute humidity in the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing and the ningxia province decreased by more than 3 while the remaining provinces showed small decreases or marked increases during winter all regions displayed increased absolute humidity by as much as 8 16 in northern china absolute humidity is impacted by the combined effects of vegetation transpiration and artificial water dissipation natural water dissipation vegetation transpiration plays an important role in highly urbanized areas during summer while the impact of artificial water dissipation is relatively small in summer the overall temperature of highly urbanized areas has increased over time and absolute humidity is mainly controlled by temperature in urban areas with higher temperatures transpiration increases and exceeds artificial water dissipation therefore natural water dissipation vegetation transpiration plays an important role in highly urbanized areas during summer while the impact of artificial water dissipation is relatively small during winter both temperature and precipitation are lower in urban areas transpiration is reduced and the absolute humidity is mainly controlled by water availability due to urbanization water vapor from artificial water dissipation has increased over time however compared to transpiration urban artificial water dissipation shows less seasonality and becomes more apparent during winter increasing the absolute humidity in urban areas 4 discussion some arid areas of china including the xinjiang qinghai and ningxia provinces showed urban dry island phenomena which were contrary to the main findings in this study hence urban and suburban stations in these regions were analyzed in more detail xinjiang province has more than 570 rivers and some suburban meteorological stations are located beside these rivers e g the haba fuhai and jinghe rivers leading to increased relative humidity 60 in suburban compared to urban areas the average relative humidity of suburban stations not located near rivers was 47 1 which was lower than in urban areas 48 3 consequently we attribute dry island effects in xinjiang province to the riverside locations of some meteorological stations in surrounding suburbs golmud city in qinghai province has a plateau interior basin climate characterized by aridity low rainfall high sunshine hours and strong evaporation in the past ten years the city s annual average rainfall was 55 mm there were 2904 sunshine hours and evaporation was 2173 mm monthly average relative humidity was 32 2 in golmud city compared to 55 7 in other cities moreover there were only five urban and 23 suburban stations in qinghai province so the relative humidity of urban stations was easily skewed by the extreme values from golmud city and our statistical results indicated a dry island effect if golmud city and its surrounding suburban stations were exploded from the analysis qinghai province shows a wet island effect ningxia province has a temperate continental climate with a large latitude span consequently rainfall in the province is greater less in the south north the north of the province is largely arid while the south is semi humid in the north shizuishan and yinchuan cities have long sunshine hours throughout the year and a monthly average relative humidity of 46 there are only four urban stations in the province so the relative humidity of urban stations was easily impacted by extreme values furthermore most suburban stations were located in middle and southern areas therefore we attribute the dry island effect in this province to the distribution of the limited urban stations in the province based on the ecological hydrological process hao et al 2018 analyzed dry island effects in the southern humid regions of china and found that in conjunction with rapid urbanization the heat island effect and vapor pressure deficit were increasing causing a decline in relative humidity willett et al 2007 analyzed monthly global surface humidity data from 1973 to 2003 and found that urbanization and human activities increased water vapor absolute humidity furthermore zhou et al 2020 analyzed the obvious seasonal differences in the water dissipation intensity of urban and built up land the natural side water dissipation taking the main part in summer and the social side water dissipation in winter the results of our study are consistent with those of hao et al 2018 willett et al 2007 and zhou et al 2020 providing evidence to support our findings with respect to dry wet island effects and artificial water dissipation 5 conclusion in this study a set of criteria to characterize dry wet islands at a national scale was proposed we combined these data with urban artificial water dissipation to compare temporal and spatial changes in absolute and relative humidity before and after large scale urbanization our conclusions are as follows 1 in arid to semi arid cities artificial water dissipation produces evaporation in urban areas which in turn increases humidity however urban heat island intensity tends to be lower so arid cities usually display wet island effects conversely humid cities have more water apour and a more intense urban heat island so humid cities usually display dry island effects the dry wet island intensity was less than 3 5 in most cities 2 heat island effects during summer increase the dynamic and thermal turbulence in urban areas compared to the surrounding suburbs furthermore there is less natural water storage e g soil aquifers in urban areas consequently cities are prone to dry island effects during summer higher winter temperatures in urban areas during winter can lead to snow water evaporation resulting in rapid increases in water content there is also more artificial water apour in urban areas so wet island intensity tends to be relatively high during winter 3 the intensification of urbanization has increased urban temperatures over time which has in turn increased dry island intensity furthermore increased artificial water dissipation has increased the apour pressure in the near surface air in urban areas heilongjiang province has the highest increase in absolute humidity 8 98 4 absolute humidity is influenced by the combined effects of vegetation transpiration and artificial water dissipation during summer vegetation transpiration played an important role in the municipalities of beijing shanghai tianjin and chongqing and in the ningxia province conversely transpiration is low during winter and artificial water dissipation predominates throughout urban china all regions displayed increased absolute humidity by as much as 8 16 in northern china the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of dry wet island effects were obtained by analyzing data from meteorological stations throughout china in the future research should incorporate regional climate models to quantify the enhancement of absolute humidity by urban artificial water dissipation in different climate zones facilitating a more comprehensive evaluation with respect to the hydrological effects of urbanization credit authorship contribution statement zhuoran luo methodology data
