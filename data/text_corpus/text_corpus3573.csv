17865,recovery of rare earth elements rees from industrial wastewater has drawn great attention due to their potential environmental toxicity as well as their high demand in modern technologies in this study we developed a magnetic composite based on the high surface area porous β cyclodextrin polymer p cdp namely p cdp fe 3 o 4 both p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 rapidly sequester rees such as nd gd eu and y reaching equilibrium in less than 10 min and fitting the langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacities ranging from 7 76 to 9 59 mg g at 25 c when the highest initial concentration was 100 mg l besides the recovery of these rees was not affected by competitive alkali alkaline earth and transition metal ions in model studies and industrial wastewater as revealed by the recovery efficiencies which ranged from 62 to 100 indicating an excellent selectivity on both adsorbents in addition both adsorbents can be fully regenerated under mildly acidic conditions for at least five consecutive cycles moreover p cdp fe 3 o 4 can be easily isolated by an external magnetic field which simplifies its synthesis and usability it also overcomes the clogging and high backpressure issues of p cdp which facilitates its application for rees recovery as compared with p cdp these characteristics demonstrate the promise of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 for the pollution control and recovery of rees graphical abstract image 1 keywords rare earth elements rees magnetic composite adsorption selectivity recovery 1 introduction rare earth elements rees have been progressively used in various industries including automobile electronics medicine cosmetics and renewable energy technologies wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in 2012 the department of energy in the usa issued a report considering rees as crucial elements in the clean energy economy u s department of energy 2011 china as a global leader of the rees market accounted for 88 of rees refined products in 2017 u s geological survey 2019 besides the economic impact relatively large quantities of rees resulting from their mining and production processes are wide spread in wastewater sludge surface water soils plants and animals this has raised concerns about the potential negative health effects and environmental toxicity of rees gwenzi et al 2018 nkinahamira et al 2019 and recently rees were reported as new emerging pollutants herrmann et al 2016 pagano et al 2016 therefore an efficient technology for the removal and recovery of rees is urgently needed solvent extraction chemical precipitation electrochemical separation coagulation and membrane filtration are the most commonly used methods for separation and enrichment of rees gok 2014 however these methods are not economical and the separated rees are not sufficiently recovered after treatment additionally some of these methods generate additional waste such as sludge and toxic solvents jha et al 2016 on the other hand the adsorption method is simple relatively more economical and especially effective to remove rees at environmental concentrations wang et al 2017 adsorbents from various categories including zeolites activated carbon clay and ordered mesoporous silica have been reported to remove rees from the aqueous environment qi et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 although some of these adsorbents show promising performance most have disadvantages including low adsorption capacity long equilibrium time and poor rees selectivity in complex matrices jha et al 2016 qiu et al 2016 the slow adsorption kinetics of rees is attributed to their large ionic radii and high coordination numbers which reduce their diffusion rates and limit their ability to access the active sites of the adsorbent wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 thus materials with high removal capacity fast adsorption kinetics and high selectivity toward rees are highly desired polymers of β cyclodextrin β cd an inexpensive sustainable macrocycle of glucose have been used as adsorbents for a variety of water purification applications alsbaiee et al 2016 morin crini and crini 2013 however the majority of the previously reported β cd polymers had low surface areas and exhibited very slow adsorption rates toward various classes of water contaminants morin crini and crini 2013 in 2016 alsbaiee et al reported the first permanently microporous high surface area β cd polymer named p cdp by crosslinking β cd with the rigid aromatic group tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile p cdp showed rapid removal of organic micropollutants pb ions and sulfides from water with high adsorption capacities and it can be easily regenerated at ambient temperature alsbaiee et al 2016 klemes et al 2018 li et al 2017 here we examined the ability of p cdp to remove rees from water using model and industrial wastewater matrices we also report the synthesis of a magnetic p cdp composite named herein p cdp fe 3 o 4 which can be easily isolated by an external magnetic field and it overcomes the clogging and high backpressure issues associated with the use of p cdp while maintaining p cdp s ability to recover rees alsbaiee et al 2016 alzate sanchez et al 2019 previous studies reported that the conjugation of magnetic nanomaterials with biopolymers such as cellulose chitosan alginate and cyclodextrin enable easy isolation of the conjugate from the medium by an external magnetic field which minimizes the loss of the adsorbent during wastewater treatment badruddoza et al 2013 reddy and lee 2013 su 2017 for instance the magnetic β cyclodextrin polymers which are synthesized in three steps could be easily regenerated while retaining good adsorption performance for organic pollutants and heavy metals in wastewater hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 p cdp fe 3 o 4 was fully characterized by various structural analysis techniques and its ability to remove rees from water was examined p cdp fe 3 o 4 and p cdp both exhibited fast adsorption and rapid recovery of rees their excellent selectivity for the recovery of rees from complex industrial wastewaters in the presence of alkali alkaline earth and transition metal competitors was also demonstrated in addition both adsorbents were fully regenerated multiple times by a simple washing procedure with dilute acidic solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and instrumentation

ch2cl2 for 15 min p cdp fe 3 o 4 particles were dried under high vacuum at 60 c for two days 2 3 batch adsorption experiments since the physical and chemical properties of rees are similar zhang et al 2016 nd and gd were selected as model elements to investigate rees adsorption on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 in general the adsorption experiments were conducted in an incubator shaker zhwy 2102c china 500 mg l stock solutions of nd and gd were prepared in milli q water using nd no3 3 6h2o and gd no3 3 6h2o respectively the working solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solutions to the desired concentration the ph values of the working solutions were adjusted using 0 1 mol l hno3 and naoh solutions after adsorption the mixtures were filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 the residual nd and gd concentrations were measured using icp oes the adsorption kinetic experiments were carried out at a dosage of 1 00 g l of adsorbent in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of 5 00 mg l nd or gd solutions at 25 c and the flasks are then shaken at 180 rpm the adsorption isotherm experiments were performed in 20 ml scintillation vials containing 10 0 mg of adsorbents and 10 0 ml of rees solutions of various concentrations and the vials were shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c the effect of ph on adsorption was studied by adding 1 00 g l of each adsorbent to 5 00 mg l solutions of nd or gd with initial ph ranging from 1 to 6 and the mixtures were then shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c for 24 h after adsorption the mixtures were filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 the

al 2017 2016 2 5 competitive adsorption experiments to study adsorption selectivity of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 toward rees competitive adsorption experiments were carried out in a 50 ml conical flask by mixing 20 0 mg of adsorbent with 10 0 ml solution containing y nd eu gd na ca mg ni and zn with initial concentrations of 5 00 mg l then shaking the mixture at 25 c for 24 h the mixtures were then filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 after determining the concentrations of the residual rees by icp oes the distribution coefficients k d ml g of the metal ions were calculated using eq 10 10 k d c o c f c f v m where c o and c f mg l are the initial and final concentration of the metal ion respectively and v and m are the volume of solution and adsorbent mass respectively 2 6 adsorbent reusability studies reusability studies were conducted using solid phase extraction spe method in which 2 5 ml empty spe cartridges were packed with 100 mg of p cdp or p cdp fe 3 o 4 and then connected to visiprep spe vacuum manifold supelco before loading the sample the cartridges were washed with milli q water 10 ml then 10 0 ml nd or gd 5 00 mg l ph 5 0 solutions were passed through the cartridges at a controlled flow rate of 0 5 ml min for p cdp and 3 ml min for p cdp fe 3 o 4 the filtrates were then collected and analyzed using icp oes to regenerate the adsorbent and recover the metal ions 0 5 m hno3 or 0 5 m hcl were passed through the cartridges at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min for p cdp and 3 ml min for p cdp fe 3 o 4 the residual nd or gd in the acidic filtrates were then analyzed by icp oes the above procedure was repeated five times the recovery efficiency of nd and gd was calculated using eq 11 wang et al 2017 11 recovery efficiency c d e s c o 100 where c des and c o mg l are the metals concentration before adsorption and after desorption respectively 2 7 adsorption studies with industrial wastewater a wastewater sample from a local rees processing industry was diluted 100 times to prepare a working wastewater solution and the ph of the working solution was adjusted to 5 0 using 1 mol l hno3 and naoh solutions 10 0 ml working solution was then mixed with 30 0 mg adsorbent in 50 ml conical flask and shaken for 20 min at 25 c the mixture was then filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 the solids were then washed one time with deionized water and then the adsorbed ions were eluted using 0 5 m hno3 the ions in the acidic filtrates were analyzed by icp ms to determine the concentration of the desorbed ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents 3 1 1 ft ir analysis ft ir spectra of β cd tfp p cdp fe3o4 and p cdp fe 3 o 4 are shown in fig 2 a for β cd and fe3o4 the intense and broad peak around 3419 cm 1 belongs to oh stretching vibrations nkinahamira et al 2017 and the bands at 1645 cm 1 and 1450 cm 1 are associated with the c c aromatic stretches the band at 2931 cm 1 in the spectra of β cd and tfp is assigned to the aliphatic c h stretches while the band at 1033 cm 1 in the spectrum of β cd corresponds to the c o stretch alsbaiee et al 2016 the bands at 2244 cm 1 and 1271 cm 1 in the spectra of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 belong to the c f and nitrile groups respectively the presence of the band at 594 cm 1 in the ir spectrum of p cdp fe 3 o 4 is attributed to the fe o bonds in the fe3o4 particles badruddoza et al 2013 3 1 2 thermal stability the tga analyses of the monomers and polymers are shown in fig 2b the tga curve of fe3o4 showed a weight loss of 3 44 over the full temperature range which can be attributed to the removal of physisorbed water and surface oh groups due to the oxidation of iron abdolmaleki et al 2015 p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 showed enhanced thermal stability as compared with tfp and β cd the initial weight drop of 3 95 and 4 40 for p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively occurred between 40 and 263 c which is attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed water nkinahamira et al 2017 the weight loss of 31 97 for p cdp and 23 09 for p cdp fe 3 o 4 that occurred between 263 and 383 c is attributed to the decomposition of tfp whereas the weight loss after 383 c in both materials is attributed to the degradation of β cd tsiepe et al 2018 the weight drop of 11 93 for p cdp fe 3 o 4 between 625 and 666 c which is absent in p cdp could be attributed to the oxidation of fe3o4 to fe2o3 which may further indicate the successful incorporation of the fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 abdolmaleki et al 2015 3 1 3 zeta potential the charge of a material s surface in solution is characterized by the isoelectric point iep or the point of zero charge pzc tran et al 2017 zeta potentials of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 are shown in fig 2c both materials have negative zeta potential values in acidic and basic solutions with pzc at ph 5 3 for p cdp and pzc at ph 4 1 for p cdp fe 3 o 4 which can be attributed to the presence of the phenolate groups in both materials as reported previously klemes et al 2018 the lower pzc of p cdp fe 3 o 4 as compared with p cdp might be due to its higher oxygen content faria et al 2004 as shown in fig s2 it should be pointed out that the negative zeta potentials of both adsorbents are advantageous for the adsorption of positively charged ree ions and it reduces the tendency of both materials to agglomerate in solution yirsaw et al 2016 3 1 4 magnetization measurements vsm was used to measure the magnetization values of fe3o4 and p cdp fe 3 o 4 at room temperature and the results are shown in fig 2d the hysteresis loops of fe3o4 and p cdp fe 3 o 4 indicate their ferromagnetic behavior with magnetic saturation of 66 and 16 emu g respectively the low magnetization value of p cdp fe 3 o 4 can be attributed to the existence of nonmagnetic material layer i e p cdp in the composite and the decrease of the weight percent of fe3o4 in the composite as compared with the neat fe3o4 qiu et al 2016 nevertheless p cdp fe 3 o 4 exhibited strong magnetic responsivity and can be separated easily from solution using an external magnet li et al 2006 3 1 5 porosity and surface area analyses porosity and surface area of the adsorbents and their corresponding monomers were investigated by asap nitrogen porosimetry analysis fe3o4 nanoparticles showed type iii isotherms with bet surface area of 73 m2 g pore volume of 0 240 cm3 g and pore size of 13 1 nm fig 3 a p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 exhibited type ii isotherms fig 3b and c characteristic of mesoporous materials as supported by the bjh pore size distribution curves fig 3d with an average pore size of 2 88 nm and 4 81 nm respectively notably the bet surface area of p cdp fe 3 o 4 was 85 m2 g as compared with a surface area of 143 m2 g for p cdp which can be attributed to the incorporation of the fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 nkinahamira et al 2017 3 1 6 morphology and elemental analysis sem images of fe3o4 fig 4 a revealed agglomerations of small spherical particles whereas the sem images of p cdp fig 4b showed irregular shape and size particles with rough surfaces indicative of the porous structure of p cdp the sem images of p cdp fe 3 o 4 fig 4c relatively resembled those of p cdp but seemed to have smaller particle size the average particle size measured using laser diffraction particle size analyzer was found to be 116 μm and 25 3 μm for p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively a further evidence of the presence of fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe3o4 is provided by the edx analysis fig 4d which indicated the presence of 29 8 wt fe 9 56 mol fe in the composition of p cdp fe3o4 edx data for β cd tfp p cdp and fe3o4 were given in fig s2 3 2 results of batch experiments 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on nd and gd adsorption by p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 was investigated at ph 2 6 for nd and 2 5 5 for gd as shown in fig 5 a and b the adsorption process was strongly dependent on solution ph in that the removal capacity of nd and gd increased with increasing ph from 2 to 5 5 since both adsorbents have negative zeta potentials fig 2c the low removal efficiency in the stronger acidic conditions can be attributed to the competition between h and the metal ions as was reported previously zhu et al 2011 therefore both nd and gd exhibited maximum removal efficiency in the ph range of 5 5 5 for instance the maximum removal efficiencies were 93 nd and 77 gd by p cdp and 94 nd and 72 gd by p cdp fe3o4 3 2 2 effects of contact time and adsorption kinetics fig 5c and d shows the adsorption of nd and gd on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 as a function of time in less than 5 min both adsorbents achieved 90 removal and nearly 100 adsorption after approximately 10 min this rapid removal of rees is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 which is consistent with previous studies that reported rapid adsorption of micropollutants on p cdp alsbaiee et al 2016 according to the kinetic parameters calculated using eqs 3 and 4 and shown in table s1 and fig s3 the adsorption of nd and gd fitted well the pseudo second order kinetic model with correlation coefficients r 2 greater than 0 998 similar to previously reported β cd polymers abdolmaleki et al 2015 alzate sanchez et al 2019 morin crini and crini 2013 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm and capacity adsorption isotherms of nd and gd are shown in fig 5 e and f the adsorption capacities of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 increased with the initial concentration of nd and gd then reached equilibrium the experimental isotherm data were fitted by langmuir and freundlich models according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively the parameters associated with langmuir and freundlich models are presented in table 1 based on the correlation coefficient value r 2 and the inset in fig 5 e and f the adsorption of nd and gd better fitted the langmuir model langmuir 1918 based on langmuir isotherm data in table 1 the maximum adsorption capacities of nd and gd on p cdp were 9 59 and 8 99 mg g respectively while the maximum adsorption capacities on p cdp fe 3 o 4 were 8 88 and 7 76 mg g respectively initial concentration ranging from 1 to 100 mg l the slightly lower adsorption capacity of p cdp fe 3 o 4 as compared with p cdp is attributed to the lower weight percentage of the β cd polymer in the composite since the adsorption fitted the langmuir model it is essential to calculate the separation factor r l which is a dimensionless constant that determines whether the adsorption is favorable r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 and can be calculated using eq 12 weber and chakravorti 1974 12 r l 1 1 k l c o where r l is a constant separation factor dimensionless of the solid liquid adsorption system k l is the langmuir equilibrium constant and c o mg l is the initial adsorbate concentration as shown in table 1 the values of r l ranged between 0 and 1 and the concave shape of the adsorption isotherm indicated that rees adsorption by p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 was favorable tran et al 2017 3 2 4 adsorption thermodynamic parameters and adsorption mechanism calculation of adsorption thermodynamic parameters is fundamental to understand the adsorption mechanism gibbs free energy δgo was calculated using eq 7 and the enthalpy δho and entropy δso components were determined from the slope and intercept respectively of the plot of lnkc versus 1 t in van t hoff equation eq 8 as shown in fig s4 the values of these thermodynamic parameters are summarized in table 2 the positive values of δho indicate that nd and gd must replace more than one water molecule upon their adsorption on p cdp and p cdp fe3o4 which causes the endothermicity of the adsorption process affirming a chemisorption process saha and chowdhury 2011 overall the increase of the negative values of δgo with temperature indicates that the adsorption process is spontaneous and that it becomes more favorable at high temperature possibly inceasing temperature increases the mobility of nd and gd in solution which increases their affinity on the adsorbents saha and chowdhury 2011 tran et al 2016 additionally since δgo values are all below 20 kj mol the adsorption process is likely to be dominated by chemisorption according to previous reports anastopoulos et al 2016 in the chemisorption process rees can form coordination complexes with donor atoms including oxygen nitrogen and fluorine in p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 hasegawa et al 2011 pearson 1968 in addition electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged phenolate groups in the adsorbents and the adsorbed rees ions are very likely to occur based on a previous report klemes et al 2018 and based on our findings here that the adsorption capacity is increased with increasing ph tran et al 2016 3 2 5 selectivity toward rees rees occur in complex matrices which contain considerable amounts of alkali alkaline earth and heavy metals zhu et al 2011 therefore it is critical to study the matrix effect on the performance of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 fig 6 shows the distribution coefficients k d of y nd eu and gd in a mixture containing na ca mg ni and zn with initial concentrations of 5 00 mg l the distribution coefficients of rees and the competitive elements were calculated using eq 10 and the separation factors sf were calculated from the ratios of the distribution coefficients callura et al 2018 p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 adsorbed much more y nd eu and gd than the background metals for example the sfs of gd3 versus na ca mg ni and zn were 67 69 38 93 115 9 87 76 and 6 260 in p cdp and 80 78 98 98 35 55 171 2 and 9 387 in p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively the sfs of nd versus the other competitive elements are shown in table s2 this high selectivity toward rees can be explained by the hard and soft acids and bases hsab principle since rees are hard lewis acids and p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 contain the hard lewis base atoms o n and f pearson 1968 3 2 6 desorption and reusability in addition to the fast kinetics good capacity and high selectivity p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 can be regenerated multiple times by a simple washing procedure with dilute acidic solution the reusability of both materials was assessed for five consecutive cycles by saturating with 5 00 mg l solutions of nd and gd and then desorption with 0 5 m hno3 notably the backpressure of p cdp was higher than that of p cdp fe 3 o 4 due to the larger particle size of the later and therefore the flow rates of the adsorbates and eluents were set at 0 5 ml min and 3 ml min for p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively the removal efficiencies and recovery efficiencies of both rees were calculated using eqs 1 and 11 and the results are shown in fig 7 after the fifth cycle the removal efficiencies of nd and gd by p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 remained above 97 the recovery efficiencies of both ions by both adsorbents after five cycles were above 96 other dilute acidic eluents such as 0 5 m hcl were also used and similar results were obtained fig s5 3 2 7 application to industrial wastewater the recovery of rees from a wastewater sample obtained from a local rees processing industry using p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 was also investigated to demonstrate the adsorbents performance under realistic environmental conditions the wastewater sample contained various rees and competitive metal ions as shown in table 3 batch adsorption experiments contact time 20 min at ambient temperature indicated that the distribution coefficients k d of rees on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 ranged from 413 7 to 1646 ml g and 304 0 1483 ml g respectively whereas the k d of the competitive metals on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 ranged from 0 4026 to 136 4 ml g and 0 1820 674 8 ml g respectively as shown in fig 8 a and b the apparent higher k d values of rees compared with those of the competitive metals confirmed the good selectivity of both adsorbents toward rees in addition the recovery efficiencies of rees by both adsorbents were in the range of 62 107 fig 8 3 3 environmental implication recovery of rees from industrial wastewater is one of the major challenges in water purification industry contamination with rees raised concerns due to their potential negative health effects and environmental toxicity gwenzi et al 2018 pagano et al 2016 various adsorbent materials have been reported to sequester rees from wastewater but these adsorbents suffer from slow adsorption kinetics poor reusability and high cost anastopoulos et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 recently an inexpensive porous polymer of β cd namely p cdp showed promise for the rapid removal of organic contaminants from water alsbaiee et al 2016 here we developed a magnetic composite of p cdp namely p cdp fe 3 o 4 and examined the ability of both p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 to recover rees from industrial wastewater these adsorbents show several favorable environmental implications for this application they can rapidly remove rees such as nd and gd in less than 10 min which was faster than most previously reported adsorbents and they display excellent selectivity toward rees in the presence of several other competitive metal ions although some adsorbents such as chitosan silica composite β cd magnetic attapulgite calcium alginate and mnsp n 2 showed higher adsorption capacity toward rees adsorbents in this study demonstrated faster equilibrium time anastopoulos et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 guo et al 2015 in addition the cost effective monomers one of which is sustainable and bio mass derived one step preparation and simple reuse at ambient temperature indicate their economic competitiveness and potentially low environmental impact furthermore the incorporation of fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 facilitated the synthesis application and regeneration of p cdp while maintaining its ability in the rapid selective and efficient recovery of rees thus the magnetic composite p cdp fe 3 o 4 may potentially further reduce the cost associated with the production use and reuse of p cdp 4 conclusions a magnetic composite of the porous β cd polymer p cdp namely p cdp fe 3 o 4 was developed in one synthetic step p cdp fe 3 o 4 has a bet surface area of 85 m2 g and similar microporous structure to p cdp the incorporation of the magnetic fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 reduced the clogging and high backpressure issues of p cdp and enabled much easier isolation of the adsorbent particles by an external magnet which facilitated its synthesis and use for water purification the use of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 for the recovery of rees e g nd gd y eu from water was examined both adsorbents were found to fit a pseudo second order kinetic model and achieve equilibrium uptake in less than 10 min the thermodynamic studies of adsorption fitted the langmuir isotherm model with adsorption capacities q max of 9 59 mg g nd and 8 99 mg g gd on p cdp and 8 88 mg g nd and 7 76 mg g gd on p cdp fe 3 o 4 with the highest initial concentration of 100 mg l more importantly both adsorbents exhibited excellent selectivity toward rees in the presence of various competitive alkali alkaline earth and heavy metal ions both in the model studies and industrial wastewater the recovery efficiencies of rees from industrial wastewater using both adsorbents ranged from 62 to 100 in addition both adsorbents were reused for five cycles using a simple washing procedure with dilute acidic solutions these characteristics make p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 promising candidates for rees sequestration and

17865,recovery of rare earth elements rees from industrial wastewater has drawn great attention due to their potential environmental toxicity as well as their high demand in modern technologies in this study we developed a magnetic composite based on the high surface area porous β cyclodextrin polymer p cdp namely p cdp fe 3 o 4 both p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 rapidly sequester rees such as nd gd eu and y reaching equilibrium in less than 10 min and fitting the langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacities ranging from 7 76 to 9 59 mg g at 25 c when the highest initial concentration was 100 mg l besides the recovery of these rees was not affected by competitive alkali alkaline earth and transition metal ions in model studies and industrial wastewater as revealed by the recovery efficiencies which ranged from 62 to 100 indicating an excellent selectivity on both adsorbents in addition both adsorbents can be fully regenerated under mildly acidic conditions for at least five consecutive cycles moreover p cdp fe 3 o 4 can be easily isolated by an external magnetic field which simplifies its synthesis and usability it also overcomes the clogging and high backpressure issues of p cdp which facilitates its application for rees recovery as compared with p cdp these characteristics demonstrate the promise of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 for the pollution control and recovery of rees graphical abstract image 1 keywords rare earth elements rees magnetic composite adsorption selectivity recovery 1 introduction rare earth elements rees have been progressively used in various industries including automobile electronics medicine cosmetics and renewable energy technologies wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in 2012 the department of energy in the usa issued a report considering rees as crucial elements in the clean energy economy u s department of energy 2011 china as a global leader of the rees market accounted for 88 of rees refined products in 2017 u s geological survey 2019 besides the economic impact relatively large quantities of rees resulting from their mining and production processes are wide spread in wastewater sludge surface water soils plants and animals this has raised concerns about the potential negative health effects and environmental toxicity of rees gwenzi et al 2018 nkinahamira et al 2019 and recently rees were reported as new emerging pollutants herrmann et al 2016 pagano et al 2016 therefore an efficient technology for the removal and recovery of rees is urgently needed solvent extraction chemical precipitation electrochemical separation coagulation and membrane filtration are the most commonly used methods for separation and enrichment of rees gok 2014 however these methods are not economical and the separated rees are not sufficiently recovered after treatment additionally some of these methods generate additional waste such as sludge and toxic solvents jha et al 2016 on the other hand the adsorption method is simple relatively more economical and especially effective to remove rees at environmental concentrations wang et al 2017 adsorbents from various categories including zeolites activated carbon clay and ordered mesoporous silica have been reported to remove rees from the aqueous environment qi et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 although some of these adsorbents show promising performance most have disadvantages including low adsorption capacity long equilibrium time and poor rees selectivity in complex matrices jha et al 2016 qiu et al 2016 the slow adsorption kinetics of rees is attributed to their large ionic radii and high coordination numbers which reduce their diffusion rates and limit their ability to access the active sites of the adsorbent wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 thus materials with high removal capacity fast adsorption kinetics and high selectivity toward rees are highly desired polymers of β cyclodextrin β cd an inexpensive sustainable macrocycle of glucose have been used as adsorbents for a variety of water purification applications alsbaiee et al 2016 morin crini and crini 2013 however the majority of the previously reported β cd polymers had low surface areas and exhibited very slow adsorption rates toward various classes of water contaminants morin crini and crini 2013 in 2016 alsbaiee et al reported the first permanently microporous high surface area β cd polymer named p cdp by crosslinking β cd with the rigid aromatic group tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile p cdp showed rapid removal of organic micropollutants pb ions and sulfides from water with high adsorption capacities and it can be easily regenerated at ambient temperature alsbaiee et al 2016 klemes et al 2018 li et al 2017 here we examined the ability of p cdp to remove rees from water using model and industrial wastewater matrices we also report the synthesis of a magnetic p cdp composite named herein p cdp fe 3 o 4 which can be easily isolated by an external magnetic field and it overcomes the clogging and high backpressure issues associated with the use of p cdp while maintaining p cdp s ability to recover rees alsbaiee et al 2016 alzate sanchez et al 2019 previous studies reported that the conjugation of magnetic nanomaterials with biopolymers such as cellulose chitosan alginate and cyclodextrin enable easy isolation of the conjugate from the medium by an external magnetic field which minimizes the loss of the adsorbent during wastewater treatment badruddoza et al 2013 reddy and lee 2013 su 2017 for instance the magnetic β cyclodextrin polymers which are synthesized in three steps could be easily regenerated while retaining good adsorption performance for organic pollutants and heavy metals in wastewater hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 p cdp fe 3 o 4 was fully characterized by various structural analysis techniques and its ability to remove rees from water was examined p cdp fe 3 o 4 and p cdp both exhibited fast adsorption and rapid recovery of rees their excellent selectivity for the recovery of rees from complex industrial wastewaters in the presence of alkali alkaline earth and transition metal competitors was also demonstrated in addition both adsorbents were fully regenerated multiple times by a simple washing procedure with dilute acidic solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and instrumentation

ch2cl2 for 15 min p cdp fe 3 o 4 particles were dried under high vacuum at 60 c for two days 2 3 batch adsorption experiments since the physical and chemical properties of rees are similar zhang et al 2016 nd and gd were selected as model elements to investigate rees adsorption on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 in general the adsorption experiments were conducted in an incubator shaker zhwy 2102c china 500 mg l stock solutions of nd and gd were prepared in milli q water using nd no3 3 6h2o and gd no3 3 6h2o respectively the working solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solutions to the desired concentration the ph values of the working solutions were adjusted using 0 1 mol l hno3 and naoh solutions after adsorption the mixtures were filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 the residual nd and gd concentrations were measured using icp oes the adsorption kinetic experiments were carried out at a dosage of 1 00 g l of adsorbent in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of 5 00 mg l nd or gd solutions at 25 c and the flasks are then shaken at 180 rpm the adsorption isotherm experiments were performed in 20 ml scintillation vials containing 10 0 mg of adsorbents and 10 0 ml of rees solutions of various concentrations and the vials were shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c the effect of ph on adsorption was studied by adding 1 00 g l of each adsorbent to 5 00 mg l solutions of nd or gd with initial ph ranging from 1 to 6 and the mixtures were then shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c for 24 h after adsorption the mixtures were filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 the

al 2017 2016 2 5 competitive adsorption experiments to study adsorption selectivity of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 toward rees competitive adsorption experiments were carried out in a 50 ml conical flask by mixing 20 0 mg of adsorbent with 10 0 ml solution containing y nd eu gd na ca mg ni and zn with initial concentrations of 5 00 mg l then shaking the mixture at 25 c for 24 h the mixtures were then filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 after determining the concentrations of the residual rees by icp oes the distribution coefficients k d ml g of the metal ions were calculated using eq 10 10 k d c o c f c f v m where c o and c f mg l are the initial and final concentration of the metal ion respectively and v and m are the volume of solution and adsorbent mass respectively 2 6 adsorbent reusability studies reusability studies were conducted using solid phase extraction spe method in which 2 5 ml empty spe cartridges were packed with 100 mg of p cdp or p cdp fe 3 o 4 and then connected to visiprep spe vacuum manifold supelco before loading the sample the cartridges were washed with milli q water 10 ml then 10 0 ml nd or gd 5 00 mg l ph 5 0 solutions were passed through the cartridges at a controlled flow rate of 0 5 ml min for p cdp and 3 ml min for p cdp fe 3 o 4 the filtrates were then collected and analyzed using icp oes to regenerate the adsorbent and recover the metal ions 0 5 m hno3 or 0 5 m hcl were passed through the cartridges at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min for p cdp and 3 ml

industrial wastewater a wastewater sample from a local rees processing industry was diluted 100 times to prepare a working wastewater solution and the ph of the working solution was adjusted to 5 0 using 1 mol l hno3 and naoh solutions 10 0 ml working solution was then mixed with 30 0 mg adsorbent in 50 ml conical flask and shaken for 20 min at 25 c the mixture was then filtrated using 0 45 μm pore size membrane for p cdp while a permanent nd fe b magnet was used to isolate p cdp fe 3 o 4 the solids were then washed one time with deionized water and then the adsorbed ions were eluted using 0 5 m hno3 the ions in the acidic filtrates were analyzed by icp ms to determine the concentration of the desorbed ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents 3 1 1 ft ir analysis ft ir spectra of β cd tfp p cdp fe3o4 and p cdp fe 3 o 4 are shown in fig 2 a for β cd and fe3o4 the intense and broad peak around 3419 cm 1 belongs to oh stretching vibrations nkinahamira et al 2017 and the bands at 1645 cm 1 and 1450 cm 1 are associated with the c c aromatic stretches the band at 2931 cm 1 in the spectra of β cd and tfp is assigned to the aliphatic c h stretches while the band at 1033 cm 1 in the spectrum of β cd corresponds to the c o stretch alsbaiee et al 2016 the bands at 2244 cm 1 and 1271 cm 1 in the spectra of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 belong to the c f and nitrile groups respectively the presence of the band at 594 cm 1 in the ir spectrum of p cdp fe 3 o 4 is attributed to the fe o bonds in the fe3o4 particles badruddoza et al 2013 3 1 2 thermal stability the tga analyses of the monomers and polymers are shown in fig 2b the tga curve of fe3o4 showed a weight loss of 3 44 over the full temperature range which can be attributed to the removal of physisorbed water and surface oh groups due to the oxidation of iron abdolmaleki et al 2015 p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 showed enhanced thermal stability as compared with tfp and β cd the initial weight drop of 3 95 and 4 40 for p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively occurred between 40 and 263 c which is attributed to the evaporation of physically absorbed water nkinahamira et al 2017 the weight loss of 31 97 for p cdp and 23 09 for p cdp fe 3 o 4 that occurred between 263 and 383 c is attributed to the decomposition of tfp whereas the weight loss after 383 c in both materials is attributed to the degradation of β cd tsiepe et al 2018 the weight drop of 11 93 for p cdp fe 3 o 4 between 625 and 666 c which is absent in p cdp could be attributed to the oxidation of fe3o4 to fe2o3 which may further indicate the successful incorporation of the fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 abdolmaleki et al 2015 3 1 3 zeta potential the charge of a material s surface in solution is characterized by the isoelectric point iep or the point of zero charge pzc tran et al 2017 zeta potentials of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 are shown in fig 2c both materials have negative zeta potential values in acidic and basic solutions with pzc at ph 5 3 for p cdp and pzc at ph 4 1 for p cdp fe 3 o 4 which can be attributed to the presence of the phenolate groups in both materials as reported previously klemes et al 2018 the lower pzc of p cdp fe 3 o 4 as compared with p cdp might be due to its higher oxygen content faria et al 2004 as shown in fig s2 it should be pointed out that the negative zeta potentials of both adsorbents are advantageous for the adsorption of positively charged ree ions and it reduces the tendency of both materials to agglomerate in solution yirsaw et al 2016 3 1 4 magnetization measurements vsm was used to measure the magnetization values of fe3o4 and p cdp fe 3 o 4 at room temperature and the results are shown in fig 2d the hysteresis loops of fe3o4 and p cdp fe 3 o 4 indicate their ferromagnetic behavior with magnetic saturation of 66 and 16 emu g respectively the low magnetization value of p cdp fe 3 o 4 can be attributed to the existence of nonmagnetic material layer i e p cdp in the composite and the decrease of the weight percent of fe3o4 in the composite as compared with the neat fe3o4 qiu et al 2016 nevertheless p cdp fe 3 o 4 exhibited strong magnetic responsivity and can be separated easily from solution using an external magnet li et al 2006 3 1 5 porosity and surface area analyses porosity and surface area of the adsorbents and their corresponding monomers were investigated by asap nitrogen porosimetry analysis fe3o4 nanoparticles showed type iii isotherms with bet surface area of 73 m2 g pore volume of 0 240 cm3 g and pore size of 13 1 nm fig 3 a p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 exhibited type ii isotherms fig 3b and c characteristic of mesoporous materials as supported by the bjh pore size distribution curves fig 3d with an average pore size of 2 88 nm and 4 81 nm respectively notably the bet surface area of p cdp fe 3 o 4 was 85 m2 g as compared with a surface area of 143 m2 g for p cdp which can be attributed to the incorporation of the fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 nkinahamira et al 2017 3 1 6 morphology and elemental analysis sem images of fe3o4 fig 4 a revealed agglomerations of small spherical particles whereas the sem images of p cdp fig 4b showed irregular shape and size particles with rough surfaces indicative of the porous structure of p cdp the sem images of p cdp fe 3 o 4 fig 4c relatively resembled those of p cdp but seemed to have smaller particle size the average particle size measured using laser diffraction particle size analyzer was found to be 116 μm and 25 3 μm for p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively a further evidence of the presence of fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe3o4 is provided by the edx analysis fig 4d which indicated the presence of 29 8 wt fe 9 56 mol fe in the composition of p cdp fe3o4 edx data for β cd tfp p cdp and fe3o4 were given in fig s2 3 2 results of batch experiments 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on nd and gd adsorption by p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 was investigated at ph 2 6 for nd and 2 5 5 for gd as shown in fig 5 a and b the adsorption process was strongly dependent on solution ph in that the removal capacity of nd and gd increased with increasing ph from 2 to 5 5 since both adsorbents have negative zeta potentials fig 2c the low removal efficiency in the stronger acidic conditions can be attributed to the competition between h and the metal ions as was reported previously zhu et al 2011 therefore both nd and gd exhibited maximum removal efficiency in the ph range of 5 5 5 for instance the maximum removal efficiencies were 93 nd and 77 gd by p cdp and 94 nd and 72 gd by p cdp fe3o4 3 2 2 effects of contact time and adsorption kinetics fig 5c and d shows the adsorption of nd and gd on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 as a function of time in less than 5 min both adsorbents achieved 90 removal and nearly 100 adsorption after approximately 10 min this rapid removal of rees is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 which is consistent with previous studies that reported rapid adsorption of micropollutants on p cdp alsbaiee et al 2016 according to the kinetic parameters calculated using eqs 3 and 4 and shown in table s1 and fig s3 the adsorption of nd and gd fitted well the pseudo second order kinetic model with correlation coefficients r 2 greater than 0 998 similar to previously reported β cd polymers abdolmaleki et al 2015 alzate sanchez et al 2019 morin crini and crini 2013 3 2 3 adsorption isotherm and capacity adsorption isotherms of nd and gd are shown in fig 5 e and f the adsorption capacities of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 increased with the initial concentration of nd and gd then reached equilibrium the experimental isotherm data were fitted by langmuir and freundlich models according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively the parameters associated with langmuir and freundlich models are presented in table 1 based on the correlation coefficient value r 2 and the inset in fig 5 e and f the adsorption of nd and gd better fitted the langmuir model langmuir 1918 based on langmuir isotherm data in table 1 the maximum adsorption capacities of nd and gd on p cdp were 9 59 and 8 99 mg g respectively while the maximum adsorption capacities on p cdp fe 3 o 4 were 8 88 and 7 76 mg g respectively initial concentration ranging from 1 to 100 mg l the slightly lower adsorption capacity of p cdp fe 3 o 4 as compared with p cdp is attributed to the lower weight percentage of the β cd polymer in the composite since the adsorption fitted the langmuir model it is essential to calculate the separation factor r l which is a dimensionless constant that determines whether the adsorption is favorable r l 1 or unfavorable r l 1 and can be calculated using eq 12 weber and chakravorti 1974 12 r l 1 1 k l c o where r l is a constant separation factor dimensionless of the solid liquid adsorption system k l is the langmuir equilibrium constant and c o mg l is the initial adsorbate concentration as shown in table 1 the values of r l ranged between 0 and 1 and the concave shape of the adsorption isotherm indicated that rees adsorption by p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 was favorable tran et al 2017 3 2 4 adsorption thermodynamic parameters and adsorption mechanism calculation of adsorption thermodynamic parameters is fundamental to understand the adsorption mechanism gibbs free energy δgo was calculated using eq 7 and the enthalpy δho and entropy δso components were determined from the slope and intercept respectively of the plot of lnkc versus 1 t in van t hoff equation eq 8 as shown in fig s4 the values of these thermodynamic parameters are summarized in table 2 the positive values of δho indicate that nd and gd must replace more than one water molecule upon their adsorption on p cdp and p cdp fe3o4 which causes the endothermicity of the adsorption process affirming a chemisorption process saha and chowdhury 2011 overall the increase of the negative values of δgo with temperature indicates that the adsorption process is spontaneous and that it becomes more favorable at high temperature possibly inceasing temperature increases the mobility of nd and gd in solution which increases their affinity on the adsorbents saha and chowdhury 2011 tran et al 2016 additionally since δgo values are all below 20 kj mol the adsorption process is likely to be dominated by chemisorption according to previous reports anastopoulos et al 2016 in the chemisorption process rees can form coordination complexes with donor atoms including oxygen nitrogen and fluorine in p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 hasegawa et al 2011 pearson 1968 in addition electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged phenolate groups in the adsorbents and the adsorbed rees ions are very likely to occur based on a previous report klemes et al 2018 and based on our findings here that the adsorption capacity is increased with increasing ph tran et al 2016 3 2 5 selectivity toward rees rees occur in complex matrices which contain considerable amounts of alkali alkaline earth and heavy metals zhu et al 2011 therefore it is critical to study the matrix effect on the performance of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 fig 6 shows the distribution coefficients k d of y nd eu and gd in a mixture containing na ca mg ni and zn with initial concentrations of 5 00 mg l the distribution coefficients of rees and the competitive elements were calculated using eq 10 and the separation factors sf were calculated from the ratios of the distribution coefficients callura et al 2018 p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 adsorbed much more y nd eu and gd than the background metals for example the sfs of gd3 versus na ca mg ni and zn were 67 69 38 93 115 9 87 76 and 6 260 in p cdp and 80 78 98 98 35 55 171 2 and 9 387 in p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively the sfs of nd versus the other competitive elements are shown in table s2 this high selectivity toward rees can be explained by the hard and soft acids and bases hsab principle since rees are hard lewis acids and p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 contain the hard lewis base atoms o n and f pearson 1968 3 2 6 desorption and reusability in addition to the fast kinetics good capacity and high selectivity p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 can be regenerated multiple times by a simple washing procedure with dilute acidic solution the reusability of both materials was assessed for five consecutive cycles by saturating with 5 00 mg l solutions of nd and gd and then desorption with 0 5 m hno3 notably the backpressure of p cdp was higher than that of p cdp fe 3 o 4 due to the larger particle size of the later and therefore the flow rates of the adsorbates and eluents were set at 0 5 ml min and 3 ml min for p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 respectively the removal efficiencies and recovery efficiencies of both rees were calculated using eqs 1 and 11 and the results are shown in fig 7 after the fifth cycle the removal efficiencies of nd and gd by p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 remained above 97 the recovery efficiencies of both ions by both adsorbents after five cycles were above 96 other dilute acidic eluents such as 0 5 m hcl were also used and similar results were obtained fig s5 3 2 7 application to industrial wastewater the recovery of rees from a wastewater sample obtained from a local rees processing industry using p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 was also investigated to demonstrate the adsorbents performance under realistic environmental conditions the wastewater sample contained various rees and competitive metal ions as shown in table 3 batch adsorption experiments contact time 20 min at ambient temperature indicated that the distribution coefficients k d of rees on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 ranged from 413 7 to 1646 ml g and 304 0 1483 ml g respectively whereas the k d of the competitive metals on p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 ranged from 0 4026 to 136 4 ml g and 0 1820 674 8 ml g respectively as shown in fig 8 a and b the apparent higher k d values of rees compared with those of the competitive metals confirmed the good selectivity of both adsorbents toward rees in addition the recovery efficiencies of rees by both adsorbents were in the range of 62 107 fig 8 3 3 environmental implication recovery of rees from industrial wastewater is one of the major challenges in water purification industry contamination with rees raised concerns due to their potential negative health effects and environmental toxicity gwenzi et al 2018 pagano et al 2016 various adsorbent materials have been reported to sequester rees from wastewater but these adsorbents suffer from slow adsorption kinetics poor reusability and high cost anastopoulos et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 recently an inexpensive porous polymer of β cd namely p cdp showed promise for the rapid removal of organic contaminants from water alsbaiee et al 2016 here we developed a magnetic composite of p cdp namely p cdp fe 3 o 4 and examined the ability of both p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 to recover rees from industrial wastewater these adsorbents show several favorable environmental implications for this application they can rapidly remove rees such as nd and gd in less than 10 min which was faster than most previously reported adsorbents and they display excellent selectivity toward rees in the presence of several other competitive metal ions although some adsorbents such as chitosan silica composite β cd magnetic attapulgite calcium alginate and mnsp n 2 showed higher adsorption capacity toward rees adsorbents in this study demonstrated faster equilibrium time anastopoulos et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 guo et al 2015 in addition the cost effective monomers one of which is sustainable and bio mass derived one step preparation and simple reuse at ambient temperature indicate their economic competitiveness and potentially low environmental impact furthermore the incorporation of fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 facilitated the synthesis application and regeneration of p cdp while maintaining its ability in the rapid selective and efficient recovery of rees thus the magnetic composite p cdp fe 3 o 4 may potentially further reduce the cost associated with the production use and reuse of p cdp 4 conclusions a magnetic composite of the porous β cd polymer p cdp namely p cdp fe 3 o 4 was developed in one synthetic step p cdp fe 3 o 4 has a bet surface area of 85 m2 g and similar microporous structure to p cdp the incorporation of the magnetic fe3o4 particles in p cdp fe 3 o 4 reduced the clogging and high backpressure issues of p cdp and enabled much easier isolation of the adsorbent particles by an external magnet which facilitated its synthesis and use for water purification the use of p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 for the recovery of rees e g nd gd y eu from water was examined both adsorbents were found to fit a pseudo second order kinetic model and achieve equilibrium uptake in less than 10 min the thermodynamic studies of adsorption fitted the langmuir isotherm model with adsorption capacities q max of 9 59 mg g nd and 8 99 mg g gd on p cdp and 8 88 mg g nd and 7 76 mg g gd on p cdp fe 3 o 4 with the highest initial concentration of 100 mg l more importantly both adsorbents exhibited excellent selectivity toward rees in the presence of various competitive alkali alkaline earth and heavy metal ions both in the model studies and industrial wastewater the recovery efficiencies of rees from industrial wastewater using both adsorbents ranged from 62 to 100 in addition both adsorbents were reused for five cycles using a simple washing procedure with dilute acidic solutions these characteristics make p cdp and p cdp fe 3 o 4 promising candidates for rees sequestration and

17866,sewage sludge mainly composed of excessive bio sludge is an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment process and contains various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and organic contaminants the production of sewage sludge may cause serious pollution risks without appropriate disposals as the essential step of sludge treatment dewatering plays significant roles in minimizing the sludge volume facilitating the transportation increasing the calorific value and even reducing the leachate production in landfill sites this paper presents a comprehensive review on the issues related to dewatering of sewage sludge section 1 starts with the environmental implications of sludge dewatering section 2 deals with the concepts and challenges about differentiation of bound water fractions and also reviews the recent progress of in situ visualization of water occurrence states in bio flocs section 3 discusses about how various physiochemical properties influence

dewaterability improvement and the advantages disadvantages of each technology in terms of applicable occasions material consumption energy consumption and environmental impacts are evaluated the last section section 5 specifically analyzes the feasibility of integrating sludge dewatering and re utilization and raises attention to the potential environmental risks of dewatering conditioning based on the above discussion we propose that a unified theory for sludge dewaterability improvement remains to be established especially how the molecular structures of sludge compositions affect the solid

dewatering is how to select the appropriate conditioning technique according to the physiochemical properties of target sludge the reliable indicators for real time control of conditioning operations are still deficient e g dynamic dosage control of conditioning chemicals accordingly the potential environmental risks of excessive conditioning chemicals should be taken into more consideration

tb eps tightly bound eps xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1 introduction due to its high adaptability to influent quality flexible operation mode and stable process performance biological wastewater treatment is the most frequently employed technology in wastewater treatment plants worldwide mahmoud et al 2013 however sewage sludge mainly composed of excessive bio sludge is an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment and contains various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and organic contaminants which may cause serious pollution risks if without appropriate disposals see table 1 with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization the production of sewage sludge continues to increase worldwide along with the increasing demand for sanitation and water treatment facilities cieślik et al 2015 for example the daily wastewater treatment capacity in china has increased rapidly since 2008 and accordingly the sewage sludge production had an average annual growth of 10 7 and rose to 11 75 million ton dry matter dm in 2019 mohurd 2020 the united states has an average annual sewage sludge production of 17 8 million ton dm in the last decade epa 2018 in terms of the typical developed countries in asia pacific region australia and japan produce 0 36 and 2 2 million ton dm per year respectively awa 2018 jswa 2017 the sewage sludge production in european union is around 9 0 million ton dm per year eurostat 2018 therefore the large production of sewage sludge worldwide determines that the sludge treatment should account for a significant proportion of secondary pollution control of wastewater treatment plants as the essential step for appropriate sludge treatments dewatering can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation increase the efficiency of energy utilization and even reduce the leachate production in sludge landfill sites mahmoud et al 2013 wong et al 2016 however sludge is difficult to be dewatered directly due to the highly hydrated colloidal structures of microbial aggregates christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a the previous studies already investigated the multiple influencing factors on sludge dewaterability and many efforts have also been devoted to improving sludge dewaterability by various approaches however there is still lack of a comprehensive review involving all the relevant issues about sludge dewatering and limited literatures specifically focused on the potential effects of dewatering conditioning on the subsequent utilization of sewage sludge christensen et al 2015 mowla et al 2013 qi et al 2011a this review provides state of the art knowledge with regards to the water distribution in sludge the influencing factors on sludge dewaterability and the approaches for sludge dewaterability improvement especially the insufficiency of existing researches on quantitative water differentiation is pointed out and the future research need for mechanism investigation on strong water holding properties of bio flocs is proposed the importance is attached on the molecular conformation of sludge compositions in addition the special emphasis is laid on the effects of conditioning operations on re utilization of dewatered sewage sludge the engineering implication of dewatering is extended from disposal to high value sludge re utilization through the review we expect that sludge dewatering can be systematically and compendiously understood from fundamentals to implementations 2 water occurrence states in bio flocs of sewage sludge the presence of organic phase in sludge makes a certain part of water embedded in a bio polymeric network and behave very differently from the bulk water heukelekian and weisberg 1956 therefore it is primarily necessary to understand the water occurrence states in bio flocs which is also the basis for optimizing the water removal efficiency and energy consumption of sludge dewatering process 2 1 definition of free water and bound water primarily the energy definition was proposed by catalano et al catalano 1970 in this context an interaction energy is defined as the energy necessary to break the binding of water to solid material bound water refers to the water bound to solid phase with a specific binding energy of x kcal mol and free water is the state of water unaffected by solid phase based on the energy definition lee 1996 further proposed that the capability of bound water to resist freezing under low temperatures is attributed to the lowering of its thermodynamic activity by the water solid bond strength they proposed the relationship between water solid binding energy and crystallization temperature of bound water as lee 1996 1 e b t s h t f 0 t f 0 δ h f where eb is the binding energy between water and solid phase tsh and tf0 are the crystallization temperature of bound water and free water δhf is the standard enthalpy of ice formation according to equation 1 the higher binding energy leads to the lower crystallization temperature in another word the capacity of bound water to resist freezing under low temperature conditions increases with the increasing binding energy with solid phase therefore to choose a freezing temperature is thereby equivalent to set a binding energy dividing the bound non bound water in sludge accordingly two quantification methods of bound water through the measurement of unfrozen water at the specific freezing temperature were established colin and gazbar 1995 he et al 2015 lee 1996 smith and vesilind 1995 wu et al 1998 heukelekian and smith measured the bound water content by monitoring the volume expansion rate at 20 c heukelekian and weisberg 1956 smith and vesilind 1995 lee et al applied the thermogravimetry to measure the entropy of sludge freezing at 20 c and derived the unfrozen bound water based on the water crystallization entropy lee and lee 1995 however how to select the appropriate freezing temperature for quantifying bound water in sludge is still a controversial issue 2 2 differentiation of bound water fractions the total amount of bound water can be quantified by the energy definition however vesilind and lee lee 1994 vesilind 1994 further distinguished the classifications of bound water in sludge based on arbitrary hypotheses called operational definition the operational definition regards the water that can be eliminated by simple thickening or by weak mechanical strains as free water bound water is the water fixed to solid phase by chemical bindings hydrogen bond physical adsorption and mechanical capture in both micro and macrocapillaries of capillary porous bodies and is hard to be removed from the sludge body using mechanical means of dewatering according to the above interactions between bound water and sludge floc structure vesilind et al vesilind 1994 moller et al möller 1983 and smollen et al smollen 1988 refined the four water fractions as free or bulk water interstitial water vicinal water and water of hydration fig 1 our previous studies visually tracked the micro spatial water distribution in bio flocs of sewage sludge through in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography the two fractions of bound water the vicinal water adhering to the surface of organic compositions and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like structure of bio flocs were identified based on the cross section x ray imaging results wu et al 2018c refer to fig 2 in addition the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution of low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr was applied to quantitatively unravel the occurrence states of water in sludge mao et al 2016 wu et al 2019b by applying carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence the signal decay rates of low field nmr differ because of the interactions among protons with the environment and with each other carneiro et al 2013 goh et al 2009 therefore t2 derived from cpmg decay could be particularly sensitive to changes in the states of protons jepsen et al 1999 and be able for characterizing the structural information of protons in different water fractions of sludge also the area under each peak of t2 distribution spectrum can be determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of bound water with different states wu et al 2019b according to previous studies vaxelaire and cézac 2004 vesilind 1994 the most mobile water is theoretically defined as free water that is unaffected by solid phase however this definition is unfeasible in practice because it is hard to only separate solid unaffected water state by experimental means actually the different water removal efficiency can be caused by different filtration pressure or centrifugation speed lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 in the study using low filed nmr for water differentiation wu et al 2019b we found that the position of t2 peak corresponding to the most mobile water state varies with the conditioning induced alterations of solid phase therefore our study modified the commonly recognized definition free water as moderately mobile water by using the t2 spectrum of low filed nmr wu et al 2019b the moderately mobile water can be interpreted as the water that is least influenced by solid phase and can be partially removed by mechanical means 2 3 future research need for bound water differentiation in terms of the expected developments for bound water differentiation we think that the direct visualization of water fractions based on in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography can be further used to deepen the understanding of flow regime in sewage sludge during dewatering process besides there is a need of thermodynamic analysis on the solid liquid interfacial interaction in sludge the quantitative characterization on the binding strength of water molecules to solid phase is expected in addition the commonly used dewaterability indexes capillary suction time cst and specific resistance of filtration srf are measured by the bench scale dewatering experiments which may be not able to fully simulate the solid liquid separation process of factory scale dewatering the water occurrence states of bio sludge reflect the solid water binding strength and influence the water removal efficiency besides the relative contents of specific bound water fractions should be closely related to the water content limit that can be realized by mechanical dewatering therefore we propose that a novel index integrating the relative contents of different water fractions and solid water binding strength can be developed to evaluate the sludge dewaterability the non destructive and rapid nmr based water state differentiation should be more convenient time saving and reproducible than the empirical indicators cst or srf 3 influencing factors on sludge dewatering the investigation on influencing factors on sludge dewaterability has been a topic of general interest because it can be a point of penetration for better understanding the microstructure and constituent of sewage sludge previous researches have systematically investigated how the rheological properties microstructure features and extracellular polymeric substances eps on the water differentiation and dewaterability of sludge the significant results and major insufficiency are summarized as following 3 1 rheological properties viscosity is a comprehensive index reflecting the interactions among sludge particles the colloidal stability of microbial aggregates and water holding capacity of sludge flocs there are already many literatures analyzing the relationship between viscosity and dewaterability generally the sludge viscosity has the positive correlations with cst and srf pearson coefficient 0 9 p value 0 05 li and yang 2007 niu et al 2013 some other studies also found that the stronger affinity between water and organic compositions led to the higher sludge viscosity and bound water content eriksson et al 1992b jin et al 2004 vesilind 1988 zhen et al 2018 zita and hermansson 1997 however most of the above correlative analysis is still based on the laboratory scale dewatering measurement actually the sludge viscosity should significantly affect the particle migration in factory scale solid liquid separation which may be not able to be fully simulated by bench scale cst or srf tests recently the increasing attention is also paid to the relationships among viscosity shear resistance and stability of sludge flocs the decreasing sludge viscosity is always accompanied with the declining elastoplastic modulus which reflects the weakening interactions among sludge particles sheng and yu 2006 sheng et al 2006 the elastoplastic modulus also positively correlated with the fractal dimensions and these two properties jointly affected the sludge dewaterability in centrifugation baudez et al 2013 eshtiaghi et al 2012 li et al 2017a xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 accordingly some attempts used the viscosity to evaluate the dewaterability of sludge christensen et al 1993 dentel et al 2000 the cst was modified as christensen et al 1993 2 cstmod cst cstf w μf where cst and cstf are the capillary suction time of sludge and filtrate respectively w is the water content of sludge μf is filtrate viscosity the normalized cst cstmod could be a promising indicator for evaluating the sludge dewaterability and determining the optimal dosage of conditioning chemicals as the crucial rheological properties of dewatered sludge cake the compressibility and porosity are also important to the water removal efficiency by filtration zhao and bache 2001 it is generally recognized that the low compressibility maintains the porous structure of the dewatered sludge without fluidity inhibits the deformation and promotes the enhanced water removal qi et al 2011a in another word the lower compressibility is always accompanied with the higher permeability qi et al 2011a but it is difficult to accurately quantify the sludge dewaterability only by compressibility as the permeability and compressibility of the sludges varies by up to ten orders of magnitude in the range of solids concentration of interest to industry skinner et al 2015 therefore a model integrating both laboratory dewatering measurements and various rheological properties is necessary that will further clarify the relationships among rheological properties and sludge dewaterability which would help screen out the processes and additives showing great promise in laboratory based experiments but not to the extent in factory scale engineering 3 2 particle size particle size distribution is commonly regarded as another key factors influencing sludge dewaterability as the surface charge of sludge particles and micromorphology of sludge flocs also improve or deteriorate the sludge dewaterability through regulating the particle size distribution the sludge particles can be categorized as rigid settable solid 100 μm fragile settable solid 10 100 μm supracolloidal solid 1 10 μm and true colloidal solid 0 001 1 0 μm karr and keinath 1978 shao et al 2009 it is generally recognized that the large fraction of long fibers in sludge causes the flocculation of particles and increases the particle size as a result the denser flocs expand the density difference between solid and liquid phases which is favorable for the solid liquid separation by gravity settling and centrifugation mowla et al 2013 on the contrary supracolloidal solid and true colloidal solid cause cake filter or filters media blinding by migration of fines into the filter cake or filter media pores which increases the filtration resistance and negatively affects the water removal from sludge zhou et al 2014 although the supracolloidal solid and true colloidal solid only account for 3 9 and 0 2 of the total solid concentration of sludge the previous studies showed that the increase of supracolloidal solid by 50 may increase srf by 100 the rigid settable solid 100 μm and fragile settable solid 10 100 μm have few effects on sludge srf karr and keinath 1978 besides the smaller particle size leads to the greater dispersion and the corresponding presence of capillaries retains a large portion of bound water in the fine pore structure higgins and novak 1997b jin et al 2004 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 current studies mainly investigated the changes of particle size distribution pre and post dewatering conditioning stages however the particle size of bio flocs can likely vary due to the changing external environment for example stirring strength or turbulent flow pattern heukelekian and weisberg 1958 therefore the particle size distribution resulting in satisfactory cst and srf results may be not appropriate for the engineering scale solid liquid equipment accordingly the future research should be carried out for the real time monitoring of particle size variation during conditioning or dewatering process which may be beneficial for the accurately regulating the conditioning operations in terms of agitation or chemical addition on the other hand the sludge with different sources or compositions may have the different optimal ranges of particle size distribution for dewaterability that also needs the systematical investigation to direct the engineering practice 3 3 micromorphology and porosity with the development of micro characterization techniques the effects of micromorphology and porosity are attracting the growing attention in terms of quantitative analysis of morphology fractal dimension is the widely applied parameter in previous researches cao et al 2016 jin et al 2004 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 an increase in quantity of fractal dimension tends to increase the bound water content in sludge accordingly the fractal dimension was found to have the positive linear relationship with sludge dewaterability based on cst cao et al 2016 jin et al 2004 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in addition it is generally accepted that the porosity improvement of filtered sludge cake can lead to the higher water removal efficiency as the existing meso and macro pores could maintain the permeability of sludge during compressing filtration qi et al 2011b thapa et al 2009a accordingly the addition of rigid porous materials is the widely applied approaches for creating or maintaining the porosity of sludge cake the analysis based on scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem verified that sludge particles can bind to the surface of porous materials by means of chemical and or electrostatic interactions liu et al 2013b tenney and cole 1968 thapa et al 2009b through such a mechanism the added rigid porous material can transfer the compressive stress and avoid the excessive compression of sludge cake which further helps the water flow out deneux mustin et al 2001 however it is still necessary to quantitatively determine the appropriate pore size and pore volume for satisfactory dewaterability the relationship between water occurrence states and pore structure can also be further explored currently no matter electron microscopy observation or conventional porosity quantification by n2 absorption isotherm cannot realize the in situ and non destructive analysis on bio sludge we propose that the recently developed techniques including x ray microtomography magnetic resonance imaging and cryo electron microscopy could be considered to solve the above issues 3 4 surface charge and repulsive energy surface charge plays a determinant role in the interactions among sludge particles which further influences the aggregation states particles size distribution and solid liquid separation performance christensen et al 2015 previous literatures primarily analyzed the correlation between surface charge and dewaterability with the presence of co existing ions and ph regulation since the outer surface compounds of microbial cell aggregates eps have the isoelectric point of 2 6 3 6 the sludge flocs are usually negatively charged whereas the charge increases with increasing ph and acidic ph range is in favor of dewaterability liao et al 2002 the surface charge of eps was measured as around 5 103 meq g at ph of 3 and the value was 14 103 meq g at ph of 11 the corresponding srf at ph of 11 was around 2 times higher than that at ph of 3 jin et al 2004 liao et al 2001 2002 however ph could damage the integrity of microbial cells which may also influence the dewaterability therefore how ph affects sludge dewaterability cannot be fully explained by surface charge neutralization in addition the water hardness or conductivity reflecting the concentration of multivalent ions was verified to be closely related to sludge dewaterability higgins et al 2004 the high conductivity is usually accompanied with the high concentration of ions in aqueous phase and the complexation is a dynamic equilibrium depending on the ratio of aqueous ions and complexation sites therefore the high concentration of aqueous ions should correspond to the high contents of complexing ions with solid compositions which allows for the surface charge neutralization and further facilitates the sludge dewaterability improvement biggs et al 2001 cousin and ganczarczyk 1999 higgins et al 2004 sobeck and higgins 2002 additionally due to the ion exchange between mono and divalent ions the ratio between monovalent m and divalent cations d cannot be higher than 2 meq l to ensure the superior dewaterability higgins and novak 1997b jin et al 2004 peeters et al 2011 it is reported that the high concentration monovalent cations such as k and na may weaken floc strength higgins and novak 1997b which is adverse to the dewatering performance however the quantitative correlation between ion strength and mechanical strength of bio flocs is still deficient furthermore how the complexed cations affect the molecular structure of sludge components e g extracellular proteins remains unclear this insufficiency may limit the understanding level of hydrophilic hydrophobic surface properties influenced by functional group conformation 3 5 eps eps are some high molecule weight compounds distributing both outside of cells and in the interior of microbial aggregates and account for 50 80 wt of the total organic fractions in sludge liu and fang 2003 the presence of eps prevents microorganisms from the severe external environment including ph change heavy metals and other toxic substances and also acts as the most exterior layers of microbial aggregates interacting with water molecules wu et al 2018c therefore the physiochemical properties of eps significantly affect the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of bio flocs and can be regarded as the most important determinant on the sludge dewaterability ge et al 2019 park and novak 2007 shao et al 2009 xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2018 yu et al 2008 3 5 1 content of eps primarily the correlation between sludge dewaterability and contents of eps was investigated some studies have shown that sludge dewaterability positively jin et al 2004 neyens et al 2004 or negatively li and yang 2007 neyens et al 2004 correlates with the eps content but some other studies thought eps content had few effects on sludge dewaterability ye et al 2011 for example using sludge samples from representative eight wastewater treatments of british houghton et al houghton and stephenson 2002 found that the optimal dewaterability could be obtained at eps content of 35 mg gdm as the eps content further increased or decreased exceeding a certain threshold a lower sludge dewaterability was observed the increasing eps content would lead to a lower shear sensitivity and lower degree of dispersion of sludge mikkelsen 2001 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 resulting in a better sludge flocculation through enhancing intercellular aggregation however as the eps content further increases and exceeds a certain threshold the water that is retained by the eps significantly increases which results in a lower sludge dewaterability at the same time the excessive eps content causes a fouling layer on the filter media and acts as a barrier for the water removal by mechanical means sponza 2002 however there are still some debates on the most appropriate contents of eps for the optimal sludge dewaterability these discrepancies may be due to the different sludge sources used in different studies another possible reason could be that the eps extraction efficiency varies significantly from the extraction methods the commonly used eps extraction methods such as ultrasonication centrifugation yu et al 2008 alkaline treatment sheng et al 2005 thermal treatment li and yang 2007 and hcho naoh treatment liu and fang 2002 may cause cell lysis and release of intracellular compounds and the extent of cell lysis during extraction is difficult to evaluate besides although the cation exchange resin method may cause a low degree of cell lysis but it may only extract compound complexed with ca2 mg2 sheng et al 2010 all these limitations of current eps methods may interfere with the quantification of total eps contents and further negatively influence the mechanistic investigation on how eps content impacts sludge dewaterability therefore the in situ analytical method for eps or the extraction methods targeting full solubilization of eps without releasing intracellular molecules is demanded 3 5 2 stratification of eps since the eps matrix is shear sensitive eriksson et al 1992a centrifugation and ultrasound are jointly applied to selectively extract the different eps layers soluble microbial products comprise soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps is the eps layer that can be removed by mild centrifugation the high intensity centrifugation with pre ultrasonication can extract tightly bound eps tb eps with the cognition of stratification structure of sludge flocs the effects of different eps fractions on sludge dewaterability were analyzed separately jia et al 2017 li and yang 2007 shao et al 2009 wen et al 2015 yu et al 2008 although the different operational parameters such as centrifugal force and ultrasonication power may lead to some difference in eps extraction amount it is widely accepted that the increasing lb eps decreases the dewaterability the loose flocs composed of lb eps could reduce the density difference between solid phase and water which maintains the stability of sludge flocs dispersing in water also the presence of gel like loose flocs increases binding strength of organic compositions to water retains much water in pore structure and so increases the amount of interstitial water dai et al 2018 higgins and novak 1997a li and yang 2007 yu et al 2008 zhen et al 2012b 2013b in addition some studies unified lb eps and soluble eps as slime eps which accounted for 18 40 of the total eps content and the removal of slime eps could decrease srf by 40 poxon and darby 1997 s eps and tb eps as compared with lb eps are often considered to be less crucial to dewaterability s eps can be removed with filtrate during dewatering process zhen et al 2012a tb eps protects the cell integrity zhou et al 2015 the lysis of tb eps would release the intracellular water sun et al 2018 yu et al 2008 zhen et al 2013b zhou et al 2015 on the other hand the increase of tb eps in a certain range could improve the shear resistance and help the water removal by centrifugation means mikkelsen and keiding 2002 3 5 3 compositions of eps eps matrix is formed by different bio chemicals secreted by microbes release of cellular material products by cell lysis or organic matter in the medium more et al 2014 sheng et al 2010 carbohydrates and proteins are the major components of eps in addition small amount of humic substances lipids nucleic acids uronic acids and some inorganic components have also been found in eps from various matrixes it is widely accepted that extracellular proteins comprise of major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 sponza 2002 yu et al 2010b yuan et al 2011 furthermore some other studies found that the polysaccharide and protein contribute to the positive and negative charges of eps respectively cetin and erdincler 2004 jin et al 2003 yu et al 2010b correspondingly the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and surface charge of sludge flocs depends on the content ratio of polysaccharide and protein in eps li et al 2012 wen et al 2015 the humic substances and nucleic acids have no significant effect on sludge dewaterability sheng et al 2010 the previous study also quantitatively analyzed the correlations among the compositions of different eps layers and sludge dewaterability yu et al 2008 the results showed that cst closely correlated with the lb eps protein content and the ratio of protein and polysaccharide in lb eps pearson coefficient 0 72 p value 0 01 however the protein polysaccharide in tb eps or the polysaccharide in lb eps both had no obvious correlation with cst pearson coefficient 0 2 which further indicated that the protein of eps was the key determinant on sludge dewaterability however the above quantitative results were all based on the conventional chromogenic methods i e lowry method for proteins and phenol sulphoacid method for polysaccharides which can only obtain the results expressed by the equivalent concentration of reference standards instead of absolute concentrations also the chromogenic methods may be interfered by the coexisting organic molecules or ions therefore more efforts should be devoted to further identifying the specific compositions of proteins and polysaccharides in eps currently regarding the specific components of eps three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy is the most used analytical method chen et al 2003 divided the 3d eem spectrum into the five specific fluorescence regions based on the excitation emission characteristics of different fluorescence compounds including aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like compounds tyrosine tryptophan protein like compounds and humic acid like compounds also in order to eliminate the overlap of different compositions in eps parallel factor parafac analysis is employed to separate the actual fluorescence spectra from the eem fluorescence spectra according to the reported tutorial stedmon and bro 2008 parafac analysis further confirmed that the improvement of sludge dewaterability is dominated by the tyrosine tryptophan protein like compounds but the humic acids and fulvic acid like compounds have limited correlations with sludge dewaterability baudez et al 2013 kim et al 2016 stedmon and bro 2008 xiao et al 2018 yu et al 2010a zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2013b recently the proteomics is introduced into the field of sludge researches because it can identify the origin molecular function and related biological processes of extracellular proteins wu et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2015a 2015b the corresponding studies realized that the membrane associated proteins and the proteins related to biological adhesion are mainly responsible for the main roles in water holding capacities of sludge flocs wu et al 2017c however the current eps extraction methods in proteomics often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells should be critically assessed the purification procedures of extracellular proteins are also needed to be optimized and standardized therefore we also propose that the in situ techniques e g microscopy and spectrophotometric coupled with genomics proteomics and glycomics should be developed to solve the above issues 3 5 4 molecular weight of eps except for compositions several studies further analyzed the correlation between eps polymerization and sludge dewaterability cao et al 2018 used the size exclusion chromatography sec with organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection ocd ond to distinguish the three main molar mass fractions as a macromolecular weight fraction 4000 da mainly consisting of carbohydrates and proteins a mid molecular weight fraction 1000 4000 da consisting of humic substances and peptides and a low molecular weight fraction 1000 da consisting of building blocks and organic acids it is generally recognized that the presence of eps with high molecular weight reflected the stable network structure formed by interlacing a large number of polymer molecules niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 due to the hydrophilic functional groups a large amount of water is bound in the net like polymeric molecules and maintains the stability of eps supported sludge flocs in water xiao et al 2017 instead the reduction of macromolecules in bound eps is usually accompanied with the substantial decrease of shear strength and instability of colloidal sludge flocs which are both in favor of the enhanced water removal xiao et al 2017 3 5 5 functional group and molecular structure of eps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps can be used for the functional group identification of eps some xps based studies found that the reductions of amino nitrogen nh2 and cyanogen nitrogen cn of eps were accompanied with the dewaterability improvement which reflected that the n containing functional groups could be the hydrophilic functional groups of eps xiao et al 2018 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir obtained the similar results with xps it was found that the addition of coagulants enhances the stretching vibrations of o h and c oh in ft ir spectra reflecting that the electrical neutralization causes the denser sludge flocs cetin and erdincler 2004 xu et al 2018 on the contrary advanced oxidation process aop weakens the peak strengths of o h and c n stretching vibration which indicates that the removal of hydrophilic functional groups oh and nh2 can improve the sludge dewaterability he et al 2015 xu et al 2016 recently efforts were also made to further deepen the analysis on hydrophilicity hydrophobicity into the aspect of molecular structure wu et al 2017b and xu et al 2018 applied circular dichroism cd spectra to track the changes of secondary structure of extracellular proteins during sludge conditioning the strong correlation rp 0 97 p 0 03 between the surface hydrophilicity index and α helix percentages of extracellular proteins was identified which indicates that the water affinity relies more on the spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups rather than the contents the destruction of secondary and tertiary structure of extracellular proteins and stretching or preventing the aggregation of polypeptide can be the key points for changing the hydrophilic properties of bio aggregates wu et al 2017b based on the current state of knowledge related to eps we propose that the molecular conformation of eps should be the significant basis for elucidating the physiochemical mechanism behind sludge dewaterability although some progress has been obtained there is still need to systematically analyze the quantitative correlations among hydrophilic hydrophobic functional groups of eps molecular conformation of eps and rheological properties of sludge flocs the potential correlations among tertiary structure quaternary structure and water binding properties are worth to be explored and how the specific hydrophilic components or molecular structure unit leading to physical or chemical binding of water molecule should be further identified in order to minimize the possible interference of variable eps compositions on mechanism analysis of sludge dewaterability 4 conditioning technologies for sludge dewaterability improvement 4 1 physical conditioning the physical conditioning refers to the technology for improving the sludge dewaterability by non chemical conditioning reagents or input energy in the form of heating freeze thawing sonication or electrical field 4 1 1 porous material addition non chemical conditioning reagents are commonly applied as the rigid porous materials to act as skeleton builders or filter aids due to the role that they have in reducing the compressibility and improving the permeability during compression these rigid porous materials include coal fly ash nelson and brattlof 1979 lignite qi et al 2011b thapa et al 2009a steel slag czaczyk and myszka 2007 gypsum zhao and bache 2001 wood chips lin et al 2001 and rice husk lee et al 2001 zhang et al 2019b the addition was usually 30 50 wt of dry matter correspondingly srf and compressibility coefficient could be reduced by 58 88 and 22 90 respectively qi et al 2011a in addition the inorganic porous materials could reduce the phosphorous content in filtrate through the formation of insoluble phosphate which eliminates the accumulation of negative charges on sludge particles and enhances the flocculation of sludge flocs chen et al 2010 djedidi et al 2009 however the addition of porous materials could increase the final volume of dewatered sludge and accordingly increase the disposal cost carbon based materials have advantages compared with other mineral based materials due to the capabilities of increasing the permeability but without decreasing the calorific value of sludge which is in favor of the incineration of dewatered sludge mowla et al 2013 besides the particle size of porous material should exceed 10 μm in order not to block the filtration media qi et al 2011a 4 1 2 sonication besides non chemical conditioning reagents some other physical approaches have also been used to alter the micro structure of sludge flocs for dewaterability improvement for this purpose cavitation seems to offer immense potential and received special attention during recent years acoustic cavitation is generated by the use of low frequency ultrasound the ultrasound is cyclic sound compression and expansion with a frequency greater than 20 khz due to this cyclic negative pressure acoustic cavitation occurs through mechanical shear forces these ultrasonic stresses rupture the microbial cell wall and release the intracellular organics into the aqueous phase chen et al 2001 gogate and kabadi 2009 huan et al 2009 khanal et al 2006 2007 yin et al 2004 which helps to disintegrate the biological flocs and homogenize sludge by forming sponge like properties cai et al 2018 mowla et al 2013 however there are also controversial conclusions on the effect of sonication on dewaterability bien bien and wolny 1997 and hogan hogan et al 2004 reported that ultra sonication could enhance the sludge dewaterability while wang et al 2006 thought the release of intracellular polymers and disintegration of cells would deteriorate dewaterability feng et al 2009b reported that the effects of sonication on sludge dewaterability depends on the energy input the optimal ultrasonic energy input was determined to be 800 kj kg total solid ts despite the above existing debate on the effectiveness of sonication the difficulty in scale up is also the main limitation for the engineering application of acoustic cavitation hydrodynamic cavitation is a process using orifice plate or venturi in liquid flow path to increase the local velocity of sludge flow according to bernoulli law this increase in velocity causes a local pressure decrease which results in cavities if the local pressure is less than vapor pressure of the media at the operating temperature mowla et al 2013 similar to ultra sonication the cavities generated by hydrodynamic cavitation could also disrupt cell wall and enhance the release of intracellular water caulfield 2012 gogate and kabadi 2009 these changes were thought to be effective in decreasing the water content limit of sludge dewatered by mechanical compression however the optimization of flow regime should be crucial for hydrodynamic cavitation to exert conditioning effect no chemical addition is needed by cavitation based conditioning but the energy consumption in cavitation should be carefully compared with other conditioning technologies 4 1 3 thermal treatment another widely reported physical approach for sludge conditioning is thermal pretreatment thermal hydrolysis refers to the process heating sludge up to 60 180 c in the sealed environment which accelerates the dissolution of lipids and carbohydrates and the release of intracellular proteins bound within the cell wall tunçal 2011 wang and li 2015 wang et al 2010 2014 previous studies baohong et al 2012 everett 1974 neyens et al 2003 yu et al 2014 also found that the thermal process could promote the breakdown of gel like sludge flocs the degree of floc disintegration by thermal hydrolysis depended on the applied temperature and holding time the temperature of 175 c and holding time of 10 30 min were reported as the optimal conditions for maximizing the ammonia acid volatile acids and monosaccharide in liquid phase which was also accompanied with the decrease in the viscosity and increase of filterability of the treated sludge everett 1974 wang et al 2010 hydrothermal conditions temperature 180 250 c pressure 1 4 mpa can induce series of transformations that cannot occur at ambient temperature including hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation and aromatization wang et al 2014 as a result the hydrophilic functional groups of organic compositions can be removed by hydrothermal treatment the carbonization of sludge significantly decreases the water holding capacities however due to maillard reactions the drawback of hydrothermal treatment is generating a large amount of refractory organic wastewater containing heterocyclic nitrogen compounds the equipment corrosion occurring in the hydrothermal treatment should also be carefully prevented currently there are few engineering cases using hydrothermal treatment specifically for the sludge dewaterability improvement microwave treatment is a process using electromagnetic wave with wave length of 0 1 mm 1 m and frequency of 300 mhz 3 thz for thermal input to sludge wojciechowska 2005 and yu yu et al 2009 both verified the positive effects of microwave treatment under alkaline conditions on sludge dewaterability however similar with cavitation it s technically difficult and uneconomical to scale up the high power microwave generator for sludge pretreatment 4 1 4 freezing and thawing freezing thawing conditioning is an effective physical way to reduce the bound water content by inducing the changes in floc structure of sewage sludge during the cyclic freezing thawing process sludge is first frozen at temperatures below the freezing point of water around 20 c to 15 c and kept at this state for a while following the thawing process at room temperature mowla et al 2013 due to the formation of homogeneous ice crystal the water molecule is fixed into the ice crystal and sludge particles are excluded outside the crystal structure which realizes the solid liquid separation with ice thawing the water is discharged and concentrated solid can be collected separately martel 1993 tunçal 2011 franceschini et al franceschini 2010 investigated the effects of cyclic number of freeze thaw processes and freezing temperature on the dewaterability improvement the repeated freezing thawing operation leads to the crystallization of intracellular water and its volume expansion this process is accompanied with cell swelling phenomenon and reduce the bound water fraction including intracellular water which is beneficial for the deep dehydration of sludge however how to quantify the released intracellular water and how significant cell swelling contributes to the dewaterability improvement are worth to be further discussed in addition the freezing thawing conditioning is normally practical in the regions with cold climate the large energy consumption for the repeated freezing thawing operation limits the widespread implementation of this technology 4 1 5 electrical treatment the electrical filed combined with mechanical compression is well suited for enhanced dewatering of sludge to the water content below 50 wt the presence of amphoteric functional group e g cooh and nh2 makes the sludge particles negatively charged the migration of charged particles driven by electrical field causes the accumulation of sludge particles on the cathode anode that has the opposite charges and further enhances the solid liquid separation mahmoud et al 2018b in addition the electrically driven movement of hydrated ions in the water phase creates the concentration gradient of ions and accordingly enhances the water diffusion in sludge mahmoud et al 2011 as a result the water osmosis through the permeable polar plate acts as another way of water removal from sludge however few researches quantitatively or visually tracked the electro driven ion migration it would be meaningful to calculate the osmotic pressure due to the gradient distribution of hydrated ions furthermore the electrolysis of water partially contributes to the reduction of water content in sludge the electrolysis also causes the degradation of eps layer and lysis of microbial cells which destroys the stability of sludge flocs decreases the viscosity and reduces the bound water percentage mahmoud et al 2010 2018a the recent study thought that joule heat generated during electro conditioning process also ruptures cells disperses microbial cell aggregations and decreases the viscosity of solid liquid mixture which are both beneficial for the improvement of dewaterability lv et al 2019 mahmoud et al 2011 various electro dewatering equipment have been developed in the last decades 10 60 v direct current voltage decreased the water content of sludge below 40 wt chu et al 2005 esmaeily et al 2006 lai 2001 tuan et al 2008 zhou et al 2001 the combination of mechanical compression and electrical field could realize the higher dewatering efficiency than that of dewatering process only assisted by electrical filed gazbar et al 1994 laursen and jensen 1993 yuan 2002 yuan and weng 2003 cao et al 2019 made some attempts to use carbon based materials as amendment during electro dewatering of sludge which helped increase the conductivity decreased the energy consumption and adsorbed s eps to improve filterability however the high energy consumption 1 5 3 kwh kgdm and corrosion of polar plates may still be the main obstacles for the factory scale application of electrical sludge dewatering mahmoud et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a the long term operation status and operation life of electro dewatering equipment should be monitored 4 2 chemical conditioning the chemical conditioning refers to the technology for improving the dewaterability through altering the physio chemical properties of sludge by use of chemicals according to the reaction types the chemical conditioning of sludge can be generally categorized as coagulation flocculation aop acid base and enzymatic treatment 4 2 1 coagulation flocculation common coagulation reagents include inorganic salt coagulants represented by ferric and aluminum salts turchiuli and fargues 2004 investigated the conditioning performance of two small molecule inorganic coagulants al2 so4 3 and fecl3 in sludge suspensions they pointed out that the alum induced flocs were larger and more compact than ferric ones resulting in the faster settling performance but the presence of s eps may consume added al3 through chelation and increase the demand of aluminum coagulants yang et al 2019 ferric salts may have advantages than alum salts in sludge conditioning due to their low cost fast settling velocity of ferric flocs lower toxicity wider ph range of applications and better effect under low temperatures bratby 2006 lee et al 2014 in addition chen chen et al 2015 wei wei et al 2018a and yu yu et al 2016 found the stronger affinity of ferrous ions with protein like substances than alum ions which results in the better coagulation for hydrophilic compositions of eps however the use of ferric salts as coagulants may aggravate the corrosion of agitation equipment and structures alternatively the combined use of titanium salts magnesium salts and alkaline conditions has been attracting growing attention due to the minimal negative environmental effects wang et al 2016b wu et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 there are some studies analyzing the conditioning effects of alum ions with different chemical forms cao et al 2016 pambou et al 2016 the results showed that compared with monomer forms of aluminum almon al13 mainly made up of middle polymerization of aluminum and alun primarily composed of high polymerization of aluminum make the sludge flocs with smaller particle size and weaker compressibility but denser and more stable flocs al13 and alun have the better coagulation effect on protein like substances of eps therefore they exhibited the better performance than almon for sludge dewaterability improvement the polymeric multivalent inorganic salts have the high charge density and molecular weight which could facilitate the charge balance with a low dosage watanabe et al 1999 it was previously reported that polymeric ferric sulfate pfs could realize nearly 100 neutralization of negative charge but that was only 50 by the same dosage of fecl3 watanabe et al 1999 zhang et al 2014 conducted the comparative analysis of s eps removal by polymeric aluminum chloride pacl polymeric ferric chloride pfc and composite coagulant which indicated that the content of s eps the absolute value of zeta potential and the dosage of polymeric inorganic salts positively correlated with srf pacl and pfc could lead to the larger sludge particle size but looser floc structure than that induced by fecl3 and generally exhibited the better dewatering conditioning performance niu et al 2013 besides polymeric ferric and alum salts zhao et al 2016 developed the synthesis method for covalently bound organic aluminum silicate coagulant which had the higher polymerization degree larger molecular weight and stronger dewatering conditioning capacity than conventional coagulants flocculants are commonly recognized as the macromolecular polymers taking effects by adsorption bridging reactions on sludge particles which increases the floc size and enhances the solid liquid separation by enlarging the density difference due to the negatively charged sludge particles cationic polyacrylamide cpam and derivatives are the most widely used flocculants for sludge dewatering cpam is efficient in destabilizing sludge colloidal flocs through charge neutralization and also the function of re aggregating fine sludge particles cpam is synthesized by the copolymerization of cationic monomers and acrylamide am the cationic monomers include 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride dac methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and dimethyldiallyammonium chloride dmdaac sun et al 2016 yang et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 in addition to cpam several cationic polymeric flocculants with special structures have been reported for example the polymer with cationic microblock structure of am and dac the novel cationic polyamidine with a ring like structural unit of five carbon atoms and the flocculant with strong cationic hydrophobic regions have been developed chen et al 2016 guo et al 2017 which can achieve the srf of 2 1012 m kg with the dosage of 0 3 wt dm in order to minimize the secondary pollution of sludge conditioning the biodegradable and non toxic polymers from natural source are applied for improving sludge dewaterability grafting modification is a useful method that introduces positive pieces onto natural polymers e g polysaccharide based polymers as branch chains such as starch graft 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride stc g dmc starch graft dimethyl ammonium chloride stc g dmdaac lv et al 2014 pourjavadi et al 2013 and chitosan based polymers guibal et al 2006 wang et al 2016a bio flocculants are also regarded as natural polymers based conditioning reagents the previous study applied microbial bio flocculants produced by rhodococcus erythropolis separated from alkali assisted thermally pretreated sludge the final solid content and srf of sludge reached 22 5 and 3 4 1012 m kg respectively after 30 min filtration at vacuum degree of 0 05 mpa guo and ma 2015 we believe that the key challenges for sludge coagulation flocculation is how to select the appropriate conditioning chemicals according to the physiochemical properties of target sludge whether the polymeric multivalent inorganic salts and organic flocculants are jointly or separately used should depend on a theoretical basis instead of engineering experience due to the complexity and variability of sewage sludge the reliable indicators for real time control of conditioning operations are necessary but still deficient e g dynamic dosage regulation of conditioning chemicals that deficiency may lead to the excessive addition of conditioning reagents correspondingly the potential environmental risks of coagulants flocculants should be taken into more consideration especially the chlorine introduced by commonly used pacl and pfc may increase the risk of dioxin formation during incineration of dewatered sludge but the related systematical analysis is still insufficient the commercial instruments widely used in the coagulation treatment of wastewater with high turbidity have realized the real time monitoring of particle size distribution through laser scattering we propose that these instruments may facilitate the process monitoring of sludge conditioning in addition corresponding to the discussion in section 3 2 it would be interesting to in situ observe coagulation agglomeration or adsorption bridging by synchrotron x ray microtomography that will be beneficial for unraveling the coagulation flocculation mechanism and also help to screen the effective coagulant flocculant reagents in changing sludge microstructure as a result a database of conditioning chemicals can be established for optimal selection of the appropriate reagents towards different sludge sources which would also improve the effectiveness of engineering design 4 2 2 acid base treatment naoh ca oh 2 and cao are the representative base conditioning reagents li et al 2008 from the positive aspect alkaline pretreatment can disrupt bio flocs and cells of microorganisms in the sludge which enhances the reduction of bound water li et al 2009 but towards the negative aspect the deterioration of dewaterability can be caused by the excessive accumulation of organic matters in slime fractions which may increase the filtration resistance shao et al 2012 therefore low dose naoh treatment 10 wt dm deteriorated sludge dewatering ability obviously while the ability can be restored to some extent by the treatment with high dosage 10 30 wt dm li et al 2008 ca oh 2 is more appropriate for improving sludge dewaterability than naoh because ca2 can facilitate the re flocculation of soluble organic compositions which would counteract the negative effect brought about by excessive disintegration of sludge li et al 2009 su et al 2013 cao can reduce the water content of sludge by exothermic hydration reaction but probably with the drawbacks of volume increase of pretreated sludge as discussed in section 3 4 the acidic ph range could also regulate the surface charge of sludge particles disintegrate bio flocs and reduce the bound water however according to some other studies the excessive acidification can deteriorate the filterability by lysis of sludge flocs which results in the release of fine particles into liquid phase posing the risk of filtration media blocking li et al 2005 macdonald et al 2018 raynaud et al 2012 therefore the appropriate acidity for sludge dewaterability improvement still needs to be determined on various types of sludge additionally some literature found free nitrous acid or sulfuric acid could degrade eps leading to the loss of water binding capacity and opened bacteria cells with intracellular water freed chen et al 2001 wei et al 2018b since the spatial conformation of hydrophilic hydrophobic functional groups significantly influences the surface properties of eps matrix some organic acids including tannic acid and peracetic acid were recently reported to improve the sludge dewaterability by inducing the denaturation of hydrophilic protein like substances or regulating the spatial distribution of water holding substances devlin et al 2011 ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b which should be the preliminary attempts to improve the sludge dewaterability by modifying the molecular structure of eps 4 2 3 aop according to the discussion in section 3 5 the presence of eps dominantly leads to the existence of bound water the substantial lysis and release of eps contributes to the release of intracellular water and interstitial water in sludge flocs therefore the approaches represented by aop aiming at destruction of cell walls and eps were widely reported for the dewaterability improvement of sludge fenton reaction was first verified to be effective in eliminating the water holding capacity of eps the highly reactive and non selective oh eo oh h h2o 2 813 vnhe could enhance the degradation and de polymerization of eps buyukkamaci 2004 unlike fenton reactions occurring under acidic conditions the thermally activated kim et al 2016 transition metal catalyzed li et al 2019 zhen et al 2012a and electrically catalyzed zhen et al 2013b na2s2o8 nahso5 peroxymonosulfate pms and nahs2o8 peroxydisulfate pds can induce the radical based oxidation in the neutralized ph range our previous studies investigated the performance of nano scale cao2 in sludge conditioning which also effectively improved the dewaterability under near neutral conditions wu et al 2016b 2017a in addition microwave induced peroxidation zhou et al 2014 and tio2 based light catalysis liu et al 2013a were able to improve the dewaterability and biodegradability in anaerobic digestion simultaneously with elimination of fe2 addition recently in order to minimize the dosage of aop based conditioning reagents the heterogeneous fenton reaction using zero valence iron as catalyst was applied to sludge that provided the possibility of magnetic recovery and reuse of heterogeneous catalyst zero valence iron li et al 2018 similarly tao et al 2019 converted fenton treated sludge into fe rich biochar by pyrolysis and the obtained fe rich biochar was used to induce the heterogeneous fenton for raw sludge as a result a near zero disposal system was established although aop was verified to be effective in sludge dewaterability improvement yet most of the existing studies only focused on the aop induced changes in micromorphology of sludge flocs and contents of different eps fractions s eps lb eps and tb eps he et al 2015 kim et al 2016 mo et al 2015 shao et al 2009 yang and li 2009 zhen et al 2013b zhou et al 2015 based on the correlative analysis among eps fractions and dewaterability it is widely recognized that extracellular proteins comprise are the major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2010b yuan et al 2011 therefore we analyzed the aop induced change of hydrophilic properties of extracellular protein mixture identified and relatively quantified the extracellular proteins of sludge pre and post aop and also revealed the aop induced molecular structure alteration of representative extracellular proteins with implications on the hydrophilicity of biological aggregates wu et al 2017b however there still may be some debate on whether the aop caused dewaterability improvement is due to the radical oxidation of macromolecular eps or the coagulation induced by inorganic catalysts of aop e g ferrous salts since the dosage of these heterogeneous catalysts can be as high as 10 20 wt dm of raw sludge in another word there may be some misunderstandings in the functions of aop in sludge dewaterability improvement also radical oxidation is a non selective reaction some of the added aop reagents may be consumed by the unfavorable reactions for sludge dewaterability improvement therefore we insist that to what extent aop influences the molecular compositions of eps with implications to sludge dewaterability needs to be further clarified and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms could be a useful tool to track the variations in chemical formulas of eps e g unsaturation degree double bond equivalent and aromatic index and the atom numbers of c h o and n as a result it can help us figure out how much of the added aop reagents are consumed by the favorable reactions for hydrophilicity reduction of eps furthermore whether and how we can reduce the consumption of aop based conditioning chemicals could be determined 4 2 4 enzymatic treatment similar with aop the hydrolysis enzymes could promote the degradation of eps resulting in the destruction of viscous bio flocs and reduce the water holding capacity of sludge but the dosage of hydrolysis enzymes is usually much lower than that of oxidants which correspondingly has less environmental risk lü et al 2016 pinpointed the effectiveness of various enzymes including amylase cellulase proteinase dnase and polygalacturonase by quantifying the spatial distribution of each type of organic matters protein polysaccharide dna fluorescent organics in outer layer eps inner layer eps and cells the results indicated that polygalacturonase unexpectedly increased the total eps polysaccharides up to seven times accompanied with improved dewaterability and cellulose hydrolysis led to massive release of all kinds of organic matters lü et al 2016 ayol et al ayol 2005 ayol and dentel 2005 lu et al 2011 and our previous study wu et al 2016a confirmed the feasibility of dewatering sewage sludge and cellulosic sludge by composite hydrolysis enzyme and dentel et al dentel and dursun 2009 evaluated the performance of enzyme assisted dewatering from the perspective of shear sensitivity of digested sludge these studies highlighted the advantages of composite enzymes in sludge conditioning including non toxicity biodegradability and low dosage requirement but the long retention time and harsh reaction conditions could be the limitations for the scale up application of enzyme based sludge dewatering conditioning in addition the enzyme specificity would also be the obstacle to select appropriate enzymes for treating sewage sludge with complex compositions 5 effects of conditioning operations on utilization of dewatered sewage sludge dewatering conditioning improves the sludge dewaterability with simultaneously altering extracellular proteins polysaccharides releasing nitrogen phosphorus nutrients and influencing the chemical speciation of heavy metals therefore it is necessary to investigate the potential impacts of sludge conditioning on the subsequent disposal or utilization process 5 1 resource recovery since 30 50 of chemical oxygen demand cod 20 30 of total nitrogen and 90 of total phosphorus are transformed into sludge during the biological process the resource recovery has become one of the promising objectives of sludge treatment anaerobic fermentation is a typical approach which can simultaneously realize the recovery of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and improve the dewaterability for example chen et al chen et al 2007 feng et al 2009a yuan et al 2006 zhang and chen 2009 produced volatile fatty acids vfa from anaerobic fermentation and further used them as the supplementary carbon source for the enhanced biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus furthermore after the dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus during anaerobic fermentation process were recovered by struvite sludge srf and cst decreased by 96 9 and 99 6 respectively based on the similar principle li et al 2017b developed the similar process named as airprex which adjusts ph of sludge to 7 8 by air injection following the addition of mgcl2 to facilitate the crystallization of struvite the removal of phosphate relieves the struvite scaling reduces the negative charge density and accordingly helps the reduction of dewatering conditioning reagent dosage wang et al 2018b rittmann cusick and zhen et al cusick and logan 2012 lee and rittmann 2011 zhen et al 2013a analyzed the impacts of conditioning techniques e g electrolysis and aop on nutrient release the results showed that the direct current dc output at 35 kwh m3 increased the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p volatile fatty acids polysaccharides and proteins by 110 460 in aqueous phase that disintegration of sludge flocs provided the possibilities of improving the dewaterability with simultaneous recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from the aqueous phase some other studies analyzed the migration and transformation of heavy metals during sludge conditioning process the techniques integrating dewaterability improvement and heavy metal stabilization extraction were developed for example bio char hua et al 2009 coal fly ash fang et al 1999 and lime fang and wong 1999 could decrease the leaching risk of heavy metals and simultaneously improve the dewaterability by maintaining the sludge permeability during filter pressing liu et al 2012a 2012b found that bioleaching process could also improve the dewaterability and synchronously enhance the solubilization of heavy metals through increasing oxidation reduction potential orp and decreasing ph silva et al 2019 reported that the electrochemically assisted dewatering process can also help to exhaust the organic pollutants e g herbicide clopyralid antibiotics amoxicillin and ampicillin adsorbed onto the sludge which is beneficial for avoiding the diffusion of hazardous pollution during sludge land application according to the discussion in this section the sludge conditioning process generally has positive effects on the resource recovery of sewage sludge especially the nutrient recovery based on the disintegration of sludge flocs the integration of sludge conditioning and nutrient recovery should be a promising way worth to be further extended 5 2 energy recovery anaerobic digestion is the major way of sludge treatment towards energy recovery as the form of methane joo et al 2016 however conventional anaerobic digestion requires the solid content below 5 wt liao and li 2015 yin et al 2016 and the anaerobic digestion of dewatered sludge probably leads to the local accumulation of volatile fatty acids inhibiting the activity of methanogens appels et al 2011 shen et al 2015 yin et al 2016 although some recent attempts applied thermal hydrolysis to dewatered sludge solid content of 10 20 wt for improving anaerobic digestion performance the large energy consumption and high operation cost could still be the drawbacks dai et al 2013a duan et al 2012 in addition the most commonly used conditioning reagents including pacl and pfc inhibit the methanogenic activity through ph drop induced by al3 fe3 hydrolysis chaudhari et al 2007 it was reported that al3 suppressed the metabolism process related to the reduction of co2 by h2 which resulted in the decrease of ch4 production wu et al 2019c the use of cpam inevitably introduces the toxic monomer acrylamide into sludge and poses negative effects on the hydrolysis stage of anaerobic digestion and also increases risks for agricultural application dai et al 2013b wang et al 2018a however due to the low cost and wide range of source no viable alternatives with low environmental impacts can currently replace pacl and pfc to what extent al3 and fe3 inhibit the biological conversion of waste activated sludge or methane production still needs to be further quantitively studied if the added value of sludge utilization e g energy recovery or resource recovery is too low to balance the operational cost of dewatering unit the minor improvement of conditioning reagents with cost increase cannot be acceptable by engineering applications therefore the technical progress is still expected to overcome the conflict between economic performance and environmental impact of conditioning reagents that s also the reason why most of the conditioning technologies reviewed in section 4 cannot be commercialized for decades one approach capable of achieving several treatment and recovery goals for biosolids would be combustion based technologies associated with incineration gasification or pyrolysis the self sustained incineration of sludge commonly requires the water content below 60 wt currently it is necessary to use pacl and pfc with the dosages higher than 5 wt in order to help the sludge dewatered by mechanical pressure filtration meet the water content limit of 60 wt the large addition of inorganic coagulant containing chlorine decreases the sludge calorific value stresses the pollution control of incineration flue gas and aggravates device corrosion the existing results indicated that 10 wt dm of cao decreased the dry base caloric value of sludge over 15 barber 2007 kijo kleczkowska et al 2016 xu et al 2014 compared with the pacl added dosage 2 wt dm and pam added dosage 0 05 wt dm sludge the chlorine containing conditioning reagents would increase the dioxin concentration in flue gas by 3 times chang et al 2013 lin et al 2015 pyrolysis is another thermochemical technology that can be applied to dewatered sludge for energy recovery tian et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 limited studies specifically focus on the effect of conditioning operation on pyrolysis performance such as bio oil yield or flammable gas yield the previous study attempted to use fe2 so4 3 as amendment for producing fe amended char and minimizing the bio crude yield of sludge pyrolysis yu et al 2018 while the addition of aluminum based conditioning reagent could facilitate the pore forming of bio char zhang et al 2013 and the fixation of phosphorus in solid phase thomsen et al 2017 the conditioning agent cao was found to be capable of fixing sulfur in solid products and accordingly improve the syngas quality of sludge pyrolysis liu et al 2014 tang et al 2018 however how the types and dosages of conditioning reagents affect the chemical transformations during sludge pyrolysis is still worth to be systematically analyzed especially the potential of added conditioning reagents in improving the qualities of pyrolysis produced fuel oil and flammable gas can be further explored recent studies developed the water extraction process by hydrate formation for free conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge and the dewatered sludge could be accordingly used as solid fuel to balance the energy consumption of water extraction process our previous study wu et al 2018a and oshita et al li et al 2014 oshita et al 2011 2012 used propane and dimethyl ether as hydrate precursor respectively and the energy consumption of hydrate based dewatering could be partially balanced 30 50 by the subsequent incineration of dewatered sludge according to the above discussion most of existing dewatering conditioning approaches have negative effects on the energy recovery from sewage sludge especially due to the biological toxicity of conditioning reagents and the secondary pollution risks caused by conditioning operations the environmentally friendly or free conditioning dewatering processes for sludge treatment are still demanded to significantly improve the energy utilization efficiency of sewage sludge 5 3 regeneration as functional materials due to the carbon rich characteristic of sewage sludge and its transition metal constituents with various catalytic performances the thermal conversion of dewatered sewage sludge into high value added carbonaceous materials has become a prospective direction for sludge utilization for example several studies found that fe containing residue of pfc pretreated sludge after pyrolysis can be used as the heterogeneous catalyst of fenton reaction yuan and dai 2016 accordingly the sludge based fe loaded fenton catalyst was developed for the oxidative degradation of acid orange ii tu et al 2012 yuan et al yuan and dai 2014 synthesized an alternative sludge based functional material via a facile one step calcination method at 350 c for 3 h and demonstrated its efficiency and stability as a heterogeneous photo fenton catalyst similarly hou et al 2016 reported the feasibility of fe rich sludge served as a catalytic particle electrode in the electro fenton process ai et al 2019 used carbon based functional material obtained from kmno4 fe ii conditioning sludge to remove toxic arsenic from contaminant ground water xu et al 2014 used cao pretreated sludge for the production of cement matrix our previous study wu et al 2018b used k2feo4 oxidation to improve the dewaterability of sludge and the pretreated sludge containing fe was further thermally converted into fe doped sludge derived mesoporous material for re utilizing it as the catalyst of aop and filtration aid which effectively integrated the enhanced dewatering process and resource utilization of sludge according to the discussion in this section the added conditioning reagents can be chemically converted into the key functional compositions during the synthesis of the sludge based materials however the systematical design for scaling up these processes is still demanded and life cycle assessment should be significantly taken into consideration moreover the development of high value added products from sewage sludge for example the functional materials for greenhouse gas emission control or flue gas treatment is still worth to be further explored 6 concluding remarks dewatering is an essential process for the appropriate treatment of sewage sludge continuous effects in the last decades have been devoted to revealing the influencing factors on sludge dewaterability and developing highly efficient conditioning technologies however the critical review presented here indicates that there are still many unsettled issues about either mechanistic researches or factory scale applications from our point view the required development could include 1 the thermodynamic analysis on the solid liquid interfacial interaction in sludge is still insufficient the quantitative characterization on the binding strength of water molecules to solid phase is expected also in order to accurately evaluate the sludge dewaterability and optimize the energy consumption of dewatering process more efforts should be devoted to quantifying the different water fractions we believe that a better understanding of water occurrence states in sewage sludge will consolidate the theoretical foundation of water removal from highly hydrophilic bio aggregates 2 although a variety of physiochemical properties were verified to have correlations with the dewaterability a unified theory for the improvement of sludge dewaterability is still deficient the exact physiochemical mechanism for the water holding capacities of bio flocs needs to be further deepened more importance can be attached to how the molecular conformation of eps influences the water solid interface behavior and the in situ visualization methods would be promising for unveiling the related mechanism through the micro scale characterization of sludge constituents 3 various physical and chemical approaches have been developed to improve sludge dewaterability however how to select the appropriate conditioning technique for the sludge with the specific physiochemical properties remains unclear despite the bench scale dewatering measurements of cst and srf we propose that the reliable indicators are still deficient for real time control of conditioning operations some recently developed machine learning technologies for example artificial neutral network can be attempted to clarify the complex non linear relationships among sludge compositions rheological properties and dewaterability 4 more attention should be paid to the effects of conditioning operations on the subsequent re utilization or safe disposal of sewage sludge dewatering can be taken as an intermediate link enhancing resource value instead of the volume reduction step facilitating sludge disposal the technical progress in conditioning approaches is expected to facilitate the re utilization of sewage sludge accordingly only if the added value of sludge utilization e g energy recovery or resource recovery is able to fully or partially balance the operational cost of dewatering unit the improvement of conditioning approach with cost increase can be acceptable by engineering implementations 5 to minimize the environmental impacts of sludge conditioning processes some novel environmentally friendly technical means including extracellular protein denaturation water extraction by hydrate formation and osmotic technique can be explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17866,sewage sludge mainly composed of excessive bio sludge is an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment process and contains various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and organic contaminants the production of sewage sludge may cause serious pollution risks without appropriate disposals as the essential step of sludge treatment dewatering plays significant roles in minimizing the sludge volume facilitating the transportation increasing the calorific value and even reducing the leachate production in landfill sites this paper presents a comprehensive review on the issues related to dewatering of sewage sludge section 1 starts with the environmental implications of sludge dewatering section 2 deals with the concepts and challenges about differentiation of bound water fractions and also reviews the recent progress of in situ visualization of water occurrence states in bio flocs section 3 discusses about how various physiochemical properties influence

section section 5 specifically analyzes the feasibility of integrating sludge dewatering and re utilization and raises attention to the potential environmental risks of dewatering conditioning based on the above discussion we propose that a unified theory for sludge dewaterability improvement remains to be established especially how the molecular structures of sludge compositions affect the solid water interface behavior requires to be deepened which will further unravel the mechanism behind strong water holding capacities of bio flocs additionally we believe that the key challenges for sludge dewatering is how to select the appropriate conditioning technique according to the physiochemical properties of target sludge the reliable indicators for real time control of conditioning operations are still deficient e g dynamic dosage control of conditioning chemicals accordingly the potential environmental risks of excessive conditioning chemicals should be taken into more consideration

wastewater treatment is the most frequently employed technology in wastewater treatment plants worldwide mahmoud et al 2013 however sewage sludge mainly composed of excessive bio sludge is an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment and contains various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and organic contaminants which may cause serious pollution risks if without appropriate disposals see table 1 with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization the production of sewage sludge continues to increase worldwide along with the increasing demand for sanitation and water treatment facilities cieślik et al 2015 for example the daily wastewater treatment capacity in china has increased rapidly since 2008 and accordingly the sewage sludge production had an average annual growth of 10 7 and rose to 11 75 million ton dry matter dm in 2019 mohurd 2020 the united states has an average annual sewage sludge production of 17 8 million ton dm in the last decade epa 2018 in terms of the typical developed countries in asia pacific region australia and japan produce 0 36 and 2 2 million ton dm per year respectively awa 2018 jswa 2017 the sewage sludge production in european union is around 9 0 million ton dm per year eurostat 2018 therefore the large production of sewage sludge worldwide determines that the sludge treatment should account for a significant proportion of secondary pollution control of wastewater treatment plants as the essential step for appropriate sludge treatments dewatering can minimize the sludge volume facilitate the transportation increase the efficiency of energy utilization and even reduce the leachate production in sludge landfill sites mahmoud et al 2013 wong et al 2016 however sludge is difficult to be dewatered directly due to the highly hydrated colloidal structures of microbial aggregates christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a the previous studies already investigated the multiple influencing factors on sludge dewaterability and many efforts have also been devoted to improving sludge dewaterability by various approaches however there is still lack of a comprehensive review involving all the relevant issues about sludge dewatering and limited literatures specifically focused on the potential effects of dewatering conditioning on the subsequent utilization of sewage sludge christensen et al 2015 mowla et al 2013 qi et al 2011a this review provides state of the art knowledge with regards to the water distribution in sludge the influencing factors on sludge dewaterability and the approaches for sludge dewaterability improvement especially the insufficiency of existing researches on quantitative water differentiation is pointed out and the future research need for mechanism investigation on strong water holding properties of bio flocs is proposed the importance is attached on the molecular conformation of sludge compositions in addition the special emphasis is laid on the effects of conditioning operations on re utilization of dewatered sewage sludge the engineering implication of dewatering is extended from disposal to high value sludge re utilization through the review we expect that sludge dewatering can be systematically and compendiously understood from fundamentals to implementations 2 water occurrence states in bio flocs of sewage sludge the presence of organic phase in sludge makes a certain part of water embedded in a bio polymeric network and behave very differently from the bulk water heukelekian and weisberg 1956 therefore it is primarily necessary to understand the water occurrence states in bio flocs which is also the basis for optimizing the water removal efficiency and energy consumption of sludge dewatering process 2 1 definition of free water and bound water primarily the energy definition was proposed by catalano et al catalano 1970 in this context an interaction energy is defined as the energy necessary to break the binding of water to solid material bound water refers to the water bound to solid phase with a specific binding energy of x kcal mol and free water is the state of water unaffected by solid phase based on the energy definition lee 1996 further proposed that the capability of bound water to resist freezing under low temperatures is attributed to the lowering of its thermodynamic activity by the water solid bond strength they proposed the relationship between water solid binding energy and crystallization temperature of bound water as lee 1996 1 e b t s h t f 0 t f 0 δ h f where eb is the binding energy between water and solid phase tsh and tf0 are the crystallization temperature of bound water and free water δhf is the standard enthalpy of ice formation according to equation 1 the higher binding energy leads to the lower crystallization temperature in another word the capacity of bound water to resist freezing under low temperature conditions increases with the increasing binding energy with solid phase therefore to choose a freezing temperature is thereby equivalent to set a binding energy dividing the bound non bound water in sludge accordingly two quantification methods of bound water through the measurement of unfrozen water at the specific freezing temperature were established colin and gazbar 1995 he et al 2015 lee 1996 smith and vesilind 1995 wu et al 1998 heukelekian and smith measured the bound water content by monitoring the volume expansion rate at 20 c heukelekian and weisberg 1956 smith and vesilind 1995 lee et al applied the thermogravimetry to measure the entropy of sludge freezing at 20 c and derived the unfrozen bound water based on the water crystallization entropy lee and lee 1995 however how to select the appropriate freezing temperature for quantifying bound water in sludge is still a controversial issue 2 2 differentiation of bound water fractions the total amount of bound water can be quantified by the energy definition however vesilind and lee lee 1994 vesilind 1994 further distinguished the classifications of bound water in sludge based on arbitrary hypotheses called operational definition the operational definition regards the water that can be eliminated by simple thickening or by weak mechanical strains as free water bound water is the water fixed to solid phase by chemical bindings hydrogen bond physical adsorption and mechanical capture in both micro and macrocapillaries of capillary porous bodies and is hard to be removed from the sludge body using mechanical means of dewatering according to the above interactions between bound water and sludge floc structure vesilind et al vesilind 1994 moller et al möller 1983 and smollen et al smollen 1988 refined the four water fractions as free or bulk water interstitial water vicinal water and water of hydration fig 1 our previous studies visually tracked the micro spatial water distribution in bio flocs of sewage sludge through in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography the two fractions of bound water the vicinal water adhering to the surface of organic compositions and the interstitial water mechanically trapped in the net like structure of bio flocs were identified based on the cross section x ray imaging results wu et al 2018c refer to fig 2 in addition the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution of low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr was applied to quantitatively unravel the occurrence states of water in sludge mao et al 2016 wu et al 2019b by applying carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence the signal decay rates of low field nmr differ because of the interactions among protons with the environment and with each other carneiro et al 2013 goh et al 2009 therefore t2 derived from cpmg decay could be particularly sensitive to changes in the states of protons jepsen et al 1999 and be able for characterizing the structural information of protons in different water fractions of sludge also the area under each peak of t2 distribution spectrum can be determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of bound water with different states wu et al 2019b according to previous studies vaxelaire and cézac 2004 vesilind 1994 the most mobile water is theoretically defined as free water that is unaffected by solid phase however this definition is unfeasible in practice because it is hard to only separate solid unaffected water state by experimental means actually the different water removal efficiency can be caused by different filtration pressure or centrifugation speed lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 in the study using low filed nmr for water differentiation wu et al 2019b we found that the position of t2 peak corresponding to the most mobile water state varies with the conditioning induced alterations of solid phase therefore our study modified the commonly recognized definition free water as moderately mobile water by using the t2 spectrum of low filed nmr wu et al 2019b the moderately mobile water can be interpreted as the water that is least influenced by solid phase and can be partially removed by mechanical means 2 3 future research need for bound water differentiation in terms of the expected developments for bound water differentiation we think that the direct visualization of water fractions based on in situ synchrotron x ray computed microtomography can be further used to deepen the understanding of flow regime in sewage sludge during dewatering process besides there is a need of thermodynamic analysis on the solid liquid interfacial interaction in sludge the quantitative characterization on the binding strength of water molecules to solid phase is expected in addition the commonly used dewaterability indexes capillary suction time cst and specific resistance of filtration srf are measured by the bench scale dewatering experiments which may be not able to fully simulate the solid liquid separation process of factory scale dewatering the water occurrence states of bio sludge reflect the solid water binding strength and influence the water removal efficiency besides the relative contents of specific bound water fractions should be closely related to the water content limit that can be realized by mechanical dewatering therefore we propose that a novel index integrating the relative contents of different water fractions and solid water binding strength can be developed to evaluate the sludge dewaterability the non destructive and rapid nmr based water state differentiation should be more convenient time saving and reproducible than the empirical indicators cst or srf 3 influencing factors on sludge dewatering the investigation on influencing factors on sludge dewaterability has been a topic of general interest because it can be a point of penetration for better understanding the microstructure and constituent of sewage sludge previous researches have systematically investigated how the rheological properties microstructure features and extracellular polymeric substances eps on the water differentiation and dewaterability of sludge the significant results and major insufficiency are summarized as following 3 1 rheological properties viscosity is a comprehensive index reflecting the interactions among sludge particles the colloidal stability of microbial aggregates and water holding capacity of sludge flocs there are already many literatures analyzing the relationship between viscosity and dewaterability generally the sludge viscosity has the positive correlations with cst and srf pearson coefficient 0 9 p value 0 05 li and yang 2007 niu et al 2013 some other studies also found that the stronger affinity between water and organic compositions led to the higher sludge viscosity and bound water content eriksson et al 1992b jin et al 2004 vesilind 1988 zhen et al 2018 zita and hermansson 1997 however most of the above correlative analysis is still based on the laboratory scale dewatering measurement actually the sludge viscosity should significantly affect the particle migration in factory scale solid liquid separation which may be not able to be fully simulated by bench scale cst or srf tests recently the increasing attention is also paid to the relationships among viscosity shear resistance and stability of sludge flocs the decreasing sludge viscosity is always accompanied with the declining elastoplastic modulus which reflects the weakening interactions among sludge particles sheng and yu 2006 sheng et al 2006 the elastoplastic modulus also positively correlated with the fractal dimensions and these two properties jointly affected the sludge dewaterability in centrifugation baudez et al 2013 eshtiaghi et al 2012 li et al 2017a xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 accordingly some attempts used the viscosity to evaluate the dewaterability of sludge christensen et al 1993 dentel et al 2000 the cst was modified as christensen et al 1993 2 cstmod cst cstf w μf where cst and cstf are the capillary suction time of sludge and filtrate respectively w is the water content of sludge μf is filtrate viscosity the normalized cst cstmod could be a promising indicator for evaluating the sludge dewaterability and determining the optimal dosage of conditioning chemicals as the crucial rheological properties of dewatered sludge cake the compressibility and porosity are also important to the water removal efficiency by filtration zhao and bache 2001 it is generally recognized that the low compressibility maintains the porous structure of the dewatered sludge without fluidity inhibits the deformation and promotes the enhanced water removal qi et al 2011a in another word the lower compressibility is always accompanied with the higher permeability qi et al 2011a but it is difficult to accurately quantify the sludge dewaterability only by compressibility as the permeability and compressibility of the sludges varies by up to ten orders of magnitude in the range of solids concentration of interest to industry skinner et al 2015 therefore a model integrating both laboratory dewatering measurements and various rheological properties is necessary that will further clarify the relationships among rheological properties and sludge dewaterability which would help screen out the processes and additives showing great promise in laboratory based experiments but not to the extent in factory scale engineering 3 2 particle size particle size distribution is commonly regarded as another key factors influencing sludge dewaterability as the surface charge of sludge particles and micromorphology of sludge flocs also improve or deteriorate the sludge dewaterability through regulating the particle size distribution the sludge particles can be categorized as rigid settable solid 100 μm fragile settable solid 10 100 μm supracolloidal solid 1 10 μm and true colloidal solid 0 001 1 0 μm karr and keinath 1978 shao et al 2009 it is generally recognized that the large fraction of long fibers in sludge causes the flocculation of particles and increases the particle size as a result the denser flocs expand the density difference between solid and liquid phases which is favorable for the solid liquid separation by gravity settling and centrifugation mowla et al 2013 on the contrary supracolloidal solid and true colloidal solid cause cake filter or filters media blinding by migration of fines into the filter cake or filter media pores which increases the filtration resistance and negatively affects the water removal from sludge zhou et al 2014 although the supracolloidal solid and true colloidal solid only account for 3 9 and 0 2 of the total solid concentration of sludge the previous studies showed that the increase of supracolloidal solid by 50 may increase srf by 100 the rigid settable solid 100 μm and fragile settable solid 10 100 μm have few effects on sludge srf karr and keinath 1978 besides the smaller particle size leads to the greater dispersion and the corresponding presence of capillaries retains a large portion of bound water in the fine pore structure higgins and novak 1997b jin et al 2004 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 current studies mainly investigated the changes of particle size distribution pre and post dewatering conditioning stages however the particle size of bio flocs can likely vary due to the changing external environment for example stirring strength or turbulent flow pattern heukelekian and weisberg 1958 therefore the particle size distribution resulting in satisfactory cst and srf results may be not appropriate for the engineering scale solid liquid equipment accordingly the future research should be carried out for the real time monitoring of particle size variation during conditioning or dewatering process which may be beneficial for the accurately regulating the conditioning operations in terms of agitation or chemical addition on the other hand the sludge with different sources or compositions may have the different optimal ranges of particle size distribution for dewaterability that also needs the systematical investigation to direct the engineering practice 3 3 micromorphology and porosity with the development of micro characterization techniques the effects of micromorphology and porosity are attracting the growing attention in terms of quantitative analysis of morphology fractal dimension is the widely applied parameter in previous researches cao et al 2016 jin et al 2004 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 an increase in quantity of fractal dimension tends to increase the bound water content in sludge accordingly the fractal dimension was found to have the positive linear relationship with sludge dewaterability based on cst cao et al 2016 jin et al 2004 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in addition it is generally accepted that the porosity improvement of filtered sludge cake can lead to the higher water removal efficiency as the existing meso and macro pores could maintain the permeability of sludge during compressing filtration qi et al 2011b thapa et al 2009a accordingly the addition of rigid porous materials is the widely applied approaches for creating or maintaining the porosity of sludge cake the analysis based on scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem verified that sludge particles can bind to the surface of porous materials by means of chemical and or electrostatic interactions liu et al 2013b tenney and cole 1968 thapa et al 2009b through such a mechanism the added rigid porous material can transfer the compressive stress and avoid the excessive compression of sludge cake which further helps the water flow out deneux mustin et al 2001 however it is still necessary to quantitatively determine the appropriate pore size and pore volume for satisfactory dewaterability the relationship between water occurrence states and pore structure can also be further explored currently no matter electron microscopy observation or conventional porosity quantification by n2 absorption isotherm cannot realize the in situ and non destructive analysis on bio sludge we propose that the recently developed techniques including x ray microtomography magnetic resonance imaging and cryo electron microscopy could be considered to solve the above issues 3 4 surface charge and repulsive energy surface charge plays a determinant role in the interactions among sludge particles which further influences the aggregation states particles size distribution and solid liquid separation performance christensen et al 2015 previous literatures primarily analyzed the correlation between surface charge and dewaterability with the presence of co existing ions and ph regulation since the outer surface compounds of microbial cell aggregates eps have the isoelectric point of 2 6 3 6 the sludge flocs are usually negatively charged whereas the charge increases with increasing ph and acidic ph range is in favor of dewaterability liao et al 2002 the surface charge of eps was measured as around 5 103 meq g at ph of 3 and the value was 14 103 meq g at ph of 11 the corresponding srf at ph of 11 was around 2 times higher than that at ph of 3 jin et al 2004 liao et al 2001 2002 however ph could damage the integrity of microbial cells which may also influence the dewaterability therefore how ph affects sludge dewaterability cannot be fully explained by surface charge neutralization in addition the water hardness or conductivity reflecting the concentration of multivalent ions was verified to be closely related to sludge dewaterability higgins et al 2004 the high conductivity is usually accompanied with the high concentration of ions in aqueous phase and the complexation is a dynamic equilibrium depending on the ratio of aqueous ions and complexation sites therefore the high concentration of aqueous ions should correspond to the high contents of complexing ions with solid compositions which allows for the surface charge neutralization and further facilitates the sludge dewaterability improvement biggs et al 2001 cousin and ganczarczyk 1999 higgins et al 2004 sobeck and higgins 2002 additionally due to the ion exchange between mono and divalent ions the ratio between monovalent m and divalent cations d cannot be higher than 2 meq l to ensure the superior dewaterability higgins and novak 1997b jin et al 2004 peeters et al 2011 it is reported that the high concentration monovalent cations such as k and na may weaken floc strength higgins and novak 1997b which is adverse to the dewatering performance however the quantitative correlation between ion strength and mechanical strength of bio flocs is still deficient furthermore how the complexed cations affect the molecular structure of sludge components e g extracellular proteins remains unclear this insufficiency may limit the understanding level of hydrophilic hydrophobic surface properties influenced by functional group conformation 3 5 eps eps are some high molecule weight compounds distributing both outside of cells and in the interior of microbial aggregates and account for 50 80 wt of the total organic fractions in sludge liu and fang 2003 the presence of eps prevents microorganisms from the severe external environment including ph change heavy metals and other toxic substances and also acts as the most exterior layers of microbial aggregates interacting with water molecules wu et al 2018c therefore the physiochemical properties of eps significantly affect the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of bio flocs and can be regarded as the most important determinant on the sludge dewaterability ge et al 2019 park and novak 2007 shao et al 2009 xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2018 yu et al 2008 3 5 1 content of eps primarily the correlation between sludge dewaterability and contents of eps was investigated some studies have shown that sludge dewaterability positively jin et al 2004 neyens et al 2004 or negatively li and yang 2007 neyens et al 2004 correlates with the eps content but some other studies thought eps content had few effects on sludge dewaterability ye et al 2011 for example using sludge samples from representative eight wastewater treatments of british houghton et al houghton and stephenson 2002 found that the optimal dewaterability could be obtained at eps content of 35 mg gdm as the eps content further increased or decreased exceeding a certain threshold a lower sludge dewaterability was observed the increasing eps content would lead to a lower shear sensitivity and lower degree of dispersion of sludge mikkelsen 2001 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 resulting in a better sludge flocculation through enhancing intercellular aggregation however as the eps content further increases and exceeds a certain threshold the water that is retained by the eps significantly increases which results in a lower sludge dewaterability at the same time the excessive eps content causes a fouling layer on the filter media and acts as a barrier for the water removal by mechanical means sponza 2002 however there are still some debates on the most appropriate contents of eps for the optimal sludge dewaterability these discrepancies may be due to the different sludge sources used in different studies another possible reason could be that the eps extraction efficiency varies significantly from the extraction methods the commonly used eps extraction methods such as ultrasonication centrifugation yu et al 2008 alkaline treatment sheng et al 2005 thermal treatment li and yang 2007 and hcho naoh treatment liu and fang 2002 may cause cell lysis and release of intracellular compounds and the extent of cell lysis during extraction is difficult to evaluate besides although the cation exchange resin method may cause a low degree of cell lysis but it may only extract compound complexed with ca2 mg2 sheng et al 2010 all these limitations of current eps methods may interfere with the quantification of total eps contents and further negatively influence the mechanistic investigation on how eps content impacts sludge dewaterability therefore the in situ analytical method for eps or the extraction methods targeting full solubilization of eps without releasing intracellular molecules is demanded 3 5 2 stratification of eps since the eps matrix is shear sensitive eriksson et al 1992a centrifugation and ultrasound are jointly applied to selectively extract the different eps layers soluble microbial products comprise soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps is the eps layer that can be removed by mild centrifugation the high intensity centrifugation with pre ultrasonication can extract tightly bound eps tb eps with the cognition of stratification structure of sludge flocs the effects of different eps fractions on sludge dewaterability were analyzed separately jia et al 2017 li and yang 2007 shao et al 2009 wen et al 2015 yu et al 2008 although the different operational parameters such as centrifugal force and ultrasonication power may lead to some difference in eps extraction amount it is widely accepted that the increasing lb eps decreases the dewaterability the loose flocs composed of lb eps could reduce the density difference between solid phase and water which maintains the stability of sludge flocs dispersing in water also the presence of gel like loose flocs increases binding strength of organic compositions to water retains much water in pore structure and so increases the amount of interstitial water dai et al 2018 higgins and novak 1997a li and yang 2007 yu et al 2008 zhen et al 2012b 2013b in addition some studies unified lb eps and soluble eps as slime eps which accounted for 18 40 of the total eps content and the removal of slime eps could decrease srf by 40 poxon and darby 1997 s eps and tb eps as compared with lb eps are often considered to be less crucial to dewaterability s eps can be removed with filtrate during dewatering process zhen et al 2012a tb eps protects the cell integrity zhou et al 2015 the lysis of tb eps would release the intracellular water sun et al 2018 yu et al 2008 zhen et al 2013b zhou et al 2015 on the other hand the increase of tb eps in a certain range could improve the shear resistance and help the water removal by centrifugation means mikkelsen and keiding 2002 3 5 3 compositions of eps eps matrix is formed by different bio chemicals secreted by microbes release of cellular material products by cell lysis or organic matter in the medium more et al 2014 sheng et al 2010 carbohydrates and proteins are the major components of eps in addition small amount of humic substances lipids nucleic acids uronic acids and some inorganic components have also been found in eps from various matrixes it is widely accepted that extracellular proteins comprise of major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 sponza 2002 yu et al 2010b yuan et al 2011 furthermore some other studies found that the polysaccharide and protein contribute to the positive and negative charges of eps respectively cetin and erdincler 2004 jin et al 2003 yu et al 2010b correspondingly the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and surface charge of sludge flocs depends on the content ratio of polysaccharide and protein in eps li et al 2012 wen et al 2015 the humic substances and nucleic acids have no significant effect on sludge dewaterability sheng et al 2010 the previous study also quantitatively analyzed the correlations among the compositions of different eps layers and sludge dewaterability yu et al 2008 the results showed that cst closely correlated with the lb eps protein content and the ratio of protein and polysaccharide in lb eps pearson coefficient 0 72 p value 0 01 however the protein polysaccharide in tb eps or the polysaccharide in lb eps both had no obvious correlation with cst pearson coefficient 0 2 which further indicated that the protein of eps was the key determinant on sludge dewaterability however the above quantitative results were all based on the conventional chromogenic methods i e lowry method for proteins and phenol sulphoacid method for polysaccharides which can only obtain the results expressed by the equivalent concentration of reference standards instead of absolute concentrations also the chromogenic methods may be interfered by the coexisting organic molecules or ions therefore more efforts should be devoted to further identifying the specific compositions of proteins and polysaccharides in eps currently regarding the specific components of eps three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy is the most used analytical method chen et al 2003 divided the 3d eem spectrum into the five specific fluorescence regions based on the excitation emission characteristics of different fluorescence compounds including aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like compounds tyrosine tryptophan protein like compounds and humic acid like compounds also in order to eliminate the overlap of different compositions in eps parallel factor parafac analysis is employed to separate the actual fluorescence spectra from the eem fluorescence spectra according to the reported tutorial stedmon and bro 2008 parafac analysis further confirmed that the improvement of sludge dewaterability is dominated by the tyrosine tryptophan protein like compounds but the humic acids and fulvic acid like compounds have limited correlations with sludge dewaterability baudez et al 2013 kim et al 2016 stedmon and bro 2008 xiao et al 2018 yu et al 2010a zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2013b recently the proteomics is introduced into the field of sludge researches because it can identify the origin molecular function and related biological processes of extracellular proteins wu et al 2017b 2017c zhang et al 2015a 2015b the corresponding studies realized that the membrane associated proteins and the proteins related to biological adhesion are mainly responsible for the main roles in water holding capacities of sludge flocs wu et al 2017c however the current eps extraction methods in proteomics often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells should be critically assessed the purification procedures of extracellular proteins are also needed to be optimized and standardized therefore we also propose that the in situ techniques e g microscopy and spectrophotometric coupled with genomics proteomics and glycomics should be developed to solve the above issues 3 5 4 molecular weight of eps except for compositions several studies further analyzed the correlation between eps polymerization and sludge dewaterability cao et al 2018 used the size exclusion chromatography sec with organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection ocd ond to distinguish the three main molar mass fractions as a macromolecular weight fraction 4000 da mainly consisting of carbohydrates and proteins a mid molecular weight fraction 1000 4000 da consisting of humic substances and peptides and a low molecular weight fraction 1000 da consisting of building blocks and organic acids it is generally recognized that the presence of eps with high molecular weight reflected the stable network structure formed by interlacing a large number of polymer molecules niu et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 due to the hydrophilic functional groups a large amount of water is bound in the net like polymeric molecules and maintains the stability of eps supported sludge flocs in water xiao et al 2017 instead the reduction of macromolecules in bound eps is usually accompanied with the substantial decrease of shear strength and instability of colloidal sludge flocs which are both in favor of the enhanced water removal xiao et al 2017 3 5 5 functional group and molecular structure of eps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps can be used for the functional group identification of eps some xps based studies found that the reductions of amino nitrogen nh2 and cyanogen nitrogen cn of eps were accompanied with the dewaterability improvement which reflected that the n containing functional groups could be the hydrophilic functional groups of eps xiao et al 2018 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir obtained the similar results with xps it was found that the addition of coagulants enhances the stretching vibrations of o h and c oh in ft ir spectra reflecting that the electrical neutralization causes the denser sludge flocs cetin and erdincler 2004 xu et al 2018 on the contrary advanced oxidation process aop weakens the peak strengths of o h and c n stretching vibration which indicates that the removal of hydrophilic functional groups oh and nh2 can improve the sludge dewaterability he et al 2015 xu et al 2016 recently efforts were also made to further deepen the analysis on hydrophilicity hydrophobicity into the aspect of molecular structure wu et al 2017b and xu et al 2018 applied circular dichroism cd spectra to track the changes of secondary structure of extracellular proteins during sludge conditioning the strong correlation rp 0 97 p 0 03 between the surface hydrophilicity index and α helix percentages of extracellular proteins was identified which indicates that the water affinity relies more on the spatial distribution of hydrophilic functional groups rather than the contents the destruction of secondary and tertiary structure of extracellular proteins and stretching or preventing the aggregation of polypeptide can be the key points for changing the hydrophilic properties of bio aggregates wu et al 2017b based on the current state of knowledge related to eps we propose that the molecular conformation of eps should be the significant basis for elucidating the physiochemical mechanism behind sludge dewaterability although some progress has been obtained there is still need to systematically analyze the quantitative correlations among hydrophilic hydrophobic functional groups of eps molecular conformation of eps and rheological properties of sludge flocs the potential correlations among tertiary structure quaternary structure and water binding properties are worth to be explored and how the specific hydrophilic components or molecular structure unit leading to physical or chemical binding of water molecule should be further identified in order to minimize the possible interference of variable eps compositions on mechanism analysis of sludge dewaterability 4 conditioning technologies for sludge dewaterability improvement 4 1 physical conditioning the physical conditioning refers to the technology for improving the sludge dewaterability by non chemical conditioning reagents or input energy in the form of heating freeze thawing sonication or electrical field 4 1 1 porous material addition non chemical conditioning reagents are commonly applied as the rigid porous materials to act as skeleton builders or filter aids due to the role that they have in reducing the compressibility and improving the permeability during compression these rigid porous materials include coal fly ash nelson and brattlof 1979 lignite qi et al 2011b thapa et al 2009a steel slag czaczyk and myszka 2007 gypsum zhao and bache 2001 wood chips lin et al 2001 and rice husk lee et al 2001 zhang et al 2019b the addition was usually 30 50 wt of dry matter correspondingly srf and compressibility coefficient could be reduced by 58 88 and 22 90 respectively qi et al 2011a in addition the inorganic porous materials could reduce the phosphorous content in filtrate through the formation of insoluble phosphate which eliminates the accumulation of negative charges on sludge particles and enhances the flocculation of sludge flocs chen et al 2010 djedidi et al 2009 however the addition of porous materials could increase the final volume of dewatered sludge and accordingly increase the disposal cost carbon based materials have advantages compared with other mineral based materials due to the capabilities of increasing the permeability but without decreasing the calorific value of sludge which is in favor of the incineration of dewatered sludge mowla et al 2013 besides the particle size of porous material should exceed 10 μm in order not to block the filtration media qi et al 2011a 4 1 2 sonication besides non chemical conditioning reagents some other physical approaches have also been used to alter the micro structure of sludge flocs for dewaterability improvement for this purpose cavitation seems to offer immense potential and received special attention during recent years acoustic cavitation is generated by the use of low frequency ultrasound the ultrasound is cyclic sound compression and expansion with a frequency greater than 20 khz due to this cyclic negative pressure acoustic cavitation occurs through mechanical shear forces these ultrasonic stresses rupture the microbial cell wall and release the intracellular organics into the aqueous phase chen et al 2001 gogate and kabadi 2009 huan et al 2009 khanal et al 2006 2007 yin et al 2004 which helps to disintegrate the biological flocs and homogenize sludge by forming sponge like properties cai et al 2018 mowla et al 2013 however there are also controversial conclusions on the effect of sonication on dewaterability bien bien and wolny 1997 and hogan hogan et al 2004 reported that ultra sonication could enhance the sludge dewaterability while wang et al 2006 thought the release of intracellular polymers and disintegration of cells would deteriorate dewaterability feng et al 2009b reported that the effects of sonication on sludge dewaterability depends on the energy input the optimal ultrasonic energy input was determined to be 800 kj kg total solid ts despite the above existing debate on the effectiveness of sonication the difficulty in scale up is also the main limitation for the engineering application of acoustic cavitation hydrodynamic cavitation is a process using orifice plate or venturi in liquid flow path to increase the local velocity of sludge flow according to bernoulli law this increase in velocity causes a local pressure decrease which results in cavities if the local pressure is less than vapor pressure of the media at the operating temperature mowla et al 2013 similar to ultra sonication the cavities generated by hydrodynamic cavitation could also disrupt cell wall and enhance the release of intracellular water caulfield 2012 gogate and kabadi 2009 these changes were thought to be effective in decreasing the water content limit of sludge dewatered by mechanical compression however the optimization of flow regime should be crucial for hydrodynamic cavitation to exert conditioning effect no chemical addition is needed by cavitation based conditioning but the energy consumption in cavitation should be carefully compared with other conditioning technologies 4 1 3 thermal treatment another widely reported physical approach for sludge conditioning is thermal pretreatment thermal hydrolysis refers to the process heating sludge up to 60 180 c in the sealed environment which accelerates the dissolution of lipids and carbohydrates and the release of intracellular proteins bound within the cell wall tunçal 2011 wang and li 2015 wang et al 2010 2014 previous studies baohong et al 2012 everett 1974 neyens et al 2003 yu et al 2014 also found that the thermal process could promote the breakdown of gel like sludge flocs the degree of floc disintegration by thermal hydrolysis depended on the applied temperature and holding time the temperature of 175 c and holding time of 10 30 min were reported as the optimal conditions for maximizing the ammonia acid volatile acids and monosaccharide in liquid phase which was also accompanied with the decrease in the viscosity and increase of filterability of the treated sludge everett 1974 wang et al 2010 hydrothermal conditions temperature 180 250 c pressure 1 4 mpa can induce series of transformations that cannot occur at ambient temperature including hydrolysis dehydration decarboxylation and aromatization wang et al 2014 as a result the hydrophilic functional groups of organic compositions can be removed by hydrothermal treatment the carbonization of sludge significantly decreases the water holding capacities however due to maillard reactions the drawback of hydrothermal treatment is generating a large amount of refractory organic wastewater containing heterocyclic nitrogen compounds the equipment corrosion occurring in the hydrothermal treatment should also be carefully prevented currently there are few engineering cases using hydrothermal treatment specifically for the sludge dewaterability improvement microwave treatment is a process using electromagnetic wave with wave length of 0 1 mm 1 m and frequency of 300 mhz 3 thz for thermal input to sludge wojciechowska 2005 and yu yu et al 2009 both verified the positive effects of microwave treatment under alkaline conditions on sludge dewaterability however similar with cavitation it s technically difficult and uneconomical to scale up the high power microwave generator for sludge pretreatment 4 1 4 freezing and thawing freezing thawing conditioning is an effective physical way to reduce the bound water content by inducing the changes in floc structure of sewage sludge during the cyclic freezing thawing process sludge is first frozen at temperatures below the freezing point of water around 20 c to 15 c and kept at this state for a while following the thawing process at room temperature mowla et al 2013 due to the formation of homogeneous ice crystal the water molecule is fixed into the ice crystal and sludge particles are excluded outside the crystal structure which realizes the solid liquid separation with ice thawing the water is discharged and concentrated solid can be collected separately martel 1993 tunçal 2011 franceschini et al franceschini 2010 investigated the effects of cyclic number of freeze thaw processes and freezing temperature on the dewaterability improvement the repeated freezing thawing operation leads to the crystallization of intracellular water and its volume expansion this process is accompanied with cell swelling phenomenon and reduce the bound water fraction including intracellular water which is beneficial for the deep dehydration of sludge however how to quantify the released intracellular water and how significant cell swelling contributes to the dewaterability improvement are worth to be further discussed in addition the freezing thawing conditioning is normally practical in the regions with cold climate the large energy consumption for the repeated freezing thawing operation limits the widespread implementation of this technology 4 1 5 electrical treatment the electrical filed combined with mechanical compression is well suited for enhanced dewatering of sludge to the water content below 50 wt the presence of amphoteric functional group e g cooh and nh2 makes the sludge particles negatively charged the migration of charged particles driven by electrical field causes the accumulation of sludge particles on the cathode anode that has the opposite charges and further enhances the solid liquid separation mahmoud et al 2018b in addition the electrically driven movement of hydrated ions in the water phase creates the concentration gradient of ions and accordingly enhances the water diffusion in sludge mahmoud et al 2011 as a result the water osmosis through the permeable polar plate acts as another way of water removal from sludge however few researches quantitatively or visually tracked the electro driven ion migration it would be meaningful to calculate the osmotic pressure due to the gradient distribution of hydrated ions furthermore the electrolysis of water partially contributes to the reduction of water content in sludge the electrolysis also causes the degradation of eps layer and lysis of microbial cells which destroys the stability of sludge flocs decreases the viscosity and reduces the bound water percentage mahmoud et al 2010 2018a the recent study thought that joule heat generated during electro conditioning process also ruptures cells disperses microbial cell aggregations and decreases the viscosity of solid liquid mixture which are both beneficial for the improvement of dewaterability lv et al 2019 mahmoud et al 2011 various electro dewatering equipment have been developed in the last decades 10 60 v direct current voltage decreased the water content of sludge below 40 wt chu et al 2005 esmaeily et al 2006 lai 2001 tuan et al 2008 zhou et al 2001 the combination of mechanical compression and electrical field could realize the higher dewatering efficiency than that of dewatering process only assisted by electrical filed gazbar et al 1994 laursen and jensen 1993 yuan 2002 yuan and weng 2003 cao et al 2019 made some attempts to use carbon based materials as amendment during electro dewatering of sludge which helped increase the conductivity decreased the energy consumption and adsorbed s eps to improve filterability however the high energy consumption 1 5 3 kwh kgdm and corrosion of polar plates may still be the main obstacles for the factory scale application of electrical sludge dewatering mahmoud et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a the long term operation status and operation life of electro dewatering equipment should be monitored 4 2 chemical conditioning the chemical conditioning refers to the technology for improving the dewaterability through altering the physio chemical properties of sludge by use of chemicals according to the reaction types the chemical conditioning of sludge can be generally categorized as coagulation flocculation aop acid base and enzymatic treatment 4 2 1 coagulation flocculation common coagulation reagents include inorganic salt coagulants represented by ferric and aluminum salts turchiuli and fargues 2004 investigated the conditioning performance of two small molecule inorganic coagulants al2 so4 3 and fecl3 in sludge suspensions they pointed out that the alum induced flocs were larger and more compact than ferric ones resulting in the faster settling performance but the presence of s eps may consume added al3 through chelation and increase the demand of aluminum coagulants yang et al 2019 ferric salts may have advantages than alum salts in sludge conditioning due to their low cost fast settling velocity of ferric flocs lower toxicity wider ph range of applications and better effect under low temperatures bratby 2006 lee et al 2014 in addition chen chen et al 2015 wei wei et al 2018a and yu yu et al 2016 found the stronger affinity of ferrous ions with protein like substances than alum ions which results in the better coagulation for hydrophilic compositions of eps however the use of ferric salts as coagulants may aggravate the corrosion of agitation equipment and structures alternatively the combined use of titanium salts magnesium salts and alkaline conditions has been attracting growing attention due to the minimal negative environmental effects wang et al 2016b wu et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 there are some studies analyzing the conditioning effects of alum ions with different chemical forms cao et al 2016 pambou et al 2016 the results showed that compared with monomer forms of aluminum almon al13 mainly made up of middle polymerization of aluminum and alun primarily composed of high polymerization of aluminum make the sludge flocs with smaller particle size and weaker compressibility but denser and more stable flocs al13 and alun have the better coagulation effect on protein like substances of eps therefore they exhibited the better performance than almon for sludge dewaterability improvement the polymeric multivalent inorganic salts have the high charge density and molecular weight which could facilitate the charge balance with a low dosage watanabe et al 1999 it was previously reported that polymeric ferric sulfate pfs could realize nearly 100 neutralization of negative charge but that was only 50 by the same dosage of fecl3 watanabe et al 1999 zhang et al 2014 conducted the comparative analysis of s eps removal by polymeric aluminum chloride pacl polymeric ferric chloride pfc and composite coagulant which indicated that the content of s eps the absolute value of zeta potential and the dosage of polymeric inorganic salts positively correlated with srf pacl and pfc could lead to the larger sludge particle size but looser floc structure than that induced by fecl3 and generally exhibited the better dewatering conditioning performance niu et al 2013 besides polymeric ferric and alum salts zhao et al 2016 developed the synthesis method for covalently bound organic aluminum silicate coagulant which had the higher polymerization degree larger molecular weight and stronger dewatering conditioning capacity than conventional coagulants flocculants are commonly recognized as the macromolecular polymers taking effects by adsorption bridging reactions on sludge particles which increases the floc size and enhances the solid liquid separation by enlarging the density difference due to the negatively charged sludge particles cationic polyacrylamide cpam and derivatives are the most widely used flocculants for sludge dewatering cpam is efficient in destabilizing sludge colloidal flocs through charge neutralization and also the function of re aggregating fine sludge particles cpam is synthesized by the copolymerization of cationic monomers and acrylamide am the cationic monomers include 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride dac methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and dimethyldiallyammonium chloride dmdaac sun et al 2016 yang et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 in addition to cpam several cationic polymeric flocculants with special structures have been reported for example the polymer with cationic microblock structure of am and dac the novel cationic polyamidine with a ring like structural unit of five carbon atoms and the flocculant with strong cationic hydrophobic regions have been developed chen et al 2016 guo et al 2017 which can achieve the srf of 2 1012 m kg with the dosage of 0 3 wt dm in order to minimize the secondary pollution of sludge conditioning the biodegradable and non toxic polymers from natural source are applied for improving sludge dewaterability grafting modification is a useful method that introduces positive pieces onto natural polymers e g polysaccharide based polymers as branch chains such as starch graft 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride stc g dmc starch graft dimethyl ammonium chloride stc g dmdaac lv et al 2014 pourjavadi et al 2013 and chitosan based polymers guibal et al 2006 wang et al 2016a bio flocculants are also regarded as natural polymers based conditioning reagents the previous study applied microbial bio flocculants produced by rhodococcus erythropolis separated from alkali assisted thermally pretreated sludge the final solid content and srf of sludge reached 22 5 and 3 4 1012 m kg respectively after 30 min filtration at vacuum degree of 0 05 mpa guo and ma 2015 we believe that the key challenges for sludge coagulation flocculation is how to select the appropriate conditioning chemicals according to the physiochemical properties of target sludge whether the polymeric multivalent inorganic salts and organic flocculants are jointly or separately used should depend on a theoretical basis instead of engineering experience due to the complexity and variability of sewage sludge the reliable indicators for real time control of conditioning operations are necessary but still deficient e g dynamic dosage regulation of conditioning chemicals that deficiency may lead to the excessive addition of conditioning reagents correspondingly the potential environmental risks of coagulants flocculants should be taken into more consideration especially the chlorine introduced by commonly used pacl and pfc may increase the risk of dioxin formation during incineration of dewatered sludge but the related systematical analysis is still insufficient the commercial instruments widely used in the coagulation treatment of wastewater with high turbidity have realized the real time monitoring of particle size distribution through laser scattering we propose that these instruments may facilitate the process monitoring of sludge conditioning in addition corresponding to the discussion in section 3 2 it would be interesting to in situ observe coagulation agglomeration or adsorption bridging by synchrotron x ray microtomography that will be beneficial for unraveling the coagulation flocculation mechanism and also help to screen the effective coagulant flocculant reagents in changing sludge microstructure as a result a database of conditioning chemicals can be established for optimal selection of the appropriate reagents towards different sludge sources which would also improve the effectiveness of engineering design 4 2 2 acid base treatment naoh ca oh 2 and cao are the representative base conditioning reagents li et al 2008 from the positive aspect alkaline pretreatment can disrupt bio flocs and cells of microorganisms in the sludge which enhances the reduction of bound water li et al 2009 but towards the negative aspect the deterioration of dewaterability can be caused by the excessive accumulation of organic matters in slime fractions which may increase the filtration resistance shao et al 2012 therefore low dose naoh treatment 10 wt dm deteriorated sludge dewatering ability obviously while the ability can be restored to some extent by the treatment with high dosage 10 30 wt dm li et al 2008 ca oh 2 is more appropriate for improving sludge dewaterability than naoh because ca2 can facilitate the re flocculation of soluble organic compositions which would counteract the negative effect brought about by excessive disintegration of sludge li et al 2009 su et al 2013 cao can reduce the water content of sludge by exothermic hydration reaction but probably with the drawbacks of volume increase of pretreated sludge as discussed in section 3 4 the acidic ph range could also regulate the surface charge of sludge particles disintegrate bio flocs and reduce the bound water however according to some other studies the excessive acidification can deteriorate the filterability by lysis of sludge flocs which results in the release of fine particles into liquid phase posing the risk of filtration media blocking li et al 2005 macdonald et al 2018 raynaud et al 2012 therefore the appropriate acidity for sludge dewaterability improvement still needs to be determined on various types of sludge additionally some literature found free nitrous acid or sulfuric acid could degrade eps leading to the loss of water binding capacity and opened bacteria cells with intracellular water freed chen et al 2001 wei et al 2018b since the spatial conformation of hydrophilic hydrophobic functional groups significantly influences the surface properties of eps matrix some organic acids including tannic acid and peracetic acid were recently reported to improve the sludge dewaterability by inducing the denaturation of hydrophilic protein like substances or regulating the spatial distribution of water holding substances devlin et al 2011 ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b which should be the preliminary attempts to improve the sludge dewaterability by modifying the molecular structure of eps 4 2 3 aop according to the discussion in section 3 5 the presence of eps dominantly leads to the existence of bound water the substantial lysis and release of eps contributes to the release of intracellular water and interstitial water in sludge flocs therefore the approaches represented by aop aiming at destruction of cell walls and eps were widely reported for the dewaterability improvement of sludge fenton reaction was first verified to be effective in eliminating the water holding capacity of eps the highly reactive and non selective oh eo oh h h2o 2 813 vnhe could enhance the degradation and de polymerization of eps buyukkamaci 2004 unlike fenton reactions occurring under acidic conditions the thermally activated kim et al 2016 transition metal catalyzed li et al 2019 zhen et al 2012a and electrically catalyzed zhen et al 2013b na2s2o8 nahso5 peroxymonosulfate pms and nahs2o8 peroxydisulfate pds can induce the radical based oxidation in the neutralized ph range our previous studies investigated the performance of nano scale cao2 in sludge conditioning which also effectively improved the dewaterability under near neutral conditions wu et al 2016b 2017a in addition microwave induced peroxidation zhou et al 2014 and tio2 based light catalysis liu et al 2013a were able to improve the dewaterability and biodegradability in anaerobic digestion simultaneously with elimination of fe2 addition recently in order to minimize the dosage of aop based conditioning reagents the heterogeneous fenton reaction using zero valence iron as catalyst was applied to sludge that provided the possibility of magnetic recovery and reuse of heterogeneous catalyst zero valence iron li et al 2018 similarly tao et al 2019 converted fenton treated sludge into fe rich biochar by pyrolysis and the obtained fe rich biochar was used to induce the heterogeneous fenton for raw sludge as a result a near zero disposal system was established although aop was verified to be effective in sludge dewaterability improvement yet most of the existing studies only focused on the aop induced changes in micromorphology of sludge flocs and contents of different eps fractions s eps lb eps and tb eps he et al 2015 kim et al 2016 mo et al 2015 shao et al 2009 yang and li 2009 zhen et al 2013b zhou et al 2015 based on the correlative analysis among eps fractions and dewaterability it is widely recognized that extracellular proteins comprise are the major hydrophilic substances in sludge and play more important roles in determining dewaterability than polysaccharides and humic substances cetin and erdincler 2004 houghton and stephenson 2002 shao et al 2009 wu and chai 2016 yu et al 2010b yuan et al 2011 therefore we analyzed the aop induced change of hydrophilic properties of extracellular protein mixture identified and relatively quantified the extracellular proteins of sludge pre and post aop and also revealed the aop induced molecular structure alteration of representative extracellular proteins with implications on the hydrophilicity of biological aggregates wu et al 2017b however there still may be some debate on whether the aop caused dewaterability improvement is due to the radical oxidation of macromolecular eps or the coagulation induced by inorganic catalysts of aop e g ferrous salts since the dosage of these heterogeneous catalysts can be as high as 10 20 wt dm of raw sludge in another word there may be some misunderstandings in the functions of aop in sludge dewaterability improvement also radical oxidation is a non selective reaction some of the added aop reagents may be consumed by the unfavorable reactions for sludge dewaterability improvement therefore we insist that to what extent aop influences the molecular compositions of eps with implications to sludge dewaterability needs to be further clarified and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms could be a useful tool to track the variations in chemical formulas of eps e g unsaturation degree double bond equivalent and aromatic index and the atom numbers of c h o and n as a result it can help us figure out how much of the added aop reagents are consumed by the favorable reactions for hydrophilicity reduction of eps furthermore whether and how we can reduce the consumption of aop based conditioning chemicals could be determined 4 2 4 enzymatic treatment similar with aop the hydrolysis enzymes could promote the degradation of eps resulting in the destruction of viscous bio flocs and reduce the water holding capacity of sludge but the dosage of hydrolysis enzymes is usually much lower than that of oxidants which correspondingly has less environmental risk lü et al 2016 pinpointed the effectiveness of various enzymes including amylase cellulase proteinase dnase and polygalacturonase by quantifying the spatial distribution of each type of organic matters protein polysaccharide dna fluorescent organics in outer layer eps inner layer eps and cells the results indicated that polygalacturonase unexpectedly increased the total eps polysaccharides up to seven times accompanied with improved dewaterability and cellulose hydrolysis led to massive release of all kinds of organic matters lü et al 2016 ayol et al ayol 2005 ayol and dentel 2005 lu et al 2011 and our previous study wu et al 2016a confirmed the feasibility of dewatering sewage sludge and cellulosic sludge by composite hydrolysis enzyme and dentel et al dentel and dursun 2009 evaluated the performance of enzyme assisted dewatering from the perspective of shear sensitivity of digested sludge these studies highlighted the advantages of composite enzymes in sludge conditioning including non toxicity biodegradability and low dosage requirement but the long retention time and harsh reaction conditions could be the limitations for the scale up application of enzyme based sludge dewatering conditioning in addition the enzyme specificity would also be the obstacle to select appropriate enzymes for treating sewage sludge with complex compositions 5 effects of conditioning operations on utilization of dewatered sewage sludge dewatering conditioning improves the sludge dewaterability with simultaneously altering extracellular proteins polysaccharides releasing nitrogen phosphorus nutrients and influencing the chemical speciation of heavy metals therefore it is necessary to investigate the potential impacts of sludge conditioning on the subsequent disposal or utilization process 5 1 resource recovery since 30 50 of chemical oxygen demand cod 20 30 of total nitrogen and 90 of total phosphorus are transformed into sludge during the biological process the resource recovery has become one of the promising objectives of sludge treatment anaerobic fermentation is a typical approach which can simultaneously realize the recovery of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and improve the dewaterability for example chen et al chen et al 2007 feng et al 2009a yuan et al 2006 zhang and chen 2009 produced volatile fatty acids vfa from anaerobic fermentation and further used them as the supplementary carbon source for the enhanced biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus furthermore after the dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus during anaerobic fermentation process were recovered by struvite sludge srf and cst decreased by 96 9 and 99 6 respectively based on the similar principle li et al 2017b developed the similar process named as airprex which adjusts ph of sludge to 7 8 by air injection following the addition of mgcl2 to facilitate the crystallization of struvite the removal of phosphate relieves the struvite scaling reduces the negative charge density and accordingly helps the reduction of dewatering conditioning reagent dosage wang et al 2018b rittmann cusick and zhen et al cusick and logan 2012 lee and rittmann 2011 zhen et al 2013a analyzed the impacts of conditioning techniques e g electrolysis and aop on nutrient release the results showed that the direct current dc output at 35 kwh m3 increased the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p volatile fatty acids polysaccharides and proteins by 110 460 in aqueous phase that disintegration of sludge flocs provided the possibilities of improving the dewaterability with simultaneous recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from the aqueous phase some other studies analyzed the migration and transformation of heavy metals during sludge conditioning process the techniques integrating dewaterability improvement and heavy metal stabilization extraction were developed for example bio char hua et al 2009 coal fly ash fang et al 1999 and lime fang and wong 1999 could decrease the leaching risk of heavy metals and simultaneously improve the dewaterability by maintaining the sludge permeability during filter pressing liu et al 2012a 2012b found that bioleaching process could also improve the dewaterability and synchronously enhance the solubilization of heavy metals through increasing oxidation reduction potential orp and decreasing ph silva et al 2019 reported that the electrochemically assisted dewatering process can also help to exhaust the organic pollutants e g herbicide clopyralid antibiotics amoxicillin and ampicillin adsorbed onto the sludge which is beneficial for avoiding the diffusion of hazardous pollution during sludge land application according to the discussion in this section the sludge conditioning process generally has positive effects on the resource recovery of sewage sludge especially the nutrient recovery based on the disintegration of sludge flocs the integration of sludge conditioning and nutrient recovery should be a promising way worth to be further extended 5 2 energy recovery anaerobic digestion is the major way of sludge treatment towards energy recovery as the form of methane joo et al 2016 however conventional anaerobic digestion requires the solid content below 5 wt liao and li 2015 yin et al 2016 and the anaerobic digestion of dewatered sludge probably leads to the local accumulation of volatile fatty acids inhibiting the activity of methanogens appels et al 2011 shen et al 2015 yin et al 2016 although some recent attempts applied thermal hydrolysis to dewatered sludge solid content of 10 20 wt for improving anaerobic digestion performance the large energy consumption and high operation cost could still be the drawbacks dai et al 2013a duan et al 2012 in addition the most commonly used conditioning reagents including pacl and pfc inhibit the methanogenic activity through ph drop induced by al3 fe3 hydrolysis chaudhari et al 2007 it was reported that al3 suppressed the metabolism process related to the reduction of co2 by h2 which resulted in the decrease of ch4 production wu et al 2019c the use of cpam inevitably introduces the toxic monomer acrylamide into sludge and poses negative effects on the hydrolysis stage of anaerobic digestion and also increases risks for agricultural application dai et al 2013b wang et al 2018a however due to the low cost and wide range of source no viable alternatives with low environmental impacts can currently replace pacl and pfc to what extent al3 and fe3 inhibit the biological conversion of waste activated sludge or methane production still needs to be further quantitively studied if the added value of sludge utilization e g energy recovery or resource recovery is too low to balance the operational cost of dewatering unit the minor improvement of conditioning reagents with cost increase cannot be acceptable by engineering applications therefore the technical progress is still expected to overcome the conflict between economic performance and environmental impact of conditioning reagents that s also the reason why most of the conditioning technologies reviewed in section 4 cannot be commercialized for decades one approach capable of achieving several treatment and recovery goals for biosolids would be combustion based technologies associated with incineration gasification or pyrolysis the self sustained incineration of sludge commonly requires the water content below 60 wt currently it is necessary to use pacl and pfc with the dosages higher than 5 wt in order to help the sludge dewatered by mechanical pressure filtration meet the water content limit of 60 wt the large addition of inorganic coagulant containing chlorine decreases the sludge calorific value stresses the pollution control of incineration flue gas and aggravates device corrosion the existing results indicated that 10 wt dm of cao decreased the dry base caloric value of sludge over 15 barber 2007 kijo kleczkowska et al 2016 xu et al 2014 compared with the pacl added dosage 2 wt dm and pam added dosage 0 05 wt dm sludge the chlorine containing conditioning reagents would increase the dioxin concentration in flue gas by 3 times chang et al 2013 lin et al 2015 pyrolysis is another thermochemical technology that can be applied to dewatered sludge for energy recovery tian et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 limited studies specifically focus on the effect of conditioning operation on pyrolysis performance such as bio oil yield or flammable gas yield the previous study attempted to use fe2 so4 3 as amendment for producing fe amended char and minimizing the bio crude yield of sludge pyrolysis yu et al 2018 while the addition of aluminum based conditioning reagent could facilitate the pore forming of bio char zhang et al 2013 and the fixation of phosphorus in solid phase thomsen et al 2017 the conditioning agent cao was found to be capable of fixing sulfur in solid products and accordingly improve the syngas quality of sludge pyrolysis liu et al 2014 tang et al 2018 however how the types and dosages of conditioning reagents affect the chemical transformations during sludge pyrolysis is still worth to be systematically analyzed especially the potential of added conditioning reagents in improving the qualities of pyrolysis produced fuel oil and flammable gas can be further explored recent studies developed the water extraction process by hydrate formation for free conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge and the dewatered sludge could be accordingly used as solid fuel to balance the energy consumption of water extraction process our previous study wu et al 2018a and oshita et al li et al 2014 oshita et al 2011 2012 used propane and dimethyl ether as hydrate precursor respectively and the energy consumption of hydrate based dewatering could be partially balanced 30 50 by the subsequent incineration of dewatered sludge according to the above discussion most of existing dewatering conditioning approaches have negative effects on the energy recovery from sewage sludge especially due to the biological toxicity of conditioning reagents and the secondary pollution risks caused by conditioning operations the environmentally friendly or free conditioning dewatering processes for sludge treatment are still demanded to significantly improve the energy utilization efficiency of sewage sludge 5 3 regeneration as functional materials due to the carbon rich characteristic of sewage sludge and its transition metal constituents with various catalytic performances the thermal conversion of dewatered sewage sludge into high value added carbonaceous materials has become a prospective direction for sludge utilization for example several studies found that fe containing residue of pfc pretreated sludge after pyrolysis can be used as the heterogeneous catalyst of fenton reaction yuan and dai 2016 accordingly the sludge based fe loaded fenton catalyst was developed for the oxidative degradation of acid orange ii tu et al 2012 yuan et al yuan and dai 2014 synthesized an alternative sludge based functional material via a facile one step calcination method at 350 c for 3 h and demonstrated its efficiency and stability as a heterogeneous photo fenton catalyst similarly hou et al 2016 reported the feasibility of fe rich sludge served as a catalytic particle electrode in the electro fenton process ai et al 2019 used carbon based functional material obtained from kmno4 fe ii conditioning sludge to remove toxic arsenic from contaminant ground water xu et al 2014 used cao pretreated sludge for the production of cement matrix our previous study wu et al 2018b used k2feo4 oxidation to improve the dewaterability of sludge and the pretreated sludge containing fe was further thermally converted into fe doped sludge derived mesoporous material for re utilizing it as the catalyst of aop and filtration aid which effectively integrated the enhanced dewatering process and resource utilization of sludge according to the discussion in this section the added conditioning reagents can be chemically converted into the key functional compositions during the synthesis of the sludge based materials however the systematical design for scaling up these processes is still demanded and life cycle assessment should be significantly taken into consideration moreover the development of high value added products from sewage sludge for example the functional materials for greenhouse gas emission control or flue gas treatment is still worth to be further explored 6 concluding remarks dewatering is an essential process for the appropriate treatment of sewage sludge continuous effects in the last decades have been devoted to revealing the influencing factors on sludge dewaterability and developing highly efficient conditioning technologies however the critical review presented here indicates that there are still many unsettled issues about either mechanistic researches or factory scale applications from our point view the required development could include 1 the thermodynamic analysis on the solid liquid interfacial interaction in sludge is still insufficient the quantitative characterization on the binding strength of water molecules to solid phase is expected also in order to accurately evaluate the sludge dewaterability and optimize the energy consumption of dewatering process more efforts should be devoted to quantifying the different water fractions we believe that a better understanding of water occurrence states in sewage sludge will consolidate the theoretical foundation of water removal from highly hydrophilic bio aggregates 2 although a variety of physiochemical properties were verified to have correlations with the dewaterability a unified theory for the improvement of sludge dewaterability is still deficient the exact physiochemical mechanism for the water holding capacities of bio flocs needs to be further deepened more importance can be attached to how the molecular conformation of eps influences the water solid interface behavior and the in situ visualization methods would be promising for unveiling the related mechanism through the micro scale characterization of sludge constituents 3 various physical and chemical approaches have been developed to improve sludge dewaterability however how to select the appropriate conditioning technique for the sludge with the specific physiochemical properties remains unclear despite the bench scale dewatering measurements of cst and srf we propose that the reliable indicators are still deficient for real time control of conditioning operations some recently developed machine learning technologies for example artificial neutral network can be attempted to clarify the complex non linear relationships among sludge compositions rheological properties and dewaterability 4 more attention should be paid to the effects of conditioning operations on the subsequent re utilization or safe disposal of sewage sludge dewatering can be taken as an intermediate link enhancing resource value instead of the volume reduction step facilitating sludge disposal the technical progress in conditioning approaches is expected to facilitate the re utilization of sewage sludge accordingly only if the added value of sludge utilization e g energy recovery or resource recovery is able to fully or partially balance the operational cost of dewatering unit the improvement of conditioning approach with cost increase can be acceptable by engineering implementations 5 to minimize the environmental impacts of sludge conditioning processes some novel environmentally friendly technical means including extracellular protein denaturation water extraction by hydrate formation and osmotic technique can be explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17867,the natural aquatic environment is a significant contributor to the development and circulation of clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes args the potential for the aquatic environment to act as a reservoir for arg accumulation in areas receiving anthropogenic contamination has been thoroughly researched however the emergence of novel args in the absence of external influences as well as the capacity of environmental bacteria to disseminate args via mobile genetic elements remain relatively unchallenged in order to address these knowledge gaps this scoping literature review was established focusing on the detection of two important and readily mobile args namely extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl and carbapenemase genes this review included 41 studies from 19 different countries a range of different water bodies including rivers n 26 seawaters n 6 and lakes n 3 amongst others were analysed in the included studies esbl genes were reported in 29 41 70 7 studies while carbapenemase genes were reported in 13 41 31 7 including joint reporting in 9 studies the occurrence of mobile genetic elements was evaluated which included the detection of integrons n 22 plasmids n 18 insertion sequences n 4 and transposons n 3 the ability of environmental bacteria to successfully transfer resistance genes via conjugation was also examined in 11 of the included studies the findings of this scoping review expose the presence of clinically significant args in the natural aquatic environment and highlights the potential ability of environmental isolates to disseminate these genes among different bacterial species as such the results presented demonstrate how anthropogenic point discharges may not act as the sole contributor to the development and spread of clinically significant antibiotic resistances a number of critical knowledge gaps in current research were also identified key highlights include the limited number of studies focusing on antibiotic resistance in uncontaminated aquatic environments as well as the lack of standardisation among methodologies of reviewed investigations graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic environment antibiotic resistance extended spectrum beta lactamase carbapenemase mobile genetic elements abbreviations arg antibiotic resistance gene esbl extended spectrum beta lactamase mge mobile genetic element ears net european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network ecdc european centre for disease prevention and control who world health organization 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is recognised as a major threat to public health bacteria utilise a range of mechanisms to evade the effects of antibiotics leading to challenges in clinical infection treatments these range from non specific processes including increased efflux pump activity or downregulation of porin channels to the production of enzymes that specifically target and inactivate antibiotics peterson and kaur 2018 as bacteria continue to adapt to the presence of antibiotics through the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes args via mobile genetic elements mges available antibiotics are becoming less effective due to the growing limitation of treatment options older antibiotics such as colistin which can cause negative side effects morrill et al 2015 are being employed to treat infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to last resort antibiotics the increase in the proportion of serious infections associated with extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl and carbapenemase producing organisms is a significant clinical concern esbl enzymes have evolved by point mutations occurring in beta lactamase genes such as bla tem 1 bla tem 2 and bla shv 1 shaikh et al 2015 the ambler classification is used to categorise these beta lactamases based on their amino acid sequence ambler 1980 many of the clinically significant esbls including tem shv and ctx m variants belong to ambler class a liakopoulos et al 2016 the most commonly detected carbapenemase enzymes belong to 3 ambler classes class a e g kpc class b e g ndm vim imp and class d e g oxa 48 fröhlich et al 2019 both esbl and carbapenemase genes are commonly associated with plasmid carriage enabling their widespread dissemination the ability of bacteria to share genes between different dna molecules and further exchange mges across different bacterial species is a key tool for survival and persistence amid environmental challenges mobility of args is achieved by three mechanisms i transduction ii transformation and iii conjugation some genetic elements classed as being mobile can only move within and between dna located in the same bacterial cell partridge et al 2018 these include insertion sequences and integrons however if these dna segments harbor args and relocate to a plasmid then the bacterium has the ability to transfer these genes to another bacterium similarly conjugative transposons can excise from dna in one bacterial cell and move to another when there is direct cell to cell contact salyers et al 1995 the transfer of args within plasmids via conjugation often carried out in a controlled laboratory setting can confirm the presence of resistance genes on mges while also demonstrating the ease and speed at which bacteria can transfer args yin et al 2013 this highlights the danger of mges in comparison to intrinsic resistance whereby the rapid expansion of resistance genes across all types of bacterial species can occur rather than the inheritance in one species via vertical transmission this ability enables highly virulent and pathogenic bacteria to acquire args from harmless environmental isolates favoring their survival the inherent complexity of horizontal gene transfer among bacteria precludes full comprehension of the mechanisms involved in arg transfer a recent review by leclerc et al 2019 highlighted several critical knowledge gaps relating to the movement of args via horizontal gene transfer this included the lack of studies examining horizontal gene transfer via transduction and transformation and the predominant use of one bacterial species escherichia coli to demonstrate genetic transfer in the laboratory when interspecies transfer is common overall the extent and nature of gene transfer remains ambiguous especially in vast environmental reservoirs awareness surrounding the importance of employing a one health approach encompassing human animal and environmental health when investigating and tackling antibiotic resistance has increased in recent years this is highlighted in the world health organization who global action plan on antimicrobial resistance who 2015 this report emphasizes the need for further research in terms of transmission routes of antibiotic resistance including food water and the natural environment concomitant with the prominence of the one health concept there has been an upsurge in research relating to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the environment nonetheless information regarding the presence of naturally occurring args in the absence of anthropogenic pressures and how they are disseminated to potentially pathogenic species in the environment is lacking many bacteria and fungi that are ubiquitous in nature can produce molecules with antibacterial properties which are thought to play a role in communication and competition singer et al 2006 the cephalosporin class of antibiotics originated from a fungus acremonium chrysogenum which was isolated from a sewage outfall point in seawater in the late 1940 s brakhage 1998 resistance to the third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime attributable to esbl production was first reported in the early 1980 s rawat and nair 2010 the majority of these esbl enzymes including shv and tem were first discovered in the nosocomial setting however the lack of environmental research during the 1980 s warrants the possibility of their presence in the environment being overlooked most microorganisms that produce antibiotics in the natural environment have the corresponding resistance genes present in their genome allen et al 2010 which strengthens the possibility of some clinically significant args originating from environmental organisms in the case of the bla ctx m genes their origins have been traced to the chromosome of kluyvera species which has been isolated from environmental waters and soils cantón et al 2012a the importance of soil bacteria as the progenitors of the bla ctx m genes was further established by graham et al 2016 who detected the presence of this esbl gene in soils dating back to 1923 prior to antibiotic use in medicine in denmark in the 1930s similarly the origins of the carbapenem class of antibiotics dates back to 1976 through the discovery of thienamycin from a soil bacterium known as streptomyces cattleya papp wallace et al 2011 the first reports of carbapenem hydrolysing enzymes known as carbapenemases emerged in the early 1990s from clinical isolates cantón et al 2012b however investigations in to the origins of some of these genes revealed environmental strains as the progenitors one example is the bla oxa 48 carbapenemase encoding gene that was traced back to an environmental strain of shewanella spp tacão et al 2018 this recent discovery emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of the environment in predicting emerging resistances as well as the dissemination of known args which negatively impact clinical treatment outcomes recently consideration has been given to the role of natural production of antibacterial molecules in the formation and spread of args in the environment researchers are beginning to examine sites deemed to be pristine in terms of anthropogenic influence anthropogenic influence encompasses all human activities that result in the contamination of the environment interestingly different args have been detected at some pristine locations van goethem et al 2018 recently reported a low abundance of ambler class a b and c beta lactamases in remote antarctic surface soils at a site categorised as pristine however according to allen et al 2010 it is challenging to label a geographical area as completely pristine arguing that the only environments globally entirely devoid from human antibiotic prevalence existed in the pre antibiotic era this is due to the potential spread of antibiotic resistance from areas under anthropogenic pressures via wildlife and or environmental transmission routes including regional global wind and water circulation and cycles however research in remote environments free from anthropogenic pressures is providing further insights into args that are vertically inherited over multiple bacterial generations van goethem et al 2018 enabling bacterial survival in the presence of natural antibiotic production permafrost cores are a prime example of a remote environment typically devoid of anthropogenic activity that can preserve and prevent migration of bacteria over many years perron et al 2015 identified genes that could potentially confer low level antibiotic resistance in the permafrost core as well as genes conferring resistance to beta lactams aminoglycosides and tetracyclines in the upper active layers these types of studies strengthen the theory that the development of antibiotic resistance may be a natural occurrence in the absence of anthropogenic based pressures the aim of this scoping literature review was to analyse the role of the natural aquatic environment in the transmission of clinically significant antibiotic resistances determinants specifically esbl and carbapenemase encoding genes in this paper we define natural aquatic environments as water bodies that are not in direct receipt of contaminating discharges thus receiving minimal anthropogenic influence in this context the review aimed to identify collate and analyse data from studies examining mges in antibiotic resistant isolates obtained from water bodies furthermore current knowledge gaps for further research were identified and highlighted the focus on water derives from the vital and constant interaction that both humans and animals have with aquatic systems be it through recreational activities or consumption this inextricable link constitutes an increased likelihood for the potential spread of antibiotic resistant organisms to both humans and animals highlighting the importance of a one health approach 2 methods 2 1 research question and database queries the following research question was formulated to focus and direct the scoping review what role does the natural aquatic environment play in the transmission of esbl and carbapenemase encoding genes via mobile genetic elements the scoping review protocol was adapted from previously published papers andrade et al 2018 greig et al 2014 in summary a search string was formed based on the established research question which comprised of a combination of relevant search terms adapted to each individual database supplementary table 1 databases employed in literature searches included pubmed medline embase web of science and scopus searches were conducted on june 10th 2019 mesh terms were applied when using the pubmed database in order to employ the medical vocabulary thesaurus the explode function was used in the medline embase search string in order to search for narrower subject headings under the database s hierarchy tree the field tag ts was applied to the web of science database to focus the search string on the topic of the articles the search string was adapted to the scopus database using title abs key to identify the search terms in titles abstracts and keywords relevant subject areas and source types were also selected and applied in each database to limit the numbers of irrelevant articles retrieved all articles obtained from the searches were exported to endnote and duplicates were removed 2 2 additional sources grey literature was examined by applying the general phrase antibiotic resistance in the environment to the following databases trip www tripdatabase com base www base search net cdc www cdc gov ecdc www ecdc europa eu and research gate www researchgate net supplementary searches employing google scholar were also incorporated into the protocol bibliography screening of the final set of included papers was carried out in an attempt to identify additional relevant articles not captured within the original review protocol 2 3 screening phase and inclusion exclusion criteria phase 1 consisted of two independent reviewers screening the titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles against a pre defined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria revision by a third independent reviewer was utilised to derive an outcome in cases where article inclusion exclusion could not be agreed upon by the two independent reviewers the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied during the screening phase are outlined in table 1 two main limitations and or thresholds were set for article inclusion i investigations published between 2008 and 2019 and ii full text provided in english the publication year restriction was applied due to the upsurge in research related to the area of antibiotic resistance in the environment during this time period this was evident following application of the search string to the scopus database and analyses of the publication dates of retrieved articles additionally this year range was employed because older methods of analysing dna e g pulse field electrophoresis would not be comparable to more modern molecular methods such as whole genome sequencing no geographical thresholds were implemented for article inclusion exclusion given the limited number of studies that tested water bodies reported to be strictly free from contamination it was decided that urban waters would be included if investigations did not mention the presence of point contaminant sources upstream or in close proximity of the sampling area evidently inclusion of investigations with sample areas potentially under the influence of non point sources increases the likelihood of contamination from anthropogenic sources however considering the uncertainty in terms of presence of local anthropogenic influence it was deemed these investigations were relevant to the research question and included into the screening process papers featuring sample collection upstream and downstream of a point discharge were included extracting data solely from upstream samples in order to accommodate inclusion criteria i e no perceived local point source s of pollution following the initial title abstract screening phase 2 consisted of a full text review conducted by two independent reviewers full text screening employed additional methodology criteria for article inclusion exclusion i the genomic detection of esbl and or carbapenemase genes ii the genomic detection of mges or demonstration of transferability of resistance genes by experimentation in the case of articles where information on the variant of the beta lactamase gene detected using genotypic methods was lacking phenotypic screening such as antibiotic susceptibility testing was used to determine if the genes detected were true esbl carbapenemase producers as an example the bla shv and bla tem genes have some variants allowing for classifications as esbl producers bla tem 3 and bla shv 12 and some which are classified simply as beta lactamases bla tem 1 bla shv 1 3 results 3 1 screening stages for article inclusion a total number of 1415 articles were identified and subject to the first screening stage following application of the search string to the 5 main databases including pubmed scopus web of science medline and embase fig 1 an additional 5 peer reviewed articles were identified from grey literature queries placing the total number of articles at 1420 following initial title and abstract screening 1313 articles were excluded with a total of 107 articles subject to full text review this was narrowed down to 34 following exclusion of 73 articles that failed to meet pre established inclusion exclusion criteria the most common exclusion factor was local presence of point source discharges n 24 a recurrent feature during this screening phase was the lack of detail provided in the results of several investigations which often resulted in article exclusion several investigations failed to link the results presented to specific site types analysed e g polluted pristine but instead provided a general summary of all resistance genes detected e g dhawde et al 2018 in other cases due to the extensive nature of the data generated primarily a feature of investigations employing metagenomics args were often summarised to an overly generic level in some instances only the quantity of beta lactamase resistance genes that were present in a given sample were discussed rather than providing details on the different types of resistance genes or their location within the chromosome or mobile genetic element garner et al 2016 as such it was not possible to determine the types of beta lactamase genes detected bibliography screening of the 34 included papers following the pre defined inclusion exclusion criteria identified an additional 14 potentially suitable articles six of these papers were included for analysis increasing the total number of articles for inclusion to 40 a single article was identified during a general search using google scholar bringing the final number of included articles to 41 3 2 data extraction all 41 identified articles were subject to data extraction based on a number of pre established data fields table 2 primary data extraction fields included i country of origin for sample s analysed ii type of sample analysed e g seawater river lake iii types of mobile genetic elements detected e g plasmids integrons etc iv the application of conjugation transfer and whether it was successful at transferring the args of interest and v esbl and or carbapenemase gene variants detected a range of data fields supplementing the information presented in table 2 and pertaining local environments e g local discharges downstream of sampling points bacterial species detected and further information on the types of mobile genetic elements detected e g plasmid incompatibility groups integron class are outlined in supplementary table 2 similarly data relating to the methodology implemented in each investigation including initial collection volumes processing and genomic screening based methods for args and mges are provided in supplementary table 3 3 3 summary analysis of included studies the geographical distribution of included investigations is shown in fig 2 overall studies derived from nineteen different countries across five continents as such the data presented is representative of water bodies at a global scale but primarily comprises investigations based in europe n 18 and asia n 13 the remainder of identified investigations were based in africa n 5 south america n 4 and north america n 1 china featured as the country with most investigations n 8 followed by poland n 4 india n 4 and brazil n 4 overall the methodology employed for sample collection processing and genomic screening varied substantially among investigations supplementary table 3 sample volumes collected exhibited wide variations ranging from swab placement in water for 24 h dolejská et al 2009 to analysis of 7 l of water tacão et al 2012 concentration methods also varied significantly with filtration using a 0 45 μm n 14 and 0 22 μm n 6 being the most prevalent however a further 6 studies using a filtration approach failed to report filter pore size filtration was often followed by direct incubation of filters on agar plates n 12 pcr and subsequent sequencing n 18 featured as the most prominent molecular method employed to detect args and mges additional molecular detection methods included sole use of pcr n 16 or a sequencing approach n 5 the bacterial species most commonly detected was e coli with positive identification in a total of 24 investigations e coli detection was followed by klebsiella spp n 11 enterobacter spp n 6 and pseudomonas spp n 6 supplementary table 2 a range of natural water bodies were investigated in the reviewed studies inland waters were classified into lentic i e stationary or still water lotic i e free flowing water and sub surface groundwater lentic systems included lakes n 4 and ponds n 1 whereas lotic systems encompassed rivers n 28 and streams n 1 additionally seawater n 6 or bay waters n 1 were classified as coastal marine only two investigations evaluated sub surface groundwater for the presence of args a total of two included articles evaluated more than one type of water body rivers and lakes or groundwater in terms of arg and mge detection a summary of the numbers and types of each are provided in fig 3 a total of 33 41 80 5 investigations detected the presence of esbl and or carbapenemase genes in water samples specifically 20 41 48 8 studies detected esbl genes 4 41 9 8 studies detected carbapenemase genes and 9 41 22 0 detected dual presence the most commonly detected esbl resistance gene was bla ctx m n 21 closely followed by bla tem n 18 regarding the detection of carbapenemase resistance genes bla kpc was the most commonly detected gene with identification in 6 reviewed studies this was followed by bla vim n 3 bla ndm n 3 and bla imp n 2 in comparison to resistance gene detection a larger proportion of studies 37 41 90 2 detected the presence of one or more mge this included class 1 2 and 3 integrons n 22 plasmids n 18 insertion sequences n 4 and transposons n 3 in terms of integrons class 1 was the most prominent n 20 followed by class 2 n 6 and class 3 n 1 regarding plasmid incompatibility groups the most commonly detected types were incfib n 10 followed by incn n 8 furthermore 11 studies also demonstrated successful conjugation transfer of args 4 discussion this scoping literature review was established in order to examine existing scientific literature relating to the role of the natural aquatic environment in harboring and transmitting args of clinical importance here an exclusive focus was placed on areas with minimal direct anthropogenic contamination a key highlight from this investigation is the relative limited number of studies focusing on the nexus between the natural unpolluted aquatic environment and the presence of antibiotic resistance a significant feature identified through the review protocol is a tendency for investigations to attempt to establish point sources as pollution agents however detection of resistance genes in uncontaminated areas is generally overlooked overall the detection of esbl and or carbapenemase genes in 33 41 80 5 identified studies serves to demonstrate the importance of natural water bodies as large reservoirs of multiple args a high proportion of studies 37 41 90 2 demonstrated the presence of one or more mge highlighting the potential dissemination of args among environmental bacteria accordingly the presented figures highlight the key role of the natural aquatic environment as a significant reservoir of args 4 1 synopsis of identified literature publication dates of included articles ranged from 2008 to 2019 with the majority published between 2016 and 2019 29 41 70 7 the upsurge in publications observed in recent years concurs with an increased interest by the research community in investigating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in environmental settings kraemer et al 2019 e coli was the most commonly detected species in 24 studies followed by klebsiella spp n 11 enterobacter spp n 6 and pseudomonas spp n 6 supplementary table 2 these bacteria are often associated with clinical infections and as a result some methodologies employed a selection bias using selective broths and agars supplementary table 3 a range of natural water bodies were investigated in the reviewed studies however the majority of studies focused on lotic systems n 29 70 7 the high incidence of studies based on these systems may be associated with the smaller dimensions of rivers streams in comparison to larger marine and coastal water bodies equating to a lesser dilutional effect on viable antibiotic resistant organisms additionally lotic systems are often located within urban and agricultural landscapes with river sourced water often used as a domestic water supply and thus representing a potential pathway for antibiotic resistance transmission to humans as indicated above based on the lack of studies investigating pristine aquatic environments water bodies labelled as urban were also included in the review protocol if no local point sources were described a prevalent methodological approach among river based investigations included collection of water samples in areas upstream and downstream of a discharge point in order to ascertain the influence of discharges in the proliferation of environmental args as mentioned above only articles featuring sampling regimes based on collection of upstream samples were included in the review in order to accommodate inclusion criteria i e no perceived local point source s of pollution the low number of investigations based on marine coastal and lake environments that were free from anthropogenic contamination represents a key research gap considering their potential importance as environmental pathways for the transmission of antibiotic resistance to humans particularly through recreational exposure leonard et al 2018 possible reasons for the low number of marine based investigations observed may include lack of access to coastal sampling sites in landlocked countries or the potential for lower rates of bacterial survival in saltwater serving as a deterrent rozen and belkin 2001 in terms of lakes ponds their absence as prevalent landscape components in certain geographical settings may preclude their analysis however they do also pose a significant threat for the potential transmission of args to humans bengtsson palme et al 2014 4 2 antibiotic resistance gene detection a higher detection rate of esbl n 29 genes in comparison to carbapenemase genes n 13 among included studies may be attributable to the fact that esbl enzymes emerged approximately 10 years prior to carbapenemase detection in addition carbapenem antibiotics are classified as reserved restricted in many countries and therefore only used as a last resort in an attempt to circumvent further resistance development however both third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are classified as critically important antibiotics employed in veterinary medicine who 2016 consequently esbl producing bacteria and to a lesser extent carbapenemase producers are disseminated throughout most environments on a country basis brazil had the highest number of detected carbapenemase genes featuring in 3 out of a possible 4 studies interestingly all 3 positive studies detected bla kpc 2 this carbapenemase gene was first detected in the usa in 1996 and is now considered as endemic in brazil lee et al 2016 although china had the largest number of included studies carbapenemase enzymes were only reported in 1 8 studies in turn china accounted for the highest detection rates of esbls among included investigations 8 8 generally esbls were widespread across countries and continents fig 2 this potentially reflects their widespread dissemination and or natural occurrence in the aquatic environment as supported by several investigations swedan and abu alrub 2019 de oliveira et al 2017 yamashita et al 2017 adesoji and ogunjobi 2016 the most commonly detected esbl gene was bla ctx m n 21 this is unsurprising as the origins of this gene has been traced back to the environmental organism kluyvera previously isolated from water bodies cantón et al 2012a this was followed by bla tem n 18 bla shv n 11 and bla oxa n 9 esbl types these findings concur with additional studies screening for esbl genes in the environment for example ranjbar and sami 2017 detected bla tem bla ctx bla shv and bla oxa esbl types at a frequency of 37 27 27 and 25 respectively in an investigation based on the analysis of river water in terms of the carbapenemase encoding genes bla kpc was the most commonly detected gene in 6 41 14 6 included studies this was followed by bla vim n 3 bla ndm n 3 and bla imp n 2 these enzymes were first identified in clinical isolates khan et al 2017 yigit et al 2001 lauretti et al 1999 osano et al 1994 however their presence in the environment prior to reports in the nosocomial setting may have gone unidentified recent linkages of bla oxa 48 with the environmental shewanella species reported by tacão et al 2018 serves to highlight this possibility positive detection of esbl and or carbapenemase genes in 33 41 80 5 investigations indicates the ubiquitous occurrence of these clinically significant args in natural aquatic environments at a global scale however an important consideration in this area of research is publication bias against negative results this bias could potentially inflate the high percentage of included studies with positive detections unfortunately this is not a type of bias that can be controlled for within the scope of this review but should be considered when interpreting the results reviewed investigations with negative detection of esbls and or carbapenemases included a range of different sample types including river water n 2 lake water n 1 river and lake water n 1 seawater n 2 stream water n 1 and pond water n 1 large variations in methods employed observed among these articles may be associated with the lack of detection of args small volumes of water were collected for analysis among some investigations for example dolejská et al 2009 employed the use of swabs placed in a pond for 24 h as the initial sample collection technique while ben said et al 2016 collected 5 ml volumes of water for analysis supplementary table 3 additionally certain processing techniques may have influenced the results harnisz and korzeniewska 2018 diluted samples with saline in contrast to the filtration and enrichment prior to culturing approach employed in other investigations e g bajaj et al 2016 the large variation in methodologies employed demonstrates a lack of standardisation among environmental sampling and laboratory processing which prevents robust comparisons among reported results 4 3 mobile genetic element detection in comparison to resistance gene detection a larger proportion 37 41 90 2 of included studies detected the presence of one or more mge this included class 1 2 and 3 integrons n 22 plasmids n 18 insertion sequences n 4 and transposons n 3 fig 3 additionally 11 studies demonstrated successful conjugation transfer of args between different bacteria the combination of these elements represent the potential for dissemination of resistance elements among aquatic bacteria which may be attributed as a contributing factor in the detection of resistance in areas deemed to be free from anthropogenic influence the reported high level of detection emphasizes the ability of most bacteria to exchange genetic elements that are favourable to their survival across bacterial species making this threat almost impossible to contain this feature serves to highlight the challenges of containing and or mitigating the environmental spread of args the most commonly reported mges were integrons which have previously been detected in a wide variety of environments including soil sediment biofilms as well as waters irrespective of antibiotic contamination abella et al 2015 their ability to be transferred via insertion sequences transposons and plasmids due to co selection with resistance genes further amplifies their presence in clinical environments class 1 and 3 integrons and to a lesser extent class 2 are commonly detected in invasive bacterial isolates as a result these classes of integrons were largely screened for among included investigations however this approach may be underestimating the integron class diversity in aquatic environments and in turn the ability of environmental species to disseminate args abella et al 2015 plasmids were the second most commonly detected mge identified in 18 studies fig 3 these elements are responsible for dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements via conjugation san millan 2018 while capable of harboring and transmitting multiple gene types args have been closely linked with plasmids due to the clinical implications in terms of treatment several plasmid incompatibility groups were detected among reviewed investigations including incfib n 10 and incn n 8 which were the most commonly detected although not all studies confirmed the presence of resistance gene s on a plasmid the potential transfer of the resistance gene from the chromosome to a plasmid and its further dissemination across bacterial species via conjugation is possible the successful conjugation transfer of resistance elements in the laboratory in 11 41 26 8 investigations strengthens this possibility of arg propagation in aquatic environments notably conjugation experiments were all performed using e coli as the recipient with the majority using the j53 strain the latter is in agreement with the review performed by leclerc et al 2019 highlighting the prevalence of e coli as a common recipient for conjugation transfer and the general lack of investigations attempting interspecies transfer however in the review dataset some of the environmental isolates used as conjugation donors were klebsiella and or acinetobacter ye et al 2017 osińska et al 2016 yin et al 2013 hence there was an attempt at demonstrating interspecies transfer in a limited number of cases 4 4 sources of resistance a range of sources were linked with the incidence of args in the aquatic environments sampled in the reviewed papers for example jørgensen et al 2017a detected bla ctx m 1 and mentioned human bathing boat toilets farm animals fertilizers or birds as potential sources contributing to the presence of antibiotic resistance similarly nascimento et al 2017 detected bla kpc and bla ctx m types and hypothesized that nosocomial or domestic sewage had entered the lake system via a stream despite treatment in a flotation treatment plant prior to lake discharge beyond ouyang et al 2015 few studies considered the possibility of naturally occurring antibiotic resistance in uncontaminated aquatic environments in this study a pristine site was sampled in a remote location which yielded the detection of 69 antibiotic resistance genes the results presented were construed as indicative of ubiquitous antibiotic resistance in natural environments however the prevailing notion of arg dissemination from regions under the influence of contaminating discharges to those without it remains largely unchallenged accordingly further research into intrinsic antibiotic resistance in environmental organisms and the dissemination of args inclusive of pathways modes and extent is urgently needed the lack of standardised methodology adopted among identified investigations represents a significant knowledge gap and a challenge for the interpretation of collated data in particular issues with method sensitivity and the lack of valid comparisons to analyse reported results are apparent as such a strong argument is made for future investigations to adopt a more standardised methodological approach that is sensitive enough to detect low levels of antibiotic resistance genes similarly future research should also take associated human risks into consideration e g potential consumption volumes during recreational activities and infectious dose of organisms evidently methodology criteria applied in this review attempted to standardise articles with highly variable collection volumes and processing techniques as much as possible in particular the application of positive genomic detection criteria of args and mges increased the comparability across studies eliminating the need for comparison of phenotypic antibiotic resistance in one investigation to genomic arg detection in another in general the lack of relevant journal articles identified limited the inclusion restrictions that could be applied in terms of sampling volumes and processing predominantly the lack of consistent monitoring of the environment for antibiotic resistance worldwide severely limits our knowledge in this area the insufficient detail provided on anthropogenic contamination sources in relation to water bodies in several reviewed investigations represents a second important research gap overall it was not possible to ascertain if analysed water bodies were entirely free from contamination in some studies the sampling sites were labelled as pristine or in areas of strict preservation but others list sampling points as urban regions and so the likelihood of contamination is much greater supplementary table 2 this particular restraint means that this review could not be strictly confined to pristine aquatic environments but it does highlight the lack of research focus on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in natural unpolluted aquatic environments more research is required in the area as discovery of resistances of clinical significance in regions free from anthropogenic activity become more apparent additionally more emphasis should be placed on investigations tracing arg origins to environmental isolates and potentially screening the environment for novel args future research should also highlight the role of mges in the dissemination of resistance elements rather than focusing primarily on contaminating sources in several investigations only certain strains of isolated bacteria were further characterised for the presence of antibiotic resistance using phonotypic and genotypic methods these were generally restricted to highly virulent bacteria and those most often associated with clinical infections in humans as such some articles employed selective application of screening methods specific to detection of only certain types of bacteria e g ye et al 2017 kieffer et al 2016 stange et al 2016 this practice represents a major knowledge gap with the current role of ubiquitous non pathogenic bacteria in the transference of args largely unaccounted for emphasis on antibiotic resistance profiles rather than species detected should be employed by scientists considering mges that harbor resistance genes spread throughout different bacterial species similarly by confining environmental research to the most commonly identified mges within clinical environments the potential for transmission of args via mges present in natural aquatic environments is likely being underestimated of key relevance is the high prevalence of phenotypic screening methods employed in the majority of reviewed investigations this factor limited the detection of antibiotic resistance genes to those that reside within viable bacteria that are easily cultured however reportedly less than 1 of environmental bacteria can be easily cultured using standard laboratory techniques allen et al 2010 only four included studies performed pcr sequencing of the sample without prior culturing of organisms supplementary table 3 which enabled detection and analysis of fastidious bacteria overall current research tends to exclude less clinically significant and fastidious environmental bacteria which as a result may go unnoticed as harbouring mges capable of spreading antibiotic resistance elements ideally simultaneous application of both phenotypic culture methods and molecular analysis of environmental samples would need to be employed to generate complete resistance profiles inclusive of genetic composition as well as phenotypic expression 5 conclusions the results presented highlight the importance of aquatic environments as substantial reservoirs of esbl and carbapenemase args as such point contaminant sources may not be the sole contributors to the presence of antibiotic resistance in the aquatic environment additionally collated data serves to demonstrate the potential for interspecies transference of args among environmental bacteria to potentially pathogenic species the following recommendations are made based on their potential to contribute to our current understanding of both the prevalence and risk factors associated with args in aquatic environments routine screening of antibiotic resistance genes in water bodies particularly those considered to be disassociated from direct point contaminant sources a highly sensitive and standardised methodology which enables valid and robust comparisons among study outcomes incorporation of genomic screening and culture based analyses aiming to mitigate the selective bias imposed by culturing detailed reporting in investigations particularly in terms of study site characteristics e g location of possible non point and point sources implementation of replica aquatic environmental conjugation transformation transduction experiments demonstrating interspecies transfer future research should focus on these key areas to strengthen the body of evidence which suggests that args of clinical significance can potentially become widely disseminated by mges throughout uncontaminated aquatic environments outcomes from the reviewed investigations strengthen the need for a one health approach encompassing human animal and environmental health when tackling the immense threat of a world without effective antibiotics

17867,the natural aquatic environment is a significant contributor to the development and circulation of clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes args the potential for the aquatic environment to act as a reservoir for arg accumulation in areas receiving anthropogenic contamination has been thoroughly researched however the emergence of novel args in the absence of external influences as well as the capacity of environmental bacteria to disseminate args via mobile genetic elements remain relatively unchallenged in order to address these knowledge gaps this scoping literature review was established focusing on the detection of two important and readily mobile args namely extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl and carbapenemase genes this review included 41 studies from 19 different countries a range of different water bodies including rivers n 26 seawaters n 6 and lakes n 3 amongst others were analysed in the included studies esbl genes were reported in 29 41 70 7 studies while carbapenemase genes were reported in 13 41 31 7 including joint reporting in 9 studies the occurrence of mobile genetic elements was evaluated which included the detection of integrons n 22 plasmids n 18 insertion sequences n 4 and transposons n 3 the ability of environmental bacteria to successfully transfer resistance genes via conjugation was also examined in 11 of the included studies the findings of this scoping review expose the presence of clinically significant args in the natural aquatic environment and highlights the potential ability of environmental isolates to disseminate these genes among different bacterial species as such the results presented demonstrate how anthropogenic point discharges may not act as the sole contributor to the development and spread of clinically significant antibiotic resistances a number of critical knowledge gaps in current research were also identified key highlights include the limited number of studies focusing on antibiotic resistance in uncontaminated aquatic environments as well as the lack of standardisation among methodologies of reviewed investigations graphical abstract image 1

introduction antibiotic resistance is recognised as a major threat to public health bacteria utilise a range of mechanisms to evade the effects of antibiotics leading to challenges in clinical infection treatments these range from non specific processes including increased efflux pump activity or downregulation of porin channels to the production of enzymes that specifically target and inactivate antibiotics peterson and kaur 2018 as bacteria continue to adapt to the presence of antibiotics through the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes args via mobile genetic elements mges available antibiotics are becoming less effective due to the growing limitation of treatment options older antibiotics such as colistin which can cause negative side effects morrill et al 2015 are being employed to treat infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to last resort antibiotics the increase in the proportion of serious infections associated with extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl and carbapenemase producing organisms is a significant clinical concern esbl enzymes have evolved by point mutations occurring in beta lactamase genes such as bla tem 1 bla tem 2 and bla shv 1 shaikh et al 2015 the ambler classification is used to categorise these beta lactamases based on their amino acid sequence ambler 1980 many of the clinically significant esbls including tem shv and ctx m variants belong to ambler class a liakopoulos et al 2016 the most commonly detected carbapenemase enzymes belong to 3 ambler classes class a e g kpc class b e g ndm vim imp and class d e g oxa 48 fröhlich et al 2019 both esbl and carbapenemase genes are commonly associated with plasmid carriage enabling their widespread dissemination the ability of bacteria to share genes between different dna molecules and further exchange mges across different bacterial species is a key tool for survival and persistence amid environmental challenges mobility of args is achieved by three mechanisms i transduction ii transformation and iii conjugation some genetic elements classed as being mobile can only move within and between dna located in the same bacterial cell partridge et al 2018 these include insertion sequences and integrons however if these dna segments harbor args and relocate to a plasmid then the bacterium has the ability to transfer these genes to another bacterium similarly conjugative transposons can excise from dna in one bacterial cell and move to another when there is direct cell to cell contact salyers et al 1995 the transfer of args within plasmids via conjugation often carried out in a controlled laboratory setting can confirm the presence of resistance genes on mges while also demonstrating the ease and speed at which bacteria can transfer args yin et al 2013 this highlights the danger of mges in comparison to intrinsic resistance whereby the rapid expansion of resistance genes across all types of bacterial species can occur rather than the inheritance in one species via vertical transmission this ability enables highly virulent and pathogenic bacteria to acquire args from harmless environmental isolates favoring their survival the inherent complexity of horizontal gene transfer among bacteria precludes full comprehension of the mechanisms involved in arg transfer a recent review by leclerc et al 2019 highlighted several critical knowledge gaps relating to the movement of args via horizontal gene transfer this included the lack of studies examining horizontal gene transfer via transduction and transformation and the predominant use of one bacterial species escherichia coli to demonstrate genetic transfer in the laboratory when interspecies transfer is common overall the extent and nature of gene transfer remains ambiguous especially in vast environmental reservoirs awareness surrounding the importance of employing a one health approach encompassing human animal and environmental health when investigating and tackling antibiotic resistance has increased in recent years this is highlighted in the world health organization who global action plan on antimicrobial resistance who 2015 this report emphasizes the need for further research in terms of transmission routes of antibiotic resistance including food water and the natural environment concomitant with the prominence of the one health concept there has been an upsurge in research relating to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the environment nonetheless information regarding the presence of naturally occurring args in the absence of anthropogenic pressures and how they are disseminated to potentially pathogenic species in the environment is lacking many bacteria and fungi that are ubiquitous in nature can produce molecules with antibacterial properties which are thought to play a role in communication and competition singer et al 2006 the cephalosporin class of antibiotics originated from a fungus acremonium chrysogenum which was isolated from a sewage outfall point in seawater in the late 1940 s brakhage 1998 resistance to the third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime attributable to esbl production was first reported in the early 1980 s rawat and nair 2010 the majority of these esbl enzymes including shv and tem were first discovered in the nosocomial setting however the lack of environmental research during the 1980 s warrants the possibility of their presence in the environment being overlooked most microorganisms that produce antibiotics in the natural environment have the corresponding resistance genes present in their genome allen et al 2010 which strengthens the possibility of some clinically significant args originating from environmental organisms in the case of the bla ctx m genes their origins have been traced to the chromosome of kluyvera species which has been isolated from environmental waters and soils cantón et al 2012a the importance of soil bacteria as the progenitors of the bla ctx m genes was further established by graham et al 2016 who detected the presence of this esbl gene in soils dating back to 1923 prior to antibiotic use in medicine in denmark in the 1930s similarly the origins of the carbapenem class of antibiotics dates back to 1976 through the discovery of thienamycin from a soil bacterium known as streptomyces cattleya papp wallace et al 2011 the first reports of carbapenem hydrolysing enzymes known as carbapenemases emerged in the early 1990s from clinical isolates cantón et al 2012b however investigations in to the origins of some of these genes revealed environmental strains as the progenitors one example is the bla oxa 48 carbapenemase encoding gene that was traced back to an environmental strain of shewanella spp tacão et al 2018 this recent discovery emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of the environment in predicting emerging resistances as well as the dissemination of known args which negatively impact clinical treatment outcomes recently consideration has been given to the role of natural production of antibacterial molecules in the formation and spread of args in the environment researchers are beginning to examine sites deemed to be pristine in terms of anthropogenic influence anthropogenic influence encompasses all human activities that result in the contamination of the environment interestingly different args have been detected at some pristine locations van goethem et al 2018 recently reported a low abundance of ambler class a b and c beta lactamases in remote antarctic surface soils at a site categorised as pristine however according to allen et al 2010 it is challenging to label a geographical area as completely pristine arguing that the only environments globally entirely devoid from human antibiotic prevalence existed in the pre antibiotic era this is due to the potential spread of antibiotic resistance from areas under anthropogenic pressures via wildlife and or environmental transmission routes including regional global wind and water circulation and cycles however research in remote environments free from anthropogenic pressures is providing further insights into args that are vertically inherited over multiple bacterial generations van goethem et al 2018 enabling bacterial survival in the presence of natural antibiotic production permafrost cores are a prime example of a remote environment typically devoid of anthropogenic activity that can preserve and prevent migration of bacteria over many years perron et al 2015 identified genes that could potentially confer low level antibiotic resistance in the permafrost core as well as genes conferring resistance to beta lactams aminoglycosides and tetracyclines in the upper active layers these types of studies strengthen the theory that the development of antibiotic resistance may be a natural occurrence in the absence of anthropogenic based pressures the aim of this scoping literature review was to analyse the role of the natural aquatic environment in the transmission of clinically significant antibiotic resistances determinants specifically esbl and carbapenemase encoding genes in this paper we define natural aquatic environments as water bodies that are not in direct receipt of contaminating discharges thus receiving minimal anthropogenic influence in this context the review aimed to identify collate and analyse data from studies examining mges in antibiotic resistant isolates obtained from water bodies furthermore current knowledge gaps for further research were identified and highlighted the focus on water derives from the vital and constant interaction that both humans and animals have with aquatic systems be it through recreational activities or consumption this inextricable link constitutes an increased likelihood for the potential spread of antibiotic resistant organisms to both humans and animals highlighting the importance of a one health approach 2 methods 2 1 research question and database queries the following research question was formulated to focus and direct the scoping review what role does the natural aquatic environment play in the transmission of esbl and carbapenemase encoding genes via mobile genetic elements the scoping review protocol was adapted from previously published papers andrade et al 2018 greig et al 2014 in summary a search string was formed based on the established research question which comprised of a combination of relevant search terms adapted to each individual database supplementary table 1 databases employed in literature searches included pubmed medline embase web of science and scopus searches were conducted on june 10th 2019 mesh terms were applied when using the pubmed database in order to employ the medical vocabulary thesaurus the explode function was used in the medline embase search string in order to search for narrower subject headings under the database s hierarchy tree the field tag ts was applied to the web of science database to focus the search string on the topic of the articles the search string was adapted to the scopus database using title abs key to identify the search terms in titles abstracts and keywords relevant subject areas and source types were also selected and applied in each database to limit the numbers of irrelevant articles retrieved all articles obtained from the searches were exported to endnote and duplicates were removed 2 2 additional sources grey literature was examined by applying the general phrase antibiotic resistance in the environment to the following databases trip www tripdatabase com base www base search net cdc www cdc gov ecdc www ecdc europa eu and research gate www researchgate net supplementary searches employing google scholar were also incorporated into the protocol bibliography screening of the final set of included papers was carried out in an attempt to identify additional relevant articles not captured within the original review protocol 2 3 screening phase and inclusion exclusion criteria phase 1 consisted of two independent reviewers screening the titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles against a pre defined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria revision by a third independent reviewer was utilised to derive an outcome in cases where article inclusion exclusion could not be agreed upon by the two independent reviewers the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied during the screening phase are outlined in table 1 two main limitations and or thresholds were set for article inclusion i investigations published between 2008 and 2019 and ii full text provided in english the publication year restriction was applied due to the upsurge in research related to the area of antibiotic resistance in the environment during this time period this was evident following application of the search string to the scopus database and analyses of the publication dates of retrieved articles additionally this year range was employed because older methods of analysing dna e g pulse field electrophoresis would not be comparable to more modern molecular methods such as whole genome sequencing no geographical thresholds were implemented for article inclusion exclusion given the limited number of studies that tested water bodies reported to be strictly free from contamination it was decided that urban waters would be included if investigations did not mention the presence of point contaminant sources upstream or in close proximity of the sampling area evidently inclusion of investigations with sample areas potentially under the influence of non point sources increases the likelihood of contamination from anthropogenic sources however considering the uncertainty in terms of presence of local anthropogenic influence it was deemed these investigations were relevant to the research question and included into the screening process papers featuring sample collection upstream and downstream of a point discharge were included extracting data solely from upstream samples in order to accommodate inclusion criteria i e no perceived local point source s of pollution following the initial title abstract screening phase 2 consisted of a full text review conducted by two independent reviewers full text screening employed additional methodology criteria for article inclusion exclusion i the genomic detection of esbl and or carbapenemase genes ii the genomic detection of mges or demonstration of transferability of resistance genes by experimentation in the case of articles where information on the variant of the beta lactamase gene detected using genotypic methods was lacking phenotypic screening such as antibiotic susceptibility testing was used to determine if the genes detected were true esbl carbapenemase producers as an example the bla shv and bla tem genes have some variants allowing for classifications as esbl producers bla tem 3 and bla shv 12 and some which are classified simply as beta lactamases bla tem 1 bla shv 1 3 results 3 1 screening stages for article inclusion a total number of 1415 articles were identified and subject to the first screening stage following application of the search string to the 5 main databases including pubmed scopus web of science medline and embase fig 1 an additional 5 peer reviewed articles were identified from grey literature queries placing the total number of articles at 1420 following initial title and abstract screening 1313 articles were excluded with a total of 107 articles subject to full text review this was narrowed down to 34 following exclusion of 73 articles that failed to meet pre established inclusion exclusion criteria the most common exclusion factor was local presence of point source discharges n 24 a recurrent feature during this screening phase was the lack of detail provided in the results of several investigations which often resulted in article exclusion several investigations failed to link the results presented to specific site types analysed e g polluted pristine but instead provided a general summary of all resistance genes detected e g dhawde et al 2018 in other cases due to the extensive nature of the data generated primarily a feature of investigations employing metagenomics args were often summarised to an overly generic level in some instances only the quantity of beta lactamase resistance genes that were present in a given sample were discussed rather than providing details on the different types of resistance genes or their location within the chromosome or mobile genetic element garner et al 2016 as such it was not possible to determine the types of beta lactamase genes detected bibliography screening of the 34 included papers following the pre defined inclusion exclusion criteria identified an additional 14 potentially suitable articles six of these papers were included for analysis increasing the total number of articles for inclusion to 40 a single article was identified during a general search using google scholar bringing the final number of included articles to 41 3 2 data extraction all 41 identified articles were subject to data extraction based on a number of pre established data fields table 2 primary data extraction fields included i country of origin for sample s analysed ii type of sample analysed e g seawater river lake iii types of mobile genetic elements detected e g plasmids integrons etc iv the application of conjugation transfer and whether it was successful at transferring the args of interest and v esbl and or carbapenemase gene variants detected a range of data fields supplementing the information presented in table 2 and pertaining local environments e g local discharges downstream of sampling points bacterial species detected and further information on the types of mobile genetic elements detected e g plasmid incompatibility groups integron class are outlined in supplementary table 2 similarly data relating to the methodology implemented in each investigation including initial collection volumes processing and genomic screening based methods for args and mges are provided in supplementary table 3 3 3 summary analysis of included studies the geographical distribution of included investigations is shown in fig 2 overall studies derived from nineteen different countries across five continents as such the data presented is representative of water bodies at a global scale but primarily comprises investigations based in europe n 18 and asia n 13 the remainder of identified investigations were based in africa n 5 south america n 4 and north america n 1 china featured as the country with most investigations n 8 followed by poland n 4 india n 4 and brazil n 4 overall the methodology employed for sample collection processing and genomic screening varied substantially among investigations supplementary table 3 sample volumes collected exhibited wide variations ranging from swab placement in water for 24 h dolejská et al 2009 to analysis of 7 l of water tacão et al 2012 concentration methods also varied significantly with filtration using a 0 45 μm n 14 and 0 22 μm n 6 being the most prevalent however a further 6 studies using a filtration approach failed to report filter pore size filtration was often followed by direct incubation of filters on agar plates n 12 pcr and subsequent sequencing n 18 featured as the most prominent molecular method employed to detect args and mges additional molecular detection methods included sole use of pcr n 16 or a sequencing approach n 5 the bacterial species most commonly detected was e coli with positive identification in a total of 24 investigations e coli detection was followed by klebsiella spp n 11 enterobacter spp n 6 and pseudomonas spp n 6 supplementary table 2 a range of natural water bodies were investigated in the reviewed studies inland waters were classified into lentic i e stationary or still water lotic i e free flowing water and sub surface groundwater lentic systems included lakes n 4 and ponds n 1 whereas lotic systems encompassed rivers n 28 and streams n 1 additionally seawater n 6 or bay waters n 1 were classified as coastal marine only two investigations evaluated sub surface groundwater for the presence of args a total of two included articles evaluated more than one type of water body rivers and lakes or groundwater in terms of arg and mge detection a summary of the numbers and types of each are provided in fig 3 a total of 33 41 80 5 investigations detected the presence of esbl and or carbapenemase genes in water samples specifically 20 41 48 8 studies detected esbl genes 4 41 9 8 studies detected carbapenemase genes and 9 41 22 0 detected dual presence the most commonly detected esbl resistance gene was bla ctx m n 21 closely followed by bla tem n 18 regarding the detection of carbapenemase resistance genes bla kpc was the most commonly detected gene with identification in 6 reviewed studies this was followed by bla vim n 3 bla ndm n 3 and bla imp n 2 in comparison to resistance gene detection a larger proportion of studies 37 41 90 2 detected the presence of one or more mge this included class 1 2 and 3 integrons n 22 plasmids n 18 insertion sequences n 4 and transposons n 3 in terms of integrons class 1 was the most prominent n 20 followed by class 2 n 6 and class 3 n 1 regarding plasmid incompatibility groups the most commonly detected types were incfib n 10 followed by incn n 8 furthermore 11 studies also demonstrated successful conjugation transfer of args 4 discussion this scoping literature review was established in order to examine existing scientific literature relating to the role of the natural aquatic environment in harboring and transmitting args of clinical importance here an exclusive focus was placed on areas with minimal direct anthropogenic contamination a key highlight from this investigation is the relative limited number of studies focusing on the nexus between the natural unpolluted aquatic environment and the presence of antibiotic resistance a significant feature identified through the review protocol is a tendency for investigations to attempt to establish point sources as pollution agents however detection of resistance genes in uncontaminated areas is generally overlooked overall the detection of esbl and or carbapenemase genes in 33 41 80 5 identified studies serves to demonstrate the importance of natural water bodies as large reservoirs of multiple args a high proportion of studies 37 41 90 2 demonstrated the presence of one or more mge highlighting the potential dissemination of args among environmental bacteria accordingly the presented figures highlight the key role of the natural aquatic environment as a significant reservoir of args 4 1 synopsis of identified literature publication dates of included articles ranged from 2008 to 2019 with the majority published between 2016 and 2019 29 41 70 7 the upsurge in publications observed in recent years concurs with an increased interest by the research community in investigating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in environmental settings kraemer et al 2019 e coli was the most commonly detected species in 24 studies followed by klebsiella spp n 11 enterobacter spp n 6 and pseudomonas spp n 6 supplementary table 2 these bacteria are often associated with clinical infections and as a result some methodologies employed a selection bias using selective broths and agars supplementary table 3 a range of natural water bodies were investigated in the reviewed studies however the majority of studies focused on lotic systems n 29 70 7 the high incidence of studies based on these systems may be associated with the smaller dimensions of rivers streams in comparison to larger marine and coastal water bodies equating to a lesser dilutional effect on viable antibiotic resistant organisms additionally lotic systems are often located within urban and agricultural landscapes with river sourced water often used as a domestic water supply and thus representing a potential pathway for antibiotic resistance transmission to humans as indicated above based on the lack of studies investigating pristine aquatic environments water bodies labelled as urban were also included in the review protocol if no local point sources were described a prevalent methodological approach among river based investigations included collection of water samples in areas upstream and downstream of a discharge point in order to ascertain the influence of discharges in the proliferation of environmental args as mentioned above only articles featuring sampling regimes based on collection of upstream samples were included in the review in order to accommodate inclusion criteria i e no perceived local point source s of pollution the low number of investigations based on marine coastal and lake environments that were free from anthropogenic contamination represents a key research gap considering their potential importance as environmental pathways for the transmission of antibiotic resistance to humans particularly through recreational exposure leonard et al 2018 possible reasons for the low number of marine based investigations observed may include lack of access to coastal sampling sites in landlocked countries or the potential for lower rates of bacterial survival in saltwater serving as a deterrent rozen and belkin 2001 in terms of lakes ponds their absence as prevalent landscape components in certain geographical settings may preclude their analysis however they do also pose a significant threat for the potential transmission of args to humans bengtsson palme et al 2014 4 2 antibiotic resistance gene detection a higher detection rate of esbl n 29 genes in comparison to carbapenemase genes n 13 among included studies may be attributable to the fact that esbl enzymes emerged approximately 10 years prior to carbapenemase detection in addition carbapenem antibiotics are classified as reserved restricted in many countries and therefore only used as a last resort in an attempt to circumvent further resistance development however both third generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are classified as critically important antibiotics employed in veterinary medicine who 2016 consequently esbl producing bacteria and to a lesser extent carbapenemase producers are disseminated throughout most environments on a country basis brazil had the highest number of detected carbapenemase genes featuring in 3 out of a possible 4 studies interestingly all 3 positive studies detected bla kpc 2 this carbapenemase gene was first detected in the usa in 1996 and is now considered as endemic in brazil lee et al 2016 although china had the largest number of included studies carbapenemase enzymes were only reported in 1 8 studies in turn china accounted for the highest detection rates of esbls among included investigations 8 8 generally esbls were widespread across countries and continents fig 2 this potentially reflects their widespread dissemination and or natural occurrence in the aquatic environment as supported by several investigations swedan and abu alrub 2019 de oliveira et al 2017 yamashita et al 2017 adesoji and ogunjobi 2016 the most commonly detected esbl gene was bla ctx m n 21 this is unsurprising as the origins of this gene has been traced back to the environmental organism kluyvera previously isolated from water bodies cantón et al 2012a this was followed by bla tem n 18 bla shv n 11 and bla oxa n 9 esbl types these findings concur with additional studies screening for esbl genes in the environment for example ranjbar and sami 2017 detected bla tem bla ctx bla shv and bla oxa esbl types at a frequency of 37 27 27 and 25 respectively in an investigation based on the analysis of river water in terms of the carbapenemase encoding genes bla kpc was the most commonly detected gene in 6 41 14 6 included studies this was followed by bla vim n 3 bla ndm n 3 and bla imp n 2 these enzymes were first identified in clinical isolates khan et al 2017 yigit et al 2001 lauretti et al 1999 osano et al 1994 however their presence in the environment prior to reports in the nosocomial setting may have gone unidentified recent linkages of bla oxa 48 with the environmental shewanella species reported by tacão et al 2018 serves to highlight this possibility positive detection of esbl and or carbapenemase genes in 33 41 80 5 investigations indicates the ubiquitous occurrence of these clinically significant args in natural aquatic environments at a global scale however an important consideration in this area of research is publication bias against negative results this bias could potentially inflate the high percentage of included studies with positive detections unfortunately this is not a type of bias that can be controlled for within the scope of this review but should be considered when interpreting the results reviewed investigations with negative detection of esbls and or carbapenemases included a range of different sample types including river water n 2 lake water n 1 river and lake water n 1 seawater n 2 stream water n 1 and pond water n 1 large variations in methods employed observed among these articles may be associated with the lack of detection of args small volumes of water were collected for analysis among some investigations for example dolejská et al 2009 employed the use of swabs placed in a pond for 24 h as the initial sample collection technique while ben said et al 2016 collected 5 ml volumes of water for analysis supplementary table 3 additionally certain processing techniques may have influenced the results harnisz and korzeniewska 2018 diluted samples with saline in contrast to the filtration and enrichment prior to culturing approach employed in other investigations e g bajaj et al 2016 the large variation in methodologies employed demonstrates a lack of standardisation among environmental sampling and laboratory processing which prevents robust comparisons among reported results 4 3 mobile genetic element detection in comparison to resistance gene detection a larger proportion 37 41 90 2 of included studies detected the presence of one or more mge this included class 1 2 and 3 integrons n 22 plasmids n 18 insertion sequences n 4 and transposons n 3 fig 3 additionally 11 studies demonstrated successful conjugation transfer of args between different bacteria the combination of these elements represent the potential for dissemination of resistance elements among aquatic bacteria which may be attributed as a contributing factor in the detection of resistance in areas deemed to be free from anthropogenic influence the reported high level of detection emphasizes the ability of most bacteria to exchange genetic elements that are favourable to their survival across bacterial species making this threat almost impossible to contain this feature serves to highlight the challenges of containing and or mitigating the environmental spread of args the most commonly reported mges were integrons which have previously been detected in a wide variety of environments including soil sediment biofilms as well as waters irrespective of antibiotic contamination abella et al 2015 their ability to be transferred via insertion sequences transposons and plasmids due to co selection with resistance genes further amplifies their presence in clinical environments class 1 and 3 integrons and to a lesser extent class 2 are commonly detected in invasive bacterial isolates as a result these classes of integrons were largely screened for among included investigations however this approach may be underestimating the integron class diversity in aquatic environments and in turn the ability of environmental species to disseminate args abella et al 2015 plasmids were the second most commonly detected mge identified in 18 studies fig 3 these elements are responsible for dissemination of antibiotic resistance elements via conjugation san millan 2018 while capable of harboring and transmitting multiple gene types args have been closely linked with plasmids due to the clinical implications in terms of treatment several plasmid incompatibility groups were detected among reviewed investigations including incfib n 10 and incn n 8 which were the most commonly detected although not all studies confirmed the presence of resistance gene s on a plasmid the potential transfer of the resistance gene from the chromosome to a plasmid and its further dissemination across bacterial species via conjugation is possible the successful conjugation transfer of resistance elements in the laboratory in 11 41 26 8 investigations strengthens this possibility of arg propagation in aquatic environments notably conjugation experiments were all performed using e coli as the recipient with the majority using the j53 strain the latter is in agreement with the review performed by leclerc et al 2019 highlighting the prevalence of e coli as a common recipient for conjugation transfer and the general lack of investigations attempting interspecies transfer however in the review dataset some of the environmental isolates used as conjugation donors were klebsiella and or acinetobacter ye et al 2017 osińska et al 2016 yin et al 2013 hence there was an attempt at demonstrating interspecies transfer in a limited number of cases 4 4 sources of resistance a range of sources were linked with the incidence of args in the aquatic environments sampled in the reviewed papers for example jørgensen et al 2017a detected bla ctx m 1 and mentioned human bathing boat toilets farm animals fertilizers or birds as potential sources contributing to the presence of antibiotic resistance similarly nascimento et al 2017 detected bla kpc and bla ctx m types and hypothesized that nosocomial or domestic sewage had entered the lake system via a stream despite treatment in a flotation treatment plant prior to lake discharge beyond ouyang et al 2015 few studies considered the possibility of naturally occurring antibiotic resistance in uncontaminated aquatic environments in this study a pristine site was sampled in a remote location which yielded the detection of 69 antibiotic resistance genes the results presented were construed as indicative of ubiquitous antibiotic resistance in natural environments however the prevailing notion of arg dissemination from regions under the influence of contaminating discharges to those without it remains largely unchallenged accordingly further research into intrinsic antibiotic resistance in environmental organisms and the dissemination of args inclusive of pathways modes and extent is urgently needed the lack of standardised methodology adopted among identified investigations represents a significant knowledge gap and a challenge for the interpretation of collated data in particular issues with method sensitivity and the lack of valid comparisons to analyse reported results are apparent as such a strong argument is made for future investigations to adopt a more standardised methodological approach that is sensitive enough to detect low levels of antibiotic resistance genes similarly future research should also take associated human risks into consideration e g potential consumption volumes during recreational activities and infectious dose of organisms evidently methodology criteria applied in this review attempted to standardise articles with highly variable collection volumes and processing techniques as much as possible in particular the application of positive genomic detection criteria of args and mges increased the comparability across studies eliminating the need for comparison of phenotypic antibiotic resistance in one investigation to genomic arg detection in another in general the lack of relevant journal articles identified limited the inclusion restrictions that could be applied in terms of sampling volumes and processing predominantly the lack of consistent monitoring of the environment for antibiotic resistance worldwide severely limits our knowledge in this area the insufficient detail provided on anthropogenic contamination sources in relation to water bodies in several reviewed investigations represents a second important research gap overall it was not possible to ascertain if analysed water bodies were entirely free from contamination in some studies the sampling sites were labelled as pristine or in areas of strict preservation but others list sampling points as urban regions and so the likelihood of contamination is much greater supplementary table 2 this particular restraint means that this review could not be strictly confined to pristine aquatic environments but it does highlight the lack of research focus on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in natural unpolluted aquatic environments more research is required in the area as discovery of resistances of clinical significance in regions free from anthropogenic activity become more apparent additionally more emphasis should be placed on investigations tracing arg origins to environmental isolates and potentially screening the environment for novel args future research should also highlight the role of mges in the dissemination of resistance elements rather than focusing primarily on contaminating sources in several investigations only certain strains of isolated bacteria were further characterised for the presence of antibiotic resistance using phonotypic and genotypic methods these were generally restricted to highly virulent bacteria and those most often associated with clinical infections in humans as such some articles employed selective application of screening methods specific to detection of only certain types of bacteria e g ye et al 2017 kieffer et al 2016 stange et al 2016 this practice represents a major knowledge gap with the current role of ubiquitous non pathogenic bacteria in the transference of args largely unaccounted for emphasis on antibiotic resistance profiles rather than species detected should be employed by scientists considering mges that harbor resistance genes spread throughout different bacterial species similarly by confining environmental research to the most commonly identified mges within clinical environments the potential for transmission of args via mges present in natural aquatic environments is likely being underestimated of key relevance is the high prevalence of phenotypic screening methods employed in the majority of reviewed investigations this factor limited the detection of antibiotic resistance genes to those that reside within viable bacteria that are easily cultured however reportedly less than 1 of environmental bacteria can be easily cultured using standard laboratory techniques allen et al 2010 only four included studies performed pcr sequencing of the sample without prior culturing of organisms supplementary table 3 which enabled detection and analysis of fastidious bacteria overall current research tends to exclude less clinically significant and fastidious environmental bacteria which as a result may go unnoticed as harbouring mges capable of spreading antibiotic resistance elements ideally simultaneous application of both phenotypic culture methods and molecular analysis of environmental samples would need to be employed to generate complete resistance profiles inclusive of genetic composition as well as phenotypic expression 5 conclusions the results presented highlight the importance of aquatic environments as substantial reservoirs of esbl and carbapenemase args as such point contaminant sources may not be the sole contributors to the presence of antibiotic resistance in the aquatic environment additionally collated data serves to demonstrate the potential for interspecies transference of args among environmental bacteria to potentially pathogenic species the following recommendations are made based on their potential to contribute to our current understanding of both the prevalence and risk factors associated with args in aquatic environments routine screening of antibiotic resistance genes in water bodies particularly those considered to be disassociated from direct point contaminant sources a highly sensitive and standardised methodology which enables valid and robust comparisons among study outcomes incorporation of genomic screening and culture based analyses aiming to mitigate the selective bias imposed by culturing detailed reporting in investigations particularly in terms of study site characteristics e g location of possible non point and point sources implementation of replica aquatic environmental conjugation transformation transduction experiments demonstrating interspecies transfer future research should focus on these key areas to strengthen the body of evidence which suggests that args of clinical significance can potentially become widely disseminated by mges throughout uncontaminated aquatic environments outcomes from the reviewed investigations strengthen the need for a one health approach encompassing human animal and environmental health when tackling the immense threat of a world without effective antibiotics

17868,in this study a novel coupling process with partial nitritation anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox pna and sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad was studied using an upflow biofilm reactor with mechanical vibration at a lower dissolved oxygen do concentration 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 ammonia could be efficiently removed from synthetic wastewater by the coupling system with a total nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 98 and an influent nh4 n concentration of 600 mg l 1 in this system the nitrate which was produced during the anammox reaction could be timely reduced by the sad reaction compared with the conventional pna and sad processes coupling the pna and sad processes in a single reactor prevented nitrite accumulation in the sad reaction and reduced the total sulfate production by 59 the high throughput sequencing analysis supported that the sad bacteria thiobacillus and anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia could coexist on the elemental sulfur stone additionally sulfur consumption and sulfate production were increased under a high do concentration the sulfate production nitrate reduction ratio and changing profile of the substrate suggested that the short cut sad process mainly occurred in this coupling system otherwise batch experiments also suggested that the nitrite removal rate in the anammox process was 34 5 times higher than that in the sad process the outcomes of these experiments revealed that most of the nitrite as an intermediate product in the sad reaction served as an electron acceptor for the anammox reaction a stoichiometric calculation of this coupling process indicated that the novel reaction scheme with a high nre was successfully achieved under an ideal short cut sad process almost 55 of the sulfur consumption could be reduced in this coupling system the coupling system provides a new perspective for nitrogen removal in a single reactor and further promotes anammox and sad performance in wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox autotrophic denitrification vibration microbial community biofilm sulfur 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is one of the most energy efficient environmental biotechnologies and it was proposed more than 20 y ago kartal et al 2010 in practice the anammox process must be combined with partial nitritation as a pretreatment in either a single stage oxygen limited bioreactor bernet et al 2001 ma et al 2011 or two stage such as sharon hellinga et al 1999 bioreactor ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria play a major role in the partial nitritation anammox pna system wen et al 2017 aob oxidize approximately 50 of influent ammonium to nitrite and the anammox bacteria oxidize the remaining ammonium to dinitrogen gas using this nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor kartal et al 2011 in the anammox process nitrate production is needed for the generation of reducing equivalents associated with carbon fixation therefore in an ideal pna process some nitrate would remain in the effluent strous et al 2006 the hypothetical reaction equations for anammox nitritation and pna are expressed by eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 respectively as follows strous et al 1998 sinha and annachhatre 2007 qian et al 2017 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 256 no 3 0 066 ch 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 2 03 h 2 o 2 nh 4 1 38 o 2 0 09 hco

removal efficiency nre in the pna process does not exceed 89 to increase the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency an organic carbon source such as methanol glucose or acetate used as an organic electron donor must be added to remove the nitrate via heterotrophic denitrification ashok and hait 2015 cherchi et al 2009 kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 nevertheless it is challenging to combine heterotrophic denitrification and pna in a single reactor especially under a fluctuating influent ammonium concentration addition of excess organic compounds has been shown to inhibit the anammox reaction and may also result in secondary organic pollution of public water bodies sun et al 2018 koenig and liu 2001 sulfur is a cheap and effective inorganic electron donor that is utilized as an alternative electron donor to remove nitrate under anaerobic conditions li et al 2016 sahinkaya et al 2011 beller et al 2006a therefore the sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad process is widely used for the treatment of headwater streams potable water and groundwater moon et al 2004 yue wang et al 2016 nitrate is first reduced to nitrite and then to n2 in the sad process xu et al 2016 this sad reaction can be expressed by eq 4 as follows hashimoto et al 1987 4 no 3 1 1 s 0 0 4 co 2 0 76 h 2 0 08 nh 4 0 5 n 2 1 1 so 4 2 1 28 h 0 08 c 5 h 7 o 2 n however the major disadvantage of the sad process is the production of sulfate sahinkaya et al 2011 according to eq 4 7 54 mg of sulfate is generated per milligram of no3 n reduction sahinkaya et al 2014 the effluent sulfate concentration would increase significantly with a high reduction in influent nitrate dasgupta et al 2017 showed that the process of coupling sad with pna can remove 97 of the total incoming inorganic nitrogen however with the removal of 33 7 mg of no3 n l 1 261 4 mg of sulfate was produced in this system some studies have indicated that sulfate production decreases to approximately 10 20 by changing the sulfur source to sulfide sulfur oxidation number of i or ii kong et al 2016 tong et al 2017 nevertheless the nre is not high usually lower than 80 owing to the high affinity of sulfur to no3 n chen et al 2018 transient accumulation of nitrite during the sad process has been observed in some reports sadeq et al 2008 li et al 2016 therefore this accumulated nitrite during the sad reaction can be utilized as an electron acceptor in the anammox process lawson et al 2017 a short cut sad process may then occur in the coupling system the objective of this study was to explore the feasibility and coupling effects of the pna and sad processes using our newly developed single upflow vibration biofilm reactor the nitrite and nitrate removal rates in the anammox and sad processes were compared furthermore the sulfate production rate substrate consumption rate and data of the isotope labeling experiment were analyzed to explore the reaction pathway in the coupling system finally the theoretical stoichiometry of the sulfate production in this coupling system was also calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor startup and operation an upflow biofilm reactor with mechanical vibration was used in this study fig 1 the total reactor volume was 1 53 l working volume of approximately 0 94 l with an inner diameter of 70 mm and a height of 400 mm it was operated at 32 1 c in a water bath a small motor 3 v dc motor max 4000 rpm 4 5 w guoling china with an eccentric wheel was used to excite vibration with the motor rotation and was controlled through a programmable dc power supply dp832 rigol china the motor worked for 5 s during a 1 min period the vibration motion could effectively release the bubbles accumulated inside the biofilm and decrease the mass transfer resistance zhang et al 2019b a dissolved oxygen do controller sin do700 sinomeasure china along with a mini air pump ct 201 sensen china was used to maintain the reactor do concentration at 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 meanwhile a metering pump dz2 xu2 xin xishan china was controlled by a ph controller sin ph orp 6 0 sinomeasure china to maintain the reactor ph at 8 25 0 20 through the addition of 0 2 mol l 1 of sodium carbonate a peristaltic pump bt 100 longer china was employed for the influent and it was ensured that the hydraulic retention time hrt of each reactor was 10 h nh4cl nano2 and nano3 were used as the ammonium nitrite and nitrate sources respectively the other synthetic medium was prepared as described in the references van de graaf et al 1996 zhang et al 2019a and the composition is shown in table s1 the influent do concentration was reduced to 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 by sparging the synthetic feed medium with 99 n2 gas for 15 20 min 2 2 experimental procedure six phases were performed for the experiment table 1 in phase i two reactors r1 and r2 with the same specifications fig 1 were added with biofilm carriers and the sulfur stone respectively the biofilm carrier dongyuan china which consisted of several nylon ropes in an array arrangement was fixed around the cylindrical screen with a 3 35 mm mesh in r1 fig 1 the seeding sludge for the pna process r1 was obtained from a single stage nitrogen removal reactor using anammox and partial nitritation this reactor was operated under a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 2 16 kg n m 3 d 1 using ammonium containing synthetic wastewater zhang et al 2018 the do and ph in the pna reactor phase i were kept at 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 and 8 25 0 20 respectively the details of the operational conditions are shown in fig s1 the sulfur stone sulfur content 99 5 was broken into small pieces 3 5 6 0 mm and fed into the cylindrical screen in r2 the inner diameter and total height of the cylindrical screen fig s2 were 45 mm and 200 mm respectively the influent ammonium concentration was maintained at 10 mg n l 1 and the nitrate concentration gradually increased from 40 mg n l 1 to 70 mg n l 1 in the first 45 d of operation from days 65 85 the nitrate was replaced with nitrite in the synthetic medium to investigate the effect of the nitrogen source on sulfate production after the pre cultivation phase ii days 96 125 experiments were started by feeding effluent from r1 pna to r2 sad in phase iii days 126 139 several groups of the continuous experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between the nitrite or nitrate removal rate and the effluent substrate concentration in the anammox or sad process aeration was stopped in this phase and the reactors were completely sealed and flushed with n2 gas in addition the synthetic medium ammonium and nitrite or ammonium and nitrate was sparged with 99 n2 gas for 40 min to ensure an extremely low do concentration below 0 01 mg l 1 and the reactor ph was maintained at 8 25 0 20 by appropriate dosing with 0 1 n of hydrochloric acid or 0 2 mol l 1 of sodium carbonate the nlr was gradually changed by increasing the influent nitrogen concentration or by shortening the hrt details on the nitrogen concentration and the calculation of the nitrogen removal rate nrr are shown in text s1 phase iv days 140 265 was used to investigate the treatment performance of coupling the pna and sad processes in a single reactor r1 the sulfur stone was fed into the cylindrical screen with a 3 35 mm mesh and covered with the pna biofilm in r1 at the beginning of this phase the influent ammonium concentration was also maintained at 600 mg n l 1 to further investigate the influence of aeration on this coupling system the do concentration was gradually increased from 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 to 1 20 0 20 mg l 1 from days 266 305 phase v the aeration was stopped in phase vi days 310 332 to ensure r1 operation under anaerobic conditions table 1 furthermore an influent nitrogen source composed of nh4 n 80 mg l 1 and no3 n 66 mg l 1 was used in phase vi from days 310 314 and 320 to 324 the sulfur stones were returned to r2 to clarify the relationship between the anammox and sad reactions in r1 by using the 15n stable isotope technique differentiation between the anammox and other denitrification reactions was possible dalsgaard et al 2005 kuypers et al 2003 from days 330 332 the nitrate resource was changed to labeled nitrate with 15n 98 5 atom and a u shaped glass tube was set at the effluent port the top of r1 was covered with a cap for collection of the resultant produced dinitrogen gas as anammox generates dinitrogen gas by one to one pairing of nitrogen from nitrite and ammonium the ratio of 29n2 and 30n2 should reflect the anammox activity in the coupling reaction stein 2011 2 3 analytical methods the suspended solids and volatile suspended solids were measured by the standard methods apha 2005 the concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and sulfate were measured using a spectrophotometer with a reagent from hach hach dr 4000 usa each sample was filtered through a 0 45 mm membrane filter and analyzed in triplicate the theoretical sulfate production was calculated using eq 3 and eq 4 in the coupling process 0 83 mg of sulfate was generated per milligram of nh4 n removed displacement sensors and amplitude units zx lda11 omron japan were used to evaluate the thickness of the biofilm the 14n15n 15n15n ratios were determined by gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry kuypers et al 2003 cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes and metagenomics were performed as described in the supplementary material free ammonia fa can be calculated using eq 5 as follows anthonisen et al 1976 5 fa 1 214 nh 4 n 10 ph exp 6344 273 t 10 ph the sulfate production nitrate reduction ratio s n was calculated as follows 6 s n so 4 2 effluent so 4 2 influent no 3 n effluent no 3 n influent videos and photographs of the biofilm were taken using a digital camera lens leica summilux h f 1 6 double germany and a digital microscope jt 2000 jingchang china 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance in r1 the influent nh4 n increased from 200 mg l 1 to 800 mg l 1 and the average nrr gradually increased to 1 29 kg n m 3 d 1 in phase i fig s1 meanwhile the nitrate removal efficiency in the sad process also reached 98 after 60 d of operation in r2 the treatment performance in this phase indicated that the pna and sad reactors were successfully started up and could be operated stably in phase ii days 96 125 r1 was operated by feeding 600 mg nh4 n l 1 of influent at 32 c the effluent no3 n concentration of r1 was nearly 61 4 mg l 1 with an nre of 87 table 2 after feeding the effluent from r1 to r2 the effluent no3 n concentrations of r2 were further decreased to 1 02 0 51 mg l 1 the outcome of this experiment revealed that the sad process could effectively remove the residual nitrate produced however the effluent no2 n concentrations of r2 increased from 0 76 0 37 mg l 1 to 8 12 0 43 mg l 1 table 2 this result suggested that nitrite was an intermediate in the sad process and the nitrite removal rate should be lower than that of nitrate the effect of the nitrite or nitrate concentration on the volumetric removal rate was explored in phase iii it was found that the nitrate removal rate was higher than the nitrite removal rate in the sad process fig 2 b therefore the effluent no2 n concentrations were higher than those of no3 n during phase ii this result was similar to those of previous reports in which nitrite accumulation easily occurred during sulfur based denitrification yue wang et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sahinkaya et al 2015 at the beginning of phase iv the effluent no3 n concentration in r1 was significantly decreased to 6 46 0 29 mg l 1 after the sulfur stone was added accordingly the nrr suddenly increased from 1 25 kg n m 3 d 1 to 1 38 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 2c compared with that in the conventional pna process the tn removal efficiency was increased significantly from 87 to 98 table 2 it could be assumed that the nitrate which was produced during the anammox reaction was timely reduced by the sad reaction after 35 d of operation in this phase the average effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations were decreased to 3 6 mg l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively unlike that in phase ii nitrite was not accumulated in the coupling system and the nitrate removal rate was 5 8 times higher than the nitrite removal rate in the sad process fig 2b this phenomenon implies that most of the nitrite might have been converted by other reaction pathways such as the anammox process fig 2b shows that the nitrite removal rate of the anammox reaction reached to 1004 mg n l 1 d 1 with a nitrite effluent concentration of 0 52 mg n l 1 it was 34 5 times higher than the nitrite removal rate in the sad process therefore it could be speculated that the accumulated nitrite might have been reduced to dinitrogen gas in the anammox reaction coupling the pna and sad processes in a single reactor could achieve a higher nre and effectively prevent nitrite accumulation in the sad process 3 2 sulfate production in phase ii effluent from r1 was fed into r2 to increase the total nre after passing the sad process the effluent no3 n concentrations were decreased to lower than 2 mg n l 1 fig 3 a however the effluent sulfate concentration was increased from 74 12 mg l 1 to 540 18 mg l 1 the s n ratio reached 7 79 0 29 which was slightly higher than the theoretical stoichiometric s n ratio of 7 54 for the sad process sahinkaya and kilic 2014 discharge of effluent with a high sulfate concentration is generally regarded as harmful to the ecosystem of the receiving water body therefore the application of the sad reaction for reducing nitrate is limited dutta et al 2010 hu et al 2018 liang et al 2018 thus the scheme in phase ii was not suitable for the treatment of high ammonium containing wastewater after the addition of the sulfur stone to r1 the effluent sulfate concentration declined sharply to 388 mg l 1 and gradually decreased to 268 14 mg l 1 in phase iv the sulfate production was reduced to approximately 41 of the stoichiometric value after 175 d fig 3b these results indicate that coupling pna and sad in a single reactor can not only increase the nre but also decrease the sulfur consumption after changing the influent nitrogen source from nitrate and ammonium to nitrite and ammonium in phase i the effluent sulfate concentrations were decreased from 591 25 mg l 1 to 384 13 mg l 1 fig 3a which was in line with the results of a previous study chung et al 2014 the outcome revealed that the effluent sulfate production was decreased by approximately 40 after replacing the nitrate with the same concentration of nitrite this meant that the sulfate production would be reduced under an incomplete sad reaction the decrease in the sulfate production rate in r2 was similar to the sulfate production rate in r1 therefore it could be speculated that only the first step of sad was functional short cut denitrification processes might have occurred in the coupling system 3 3 influence of dissolved oxygen and the biofilm in the coupling system because autotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as thiobacillus denitrificans prefer oxygen as an electron acceptor over sulfur kimura et al 2002 operation under a high do concentration would deteriorate the nitrogen removal performance and increase the effluent sulfate concentration sahinkaya and kilic 2014 however for the sad process in phase iv with the addition of the sulfur stone in r1 the effluent nitrate and sulfate concentrations were gradually decreased from days 140 161 these results indicate that the sad reaction could be well adapted for the operational conditions of this coupling system during this period a marked shift in the morphology of the sulfur stone was observed fig s3 a thin biofilm with a pale red color was formed on the surface of the sulfur stone it was very thick and could be easily peeled off the bacterial sequences of the pale red biofilm showed that candidatus kuenenia anammox bacterium and thiobacillus sad bacterium accounted for 8 18 and 59 01 of the total reads respectively text s2 this result inferred the co existence of anammox and sad bacteria on the sulfur stone a repetitive experiment in which the reactor was operated under the same operational conditions in phases i ii and iv was designed to investigate whether the coupling system could promote the growth of special biofilm when the newly pre cultivated sulfur stone was added to the pna biofilm reactor the sulfate production ideal nitrate production in the pna process ratio s nideal also gradually decreased from 4 71 to 3 15 in the following 16 d of operation fig s4 meanwhile the formation of a unique pale red biofilm on the surface of the sulfur stone was recognized these results suggest that the coupling system promoted the formation of the unique biofilm and could effectively reduce the sulfate production rate after increasing the reactor do concentration from 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 to 0 80 0 20 mg l 1 the effluent nitrogen concentration changed slightly p 0 05 table s2 this meant that the fluctuation in the do concentration within a small range had little effect on the nitrogen removal performance of the coupling system however after increasing the do concentration to 1 20 0 20 mg l 1 on day 285 the average effluent nitrate concentration increased from 3 75 mg l 1 to 5 02 mg l 1 fig 4 the effluent sulfate concentration also reached to 416 mg l 1 and did not show a downward trend in the following days these results suggest that a high do concentration would increase the sulfate production and sulfur consumption table s2 consequently maintaining a low do concentration 0 6 mg l 1 in this coupling reactor was very important to ensure a lower sulfate production rate 3 4 substrate depletion assays and 15n labeling experiment for inferring the reaction pathway in the coupling processes previous studies and metagenomics sequencing text s2 suggested that sad and anammox have a similar reaction pathway in their denitrification processes nitrite to nitric oxide beller et al 2006b lawson et al 2017 li et al 2016 tang et al 2018 yayi wang et al 2016 therefore it was possible to replace part of the sad process from nitrite to dinitrogen gas with the anammox process to further investigate the relationship between the anammox and sad processes the aeration in phase vi was stopped to avoid the influence of a partial nitritation reaction as the nitrate could not be reduced in the anammox reaction the effluent no3 n concentration reached 65 3 1 4 mg l 1 after removing the sulfur stone from r1 fig 5 in addition the effluent nh4 n concentration reached 81 7 1 1 mg l 1 which was even higher than the influent nh4 n concentration these results indicate that the partial nitritation reaction was stopped under this operational condition and the anammox process would not occur without no2 n strous et al 2006 when the sulfur stone was re added to r1 the effluent no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were decreased to 2 3 mg l 1 and 12 16 mg l 1 respectively in this period more than 64 mg l 1 of nh4 n and 64 mg l 1 of no3 n were removed under the condition with no aeration with sad the s n ratio was 3 69 0 29 which was much lower than that for phase ii these results suggested that an anammox reaction occurred under an incomplete sad reaction the results of the 15n labeling experiment are shown in table 3 29n2 which was produced via the anammox process accounted for nearly 88 9 of the collected dinitrogen gas on day 331 the relative abundance of 29n2 was 12 17 times higher than that of 30n2 this result indicated that most of the nitrite as an intermediate in the sad reaction served as an electron acceptor for the anammox reaction on the basis of these obtained results it could be concluded that the short cut sad process was constructed in the coupling system in the sad process sulfur as the electron donor is oxidized to sulfate to obtain five electrons for sustaining nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas chung et al 2014 xu et al 2016 however nitrate nitrogen oxidation number v receives two electrons from the oxidation of sulfur and is initially reduced to nitrite nitrogen oxidation number iii eq 7 xu et al 2016 the anammox and nitritation reactions can be simplified to eq 8 and eq 9 respectively as follows 7 no 3 2 h 2 e no 2 h 2 o 8 nh 4 1 32 no 2 1 02 n 2 0 256 no 3 9 nh 4 no 2 under an ideal short cut denitrification process it can be assumed that all nitrate is converted to nitrite by the sad reaction this converted nitrite is reduced to dinitrogen gas through the coupled anammox reaction under the same influent concentration mg n l 1 of nh4 n and no2 n the total nitrate generated in this coupling process can be iteratively calculated as follows text s3 10 i 1 n 0 256 1 32 i a 0 256 1 32 a 0 256 1 32 2 a 1 1 0 256 1 32 0 256 1 32 a 0 24 a ammonium consumption can then be calculated as follows 11 i 1 n 1 1 32 0 256 1 32 i a 1 1 32 a 1 1 32 0 256 1 32 a 0 256 1 32 2 a 1 1 32 a 1 1 32 0 256 1 064 a 1 1 32 a 0 94 a therefore the nitrogen removal equation for the anammox and short cut sad reaction could be simplified to eq 12 12 0 94 nh 4 no 2 0 97 n 2 in this reaction scheme partial nitritation was assumed to provide the proper amount of nitrite this means that all the influent ammonium nitrogen can be converted to dinitrogen gas in this ideal process thus the ratio of nitrate which is generated from the anammox process to influent ammonium can be calculated as follows 13 0 24 a 0 94 a a 0 124 this calculated ratio was 1 13 times higher than the theoretical ratio of 0 11 for the pna reaction shown in eq 3 in this proposed reaction mechanism only two electron reduction is needed in the short cut sad process eq 7 besides the pre cultivation process phase i showed that sulfate production was reduced by 40 using influent with the same concentration of ammonium and nitrite these results suggested that the theoretical sulfate production in the short cut sad process can only reach 40 of that of the complete sad process on the basis of these obtained results the total sulfate production in phase iv should be reduced by 55 compared to that in phase ii moreover the sulfate produced by the sad reaction was decreased to 59 of the stoichiometric sulfate production the reasons for this decrease in sulfate production might have been related to the occurrence of other types of denitrification reactions in the coupling process detection of some heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the sequencing of 16s rrna genes also supported this hypothesis text s2 in the present study the experimental results showed a satisfying nitrogen removal performance with a low effluent sulfate concentration the nitrogen transformation pathway in the coupling system could be conducted as shown in fig 6 in the pna process ammonium was oxidized to nitrite and converted to dinitrogen gas with a small amount of nitrate production this reaction can be controlled by adjusting the reactor do concentration under a high ph an fa concentration higher than 1 mg nh3 n l 1 can be easily maintained and the inhibition of nitrite oxidation is feasible liu et al 2019 elemental sulfur was successfully used as an electron donor in the sad reaction transient accumulated nitrite in the sad process under the operating conditions can be used as an electron acceptor in the anammox reaction this indicates that a short cut denitrification process was successfully constructed in this coupling reactor consequently the sulfur consumption and sulfate production in this coupling system were significantly reduced 3 5 applications and future research in this study pna and denitrification processes were simultaneously developed compared with that in the conventional pna process combined with the sad process most of the ammonium converted to dinitrogen gas in the anammox reaction and the nitrite provided by the short cut sad reaction could also reduce the external supplementation of alkalinity in partial nitritation because the sad reaction occurs on elemental sulfur the addition of other auxiliary materials such as organic carbon and s2o3 is not required therefore this coupling process could be easily operated furthermore as no external organic carbon source is required and less sludge is produced in autotrophic denitrification liang et al 2018 the novel system should produce less excess sludge than some conventional nitrogen removal processes such as nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification shao et al 2010 sobotka et al 2017 compared with the conventional sad process short cut denitrification could also reduce the generation of hydrogen ions table s3 that means that the demand for alkalinity in the novel system can be reduced therefore the coupling process is an effective method for treating high ammonium containing wastewater these characteristics of the coupling process illustrate the substantial economic benefits and technical merits for practical applications in the future although the coupling system with mechanical vibrations showed an excellent nitrogen removal capacity with low sulfate production the influencing factors such as the intensity of the mechanical vibrations and ph on the treatment performance must be further investigated furthermore the relationship between candidatus kuenenia and thiobacillus should be clarified through further microbiological analyses along with the microbial function related to the nitrite removal process and system stability finally the applicability of the mechanical vibration technique for the promotion of biofilm formation on the sulfur stone surface is also an area for further research 4 conclusions simultaneous pna and sad processes with the addition of sulfur stones to the pna system were successfully established this coupling system showed a high nre with low sulfate production the sulfate production rate decreased by nearly 60 in the coupling system a thin pale red biofilm was formed on the sulfur stone bacterial sequences revealed that anammox bacteria and sad bacteria co existed on the surface of the sulfur stone candidatus kuenenia anammox bacterium and thiobacillus sad bacterium accounted for 8 18 and 59 01 of the total reads respectively a higher do value would increase the sulfate production and sulfur consumption consequently maintaining a low do concentration 0 6 mg l 1 in this coupling reactor was very important to ensure a low sulfate production rate the sulfate production rate substrate consumption rate 15n labeling and theoretical calculations suggested that the short cut sad process became the dominant nitrate removal process in the coupling system most of the nitrite as an intermediate in the sad process served as an electron acceptor to achieve the anammox process meanwhile the demand for sulfur and the generation of hydrogen ions in the sad or partial nitritation processes could also be reduced no external organic carbon source is required in the coupling system so the amount of excess sludge production could be reduced to a low level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17868,in this study a novel coupling process with partial nitritation anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox pna and sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad was studied using an upflow biofilm reactor with mechanical vibration at a lower dissolved oxygen do concentration 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 ammonia could be efficiently removed from synthetic wastewater by the coupling system with a total nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 98 and an influent nh4 n concentration of 600 mg l 1 in this system the nitrate which was produced during the anammox reaction could be timely reduced by the sad reaction compared with the conventional pna and sad processes coupling the pna and sad processes in a single reactor prevented nitrite accumulation in the sad reaction and reduced the total sulfate production by 59 the high throughput sequencing analysis supported that the sad bacteria thiobacillus and anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia could coexist on the elemental sulfur stone additionally sulfur consumption and sulfate production were increased under a high do concentration the sulfate production nitrate reduction ratio and changing profile of the substrate suggested that the short cut sad process mainly occurred in this coupling system otherwise batch experiments also suggested that the nitrite removal rate in the anammox process was 34 5 times higher than that in the sad process the outcomes of these experiments revealed that most of the nitrite as an intermediate product in the sad reaction served as an electron acceptor for the anammox reaction a stoichiometric calculation of this coupling process indicated that the novel reaction scheme with a high nre was successfully achieved under an ideal short cut sad process almost 55 of the sulfur consumption could be reduced in this coupling system the coupling system provides a new perspective for nitrogen removal in a single reactor and further promotes anammox and sad performance in wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox autotrophic denitrification vibration microbial community biofilm sulfur 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is one of the most energy efficient environmental biotechnologies and it was proposed more than 20 y ago kartal et al 2010 in practice the anammox process must be combined with partial nitritation as a pretreatment in either a single stage oxygen limited bioreactor bernet et al 2001 ma et al 2011 or two stage such as sharon hellinga et al 1999 bioreactor ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria play a major role in the partial nitritation anammox pna system wen et al 2017 aob oxidize approximately 50 of influent ammonium to nitrite and the anammox bacteria oxidize the remaining ammonium to dinitrogen gas using this nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor kartal et al 2011 in the anammox process nitrate production is needed for the generation of reducing equivalents associated with carbon fixation therefore in an ideal pna process some nitrate would remain in the effluent strous et al 2006 the hypothetical reaction equations for anammox nitritation and pna are expressed by eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 respectively as follows strous et al 1998 sinha and annachhatre 2007 qian et al 2017 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n 2 0 256 no 3 0 066 ch 2 o 0 5 n 0 15 2 03 h 2 o 2 nh 4 1 38 o 2 0 09 hco

removal efficiency nre in the pna process does not exceed 89 to increase the total nitrogen tn removal efficiency an organic carbon source such as methanol glucose or acetate used as an organic electron donor must be added to remove the nitrate via heterotrophic denitrification ashok and hait 2015 cherchi et al 2009 kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 nevertheless it is challenging to combine heterotrophic denitrification and pna in a single reactor especially under a fluctuating influent ammonium concentration addition of excess organic compounds has been shown to inhibit the anammox reaction and may also result in secondary organic pollution of public water bodies sun et al 2018 koenig and liu 2001 sulfur is a cheap and effective inorganic electron donor that is utilized as an alternative electron donor to remove nitrate under anaerobic conditions li et al 2016 sahinkaya et al 2011 beller et al 2006a therefore the sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad process is widely used for the treatment of headwater streams potable water and groundwater moon et al 2004 yue wang et al 2016 nitrate is first reduced to nitrite and then to n2 in the sad process xu et al 2016 this sad reaction can be expressed by eq 4 as follows hashimoto et al 1987 4 no 3 1 1 s 0 0 4 co 2 0 76 h 2 0 08 nh 4 0 5 n 2 1 1 so 4 2 1 28 h 0 08 c 5 h 7 o 2 n however the major disadvantage of the sad process is the production of sulfate sahinkaya et al 2011 according to eq 4 7 54 mg of sulfate is generated per milligram of no3 n reduction sahinkaya et al 2014 the effluent sulfate concentration would increase significantly with a high reduction in influent nitrate dasgupta et al 2017 showed that the process of coupling sad with pna can remove 97 of the total incoming inorganic nitrogen however with the removal of 33 7 mg of no3 n l 1 261 4 mg of sulfate was produced in this system some studies have indicated that sulfate production decreases to approximately 10 20 by changing the sulfur source to sulfide sulfur oxidation number of i or ii kong et al 2016 tong et al 2017 nevertheless the nre is not high usually lower than 80 owing to the high affinity of sulfur to no3 n chen et al 2018 transient accumulation of nitrite during the sad process has been observed in some reports sadeq et al 2008 li et al 2016 therefore this accumulated nitrite during the sad reaction can be utilized as an electron acceptor in the anammox process lawson et al 2017 a short cut sad process may then occur in the coupling system the objective of this study was to explore the feasibility and coupling effects of the pna and sad processes using our newly developed single upflow vibration biofilm reactor the nitrite and nitrate removal rates in the anammox and sad processes were compared furthermore the sulfate production rate substrate consumption rate and data of the isotope labeling experiment were analyzed to explore the reaction pathway in the coupling system finally the theoretical stoichiometry of the sulfate production in this coupling system was also calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor startup and operation an upflow biofilm reactor with mechanical vibration was used in this study fig 1 the total reactor volume was 1 53 l working volume of approximately 0 94 l with an inner diameter of 70 mm and a height of 400 mm it was operated at 32 1 c in a water bath a small motor 3 v dc motor max 4000 rpm 4 5 w guoling china with an eccentric wheel was used to excite vibration with the motor rotation and was controlled through a programmable dc power supply dp832 rigol china the motor worked for 5 s during a 1 min period the vibration motion could effectively release the bubbles accumulated inside the biofilm and decrease the mass transfer resistance zhang et al 2019b a dissolved oxygen do controller sin do700 sinomeasure china along with a mini air pump ct 201 sensen china was used to maintain the reactor do concentration at 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 meanwhile a metering pump dz2 xu2 xin xishan china was controlled by a ph controller sin ph orp 6 0 sinomeasure china to maintain the reactor ph at 8 25 0 20 through the addition of 0 2 mol l 1 of sodium carbonate a peristaltic pump bt 100 longer china was employed for the influent and it was ensured that the hydraulic retention time hrt of each reactor was 10 h nh4cl nano2 and nano3 were used as the ammonium nitrite and nitrate sources respectively the other synthetic medium was prepared as described in the references van de graaf et al 1996 zhang et al 2019a and the composition is shown in table s1 the influent do concentration was reduced to 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 by sparging the synthetic feed medium with 99 n2 gas for 15 20 min 2 2 experimental procedure six phases were performed for the experiment table 1 in phase i two reactors r1 and r2 with the same specifications fig 1 were added with biofilm carriers and the sulfur stone respectively the biofilm carrier dongyuan china which consisted of several nylon ropes in an array arrangement was fixed around the cylindrical screen with a 3 35 mm mesh in r1 fig 1 the seeding sludge for the pna process r1 was obtained from a single stage nitrogen removal reactor using anammox and partial nitritation this reactor was operated under a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 2 16 kg n m 3 d 1 using ammonium containing synthetic wastewater zhang et al 2018 the do and ph in the pna reactor phase i were kept at 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 and 8 25 0 20 respectively the details of the operational conditions are shown in fig s1 the sulfur stone sulfur content 99 5 was broken into small pieces 3 5 6 0 mm and fed into the cylindrical screen in r2 the inner diameter and total height of the cylindrical screen fig s2 were 45 mm and 200 mm respectively the influent ammonium concentration was maintained at 10 mg n l 1 and the nitrate concentration gradually increased from 40 mg n l 1 to 70 mg n l 1 in the first 45 d of operation from days 65 85 the nitrate was replaced with nitrite in the synthetic medium to investigate the effect of the nitrogen source on sulfate production after the pre cultivation phase ii days 96 125 experiments were started by feeding effluent from r1 pna to r2 sad in phase iii days 126 139 several groups of the continuous experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between the nitrite or nitrate removal rate and the effluent substrate concentration in the anammox or sad process aeration was stopped in this phase and the reactors were completely sealed and flushed with n2 gas in addition the synthetic medium ammonium and nitrite or ammonium and nitrate was sparged with 99 n2 gas for 40 min to ensure an extremely low do concentration below 0 01 mg l 1 and the reactor ph was maintained at 8 25 0 20 by appropriate dosing with 0 1 n of hydrochloric acid or 0 2 mol l 1 of sodium carbonate the nlr was gradually changed by increasing the influent nitrogen concentration or by shortening the hrt details on the nitrogen concentration and the calculation of the nitrogen removal rate nrr are shown in text s1 phase iv days 140 265 was used to investigate the treatment performance of coupling the pna and sad processes in a single reactor r1 the sulfur stone was fed into the cylindrical screen with a 3 35 mm mesh and covered with the pna biofilm in r1 at the beginning of this phase the influent ammonium concentration was also maintained at 600 mg n l 1 to further investigate the influence of aeration on this coupling system the do concentration was gradually increased from 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 to 1 20 0 20 mg l 1 from days 266 305 phase v the aeration was stopped in phase vi days 310 332 to ensure r1 operation under anaerobic conditions table 1 furthermore an influent nitrogen source composed of nh4 n 80 mg l 1 and no3 n 66 mg l 1 was used in phase vi from days 310 314 and 320 to 324 the sulfur stones were returned to r2 to clarify the relationship between the anammox and sad reactions in r1 by using the 15n stable isotope technique differentiation between the anammox and other denitrification reactions was possible dalsgaard et al 2005 kuypers et al 2003 from days 330 332 the nitrate resource was changed to labeled nitrate with 15n 98 5 atom and a u shaped glass tube was set at the effluent port the top of r1 was covered with a cap for collection of the resultant produced dinitrogen gas as anammox generates dinitrogen gas by one to one pairing of nitrogen from nitrite and ammonium the ratio of 29n2 and 30n2 should reflect the anammox activity in the coupling reaction stein 2011 2 3 analytical methods the suspended solids and volatile suspended solids were measured by the standard methods apha 2005 the concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and sulfate were measured using a spectrophotometer with a reagent from hach hach dr 4000 usa each sample was filtered through a 0 45 mm membrane filter and analyzed in triplicate the theoretical sulfate production was calculated using eq 3 and eq 4 in the coupling process 0 83 mg of sulfate was generated per milligram of nh4 n removed displacement sensors and amplitude units zx lda11 omron japan were used to evaluate the thickness of the biofilm the 14n15n 15n15n ratios were determined by gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry kuypers et al 2003 cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes and metagenomics were performed as described in the supplementary material free ammonia fa can be calculated using eq 5 as follows anthonisen et al 1976 5 fa 1 214 nh 4 n 10 ph exp 6344 273 t 10 ph the sulfate production nitrate reduction ratio s n was calculated as follows 6 s n so 4 2 effluent so 4 2 influent no 3 n effluent no 3 n influent videos and photographs of the biofilm were taken using a digital camera lens leica summilux h f 1 6 double germany and a digital microscope jt 2000 jingchang china 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance in r1 the influent nh4 n increased from 200 mg l 1 to 800 mg l 1 and the average nrr gradually increased to 1 29 kg n m 3 d 1 in phase i fig s1 meanwhile the nitrate removal efficiency in the sad process also reached 98 after 60 d of operation in r2 the treatment performance in this phase indicated that the pna and sad reactors were successfully started up and could be operated stably in phase ii days 96 125 r1 was operated by feeding 600 mg nh4 n l 1 of influent at 32 c the effluent no3 n concentration of r1 was nearly 61 4 mg l 1 with an nre of 87 table 2 after feeding the effluent from r1 to r2 the effluent no3 n concentrations of r2 were further decreased to 1 02 0 51 mg l 1 the outcome of this experiment revealed that the sad process could effectively remove the residual nitrate produced however the effluent no2 n concentrations of r2 increased from 0 76 0 37 mg l 1 to 8 12 0 43 mg l 1 table 2 this result suggested that nitrite was an intermediate in the sad process and the nitrite removal rate should be lower than that of nitrate the effect of the nitrite or nitrate concentration on the volumetric removal rate was explored in phase iii it was found that the nitrate removal rate was higher than the nitrite removal rate in the sad process fig 2 b therefore the effluent no2 n concentrations were higher than those of no3 n during phase ii this result was similar to those of previous reports in which nitrite accumulation easily occurred during sulfur based denitrification yue wang et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sahinkaya et al 2015 at the beginning of phase iv the effluent no3 n concentration in r1 was significantly decreased to 6 46 0 29 mg l 1 after the sulfur stone was added accordingly the nrr suddenly increased from 1 25 kg n m 3 d 1 to 1 38 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 2c compared with that in the conventional pna process the tn removal efficiency was increased significantly from 87 to 98 table 2 it could be assumed that the nitrate which was produced during the anammox reaction was timely reduced by the sad reaction after 35 d of operation in this phase the average effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations were decreased to 3 6 mg l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively unlike that in phase ii nitrite was not accumulated in the coupling system and the nitrate removal rate was 5 8 times higher than the nitrite removal rate in the sad process fig 2b this phenomenon implies that most of the nitrite might have been converted by other reaction pathways such as the anammox process fig 2b shows that the nitrite removal rate of the anammox reaction reached to 1004 mg n l 1 d 1 with a nitrite effluent concentration of 0 52 mg n l 1 it was 34 5 times higher than the nitrite removal rate in the sad process therefore it could be speculated that the accumulated nitrite might have been reduced to dinitrogen gas in the anammox reaction coupling the pna and sad processes in a single reactor could achieve a higher nre and effectively prevent nitrite accumulation in the sad process 3 2 sulfate production in phase ii effluent from r1 was fed into r2 to increase the total nre after passing the sad process the effluent no3 n concentrations were decreased to lower than 2 mg n l 1 fig 3 a however the effluent sulfate concentration was increased from 74 12 mg l 1 to 540 18 mg l 1 the s n ratio reached 7 79 0 29 which was slightly higher than the theoretical stoichiometric s n ratio of 7 54 for the sad process sahinkaya and kilic 2014 discharge of effluent with a high sulfate concentration is generally regarded as harmful to the ecosystem of the receiving water body therefore the application of the sad reaction for reducing nitrate is limited dutta et al 2010 hu et al 2018 liang et al 2018 thus the scheme in phase ii was not suitable for the treatment of high ammonium containing wastewater after the addition of the sulfur stone to r1 the effluent sulfate concentration declined sharply to 388 mg l 1 and gradually decreased to 268 14 mg l 1 in phase iv the sulfate production was reduced to approximately 41 of the stoichiometric value after 175 d fig 3b these results indicate that coupling pna and sad in a single reactor can not only increase the nre but also decrease the sulfur consumption after changing the influent nitrogen source from nitrate and ammonium to nitrite and ammonium in phase i the effluent sulfate concentrations were decreased from 591 25 mg l 1 to 384 13 mg l 1 fig 3a which was in line with the results of a previous study chung et al 2014 the outcome revealed that the effluent sulfate production was decreased by approximately 40 after replacing the nitrate with the same concentration of nitrite this meant that the sulfate production would be reduced under an incomplete sad reaction the decrease in the sulfate production rate in r2 was similar to the sulfate production rate in r1 therefore it could be speculated that only the first step of sad was functional short cut denitrification processes might have occurred in the coupling system 3 3 influence of dissolved oxygen and the biofilm in the coupling system because autotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as thiobacillus denitrificans prefer oxygen as an electron acceptor over sulfur kimura et al 2002 operation under a high do concentration would deteriorate the nitrogen removal performance and increase the effluent sulfate concentration sahinkaya and kilic 2014 however for the sad process in phase iv with the addition of the sulfur stone in r1 the effluent nitrate and sulfate concentrations were gradually decreased from days 140 161 these results indicate that the sad reaction could be well adapted for the operational conditions of this coupling system during this period a marked shift in the morphology of the sulfur stone was observed fig s3 a thin biofilm with a pale red color was formed on the surface of the sulfur stone it was very thick and could be easily peeled off the bacterial sequences of the pale red biofilm showed that candidatus kuenenia anammox bacterium and thiobacillus sad bacterium accounted for 8 18 and 59 01 of the total reads respectively text s2 this result inferred the co existence of anammox and sad bacteria on the sulfur stone a repetitive experiment in which the reactor was operated under the same operational conditions in phases i ii and iv was designed to investigate whether the coupling system could promote the growth of special biofilm when the newly pre cultivated sulfur stone was added to the pna biofilm reactor the sulfate production ideal nitrate production in the pna process ratio s nideal also gradually decreased from 4 71 to 3 15 in the following 16 d of operation fig s4 meanwhile the formation of a unique pale red biofilm on the surface of the sulfur stone was recognized these results suggest that the coupling system promoted the formation of the unique biofilm and could effectively reduce the sulfate production rate after increasing the reactor do concentration from 0 40 0 20 mg l 1 to 0 80 0 20 mg l 1 the effluent nitrogen concentration changed slightly p 0 05 table s2 this meant that the fluctuation in the do concentration within a small range had little effect on the nitrogen removal performance of the coupling system however after increasing the do concentration to 1 20 0 20 mg l 1 on day 285 the average effluent nitrate concentration increased from 3 75 mg l 1 to 5 02 mg l 1 fig 4 the effluent sulfate concentration also reached to 416 mg l 1 and did not show a downward trend in the following days these results suggest that a high do concentration would increase the sulfate production and sulfur consumption table s2 consequently maintaining a low do concentration 0 6 mg l 1 in this coupling reactor was very important to ensure a lower sulfate production rate 3 4 substrate depletion assays and 15n labeling experiment for inferring the reaction pathway in the coupling processes previous studies and metagenomics sequencing text s2 suggested that sad and anammox have a similar reaction pathway in their denitrification processes nitrite to nitric oxide beller et al 2006b lawson et al 2017 li et al 2016 tang et al 2018 yayi wang et al 2016 therefore it was possible to replace part of the sad process from nitrite to dinitrogen gas with the anammox process to further investigate the relationship between the anammox and sad processes the aeration in phase vi was stopped to avoid the influence of a partial nitritation reaction as the nitrate could not be reduced in the anammox reaction the effluent no3 n concentration reached 65 3 1 4 mg l 1 after removing the sulfur stone from r1 fig 5 in addition the effluent nh4 n concentration reached 81 7 1 1 mg l 1 which was even higher than the influent nh4 n concentration these results indicate that the partial nitritation reaction was stopped under this operational condition and the anammox process would not occur without no2 n strous et al 2006 when the sulfur stone was re added to r1 the effluent no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were decreased to 2 3 mg l 1 and 12 16 mg l 1 respectively in this period more than 64 mg l 1 of nh4 n and 64 mg l 1 of no3 n were removed under the condition with no aeration with sad the s n ratio was 3 69 0 29 which was much lower than that for phase ii these results suggested that an anammox reaction occurred under an incomplete sad reaction the results of the 15n labeling experiment are shown in table 3 29n2 which was produced via the anammox process accounted for nearly 88 9 of the collected dinitrogen gas on day 331 the relative abundance of 29n2 was 12 17 times higher than that of 30n2 this result indicated that most of the nitrite as an intermediate in the sad reaction served as an electron acceptor for the anammox reaction on the basis of these obtained results it could be concluded that the short cut sad process was constructed in the coupling system in the sad process sulfur as the electron donor is oxidized to sulfate to obtain five electrons for sustaining nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas chung et al 2014 xu et al 2016 however nitrate nitrogen oxidation number v receives two electrons from the oxidation of sulfur and is initially reduced to nitrite nitrogen oxidation number iii eq 7 xu et al 2016 the anammox and nitritation reactions can be simplified to eq 8 and eq 9 respectively as follows 7 no 3 2 h 2 e no 2 h 2 o 8 nh 4 1 32 no 2 1 02 n 2 0 256 no 3 9 nh 4 no 2 under an ideal short cut denitrification process it can be assumed that all nitrate is converted to nitrite by the sad reaction this converted nitrite is reduced to dinitrogen gas through the coupled anammox reaction under the same influent concentration mg n l 1 of nh4 n and no2 n the total nitrate generated in this coupling process can be iteratively calculated as follows text s3 10 i 1 n 0 256 1 32 i a 0 256 1 32 a 0 256 1 32 2 a 1 1 0 256 1 32 0 256 1 32 a 0 24 a ammonium consumption can then be calculated as follows 11 i 1 n 1 1 32 0 256 1 32 i a 1 1 32 a 1 1 32 0 256 1 32 a 0 256 1 32 2 a 1 1 32 a 1 1 32 0 256 1 064 a 1 1 32 a 0 94 a therefore the nitrogen removal equation for the anammox and short cut sad reaction could be simplified to eq 12 12 0 94 nh 4 no 2 0 97 n 2 in this reaction scheme partial nitritation was assumed to provide the proper amount of nitrite this means that all the influent ammonium nitrogen can be converted to dinitrogen gas in this ideal process thus the ratio of nitrate which is generated from the anammox process to influent ammonium can be calculated as follows 13 0 24 a 0 94 a a 0 124 this calculated ratio was 1 13 times higher than the theoretical ratio of 0 11 for the pna reaction shown in eq 3 in this proposed reaction mechanism only two electron reduction is needed in the short cut sad process eq 7 besides the pre cultivation process phase i showed that sulfate production was reduced by 40 using influent with the same concentration of ammonium and nitrite these results suggested that the theoretical sulfate production in the short cut sad process can only reach 40 of that of the complete sad process on the basis of these obtained results the total sulfate production in phase iv should be reduced by 55 compared to that in phase ii moreover the sulfate produced by the sad reaction was decreased to 59 of the stoichiometric sulfate production the reasons for this decrease in sulfate production might have been related to the occurrence of other types of denitrification reactions in the coupling process detection of some heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the sequencing of 16s rrna genes also supported this hypothesis text s2 in the present study the experimental results showed a satisfying nitrogen removal performance with a low effluent sulfate concentration the nitrogen transformation pathway in the coupling system could be conducted as shown in fig 6 in the pna process ammonium was oxidized to nitrite and converted to dinitrogen gas with a small amount of nitrate production this reaction can be controlled by adjusting the reactor do concentration under a high ph an fa concentration higher than 1 mg nh3 n l 1 can be easily maintained and the inhibition of nitrite oxidation is feasible liu et al 2019 elemental sulfur was successfully used as an electron donor in the sad reaction transient accumulated nitrite in the sad process under the operating conditions can be used as an electron acceptor in the anammox reaction this indicates that a short cut denitrification process was successfully constructed in this coupling reactor consequently the sulfur consumption and sulfate production in this coupling system were significantly reduced 3 5 applications and future research in this study pna and denitrification processes were simultaneously developed compared with that in the conventional pna process combined with the sad process most of the ammonium converted to dinitrogen gas in the anammox reaction and the nitrite provided by the short cut sad reaction could also reduce the external supplementation of alkalinity in partial nitritation because the sad reaction occurs on elemental sulfur the addition of other auxiliary materials such as organic carbon and s2o3 is not required therefore this coupling process could be easily operated furthermore as no external organic carbon source is required and less sludge is produced in autotrophic denitrification liang et al 2018 the novel system should produce less excess sludge than some conventional nitrogen removal processes such as nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification shao et al 2010 sobotka et al 2017 compared with the conventional sad process short cut denitrification could also reduce the generation of hydrogen ions table s3 that means that the demand for alkalinity in the novel system can be reduced therefore the coupling process is an effective method for treating high ammonium containing wastewater these characteristics of the coupling process illustrate the substantial economic benefits and technical merits for practical applications in the future although the coupling system with mechanical vibrations showed an excellent nitrogen removal capacity with low sulfate production the influencing factors such as the intensity of the mechanical vibrations and ph on the treatment performance must be further investigated furthermore the relationship between candidatus kuenenia and thiobacillus should be clarified through further microbiological analyses along with the microbial function related to the nitrite removal process and system stability finally the applicability of the mechanical vibration technique for the promotion of biofilm formation on the sulfur stone surface is also an area for further research 4 conclusions simultaneous pna and sad processes with the addition of sulfur stones to the pna system were successfully established this coupling system showed a high nre with low sulfate production the sulfate production rate decreased by nearly 60 in the coupling system a thin pale red biofilm was formed on the sulfur stone bacterial sequences revealed that anammox bacteria and sad bacteria co existed on the surface of the sulfur stone candidatus kuenenia anammox bacterium and thiobacillus sad bacterium accounted for 8 18 and 59 01 of the total reads respectively a higher do value would increase the sulfate production and sulfur consumption consequently maintaining a low do concentration 0 6 mg l 1 in this coupling reactor was very important to ensure a low sulfate production rate the sulfate production rate substrate consumption rate 15n labeling and theoretical calculations suggested that the short cut sad process became the dominant nitrate removal process in the coupling system most of the nitrite as an intermediate in the sad process served as an electron acceptor to achieve the anammox process meanwhile the demand for sulfur and the generation of hydrogen ions in the sad or partial nitritation processes could also be reduced no external organic carbon source is required in the coupling system so the amount of excess sludge production could be reduced to a low level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17869,bio denitrification is widely used for remediation of nitrate contaminated site or removal of nitrate from wastewater but its efficiency is not always satisfied and high nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission occur frequently iron plays an important role in achieving efficient biological denitrification nevertheless its concentration in cells is usually inadequate and additional supply of iron to denitrification system has been adopted in the literature in this study a novel approach to increase the intracellular iron concentration of denitrifying microbes by using graphene to accelerate iron transport which significantly enhanced bio denitrification and decreased intermediates accumulations was reported and the underlying mechanisms were explored the presence of 50 mg l of graphene was observed to not only significantly promote nitrate removal efficiency by 67 3 but also decrease nitrite and nitrous oxide generation by 49 0 and 63 9 respectively it was found that graphene promoted the generation transfer and consumption of electrons increased the activities or gene expressions of fe containing enzymes such as complex i complex iii various cytochromes and most denitrification reductases and enhanced the growth of denitrifiers due to iron acquisition by denitrifying bacteria being remarkably facilitated leading to a significant increment of intracellular iron concentration meanwhile the intracellular proton motive force and atp levels were promoted as well this study provided a new approach to enhancing bio denitrification and revealed a novel insight into biological iron acquisition graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification graphene nitrite nitrous iron transport 1 introduction with the advantages of economic feasibility and little

isaka et al 2012 wu et al 2019 traditionally supplement of external carbon sources to increase the codcr n ratio is mostly employed to enhance denitrification performance whereas it increases the process cost and inaccurate dosing of carbon sources can cause secondary pollution ballantine et al 2014 therefore novel approaches to stimulate bio denitrification rate are urgently needed nowadays iron is an essential trace element involved in biological processes such as microbial metabolism cell growth enzymatic catalysis electron transfer and dna rna synthesis berks et al 1995 casey et al 1988 coughlan 1971 lankford and byers 1973 it is known that heterotrophic denitrifiers metabolize carbon source to produce electrons which are then delivered via electron transport system including nadh dehydrogenase complex i quinone pool bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c to corresponding denitrification reductases i e nitrate nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases berks et al 1995 obviously iron acts as the activity center of the cytochromes and most nox reductases and therefore plays an important role in achieving efficient biological denitrification it was reported that intracellular iron deficient caused the decrease of denitrification rate significantly labbé et al 2003 as the concentration of iron in bacteria is usually inadequate its additional supply to denitrification system has been adopted in the literature for example the study of hassler et al showed that external addition of iron containing nanoparticles led to a better biological denitrification efficiency with less nitrite accumulation an et al 2010 weber et al assessed the influence of zero valent iron zvi on microbial reduction of nitrate and observed that the addition of zvi increased the relative abundance of denitrifiers and nitrate removal rate weber et al 2006 song et al found that external fe2 addition assisted the process of denitrification and enhanced nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands song et al 2016 obviously the performance of biological denitrification can be improved by the increase of extracellular iron concentration as the extracellular iron should be transferred into the cell before it is utilized by denitrifiers it seems that the denitrification efficiency might be enhanced with the improvement of iron transport from extracellular to intracellular even if the outside iron concentration is not increased it has been widely accepted that iron transport by bacteria is mediated by siderophores iron carriers predominately faraldo gómez and sansom 2003 wimley 2003 usually bacteria elaborate siderophores to form iron siderophores which then pass through the outer membrane into the periplasm space through porin protein with energy supplied from proton motive force pmf originally then iron siderophores are taken over and further transported into the cytoplasm via an atp binding cassette abc transport system it indicates that by increasing the activity of transport process and the levels of pmf and atp the ability of iron being transported from extracellular to intracellular can be enhanced until now however the study regarding the improvement of denitrification performance by regulating iron transport without increasing extracellular iron concentration has not been documented graphene with a single layer of carbon atoms closely packed in a lattice honeycomb structure has been applied in various fields including biomedicine supercapacitor and sensing platform huang et al 2012 it can also be used to remove pollutants from the contaminated environments for example a variety of graphene based nanomaterials have been reported to efficiently remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions due to the six membered ring plane acting as an ideal adsorption site for antibiotics wang et al 2019 in addition graphene has the feature of electron transfer and the flat graphene can enhance electron transfer not only in the electrochemical oxidation of methylene blue but also in the electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene for the sp2 hybridization of carbon atom and zero band gap of graphene pan et al 2017 velicky et al 2014 in this study a novel approach to increase the intracellular iron of denitrifying microbes by using graphene to accelerate iron transport which significantly enhanced biological denitrification efficiency and decreased intermediates nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulations was reported and the underlying mechanisms were explored this study put forward a new solution to boosting bio denitrification process with declined toxic intermediates emissions which also expanded the application of graphene in environmental pollution remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1

medium was added to each one these bottles were divided into six groups equally p denitrificans was inoculated to each bottle with an od600 of 0 02 0 002 in each bottle and graphene was dispersed with ultrasonication 40 khz and 250 w for 30 min and then supplemented with a final concentration of 0 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg l respectively all bottles were maintained in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 30

among groups was identified by anova with the least significant difference post hoc test spss 20 0 data fitting was calculated using originpro 9 0 software originlab 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of graphene on bio denitrification performance it was observed that graphene gave significant influence on the performance of biological denitrification as illustrated in fig 1 a the addition of graphene led to more decrease in nitrate concentration at a given time by the end of the experiments the residual nitrate concentrations were 9 71 8 34 5 46 3 14 0 21 mm and non detectable in the presence of 0 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg l of graphene respectively and the corresponding nitrate removal efficiency were 50 1 57 5 71 9 83 8 98 9 and 100 0 which suggested that denitrification efficiency was increased with graphene the adsorption test showed that when there was only graphene 200 mg l and without denitrifying microbes in the reactor very little nitrate variation was observed from initial 21 36 mm to final 21 04 mm in addition it was reported that paracoccus denitrificans was an autotrophic strain which could reduce iron till et al 1998 in the current study the denitrification experiment was conducted in 100 ml medium and the initial nitrate and iron iii concentrations were respectively 21 36 mm and 9 0 μm iron iii therefore the nitrate and iron iii amounts were 2 136 mmol and 0 90 μmol respectively the theoretical maximum amount of electron provided by 0 90 μmol iron iii was 4 5 μm which could reduce 0 64 μm nitrate to nitrogen gas the initial nitrate was 2 14 mmol suggesting that 0 64 μm nitrate reduced by iron as an electron donor was negligible apparently the presence of graphene in denitrification system remarkably promoted bio denitrification and the enhancement of nitrate removal was not due to either the adsorption behavior of graphene or the autotrophic denitrification using reduced iron as an electron donor it is well known that denitrification intermediates such as nitrite and nitrous oxide are harmful to the environment and should be avoided during denitrification the influences of graphene on the variations of nitrite and nitrous oxide in denitrifying reactor were also examined in this study in the control test the greatest nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulations were respectively 0 60 mm and 4 38 μm mm tn while they were 0 25 mm and 1 58 μm mm tn and 0 17 mm and 1 17 μm mm tn in the presence of 50 and 200 mg l of graphene respectively fig 1b and c and the maximal accumulations of nitrite and nitrous oxide were reduced by 58 3 and 63 9 and 71 7 and 73 4 correspondingly obviously both nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation were attenuated with graphene addition in the literature the improvement of denitrification efficiency is usually achieved by the increase of influent carbon source concentration or the optimization of carbon source composition for example the study of warneke et al showed that the nitrate removal rate of denitrification depended directly on the quantity of microbial available carbon source but more n2o release was observed at greater nitrate removal rate warneke et al 2011 fowdar et al compared the denitrification capacities of seven carbon substrates and found that the nitrate removal rate ranged in the following order acetate cotton spent grain brewery waste rice hulls corn woodchips fowdar et al 2015 there were very few publications regarding the increase of nitrate removal with simultaneous decrease of harmful intermediates nitrite n2o or no accumulations in biological nutrient removal bnr process our previous study demonstrated that the use of waste activated sludge alkaline fermentation liquid as the carbon source compared with the commonly used carbon source e g acetic acid caused the generation of n2o and no in an anaerobic aerobic low dissolved oxygen bnr process being decreased by 68 7 and 50 0 respectively but the removal efficiencies of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were all improved zhu and chen 2011 the data in fig 1 suggested that the current study provided an alternative method to promote denitrification and reduce the accumulations of nitrite and nitrous oxide by using graphene it should be noted that although the denitrification performance was increased with graphene dosage the denitrification at graphene dosage of 50 mg l was significant enhanced compared with that in the control and a low graphene dosage facilitated its practical application in real denitrification system thus in the following text 50 mg l of graphene was taken as an example to explore the mechanism of remarkably enhancng biodenitrification 3 2 influence of graphene on cell structure and physiological activity of denitrifying bacteria the morphological features of denitrifying microbes in the presence and absence of 50 mg l graphene were examined by sem and tem it was observed from fig 2 a and b without graphene and fig 2c and d with graphene that there was no significant difference in the morphology of cell before and after 50 mg l graphene addition the tem images also confirmed the integrity of cell membrane fig 2e h ldh release is usually used in the literature for quantitative analysis of cell structure integrality the data in fig 2i indicated that the addition of 50 mg l graphene did not result in significant increase of ldh release p 0 05 further cck 8 analysis which has been widely applied to measure cell viability also suggested that graphene led to no obviously damages on the viability of denitrifying bacteria these results observed in the current study were probably due to the excellent compatibility of cvd grown graphene with denitrifiers kalbacova et al 2010 lee et al 2011 atp is a crucial energy carrier for cell biosynthesis activity and substrate e g nitrate transport and a higher atp level indicates a greater physiological activity of denitrifying bacteria yu et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 as seen from fig 2j the atp level was increased with graphene at a given experimental time by the end of the experiment it was 0 145 μmol mg protein in the 50 mg l graphene reactor compared with 0 088 μmol mg protein in the control reactor which indicated an increase of 47 1 in atp level after the addition of 50 mg l of graphene the elements for the atp synthesis process are separated in the bipartite structure the membrane intrinsic portion f0 with αβγδε subunits and the peripheral portion fi with abc subunits cabezon et al 2002 engelbrecht and junge 1997 as illustrated in fig 2k the expression of gene cluster of f0f1 atpase subunits encoding atp synthase was up regulated in the presence of 50 mg l graphene which was in correspondence with the increased atp level under the condition 3 3 influence of graphene on the activity of electron generation transport and consumption during denitrification electrons are required for biologically reducing nitrate by denitrifying enzymes to nitrite no n2o and finally nitrogen gas they are generated in the metabolism of carbon source acetate in this study fig 3 a illustrated the variation of acetate concentration with time in the presence of 0 20 and 50 mg l of graphene and the final acetate was respectively 23 01 17 64 and 13 83 mm at graphene dosage of 0 20 and 50 mg l suggesting that graphene stimulated the metabolism of acetate which would increase electrons generation it is well known that the generated electrons need to be transferred to electron acceptors before being utilized by denitrifying enzymes and the effectiveness of electron transport process can be evaluated by measuring the activities of complex i and complex iii li et al 2016 wan et al 2016 as seen in fig 3b there were 28 6 and 44 5 increments in complex i and complex iii under conditions of 50 mg l graphene indicating a faster electron flow from electron donor carbon source to electron acceptor nox reductases to the consumption of electrons it was determined by the activities of nox reductases fig 3c showed that compared with the control the activities of nox reductases were increased by 75 4 nar nitrate reductase 28 8 nir nitrite reductase 24 2 nor nitric oxide reductase and 50 3 n2or nitrous oxide reductase in the presence of 50 mg l of graphene apparently the increased denitrification efficiency caused by graphene was due to the enhancement of electron generation transport and consumption which were further depicted in fig 3d it was noted that the growth of biomass was also increased by graphene at the end of the denitrification experiment the concentration of denitrifying microbes was 0 43 and 0 57 mg dry wt ml in the absence and presence of 50 mg l graphene respectively and the biomass was increased by 32 6 50 mg l it should be emphasized that the removal of nitrate was increased by 67 3 under condition of graphene dosage of 50 mg l suggesting that the addition of graphene to denitrification system causing the increase of biomass was only one possible reason for the improvement of nitrate removal efficiency observed in this study and the role of graphene in enhancing denitrifying microorganism activity and promoting microbial metabolism were also important the activities of many denitrifying enzymes and proteins involved in electron transport and consumption are reported to be related with iron also iron is an essential element for microbial growth for example electrons are initially transduced to the flavin mono nucleotide in complex i which is a fe s cluster beinert et al 1997 complex iii consists of an integral membrane protein with two or more iron relevant heme b cofactors iwata et al 1998 iron also acts as the active site in the electron carrier c type cytochrome chen and strous 2013 in addition nar nitrate reductase nir nitrite reductase nor nitric oxide reductase and n2or nitrous oxide reductase also include the fe containing heme or fe s cluster berks et al 1995 thus in the following text the influence of graphene on iron acquisition by denitrifying microbes was investigated 3 4 influence of graphene on iron acquisition by denitrifying bacteria iron acquisition by bacteria is heavily dependent on the amount of secreted siderophore by cell itself and the transmembrane transport rate of iron siderophore faraldo gómez and sansom 2003 in the current study the test of graphene affecting intracellular iron level by an iron sensor probe calcein whose fluorescent emission would be quenched by iron binding was conducted it was observed that when enough feedta control was applied as the iron source the average fluorescent intensity was decreased from 8455 to 4066 following with the addition of 50 mg l graphene fig 4 which indicated that graphene indeed resulted in a much higher intracellular iron level in denitrifying bacteria it was reported that bacteria produced siderophore had a very high affinity to iron with the formation of fe siderophore and therefore was able to obtain iron from its complex i e feedta which facilitated the transport of iron through the membrane directly stintzi et al 2000 in order to find out whether the influence of graphene on iron acquisition was attributed to the production of siderophore or not fe siderophore equivalent to feedta in iron amount was substituted for feedta and the influence of graphene on iron fe siderophore intracellular iron level was investigated as shown in fig 4 the average fluorescent intensity changed from 7211 to 2410 provided by the instrument after the addition of graphene indicating that fe siderophore uptake rate was also significantly promoted by graphene in this condition besides in the absence of graphene by comparing the average fluorescent intensity levels in both feedta and fe siderophore it was found that the average fluorescent intensity was decreased from 8455 to 7211 it coincided with the expectation that the intracellular iron level was increased when iron was provided in the form of fe siderophore however compared with that the influence of graphene this increment was relatively small thereby it was concluded that graphene promoted iron acquisition mainly by increasing the fe siderophore uptake rate it was reported that the transport of iron siderophores from extracellular to periplasmic space was driven by the change of porin configuration in the outer membrane and the energy needed for the change of porin configuration came from the tonb exbb exbd system after receiving the external energy the system changed its configuration which caused the change of porin configuration and transferred the energy to porin thus providing energy for iron siderophores transport fig 5 a faraldo gómez and sansom 2003 larsen et al 1999 data in fig 5b revealed that the gene expression in iron uptake pathway was significantly up regulated p 0 001 it is well known that pmf is the energy source of tonb exbb exbd system and plays an important role in the iron transport process thus the effect of graphene 50 mg l on pmf in denitrification process was investigated as the total pmf δp δψ zδph across the membrane is made up of electrical potential δψ and chemical zδph components it can be evaluated by examining the difference in electrical potential and ph level between the inside and outside of the cell manson et al 1977 in the current study there was no obvious change in both extracellular ph fig s2a supporting information and intracellular ph fig s2b no matter whether graphene was introduced or not this result was due to the buffering capacity of phosphate medium outside and the cytoplasmic matrix inside and it indicated that the δph value kept constant hence the pmf was dominated by the membrane potential component the potential of the inner and outer membrane of denitrifying microbes was measured by fluorescence probe and the results were illustrated in fig 5c compared with the control the addition of 50 mg l graphene increased the average fluorescence intensity from 593 to 721 provided by the instrument suggesting that graphene facilitated a higher pmf in denitrification process which provided more impetus for iron siderophores transport pmf can be produced in the process of redox loops including oxidation and reduction of cytochromes and complexes i and iii jormakka et al 2002 saraste 1999 data in fig 3b and c showed increments in the activities of these compounds which were in consistent with a higher pmf observed here at the end of the denitrification test the intracellular iron concentrations were 5 02 and 8 06 10 12 μm cell at graphene of 0 and 50 mg l fig 5d respectively thus the presence of graphene increased the intracellular iron level it was seen from fig 5e that the gene of iron containing compounds including various key cytochromes nitrate reductase and others were all significantly up regulated it would contribute to an increment in denitrification performance accordingly meanwhile most of these iron containing compounds were relative to redox loops in denitrifiers a higher gene expression of them would promote the generation of pmf in addition the presence of graphene was observed to increase intracellular atp fig 2j and k which provided more energy for the transport of carbon source trace elements nitrates and nitrites since these processes were heavily dependent on energy berks et al 1995 bradbeer 1993 further analyses of genes relevant transport process depending on atp and pmf in p denitrificans were also significantly improved by graphene table s1 supporting information 4 conclusions the influence of graphene on denitrification performance was investigated the removal of nitrate was remarkably enhanced and the accumulations of environmentally harmful metabolic intermediates nitrite and nitrous oxide were significantly decreased the mechanism investigations revealed that graphene did not affect cell morphology and damage microbial viability but it promoted the metabolism of carbon source the generation transfer and consumption of electrons the activities of key enzymes the growth of denitrifiers the intracellular proton motive force and atp due to iron transmembrane transport being enhanced this study provided a novel method for efficient nitrate contamination remediation in addition as iron is a crucial element to the growth and metabolism of many microorganisms the findings reported in this paper would reveal a novel insight into assisting their iron acquisition with graphene declaration of

17869,bio denitrification is widely used for remediation of nitrate contaminated site or removal of nitrate from wastewater but its efficiency is not always satisfied and high nitrite accumulation and nitrous oxide emission occur frequently iron plays an important role in achieving efficient biological denitrification nevertheless its concentration in cells is usually inadequate and additional supply of iron to denitrification system has been adopted in the literature in this study a novel approach to increase the intracellular iron concentration of denitrifying microbes by using graphene to accelerate iron transport which significantly enhanced bio denitrification and decreased intermediates accumulations was reported and the underlying mechanisms were explored the presence of 50 mg l of graphene was observed to not only significantly promote nitrate removal efficiency by 67 3 but also decrease nitrite and nitrous oxide generation by 49 0 and 63 9 respectively it was found that graphene promoted the generation transfer and consumption of electrons increased the activities or gene expressions of fe containing enzymes such as complex i complex iii various cytochromes and most denitrification reductases and enhanced the growth of denitrifiers due to iron acquisition by denitrifying bacteria being remarkably facilitated leading to a significant increment of intracellular iron concentration meanwhile the intracellular proton motive force and atp levels were promoted as well this study provided a new approach to enhancing bio denitrification and revealed a novel insight into biological iron acquisition graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification graphene nitrite nitrous iron transport 1 introduction with the advantages of economic feasibility and little secondary pollution bio denitrification has been extensively applied to reduce and remove nitrate from contaminated environments however one of the biggest challenges is the low denitrification

development in aquatic organisms to nitrate in natural process as well as the investment for nitrate wastewater treatment facilities e g reactor volume in engineered system edwards and hamlin 2018 isaka et al 2012 wu et al 2019 traditionally supplement of external carbon sources to increase the codcr n ratio is mostly employed to enhance denitrification performance whereas it increases the process cost and inaccurate dosing of carbon sources can cause secondary pollution ballantine et al 2014 therefore novel approaches to stimulate bio denitrification rate are urgently needed nowadays iron is an essential trace element involved in biological processes such as microbial metabolism cell growth enzymatic catalysis electron transfer and dna rna synthesis berks et al 1995 casey et al 1988 coughlan 1971 lankford and byers 1973 it is known that heterotrophic denitrifiers metabolize carbon source to produce electrons which are then delivered via electron transport system including nadh dehydrogenase complex i quinone pool bc1 complex complex iii and cytochrome c to corresponding denitrification reductases i e nitrate nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases berks et al 1995 obviously iron acts as the activity center of the cytochromes and most nox reductases and therefore plays an important role in achieving efficient biological denitrification it was reported that intracellular iron deficient caused the decrease of denitrification rate significantly labbé et al 2003 as the concentration of iron in bacteria is usually inadequate its additional supply to denitrification system has been adopted in the literature for example the study of hassler et al showed that external addition of iron containing nanoparticles led to a better biological denitrification efficiency with less nitrite accumulation an et al 2010 weber et al assessed the influence of zero valent iron zvi on microbial reduction of nitrate and observed that the addition of zvi increased the relative abundance of denitrifiers and nitrate removal rate weber et al 2006 song et al found that external fe2 addition assisted the process of denitrification and enhanced nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands song et al 2016 obviously the performance of biological denitrification can be improved by the increase of extracellular iron concentration as the extracellular iron should be transferred into the cell before it is utilized by denitrifiers it seems that the denitrification efficiency might be enhanced with the improvement of iron transport from extracellular to intracellular even if the outside iron concentration is not increased it has been widely accepted that iron transport by bacteria is mediated by siderophores iron carriers predominately faraldo gómez and sansom 2003 wimley 2003 usually bacteria elaborate siderophores to form iron siderophores which then pass through the outer membrane into the periplasm space through porin protein with energy supplied from proton motive force pmf originally then iron siderophores are taken over and further transported into the cytoplasm via an atp binding cassette abc transport system it indicates that by increasing the activity of transport process and the levels of pmf and atp the ability of iron being transported from extracellular to intracellular can be enhanced until now however the study regarding the improvement of denitrification performance by regulating iron transport without increasing extracellular iron concentration has not been documented graphene with a single layer of carbon atoms closely packed in a lattice honeycomb structure has been applied in various fields including biomedicine supercapacitor and sensing platform huang et al 2012 it can also be used to remove pollutants from the contaminated environments for example a variety of graphene based nanomaterials have been reported to efficiently remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions due to the six membered ring plane acting as an ideal adsorption site for antibiotics wang et al 2019 in addition graphene has the feature of electron transfer and the flat graphene can enhance electron transfer not only in the electrochemical oxidation of methylene blue but also in the electrochemical reduction of nitrobenzene for the sp2 hybridization of carbon atom and zero band gap of graphene pan et al 2017 velicky et al 2014 in this study a novel approach to increase the intracellular iron of denitrifying microbes by using graphene to accelerate iron transport which significantly enhanced biological denitrification efficiency and decreased intermediates nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulations was reported and the underlying mechanisms were explored this study put forward a new solution to boosting bio denitrification process with declined toxic intermediates emissions which also expanded the application of graphene in environmental pollution remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1

mgso4 7h2o and trace metals were autoclaved as 200 fold stock solutions separately and then added to the serum bottles with a syringe eighteen anaerobic bottles were used and 100 ml of denitrification medium was added to each one these bottles were divided into six groups equally p denitrificans was inoculated to each bottle with an od600 of 0 02 0 002 in each bottle and graphene was dispersed with ultrasonication 40 khz and 250 w for 30 min and then supplemented with a final concentration of 0 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg l respectively all bottles were maintained in an air bath shaker 150 rpm at 30 1 c blank experiment was also designed in the same denitrifying bottles with 200 mg l of graphene in the absence of denitrifying bacteria samples withdrawn by syringe at different time were subjected

among groups was identified by anova with the least significant difference post hoc test spss 20 0 data fitting was calculated using originpro 9 0 software originlab 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of graphene on bio denitrification performance it was observed that graphene gave significant influence on the performance of biological denitrification as illustrated in fig 1 a the addition of graphene led to more decrease in nitrate concentration at a given time by the end of the experiments the residual nitrate concentrations were 9 71 8 34 5 46 3 14 0 21 mm and non detectable in the presence of 0 10 20 50 100 and 200 mg l of graphene respectively and the corresponding nitrate removal efficiency were 50 1 57 5 71 9 83 8 98 9 and 100 0 which suggested that denitrification efficiency was increased with graphene the adsorption test showed that when there was only graphene 200 mg l and without denitrifying microbes in the reactor very little nitrate variation was observed from initial 21 36 mm to final 21 04 mm in addition it was reported that paracoccus denitrificans was an autotrophic strain which could reduce iron till et al 1998 in the current study the denitrification experiment was conducted in 100 ml medium and the initial nitrate and iron iii concentrations were respectively 21 36 mm and 9 0 μm iron iii therefore the nitrate and iron iii amounts were 2 136 mmol and 0 90 μmol respectively the theoretical maximum amount of electron provided by 0 90 μmol iron iii was 4 5 μm which could reduce 0 64 μm nitrate to nitrogen gas the initial nitrate was 2 14 mmol suggesting that 0 64 μm nitrate reduced by iron as an electron donor was negligible apparently the presence of graphene in denitrification system remarkably promoted bio denitrification and the enhancement of nitrate removal was not due to either the adsorption behavior of graphene or the autotrophic denitrification using reduced iron as an electron donor it is well known that denitrification intermediates such as nitrite and nitrous oxide are harmful to the environment and should be avoided during denitrification the influences of graphene on the variations of nitrite and nitrous oxide in denitrifying reactor were also examined in this study in the control test the greatest nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulations were respectively 0 60 mm and 4 38 μm mm tn while they were 0 25 mm and 1 58 μm mm tn and 0 17 mm and 1 17 μm mm tn in the presence of 50 and 200 mg l of graphene respectively fig 1b and c and the maximal accumulations of nitrite and nitrous oxide were reduced by 58 3 and 63 9 and 71 7 and 73 4 correspondingly obviously both nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation were attenuated with graphene addition in the literature the improvement of denitrification efficiency is usually achieved by the increase of influent carbon source concentration or the optimization of carbon source composition for example the study of warneke et al showed that the nitrate removal rate of denitrification depended directly on the quantity of microbial available carbon source but more n2o release was observed at greater nitrate removal rate warneke et al 2011 fowdar et al compared the denitrification capacities of seven carbon substrates and found that the nitrate removal rate ranged in the following order acetate cotton spent grain brewery waste rice hulls corn woodchips fowdar et al 2015 there were very few publications regarding the increase of nitrate removal with simultaneous decrease of harmful intermediates nitrite n2o or no accumulations in biological nutrient removal bnr process our previous study demonstrated that the use of waste activated sludge alkaline fermentation liquid as the carbon source compared with the commonly used carbon source e g acetic acid caused the generation of n2o and no in an anaerobic aerobic low dissolved oxygen bnr process being decreased by 68 7 and 50 0 respectively but the removal efficiencies of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were all improved zhu and chen 2011 the data in fig 1 suggested that the current study provided an alternative method to promote denitrification and reduce the accumulations of nitrite and nitrous oxide by using graphene it should be noted that although the denitrification performance was increased with graphene dosage the denitrification at graphene dosage of 50 mg l was significant enhanced compared with that in the control and a low graphene dosage facilitated its practical application in real denitrification system thus in the following text 50 mg l of graphene was taken as an example to explore the mechanism of remarkably enhancng biodenitrification 3 2 influence of graphene on cell structure and physiological activity of denitrifying bacteria the morphological features of denitrifying microbes in the presence and absence of 50 mg l graphene were examined by sem and tem it was observed from fig 2 a and b without graphene and fig 2c and d with graphene that there was no significant difference in the morphology of cell before and after 50 mg l graphene addition the tem images also confirmed the integrity of cell membrane fig 2e h ldh release is usually used in the literature for quantitative analysis of cell structure integrality the data in fig 2i indicated that the addition of 50 mg l graphene did not result in significant increase of ldh release p 0 05 further cck 8 analysis which has been widely applied to measure cell viability also suggested that graphene led to no obviously damages on the viability of denitrifying bacteria these results observed in the current study were probably due to the excellent compatibility of cvd grown graphene with denitrifiers kalbacova et al 2010 lee et al 2011 atp is a crucial energy carrier for cell biosynthesis activity and substrate e g nitrate transport and a higher atp level indicates a greater physiological activity of denitrifying bacteria yu et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 as seen from fig 2j the atp level was increased with graphene at a given experimental time by the end of the experiment it was 0 145 μmol mg protein in the 50 mg l graphene reactor compared with 0 088 μmol mg protein in the control reactor which indicated an increase of 47 1 in atp level after the addition of 50 mg l of graphene the elements for the atp synthesis process are separated in the bipartite structure the membrane intrinsic portion f0 with αβγδε subunits and the peripheral portion fi with abc subunits cabezon et al 2002 engelbrecht and junge 1997 as illustrated in fig 2k the expression of gene cluster of f0f1 atpase subunits encoding atp synthase was up regulated in the presence of 50 mg l graphene which was in correspondence with the increased atp level under the condition 3 3 influence of graphene on the activity of electron generation transport and consumption during denitrification electrons are required for biologically reducing nitrate by denitrifying enzymes to nitrite no n2o and finally nitrogen gas they are generated in the metabolism of carbon source acetate in this study fig 3 a illustrated the variation of acetate concentration with time in the presence of 0 20 and 50 mg l of graphene and the final acetate was respectively 23 01 17 64 and 13 83 mm at graphene dosage of 0 20 and 50 mg l suggesting that graphene stimulated the metabolism of acetate which would increase electrons generation it is well known that the generated electrons need to be transferred to electron acceptors before being utilized by denitrifying enzymes and the effectiveness of electron transport process can be evaluated by measuring the activities of complex i and complex iii li et al 2016 wan et al 2016 as seen in fig 3b there were 28 6 and 44 5 increments in complex i and complex iii under conditions of 50 mg l graphene indicating a faster electron flow from electron donor carbon source to electron acceptor nox reductases to the consumption of electrons it was determined by the activities of nox reductases fig 3c showed that compared with the control the activities of nox reductases were increased by 75 4 nar nitrate reductase 28 8 nir nitrite reductase 24 2 nor nitric oxide reductase and 50 3 n2or nitrous oxide reductase in the presence of 50 mg l of graphene apparently the increased denitrification efficiency caused by graphene was due to the enhancement of electron generation transport and consumption which were further depicted in fig 3d it was noted that the growth of biomass was also increased by graphene at the end of the denitrification experiment the concentration of denitrifying microbes was 0 43 and 0 57 mg dry wt ml in the absence and presence of 50 mg l graphene respectively and the biomass was increased by 32 6 50 mg l it should be emphasized that the removal of nitrate was increased by 67 3 under condition of graphene dosage of 50 mg l suggesting that the addition of graphene to denitrification system causing the increase of biomass was only one possible reason for the improvement of nitrate removal efficiency observed in this study and the role of graphene in enhancing denitrifying microorganism activity and promoting microbial metabolism were also important the activities of many denitrifying enzymes and proteins involved in electron transport and consumption are reported to be related with iron also iron is an essential element for microbial growth for example electrons are initially transduced to the flavin mono nucleotide in complex i which is a fe s cluster beinert et al 1997 complex iii consists of an integral membrane protein with two or more iron relevant heme b cofactors iwata et al 1998 iron also acts as the active site in the electron carrier c type cytochrome chen and strous 2013 in addition nar nitrate reductase nir nitrite reductase nor nitric oxide reductase and n2or nitrous oxide reductase also include the fe containing heme or fe s cluster berks et al 1995 thus in the following text the influence of graphene on iron acquisition by denitrifying microbes was investigated 3 4 influence of graphene on iron acquisition by denitrifying bacteria iron acquisition by bacteria is heavily dependent on the amount of secreted siderophore by cell itself and the transmembrane transport rate of iron siderophore faraldo gómez and sansom 2003 in the current study the test of graphene affecting intracellular iron level by an iron sensor probe calcein whose fluorescent emission would be quenched by iron binding was conducted it was observed that when enough feedta control was applied as the iron source the average fluorescent intensity was decreased from 8455 to 4066 following with the addition of 50 mg l graphene fig 4 which indicated that graphene indeed resulted in a much higher intracellular iron level in denitrifying bacteria it was reported that bacteria produced siderophore had a very high affinity to iron with the formation of fe siderophore and therefore was able to obtain iron from its complex i e feedta which facilitated the transport of iron through the membrane directly stintzi et al 2000 in order to find out whether the influence of graphene on iron acquisition was attributed to the production of siderophore or not fe siderophore equivalent to feedta in iron amount was substituted for feedta and the influence of graphene on iron fe siderophore intracellular iron level was investigated as shown in fig 4 the average fluorescent intensity changed from 7211 to 2410 provided by the instrument after the addition of graphene indicating that fe siderophore uptake rate was also significantly promoted by graphene in this condition besides in the absence of graphene by comparing the average fluorescent intensity levels in both feedta and fe siderophore it was found that the average fluorescent intensity was decreased from 8455 to 7211 it coincided with the expectation that the intracellular iron level was increased when iron was provided in the form of fe siderophore however compared with that the influence of graphene this increment was relatively small thereby it was concluded that graphene promoted iron acquisition mainly by increasing the fe siderophore uptake rate it was reported that the transport of iron siderophores from extracellular to periplasmic space was driven by the change of porin configuration in the outer membrane and the energy needed for the change of porin configuration came from the tonb exbb exbd system after receiving the external energy the system changed its configuration which caused the change of porin configuration and transferred the energy to porin thus providing energy for iron siderophores transport fig 5 a faraldo gómez and sansom 2003 larsen et al 1999 data in fig 5b revealed that the gene expression in iron uptake pathway was significantly up regulated p 0 001 it is well known that pmf is the energy source of tonb exbb exbd system and plays an important role in the iron transport process thus the effect of graphene 50 mg l on pmf in denitrification process was investigated as the total pmf δp δψ zδph across the membrane is made up of electrical potential δψ and chemical zδph components it can be evaluated by examining the difference in electrical potential and ph level between the inside and outside of the cell manson et al 1977 in the current study there was no obvious change in both extracellular ph fig s2a supporting information and intracellular ph fig s2b no matter whether graphene was introduced or not this result was due to the buffering capacity of phosphate medium outside and the cytoplasmic matrix inside and it indicated that the δph value kept constant hence the pmf was dominated by the membrane potential component the potential of the inner and outer membrane of denitrifying microbes was measured by fluorescence probe and the results were illustrated in fig 5c compared with the control the addition of 50 mg l graphene increased the average fluorescence intensity from 593 to 721 provided by the instrument suggesting that graphene facilitated a higher pmf in denitrification process which provided more impetus for iron siderophores transport pmf can be produced in the process of redox loops including oxidation and reduction of cytochromes and complexes i and iii jormakka et al 2002 saraste 1999 data in fig 3b and c showed increments in the activities of these compounds which were in consistent with a higher pmf observed here at the end of the denitrification test the intracellular iron concentrations were 5 02 and 8 06 10 12 μm cell at graphene of 0 and 50 mg l fig 5d respectively thus the presence of graphene increased the intracellular iron level it was seen from fig 5e that the gene of iron containing compounds including various key cytochromes nitrate reductase and others were all significantly up regulated it would contribute to an increment in denitrification performance accordingly meanwhile most of these iron containing compounds were relative to redox loops in denitrifiers a higher gene expression of them would promote the generation of pmf in addition the presence of graphene was observed to increase intracellular atp fig 2j and k which provided more energy for the transport of carbon source trace elements nitrates and nitrites since these processes were heavily dependent on energy berks et al 1995 bradbeer 1993 further analyses of genes relevant transport process depending on atp and pmf in p denitrificans were also significantly improved by graphene table s1 supporting information 4 conclusions the influence of graphene on denitrification performance was investigated the removal of nitrate was remarkably enhanced and the accumulations of environmentally harmful metabolic intermediates nitrite and nitrous oxide were significantly decreased the mechanism investigations revealed that graphene did not affect cell morphology and damage microbial viability but it promoted the metabolism of carbon source the generation transfer and consumption of electrons the activities of key enzymes the growth of denitrifiers the intracellular proton motive force and atp due to iron transmembrane transport being enhanced this study provided a novel method for efficient nitrate contamination remediation in addition as iron is a crucial element to the growth and metabolism of many microorganisms the findings reported in this paper would reveal a novel insight into assisting their iron acquisition with graphene declaration of
