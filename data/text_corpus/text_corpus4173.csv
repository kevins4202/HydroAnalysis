20865,the hydrodynamic characteristics of a blended wheel track amphibious truck were studied via model towed tests and numerical simulations first the mathematical model was set up and the process of launching and coming ashore was researched by theoretical analysis the effect of tracks on assisting driving the truck on land was also studied second the influence of buoyancy boxes and bow plate on resistance trim and sinkage was investigated by towing tank tests and simulation the buoyancy boxes were designed to get more buoyancy force and the bow plate was installed to prevent the bow submerged the expanded buoyancy boxes could increase the resistance at f r 0 581 but decrease the resistance at f r 0 725 in addition the sinkage was also increased the installation of bow plate could reduce the resistance significantly when f r 0 436 and with the angle of 25 there was an approximately 3 resistance reduction rate compared with the 20 bow plate moreover the trim was reduced 20 9 with the bow plate angle of 20 and the pressure distribution on the bow plate at various conditions also confirms this result finally a numerical wave tank was set up and the seakeeping performance of

for many years incoul et al 2014 when running on land it is almost the same as a regular assault however the condition is quite complicated when navigating on water considering the passing ability and delivery capacity on land the amphibious vehicles are usually designed as a box shape which belongs to a blunt structure and gives a poor hydrodynamic performance in addition the wheels or tracks system are not beneficial for a formation of smoothed streamlined although they are usually lifted on water the towing tank test is a classic experimental method in the assessment of marine vehicle hydrodynamic performance delen and bal 2015 hou et al 2020 lee et al 2017 tae young et al 2005 helvacioglu et al 2011 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of an amphibious armored personnel carrier using model towed tests the water build up was serious in bow so a head plate was applied to solve this problem in addition the plate works in trim controlling and resistance reduction wang et al 2020 researched the hydrodynamic performance of a double carriage amphibious vehicle by towing tests and numerical simulations the results showed that these simulations had a high accuracy compared with experiments in addition in the process of ship design and research the model towed test is essential for example the resistance of a ship in small ice floes was studied using experimental tests zong et al 2020 some artificial ice floes made of materials were used instead of refrigerated model ice and the resistance results proved that this method was feasible recently with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd the accuracy of marine vehicle motion and hydrodynamic performance calculation have been greatly improved besides high performance computers are widely used and the costs are becoming lower a prediction method of wave resistance was presented based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans kinaci et al 2015 and it was validated by model tests and cfd technique the hydrodynamic performance of a planning hull was studied using cfd method sukas et al 2017 and the overset grid was implemented to get a better solution of complex fluid structure interaction they found that the trim and resistance increase with frouder number until the vehicle entering planning mode the cfd method used in this study exhibited satisfactory results ju et al 2015 investigated the relationship of trim and resistance using cfx software the results showed that the trim impact on resistance was more obvious with speed increase mousaviraad et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of high speed planning hulls in head waves and calm water using cfd technique the mean and amplitude of resistance heave pitch and acceleration were analyzed payam lotfi et al 2015 presented a method to study the pitch and heave of a steeped planning hulls in simulation the lift resistance and trim angle were calculated and compared with empirical equations previous researches had mainly focused on research of traditional marine vehicles yet few were related to new type amphibious vehicles in this study the research object was a blended wheel track amphibious truck which is a novel special marine vehicle two turnable buoyancy boxes were designed to get more buoyancy force under the circumstance of full load on water as depicted in fig 1 when the truck is sailing on water the wheels and tracks are lifted up as much as possible the turnable buoyancy boxes on both sides and bow plate are expanded to help the truck to work as a cargo ship by contrast when coming ashore or on land the wheels and tracks are put down the turnable buoyancy boxes and bow plate are folded to work as a truck moreover the configuration of the truck was a box shape which presented a large difference compared with conventional ships therefore relying solely on cfd technique to investigate the hydrodynamic performance has significant uncertainties in order to guarantee the calculation accuracy in the meantime considering the costs the cfd approach was applied combined with model towed tests furthermore a bow plate was used for solving the problem of bow submerged this research aims to solve the lack of references related to blended wheel track amphibious truck with box shape and try to predict the hydrodynamic performance of this new type marine vehicle 2 theoretical model of launching and coming ashore launching and coming ashore are common scenes for amphibious truck however this process is too complicated and hard to simulate by using any kind of software alone to address this problem the theoretical model was set up to study the launching and coming ashore process as depicted in fig 2 when the bow entering the water a buoyancy force was acting on it with the truck running forward the buoyancy force become larger and the acting point of the ground supporting force was finally moved to k2 and the hull body can rotate about it when the ground supporting force on k2 was disappeared if the point a a limiting point that allows the water reaching was not buried into water then the truck launched into water successfully based on above description the relationship between the buoyancy moment mb and the gravity moment mg should meet the following conditions 7 m b q x b m g w h sin α d cos α m g m b where q is the buoyancy force w is the gravity h is the height of barycenter d is the projection distance between the barycenter and the rear wheel center b is the buoyant center g is the barycenter xb and xg is the distance from point b and g to k2 from above analysis we can see that the full formed bow is conductive to increase the buoyancy and further promoting launch into water the coming ashore process can be divided into two phases as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 in the first stage the front wheel began to fall on the ramp the bow lifted and the stern was submerged into water the moment equation can be written as 8 w l i q l i r b h 2 p h 1 0 where r b is the water resistance p is the truck traction h1 and h2 is the height of acting point of traction force and water resistance in the process the truck is running forward at a constant speed thus we assume that r b h 2 p h 1 and r b p and then 9 w l i q l i this is the equilibrium conditions in first stage if the truck trim β is equal to the ramp angle α then it can entirely fall on the ramp fig 4 shows the second stage in coming ashore process according to the figure the motion equation can be written as 10 p ϕ w q cos α r f r b r i r f f w q cos α r i w q sin α where r f is the fraction resistance by ground r i is the ramp resistance ϕ and f are the attachment and resistance coefficient of the soil respectively the ramp angle can be obtained by 11 α arctan ϕ f for the known soil condition the ϕ and f are constant values for example in shoal area with the attachment coefficient ϕ 0 55 and resistance coefficient f 0 18 the ramp angle was calculated as α 20 30 3 models of the wheels and tracks the ground specific pressure of wheels gsp or tracks is an important parameter in measuring the pass ability of the amphibious truck on shoals in this study the tracks were designed to bear part of the truck weight and reduce the ground specific pressure there are two cases of the tracks in bearing weight i e passive bearing and active bearing therefore the ground specific pressure of wheels and tracks in above two cases was studied in the study of the gsp of the wheel it cannot be treated as a pure rigid body because slight deformation will occur when the wheel is in contact with the ground as depicted in fig 5 the deformation δ can be written as 12 δ c 1 w 0 85 b 0 0 7 d 0 43 p 1 0 9 k where c 1 is the wheel coefficient w is the loading on wheel b 0 is the wheel width d is the wheel diameter p 1 is the air pressure in the wheel k 0 015 b 0 0 42 for this truck the above parameters were known and the calculation process was not repeated here the touching length l width b was calculated by l 2 d δ d s b b 0 1 e t δ respectively and further the ground specific pressure p can be written as 13 p w 2 b 0 d 1 e k w 0 85 c 1 t b 0 0 7 d 0 43 p 1 0 9 k w 0 85 c 1 b 0 0 7 d 1 43 p 1 0 9 s where s and t represent the empirical constant respectively and set as s 0 557 t 122 7 for the tracks the deformation was too little to be ignored then the ground specific pressure p 14 p w l b where l and b are the length and width of the track which are known in the study for second case active bearing the track was controlled by the hydraulic cylinder to bear more load of the weight as depicted in fig 6 the equations can be written as 15 p 1 p 2 p 3 f g p 2 l 2 p 3 l 3 f l 4 g l δ 1 δ 3 δ 1 δ 2 l 3 l 2 where p1 p2 p3 and p4 are the load of 1st 2nd 3rd axle respectively f is the active bearing load of the track g is the truck weight l 2 l 3 and l 4 are the distance from 2nd 3rd and track axle to 1st axle δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 are the deformation quantity of 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th axle further the load of each axle was obtained 16 p 1 l 2 2 l 3 2 l l 2 l l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 w l 2 2 l 3 2 l 2 l 4 l 3 l 4 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 f p 2 l 3 2 2 l l 2 l l 3 l 2 l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 w l 3 2 2 l 2 l 4 l 2 l 4 l 3 l 4 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 f p 3 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l l 2 2 l l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 w l 2 2 2 l 3 l 4 l 2 l 4 l 2 l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 f fig 7 shows the gsp change with active bearing load of the track as depicted in the figure with f get larger the gsp of 3 axles decrease linearly the gsp comparison results of the two cases are listed in table 1 it is clear that the active bearing of the track can effectively reduce the gsp of the 3 axles therefore the pass ability of the amphibious truck on shoals is enhanced 4 cfd approach the cfd analysis was carried out prior to experimental tests the rans solver of siemens star ccm version 13 02 011 was employed to perform the simulation to catch the free surface between water and air user guide for star ccm the volume of fluid vof model was used the sst k ω turbulence model was applied considering the advantage in calculating viscous flow dong geun baek 2015 the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model was called and 2 dof pitch and heave was released to simulate the hydrodynamic performance in still water 4 1 geometric model and hydrostatics a 1 7 5 scaled physical model of a prototype was used in this research the lifted track was simplified as a block of the same size as depicted in fig 8 the detailed parameters of the amphibious truck were shown in table 2 4 2 governing equations the flow field around the amphibious truck is governed by the navier stokes equations the equations are expressed as 17 ρ t ρ u 0 18 ρ u t ρ u u p τ where ρ is the fluid density u is the velocity vector p is the pressure on infinitesimal surface τ is the shear force 4 3 descriptions of turbulence model and free surface the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model was applied in this simulation to calculate the strong adverse pressure gradient flow field and consider the impact of the shear force exerted by the wall song k w and guo c y et al 2019 the dissipation rate of turbulent flow equation can be written as 19 ρ x i ε u i x i γ ω ε x i α ω k g k ρ β i ω 2 2 1 f 1 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x i ω x i where k is the turbulent kinetic energy ε and ω are the dissipation rate γ ω μ μ t σ k g k ρ u i u j u j x i μ t ρ c μ k k 2 ε c μ 0 09 α 0 52 β i 0 072 f 1 tanh min max k 0 99 ω y 500 μ ρ y 2 ω 4 ρ σ ω 2 k c d k ω y 2 2 c d k ω max 2 ρ σ ω 2 ω k ω x j x j 10 20 σ ω 2 1 168 the vof method was employed to track the interface of two phases i e water and air in modelling truck motions the functions α w x y z t and α a x y z t was defined to represent the volume fraction of water and air in the computational domain the sum volume fraction of them is one i e 20 α w α a 1 where α w and α a is the volume fraction of water and air respectively there are three possibilities of their relationship in the computational domain that is α w 1 or α a 1 which indicates full water or air in the domain 0 α w 1 which indicates there is water air interface in the domain the governing differential equation of water volume fraction can be written as 21 α w t u i α w x i 0 the density and viscosity coefficient are the function of volume fraction and they are expressed as 22 ρ α w ρ w 1 α w ρ a μ α w μ w 1 α w μ a 4 4 wave generation and absorption method in numerical tank seakeeping performance is a crucial index for marine vehicles and it is more complicated for amphibious vehicles due to blunt configuration the cfd technique has been widely applied in the research of seakeeping performance which has high accuracy however the wave generation and absorption method are the core technique in simulations for viscous force based model not only the wave force and the nonlinear wave deformation but also the complex flow field near the marine structure can be obtained for this reason this paper proposed a mathematical model of numerical wave tank based on this model board wave maker is one of the most similar method to physical wave tank since the wave is generated due to the regular movement of the board in boundary the motion equation of the board can be expressed as 23 ξ t ξ 0 2 sin ω t where ξ 0 and ω are the movement amplitude and frequency of the board respectively for linear wave the wave profile can be written as 24 ζ ξ 0 2 4 sinh 2 c h 2 k h sinh 2 c h cos c x ω t n 1 4 sinh 2 μ n h 2 μ n h sinh 2 μ n h e μ n x sin ω t where h is the water depth c is the wave number μ n is defined in equation 25 25 c g tanh c h ω 2 0 μ n g tan μ n h ω 2 0 the second item in equation 24 will be damped to zero after the wave spread forward several times of depth therefore equation 24 can be simplified as 26 ζ ξ 0 2 4 sinh 2 c h 2 c h sinh 2 c h cos c ξ ω t in the meantime ζ satisfies ζ h 2 cos c ξ ω t where h is the wave height so ξ 0 can be solved by 27 ξ 0 h 2 c h sinh 2 c h 4 sinh 2 c h when the wave spread to outlet boundary or reflects to the vicinity of the wave making board it is necessary to absorb the wave for ensuring the accuracy the vertical velocity ζ in this zone is damped to ζ r by equation 28 ζ r x y z t ζ x y z t μ x z where μ x z is the damping function which is written as 29 μ x z α x x s x e x s 2 z b z z b z f s where x y z is any position in the damping zone x s and x e are the start and end position respectively z b and z fs are the bottom and surface position α is a control parameter 4 5 pre processing of simulation a virtual towing tank i e the computational domain was necessarily established for this simulation according to the research investigated by sun et al 2019 and considering the symmetry half of the amphibious truck was used for calculation and the middle longitudinal cross section was defined as symmetry plane wang et al 2015 the computational domain was set up with the size of 5 l b p 1 5 l b p 3 l b p length breadth height and for better view the mirror effect picture of domain is shown in fig 9 the inlet top bottom and side plane were set as velocity inlet to simulate the infinite far field boundary conditions and the outlet plane was set as pressure outlet song et al 2018 the velocity was set as the speed of this amphibious truck on water the truck surface was set as wall surface without slip condition the computational domain was meshed by the mesh generator in star ccm 13 02 011 overset mesh also known as chimera or overlapping mesh is a key solution developed by aerospace industry and now is extensive used in dealing with large relative motions with this method there is no modified or deformed mesh generated which is more flexible than conventional mesh the overset mesh typically consists of two regions that is the background region and overlap region the former is usually the computational domain adopted to the environment and the latter is a small region on the background region covering the largest position of the truck the overlapping region is a block surrounding the truck hull and can move together with the vehicle user guide for star ccm after creating the overset mesh the mesh cells in the computational domain can be divided into four types as depicted in fig 10 a the roles of them in the calculation is active cells the discretizing governing equations are solved in these cells donor cells they provide interpolation information to acceptor cells acceptor cells they receive the information from the donor cells passive cells there is no equations solved the operating principle of the overset mesh system is shown in fig 10 b star ccm overset mesh the data was transferred from overset mesh the red cell to background mesh the blue cell acceptor cells dotted line are used in providing information for active cells blue and orange the specific mesh information is given in fig 11 as shown in the figure the regions around the truck hull and water surface were finer with various sizes and a kelvin wave system was set up to obtain high quality grids miller et al 2014 referring to equation 30 k w song et al 2019 the wetted area of the truck was regard as a flat plate with an equal length and the boundary layer thickness can be estimated for modeling the prism layer in numerical research 30 δ x 0 37 re x 1 5 according to instructions by ittc 2014 the time step was set in the range of 0 005 0 01 l b p v as depicted in fig 13 the time step size was in the recommendation range at each f r the pressure based solver urans solver was selected in simulation the eulerian multiphase flow model volume of fluid model vof was employed in this simulation and a flat vof wave was established the vof scheme is implicit referring to previous studies sb 2010 terziev et al 2019 fig 12 shows the y distribution of the truck hull surface the figure shows that the ranges of the hull y is 0 120 in order to improve the computational efficiency the simulations were conducted on a workstation with 16 intel r cores running in 3 8 ghz the solver elapsed time per time step was 6 14s 5 experimental tests the model towed tests were conducted in a towing tank at shanghai ship and shipping research institute as shown in fig 14 the tank measures 192 m long 10 m wide and 4 3 m deep moreover equipped with a truss structured trailer which was manned controlled and can run up to 9 m s as depicted in fig 15 a 1 7 5 scaled model was manufactured with all the attachments installed including turnable buoyancy box bow plate simplified wheels and tracks the model was set as free to pitch and heave but fixed in sway roll and yaw all data were captured using the data acquisition and analysis system ni company usa all the tests were performed in calm water at the temperature of 15 c without any wind wave flow the hydrodynamic performance under different condition was tested in this research when full loaded the buoyancy boxes were expanded for getting more buoyancy alternatively when no loaded they were folded to reduce the resistance the bow plate was arranged at different angles with horizontal plane including 0 folded 20 and 25 the specific information was listed in table 3 in the following description the different conditions were represented by abbreviations further the model was towed with the velocity from 0 507 to 2 536 m s corresponding to the velocity from 5 to 25 km h of the prototype the length frouder number that is f r was used in this study sun et al 2020 which is expressed as 31 f r v g l b p where v is the velocity of the carriage g is the acceleration of gravity 6 results and discussions 6 1 validation and verification 6 1 1 mesh verification the mesh independent verification was conducted referring to the richard extrapolation method xing and stern 2010 four levels of grid g1 g2 g3 g4 were generated and the resistance values of them were denoted as s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 respectively the detailed information about the grids were listed in table 4 the errors between the simulations and experiments were less than 6 which indicates a high accuracy the convergence ratio was obtained by 32 r s f s m s m s c the estimated order of accuracy could be written as 33 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r for defining the distance from the solutions to asymptotic range the cf correction factor oberkampf et al 2002 was applied 34 c f r p r e 1 r p t h 1 the distance metric could be measured by 35 p p r e p t h where p th is the theoretical order of accuracy then the grid uncertainty was obtained by 36 u c f 9 6 1 c f 2 1 1 δ r e 0 875 c f 1 125 2 1 c f 1 δ r e 0 c f 0 875 o r c f 1 25 table 5 shows the results of the mesh convergence validation as shown in this table both the groups of grids exhibit a high accuracy the convergence ratio was less than 1 which indicates the mesh monotonic convergence as listed in table 5 the grid uncertainties associated with g1 g3 and g2 g4 are 1 15 and 1 74 of the experiment value overall the mesh uncertainty u cf was in the satisfactory range considering the results of table 4 g2 has a higher accuracy compared with g3 and g4 a little lower accuracy than g1 but the g1 needs more calculation time than g2 on the whole the parameters of g2 were applied in the following simulations 6 1 2 validation of total resistance the total resistance results of experimental tests and numerical simulation was shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the resistance trim and sinkage obtained by tests and cfd agree well with each other with an error of less than 8 this indicates that the method used in our research has high reliability fig 17 shows the waveforms of simulation and experimental test at different working conditions as shown in the figure one observation is that the waveforms from the cfd calculated shows high similar with experiments which further illustrate the results robustness another observation is that in condition a i e without bow plate the water piles up severely and the bow of the amphibious truck was almost entirely submerged this would lead to an impact on the driver s visual field after using the bow plate the problem was solved even if running at high velocity as depicted in condition e fig 17 6 1 3 uncertainty analysis of the experiments in the model towed tests there are many factors that affect the result accuracy measurement before analyzing the experiment uncertainty the model towed test procedure and deviation source should be illuminated as depicted in fig 18 there are mainly four kinds of deviation source as followings a geometric model deviation including deviation of draught wetted surface area length and so on b installation deviation including centerline alignment towed point setting and so on c apparatus deviation the measuring apparatus produces a direct deviation in the measurement results the deviation can be obtained by testing or experience d measuring results including random deviation and system deviation the total uncertainty of results usually consists deviation limit and precision limit if we define the resistance coefficient c t r 0 5 ρ v 2 s then the relationship between them is 37 u c t 2 b c t 2 p c t 2 b c t i c t x i b i p c t k s d e v m where u c t is the total uncertainty b c t and p c t is the deviation limit and precision limit of resistance coefficient respectively x i is the independent variable k 2 and m 5 sdev is the standard deviation b i is the deviation limit of the physical quantities by referring to the apparatus instruction and comprehensive analysis of the measurement system as listed in table 6 table 7 shows the experiment uncertainty results of resistance coefficient as shown in the table the ratio of total uncertainty and average coefficient is so small which indicate the results were in the acceptable accuracy range 6 2 resistance characteristics analysis fig 19 a shows the experimental resistance results at condition bpa 0 20 25 expanded under bpa 0 expanded condition a maximum speed the truck can reach is at f r 0 436 or else it would capsize at higher speed fig 20 therefore the bare truck was in poor stability and rapidity it can be obviously observed that after using the bow plate bpa 20 and bpa 25 both expanded the resistance is dramatically reduced compared with the bare hull bpa 0 expanded further for bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the bow plate angle has little influence on resistance when f r 0 581 however bpa 25 expanded has a slight advantage in reducing resistance when f r 0 581 similarly for bpa 0 20 25 folded the changing trends were almost identical to above analysis as depicted in fig 19 b regardless of whether the buoyancy boxes were expanded or not there was an approximate 3 resistance reduction rate of the 25 compared with the 20 bow plate fig 21 gives the resistance changes with the buoyancy boxes expanded or not at different bow plate angle as depicted in the figure the resistance has little difference under all conditions at f r 0 436 thus the typical values of resistance at f r 0 581 and f r 0 725 were analyzed as depicted in fig 22 the resistance value was smaller in bpa 20 folded compared with bpa 20 expanded at f r 0 581 nevertheless the situation was completely opposite at f r 0 725 the reason was that at f r 0 581 or lower speeds the expanded buoyancy boxes increased the wetted area therefore the frictional resistance was increased however at f r 0 725 or higher the proportion of residual resistance was increased in total resistance and the expanded buoyancy boxes can improve the flow field by covering part of the wheel cave which would reduce the residual resistance as shown in fig 22 it is under bpa 25 folded that resistance reaches a minimum value at f r 0 581 but under bpa 25 expanded at f r 0 725 this indicates that on the one hand at f r 0 581 or lower speeds it was under folded buoyancy boxes and plate angle of 25 that the truck were tend to have a smaller resistance at f r 0 725 or higher speeds it was under expanded buoyancy boxes and plate angle of 25 that was beneficial to resistance reduction on the other hand the buoyancy boxes had a greater impact on resistance than plate angle in fig 23 the wave patterns around the truck hull were compared at four conditions by cfd technique the wave pattern is actually the water surface deformation caused by the truck hull therefore higher wave elevation indicates higher wave resistance as depicted in this figure for bpa 20 expanded and bpa 20 folded the former has a smooth flow field while the latter has irregular broken waves around the middle part of the truck hull for bpa 25 expanded and bpa 25 expanded it is the same that is to say the expanded buoyancy boxes can improve the flow around the truck hull this can also explain why the buoyancy boxes can reduce the resistance at f r 0 725 or higher speeds 6 3 trim and sinkage fig 24 a shows the trim values of the truck obtained by experimental tests the trim was defined as positive when the truck bow rotates upward around y axis the figure indicates that for bpa 0 expanded and bpa 0 folded both are without bow plate the trim decreased less than zero with the velocity increasing and the water build up at the front of the truck until completely buried at f r 0 436 in all the towing tests when 0 145 f r 0 581 there is a smaller trim in bpa 20 expanded and bpa 20 folded this manifests that when 0 145 f r 0 581 no matter whether the buoyancy boxes were folded or not with the plate angle of 20 there is a 20 9 reduction rate of trim compared with the 25 plate angle fig 24 b gives the sinkage of the truck and it was defined as positive when the gravity center moving upward as can be seen in the figure there is an obvious difference at all conditions when f r 0 436 the sinkage reduced about 12 81 under bpa 25 folded compared with bpa 20 expanded which indicates that the folded buoyancy boxes can decrease the sinkage to obtain the pressure distribution characteristics of bow plates under different conditions the cloud contours were made using star ccm fig 25 shows the pressure coefficient distribution on bow plate under various conditions the pressure coefficient hyams et al 2011 m mansoori 2017 can be written as 38 c p p ρ g h 0 5 ρ v 2 where p is the absolute pressure ρ is the density of water h is the water depth and v is the truck velocity as shown in fig 25 with increasing of bow plate angle and the buoyancy boxes from expanded to folded the pressure increased at the below part of the bow plate this can explain why the trim was reduced about 20 9 under bpa 20 expanded compared with bpa 25 folded fig 26 shows the wetted area and flow lines around the truck hull at f r 0 725 as depicted in the figure in bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded the draught in stern is larger than bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the reason is that the expanded buoyancy boxes can provide additional force which is helpful in counteracting the trim moment while the stern sinkage is mainly caused by latter fig 27 under bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the flow lines are even and regular while under bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded are disorderly and irregularly this is consistent with the analysis of fig 23 fig 28 shows the different running states of the truck in the experimental test as shown in the figure when running in bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded the trim of the truck was significantly increased compared with bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded at f r 0 725 in addition after folding the buoyancy boxes the wave height around the hull body was decreased 6 4 hydrodynamic performance of the amphibious truck in regular head waves in order to research the seakeeping performance of this amphibious truck a target regular wave was established by cfd the wave amplitude and wave length is 0 08 m 4 m respectively fig 29 and wave period is 1 6 s the movement of wave maker board can be obtained by equation 27 fig 30 shows the resistance comparison of the amphibious truck running in regular head wave and calm water at bpa 25 expanded f r 0 581 the average value of resistance in calm water is about 44 2 n while in regular head wave the amplitude and mean resistance is 84 9 n and 61 6 n respectively that is to say the maximum and average added wave resistance ratio is 92 1 and 39 4 therefore when advancing in head wave the amphibious truck needs to enhance the thrust power to keep a constant speed fig 31 depicts the wave contours comparison of the amphibious truck advancing in head wave and calm water the trim in head wave is clearly larger than that in head wave besides the wake path line was not so obvious when advancing in head wave fig 32 gives the resistance results of the four conditions with the amphibious truck advancing in head wave it is clear that under bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the peak values were less than bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded although the minimum value was larger that is to say the fluctuation range of the resistance can be decreased by the buoyancy box fig 33 shows the navigation attitude of the amphibious truck advancing in head wave as depicted in the figure there is little gap between bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded for bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded it is the same however the difference between bpa 20 expanded and bpa 20 folded bpa 25 expanded and bpa 25 folded is obvious this indicates that the bow plate angle has little impact but the buoyancy box has a distinct effect on the navigation attitude when advancing in head wave the expanded buoyancy box can help to decrease the trim peak value which is beneficial to improve the truck running stability the expanded buoyancy box increases the buoyancy so the draught is decreased and the sinkage peak value is increased 7 conclusions in this study the hydrodynamic performance of a blended wheel track amphibious truck was investigated experimentally and numerically in addition the track plays an important role in enhancing the passbility of this amphibious truck by actively bearing part of the load the influence of buoyancy boxes and bow plate was studied the research reveals that 1 the expanded buoyancy boxes can increase the resistance at lower f r but decrease resistance at higher f r the installation of bow plate can effectively decrease the resistance compared with the bare truck regardless of whether the buoyancy boxes were expanded or not there was a 3 resistance reduction rate of the 25 bow plate angle compared with 20 in general the buoyancy boxes had more influence on resistance than bow plate angle 2 the bow plate can significantly improve the problem of bow submerged and water build up without it the truck cannot run over 15 km h corresponding to f r 0 436 in terms of trim controlling the 20 plate angle has obvious advantage compared with 25 3 the expanded buoyancy boxes can increase the sinkage when the truck was equipped with a bow plate of 25 the expanded buoyancy boxes lead to a sinkage increasement about 12 81 the bow plate had no obvious regular influence on sinkage 4 the bow plate has little influence on the seakeeping performance the buoyancy box can decrease the fluctuation range of the resistance and improve the truck running

20865,the hydrodynamic characteristics of a blended wheel track amphibious truck were studied via model towed tests and numerical simulations first the mathematical model was set up and the process of launching and coming ashore was researched by theoretical analysis the effect of tracks on assisting driving the truck on land was also studied second the influence of buoyancy boxes and bow plate on resistance trim and sinkage was investigated by towing tank tests and simulation the buoyancy boxes were designed to get more buoyancy force and the bow plate was installed to prevent the bow submerged the expanded buoyancy boxes could increase the resistance at f r 0 581 but decrease the resistance at f r 0 725 in addition the sinkage was also increased the installation of bow plate could reduce the resistance significantly when f r 0 436 and with the angle of 25 there was an approximately 3 resistance reduction rate compared with the 20 bow plate moreover the trim was reduced 20 9 with the bow plate angle of 20 and the pressure distribution on the bow plate at various conditions also confirms this result finally a numerical wave tank was set up and the seakeeping performance of

for many years incoul et al 2014 when running on land it is almost the same as a regular assault however the condition is quite complicated when navigating on water considering the passing ability and delivery capacity on land the amphibious vehicles are usually designed as a box shape which belongs to a blunt structure and gives a poor hydrodynamic performance in addition the wheels or tracks system are not beneficial for a formation of smoothed streamlined although they are usually lifted on water the towing tank test is a classic experimental method in the assessment of marine vehicle hydrodynamic performance delen and bal 2015 hou et al 2020 lee et al 2017 tae young et al 2005 helvacioglu et al 2011 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of an amphibious armored personnel carrier using model towed tests the water build up was serious in bow so a head plate was applied to solve this problem in addition the plate works in trim controlling and resistance reduction wang et al 2020 researched the hydrodynamic performance of a double carriage amphibious vehicle by towing tests and numerical simulations the results showed that these simulations had a high accuracy compared with experiments in addition in the process of ship design and research the model towed test is essential for example the resistance of a ship in small ice floes was studied using experimental tests zong et al 2020 some artificial ice floes made of materials were used instead of refrigerated model ice and the resistance results proved that this method was feasible recently with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd the accuracy of marine vehicle motion and hydrodynamic performance calculation have been greatly improved besides high performance computers are widely used and the costs are becoming lower a prediction method of wave resistance was presented based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans kinaci et al 2015 and it was validated by model tests and cfd technique the hydrodynamic performance of a planning hull was studied using cfd method sukas et al 2017 and the overset grid was implemented to get a better solution of complex fluid structure interaction they found that the trim and resistance increase with frouder number until the vehicle entering planning mode the cfd method used in this study exhibited satisfactory results ju et al 2015 investigated the relationship of trim and resistance using cfx software the results showed that the trim impact on resistance was more obvious with speed increase mousaviraad et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of high speed planning hulls in head waves and calm water using cfd technique the mean and amplitude of resistance heave pitch and acceleration were analyzed payam lotfi et al 2015 presented a method to study the pitch and heave of a steeped planning hulls in simulation the lift resistance and trim angle were calculated and compared with empirical equations previous researches had mainly focused on research of traditional marine vehicles yet few were related to new type amphibious vehicles in this study the research object was a blended wheel track amphibious truck which is a novel special marine vehicle two turnable buoyancy boxes were designed to get more buoyancy force under the circumstance of full load on water as depicted in fig 1 when the truck is sailing on water the wheels and tracks are lifted up as much as possible the turnable buoyancy boxes on both sides and bow plate are expanded to help the truck to work as a cargo ship by contrast when coming ashore or on land the wheels and tracks are put down the turnable buoyancy boxes and bow plate are folded to work as a truck moreover the configuration of the truck was a box shape which presented a large difference compared with conventional ships therefore relying solely on cfd technique to investigate the hydrodynamic performance has significant uncertainties in order to guarantee the calculation accuracy in the meantime considering the costs the cfd approach was applied combined with model towed tests furthermore a bow plate was used for solving the problem of bow submerged this research aims to solve the lack of references related to blended wheel track amphibious truck with box shape and try to predict the hydrodynamic performance of this new type marine vehicle 2 theoretical model of launching and coming ashore launching and coming ashore are common scenes for amphibious truck however this process is too complicated and hard to simulate by using any kind of software alone to address this problem the theoretical model was set up to study the launching and coming ashore process as depicted in fig 2 when the bow entering the water a buoyancy force was acting on it with the truck running forward the buoyancy force become larger and the acting point of the ground supporting force was finally moved to k2 and the hull body can rotate about it when the ground supporting force on k2 was disappeared if the point a a limiting point that allows the water reaching was not buried into water then the truck launched into water successfully based on above description the relationship between the buoyancy moment mb and the gravity moment mg should meet the following conditions 7 m b q x b m g w h sin α d cos α m g m b where q is the buoyancy force w is the gravity h is the height of barycenter d is the projection distance between the barycenter and the rear wheel center b is the buoyant center g is the barycenter xb and xg is the distance from point b and g to k2 from above analysis we can see that the full formed bow is conductive to increase the buoyancy and further promoting launch into water the coming ashore process can be divided into two phases as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 in the first stage the front wheel began to fall on the ramp the bow lifted and the stern was submerged into water the moment equation can be written as 8 w l i q l i r b h 2 p h 1 0 where r b is the water resistance p is the truck traction h1 and h2 is the height of acting point of traction force and water resistance in the process the truck is running forward at a constant speed thus we assume that r b h 2 p h 1 and r b p and then 9 w l i q l i this is the equilibrium conditions in first stage if the truck trim β is equal to the ramp angle α then it can entirely fall on the ramp fig 4 shows the second stage in coming ashore process according to the figure the motion equation can be written as 10 p ϕ w q cos α r f r b r i r f f w q cos α r i w q sin α where r f is the fraction resistance by ground r i is the ramp resistance ϕ and f are the attachment and resistance coefficient of the soil respectively the ramp angle can be obtained by 11 α arctan ϕ f for the known soil condition the ϕ and f are constant values for example in shoal area with the attachment coefficient ϕ 0 55 and resistance coefficient f 0 18 the ramp angle was calculated as α 20 30 3 models of the wheels and tracks the ground specific pressure of wheels gsp or tracks is an important parameter in measuring the pass ability of the amphibious truck on shoals in this study the tracks were designed to bear part of the truck weight and reduce the ground specific pressure there are two cases of the tracks in bearing weight i e passive bearing and active bearing therefore the ground specific pressure of wheels and tracks in above two cases was studied in the study of the gsp of the wheel it cannot be treated as a pure rigid body because slight deformation will occur when the wheel is in contact with the ground as depicted in fig 5 the deformation δ can be written as 12 δ c 1 w 0 85 b 0 0 7 d 0 43 p 1 0 9 k where c 1 is the wheel coefficient w is the loading on wheel b 0 is the wheel width d is the wheel diameter p 1 is the air pressure in the wheel k 0 015 b 0 0 42 for this truck the above parameters were known and the calculation process was not repeated here the touching length l width b was calculated by l 2 d δ d s b b 0 1 e t δ respectively and further the ground specific pressure p can be written as 13 p w 2 b 0 d 1 e k w 0 85 c 1 t b 0 0 7 d 0 43 p 1 0 9 k w 0 85 c 1 b 0 0 7 d 1 43 p 1 0 9 s where s and t represent the empirical constant respectively and set as s 0 557 t 122 7 for the tracks the deformation was too little to be ignored then the ground specific pressure p 14 p w l b where l and b are the length and width of the track which are known in the study for second case active bearing the track was controlled by the hydraulic cylinder to bear more load of the weight as depicted in fig 6 the equations can be written as 15 p 1 p 2 p 3 f g p 2 l 2 p 3 l 3 f l 4 g l δ 1 δ 3 δ 1 δ 2 l 3 l 2 where p1 p2 p3 and p4 are the load of 1st 2nd 3rd axle respectively f is the active bearing load of the track g is the truck weight l 2 l 3 and l 4 are the distance from 2nd 3rd and track axle to 1st axle δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 are the deformation quantity of 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th axle further the load of each axle was obtained 16 p 1 l 2 2 l 3 2 l l 2 l l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 w l 2 2 l 3 2 l 2 l 4 l 3 l 4 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 f p 2 l 3 2 2 l l 2 l l 3 l 2 l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 w l 3 2 2 l 2 l 4 l 2 l 4 l 3 l 4 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 f p 3 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l l 2 2 l l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 w l 2 2 2 l 3 l 4 l 2 l 4 l 2 l 3 2 l 2 2 l 2 l 3 l 3 2 f fig 7 shows the gsp change with active bearing load of the track as depicted in the figure with f get larger the gsp of 3 axles decrease linearly the gsp comparison results of the two cases are listed in table 1 it is clear that the active bearing of the track can effectively reduce the gsp of the 3 axles therefore the pass ability of the amphibious truck on shoals is enhanced 4 cfd approach the cfd analysis was carried out prior to experimental tests the rans solver of siemens star ccm version 13 02 011 was employed to perform the simulation to catch the free surface between water and air user guide for star ccm the volume of fluid vof model was used the sst k ω turbulence model was applied considering the advantage in calculating viscous flow dong geun baek 2015 the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model was called and 2 dof pitch and heave was released to simulate the hydrodynamic performance in still water 4 1 geometric model and hydrostatics a 1 7 5 scaled physical model of a prototype was used in this research the lifted track was simplified as a block of the same size as depicted in fig 8 the detailed parameters of the amphibious truck were shown in table 2 4 2 governing equations the flow field around the amphibious truck is governed by the navier stokes equations the equations are expressed as 17 ρ t ρ u 0 18 ρ u t ρ u u p τ where ρ is the fluid density u is the velocity vector p is the pressure on infinitesimal surface τ is the shear force 4 3 descriptions of turbulence model and free surface the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model was applied in this simulation to calculate the strong adverse pressure gradient flow field and consider the impact of the shear force exerted by the wall song k w and guo c y et al 2019 the dissipation rate of turbulent flow equation can be written as 19 ρ x i ε u i x i γ ω ε x i α ω k g k ρ β i ω 2 2 1 f 1 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k x i ω x i where k is the turbulent kinetic energy ε and ω are the dissipation rate γ ω μ μ t σ k g k ρ u i u j u j x i μ t ρ c μ k k 2 ε c μ 0 09 α 0 52 β i 0 072 f 1 tanh min max k 0 99 ω y 500 μ ρ y 2 ω 4 ρ σ ω 2 k c d k ω y 2 2 c d k ω max 2 ρ σ ω 2 ω k ω x j x j 10 20 σ ω 2 1 168 the vof method was employed to track the interface of two phases i e water and air in modelling truck motions the functions α w x y z t and α a x y z t was defined to represent the volume fraction of water and air in the computational domain the sum volume fraction of them is one i e 20 α w α a 1 where α w and α a is the volume fraction of water and air respectively there are three possibilities of their relationship in the computational domain that is α w 1 or α a 1 which indicates full water or air in the domain 0 α w 1 which indicates there is water air interface in the domain the governing differential equation of water volume fraction can be written as 21 α w t u i α w x i 0 the density and viscosity coefficient are the function of volume fraction and they are expressed as 22 ρ α w ρ w 1 α w ρ a μ α w μ w 1 α w μ a 4 4 wave generation and absorption method in numerical tank seakeeping performance is a crucial index for marine vehicles and it is more complicated for amphibious vehicles due to blunt configuration the cfd technique has been widely applied in the research of seakeeping performance which has high accuracy however the wave generation and absorption method are the core technique in simulations for viscous force based model not only the wave force and the nonlinear wave deformation but also the complex flow field near the marine structure can be obtained for this reason this paper proposed a mathematical model of numerical wave tank based on this model board wave maker is one of the most similar method to physical wave tank since the wave is generated due to the regular movement of the board in boundary the motion equation of the board can be expressed as 23 ξ t ξ 0 2 sin ω t where ξ 0 and ω are the movement amplitude and frequency of the board respectively for linear wave the wave profile can be written as 24 ζ ξ 0 2 4 sinh 2 c h 2 k h sinh 2 c h cos c x ω t n 1 4 sinh 2 μ n h 2 μ n h sinh 2 μ n h e μ n x sin ω t where h is the water depth c is the wave number μ n is defined in equation 25 25 c g tanh c h ω 2 0 μ n g tan μ n h ω 2 0 the second item in equation 24 will be damped to zero after the wave spread forward several times of depth therefore equation 24 can be simplified as 26 ζ ξ 0 2 4 sinh 2 c h 2 c h sinh 2 c h cos c ξ ω t in the meantime ζ satisfies ζ h 2 cos c ξ ω t where h is the wave height so ξ 0 can be solved by 27 ξ 0 h 2 c h sinh 2 c h 4 sinh 2 c h when the wave spread to outlet boundary or reflects to the vicinity of the wave making board it is necessary to absorb the wave for ensuring the accuracy the vertical velocity ζ in this zone is damped to ζ r by equation 28 ζ r x y z t ζ x y z t μ x z where μ x z is the damping function which is written as 29 μ x z α x x s x e x s 2 z b z z b z f s where x y z is any position in the damping zone x s and x e are the start and end position respectively z b and z fs are the bottom and surface position α is a control parameter 4 5 pre processing of simulation a virtual towing tank i e the computational domain was necessarily established for this simulation according to the research investigated by sun et al 2019 and considering the symmetry half of the amphibious truck was used for calculation and the middle longitudinal cross section was defined as symmetry plane wang et al 2015 the computational domain was set up with the size of 5 l b p 1 5 l b p 3 l b p length breadth height and for better view the mirror effect picture of domain is shown in fig 9 the inlet top bottom and side plane were set as velocity inlet to simulate the infinite far field boundary conditions and the outlet plane was set as pressure outlet song et al 2018 the velocity was set as the speed of this amphibious truck on water the truck surface was set as wall surface without slip condition the computational domain was meshed by the mesh generator in star ccm 13 02 011 overset mesh also known as chimera or overlapping mesh is a key solution developed by aerospace industry and now is extensive used in dealing with large relative motions with this method there is no modified or deformed mesh generated which is more flexible than conventional mesh the overset mesh typically consists of two regions that is the background region and overlap region the former is usually the computational domain adopted to the environment and the latter is a small region on the background region covering the largest position of the truck the overlapping region is a block surrounding the truck hull and can move together with the vehicle user guide for star ccm after creating the overset mesh the mesh cells in the computational domain can be divided into four types as depicted in fig 10 a the roles of them in the calculation is active cells the discretizing governing equations are solved in these cells donor cells they provide interpolation information to acceptor cells acceptor cells they receive the information from the donor cells passive cells there is no equations solved the operating principle of the overset mesh system is shown in fig 10 b star ccm overset mesh the data was transferred from overset mesh the red cell to background mesh the blue cell acceptor cells dotted line are used in providing information for active cells blue and orange the specific mesh information is given in fig 11 as shown in the figure the regions around the truck hull and water surface were finer with various sizes and a kelvin wave system was set up to obtain high quality grids miller et al 2014 referring to equation 30 k w song et al 2019 the wetted area of the truck was regard as a flat plate with an equal length and the boundary layer thickness can be estimated for modeling the prism layer in numerical research 30 δ x 0 37 re x 1 5 according to instructions by ittc 2014 the time step was set in the range of 0 005 0 01 l b p v as depicted in fig 13 the time step size was in the recommendation range at each f r the pressure based solver urans solver was selected in simulation the eulerian multiphase flow model volume of fluid model vof was employed in this simulation and a flat vof wave was established the vof scheme is implicit referring to previous studies sb 2010 terziev et al 2019 fig 12 shows the y distribution of the truck hull surface the figure shows that the ranges of the hull y is 0 120 in order to improve the computational efficiency the simulations were conducted on a workstation with 16 intel r cores running in 3 8 ghz the solver elapsed time per time step was 6 14s 5 experimental tests the model towed tests were conducted in a towing tank at shanghai ship and shipping research institute as shown in fig 14 the tank measures 192 m long 10 m wide and 4 3 m deep moreover equipped with a truss structured trailer which was manned controlled and can run up to 9 m s as depicted in fig 15 a 1 7 5 scaled model was manufactured with all the attachments installed including turnable buoyancy box bow plate simplified wheels and tracks the model was set as free to pitch and heave but fixed in sway roll and yaw all data were captured using the data acquisition and analysis system ni company usa all the tests were performed in calm water at the temperature of 15 c without any wind wave flow the hydrodynamic performance under different condition was tested in this research when full loaded the buoyancy boxes were expanded for getting more buoyancy alternatively when no loaded they were folded to reduce the resistance the bow plate was arranged at different angles with horizontal plane including 0 folded 20 and 25 the specific information was listed in table 3 in the following description the different conditions were represented by abbreviations further the model was towed with the velocity from 0 507 to 2 536 m s corresponding to the velocity from 5 to 25 km h of the prototype the length frouder number that is f r was used in this study sun et al 2020 which is expressed as 31 f r v g l b p where v is the velocity of the carriage g is the acceleration of gravity 6 results and discussions 6 1 validation and verification 6 1 1 mesh verification the mesh independent verification was conducted referring to the richard extrapolation method xing and stern 2010 four levels of grid g1 g2 g3 g4 were generated and the resistance values of them were denoted as s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 respectively the detailed information about the grids were listed in table 4 the errors between the simulations and experiments were less than 6 which indicates a high accuracy the convergence ratio was obtained by 32 r s f s m s m s c the estimated order of accuracy could be written as 33 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r for defining the distance from the solutions to asymptotic range the cf correction factor oberkampf et al 2002 was applied 34 c f r p r e 1 r p t h 1 the distance metric could be measured by 35 p p r e p t h where p th is the theoretical order of accuracy then the grid uncertainty was obtained by 36 u c f 9 6 1 c f 2 1 1 δ r e 0 875 c f 1 125 2 1 c f 1 δ r e 0 c f 0 875 o r c f 1 25 table 5 shows the results of the mesh convergence validation as shown in this table both the groups of grids exhibit a high accuracy the convergence ratio was less than 1 which indicates the mesh monotonic convergence as listed in table 5 the grid uncertainties associated with g1 g3 and g2 g4 are 1 15 and 1 74 of the experiment value overall the mesh uncertainty u cf was in the satisfactory range considering the results of table 4 g2 has a higher accuracy compared with g3 and g4 a little lower accuracy than g1 but the g1 needs more calculation time than g2 on the whole the parameters of g2 were applied in the following simulations 6 1 2 validation of total resistance the total resistance results of experimental tests and numerical simulation was shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the resistance trim and sinkage obtained by tests and cfd agree well with each other with an error of less than 8 this indicates that the method used in our research has high reliability fig 17 shows the waveforms of simulation and experimental test at different working conditions as shown in the figure one observation is that the waveforms from the cfd calculated shows high similar with experiments which further illustrate the results robustness another observation is that in condition a i e without bow plate the water piles up severely and the bow of the amphibious truck was almost entirely submerged this would lead to an impact on the driver s visual field after using the bow plate the problem was solved even if running at high velocity as depicted in condition e fig 17 6 1 3 uncertainty analysis of the experiments in the model towed tests there are many factors that affect the result accuracy measurement before analyzing the experiment uncertainty the model towed test procedure and deviation source should be illuminated as depicted in fig 18 there are mainly four kinds of deviation source as followings a geometric model deviation including deviation of draught wetted surface area length and so on b installation deviation including centerline alignment towed point setting and so on c apparatus deviation the measuring apparatus produces a direct deviation in the measurement results the deviation can be obtained by testing or experience d measuring results including random deviation and system deviation the total uncertainty of results usually consists deviation limit and precision limit if we define the resistance coefficient c t r 0 5 ρ v 2 s then the relationship between them is 37 u c t 2 b c t 2 p c t 2 b c t i c t x i b i p c t k s d e v m where u c t is the total uncertainty b c t and p c t is the deviation limit and precision limit of resistance coefficient respectively x i is the independent variable k 2 and m 5 sdev is the standard deviation b i is the deviation limit of the physical quantities by referring to the apparatus instruction and comprehensive analysis of the measurement system as listed in table 6 table 7 shows the experiment uncertainty results of resistance coefficient as shown in the table the ratio of total uncertainty and average coefficient is so small which indicate the results were in the acceptable accuracy range 6 2 resistance characteristics analysis fig 19 a shows the experimental resistance results at condition bpa 0 20 25 expanded under bpa 0 expanded condition a maximum speed the truck can reach is at f r 0 436 or else it would capsize at higher speed fig 20 therefore the bare truck was in poor stability and rapidity it can be obviously observed that after using the bow plate bpa 20 and bpa 25 both expanded the resistance is dramatically reduced compared with the bare hull bpa 0 expanded further for bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the bow plate angle has little influence on resistance when f r 0 581 however bpa 25 expanded has a slight advantage in reducing resistance when f r 0 581 similarly for bpa 0 20 25 folded the changing trends were almost identical to above analysis as depicted in fig 19 b regardless of whether the buoyancy boxes were expanded or not there was an approximate 3 resistance reduction rate of the 25 compared with the 20 bow plate fig 21 gives the resistance changes with the buoyancy boxes expanded or not at different bow plate angle as depicted in the figure the resistance has little difference under all conditions at f r 0 436 thus the typical values of resistance at f r 0 581 and f r 0 725 were analyzed as depicted in fig 22 the resistance value was smaller in bpa 20 folded compared with bpa 20 expanded at f r 0 581 nevertheless the situation was completely opposite at f r 0 725 the reason was that at f r 0 581 or lower speeds the expanded buoyancy boxes increased the wetted area therefore the frictional resistance was increased however at f r 0 725 or higher the proportion of residual resistance was increased in total resistance and the expanded buoyancy boxes can improve the flow field by covering part of the wheel cave which would reduce the residual resistance as shown in fig 22 it is under bpa 25 folded that resistance reaches a minimum value at f r 0 581 but under bpa 25 expanded at f r 0 725 this indicates that on the one hand at f r 0 581 or lower speeds it was under folded buoyancy boxes and plate angle of 25 that the truck were tend to have a smaller resistance at f r 0 725 or higher speeds it was under expanded buoyancy boxes and plate angle of 25 that was beneficial to resistance reduction on the other hand the buoyancy boxes had a greater impact on resistance than plate angle in fig 23 the wave patterns around the truck hull were compared at four conditions by cfd technique the wave pattern is actually the water surface deformation caused by the truck hull therefore higher wave elevation indicates higher wave resistance as depicted in this figure for bpa 20 expanded and bpa 20 folded the former has a smooth flow field while the latter has irregular broken waves around the middle part of the truck hull for bpa 25 expanded and bpa 25 expanded it is the same that is to say the expanded buoyancy boxes can improve the flow around the truck hull this can also explain why the buoyancy boxes can reduce the resistance at f r 0 725 or higher speeds 6 3 trim and sinkage fig 24 a shows the trim values of the truck obtained by experimental tests the trim was defined as positive when the truck bow rotates upward around y axis the figure indicates that for bpa 0 expanded and bpa 0 folded both are without bow plate the trim decreased less than zero with the velocity increasing and the water build up at the front of the truck until completely buried at f r 0 436 in all the towing tests when 0 145 f r 0 581 there is a smaller trim in bpa 20 expanded and bpa 20 folded this manifests that when 0 145 f r 0 581 no matter whether the buoyancy boxes were folded or not with the plate angle of 20 there is a 20 9 reduction rate of trim compared with the 25 plate angle fig 24 b gives the sinkage of the truck and it was defined as positive when the gravity center moving upward as can be seen in the figure there is an obvious difference at all conditions when f r 0 436 the sinkage reduced about 12 81 under bpa 25 folded compared with bpa 20 expanded which indicates that the folded buoyancy boxes can decrease the sinkage to obtain the pressure distribution characteristics of bow plates under different conditions the cloud contours were made using star ccm fig 25 shows the pressure coefficient distribution on bow plate under various conditions the pressure coefficient hyams et al 2011 m mansoori 2017 can be written as 38 c p p ρ g h 0 5 ρ v 2 where p is the absolute pressure ρ is the density of water h is the water depth and v is the truck velocity as shown in fig 25 with increasing of bow plate angle and the buoyancy boxes from expanded to folded the pressure increased at the below part of the bow plate this can explain why the trim was reduced about 20 9 under bpa 20 expanded compared with bpa 25 folded fig 26 shows the wetted area and flow lines around the truck hull at f r 0 725 as depicted in the figure in bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded the draught in stern is larger than bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the reason is that the expanded buoyancy boxes can provide additional force which is helpful in counteracting the trim moment while the stern sinkage is mainly caused by latter fig 27 under bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the flow lines are even and regular while under bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded are disorderly and irregularly this is consistent with the analysis of fig 23 fig 28 shows the different running states of the truck in the experimental test as shown in the figure when running in bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded the trim of the truck was significantly increased compared with bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded at f r 0 725 in addition after folding the buoyancy boxes the wave height around the hull body was decreased 6 4 hydrodynamic performance of the amphibious truck in regular head waves in order to research the seakeeping performance of this amphibious truck a target regular wave was established by cfd the wave amplitude and wave length is 0 08 m 4 m respectively fig 29 and wave period is 1 6 s the movement of wave maker board can be obtained by equation 27 fig 30 shows the resistance comparison of the amphibious truck running in regular head wave and calm water at bpa 25 expanded f r 0 581 the average value of resistance in calm water is about 44 2 n while in regular head wave the amplitude and mean resistance is 84 9 n and 61 6 n respectively that is to say the maximum and average added wave resistance ratio is 92 1 and 39 4 therefore when advancing in head wave the amphibious truck needs to enhance the thrust power to keep a constant speed fig 31 depicts the wave contours comparison of the amphibious truck advancing in head wave and calm water the trim in head wave is clearly larger than that in head wave besides the wake path line was not so obvious when advancing in head wave fig 32 gives the resistance results of the four conditions with the amphibious truck advancing in head wave it is clear that under bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded the peak values were less than bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded although the minimum value was larger that is to say the fluctuation range of the resistance can be decreased by the buoyancy box fig 33 shows the navigation attitude of the amphibious truck advancing in head wave as depicted in the figure there is little gap between bpa 20 expanded and bpa 25 expanded for bpa 20 folded and bpa 25 folded it is the same however the difference between bpa 20 expanded and bpa 20 folded bpa 25 expanded and bpa 25 folded is obvious this indicates that the bow plate angle has little impact but the buoyancy box has a distinct effect on the navigation attitude when advancing in head wave the expanded buoyancy box can help to decrease the trim peak value which is beneficial to improve the truck running stability the expanded buoyancy box increases the buoyancy so the draught is decreased and the sinkage peak value is increased 7 conclusions in this study the hydrodynamic performance of a blended wheel track amphibious truck was investigated experimentally and numerically in addition the track plays an important role in enhancing the passbility of this amphibious truck by actively bearing part of the load the influence of buoyancy boxes and bow plate was studied the research reveals that 1 the expanded buoyancy boxes can increase the resistance at lower f r but decrease resistance at higher f r the installation of bow plate can effectively decrease the resistance compared with the bare truck regardless of whether the buoyancy boxes were expanded or not there was a 3 resistance reduction rate of the 25 bow plate angle compared with 20 in general the buoyancy boxes had more influence on resistance than bow plate angle 2 the bow plate can significantly improve the problem of bow submerged and water build up without it the truck cannot run over 15 km h corresponding to f r 0 436 in terms of trim controlling the 20 plate angle has obvious advantage compared with 25 3 the expanded buoyancy boxes can increase the sinkage when the truck was equipped with a bow plate of 25 the expanded buoyancy boxes lead to a sinkage increasement about 12 81 the bow plate had no obvious regular influence on sinkage 4 the bow plate has little influence on the seakeeping performance the buoyancy box can decrease the fluctuation range of the resistance and improve the truck running

20866,the helicopter ship dynamic interface is the environment above the landing deck of a ship where a helicopter pilot has to control the aircraft while contending with a moving deck and an unsteady airflow known as the ship airwake research into understanding this environment has included modelling the airwake using wind tunnel studies and computational fluid dynamics and has often used the simple frigate shape sfs a generic ship geometry representative of a naval frigate this paper reviews the contribution that the sfs has made to research into the helicopter ship dynamic interface and introduces a new ship geometry for future research the new ship developed within a nato research task group is the nato generic destroyer nato gd a concept ship with a simplified geometry that is more representative of a modern helicopter enabled combat ship with a stealthy superstructure as well as introducing the nato gd as a common platform for research the paper also introduces a number of ship motion profiles to encourage new research that will include the effect of ship motion on the airwake it is anticipated that future research on a common ship with prescribed motion and adopting a common helicopter will lead to improved or new modelling methodologies keywords airwake ship helicopter cfd wind tunnel shol 1 introduction there has been a considerable international research effort for many years into understanding modelling and simulating the helicopter ship dynamic interface i e the flying environment around the landing deck of a ship in which a maritime helicopter will operate shukla et al 2019 owen et al 2017 the research has been aimed at developing a better understanding of the dynamic interface the modelling of the ship airwake and the modelling of a helicopter operating in that environment the landing deck of a ship presents one of the most challenging environments for a helicopter pilot single spot ships such as frigates and destroyers have a restricted landing area on a pitching rolling and heaving deck above which the pilot has also to contend with the presence of a highly dynamic airflow this phenomenon known as the ship airwake is caused by the air flowing over and around the ship s superstructure as a result of the combined effect of the prevailing wind and the forward motion of the ship the maritime helicopter regarded as one of the most important tactical systems on the ship is used to perform a variety of different roles including anti submarine warfare surveillance troop transfer and supply replenishment at sea the challenge of landing the helicopter in bad weather is acknowledged as being both demanding and dangerous moreover if the flying conditions are too difficult the helicopter will not be cleared to take off and an important component of the ship s capability will be lost lumsden et al 1998 whether or not the helicopter is cleared for take off is determined by the ship helicopter operating limits or shol an example of a shol diagram for a uk port side landing approach is shown in fig 1 extracted from hodge et al 2012 the shol is an envelope of limiting wind speeds and directions relative to the ship for a given helicopter type and mass operating to a particular ship with specified limits for acceptable deck motion the red and green winds denoted in fig 1 are respectively naval terminology for winds approaching from port and starboard shol envelopes are normally determined through sea trials where test pilots fly repeated launch and recovery missions for as wide a range of relative wind conditions as possible to determine the safe operating limits for an average fleet pilot research and technology organisation rto 2003 a major aim of the ongoing research into the helicopter ship dynamic interface is to develop modelling and simulation tools to support and inform the shol trials which are costly and time consuming in 1987 healey 1987 identified the difficulty of clearing the growing number of us navy helicopters to their ships and he articulated the possibility of using flight simulation to support the clearance process healey identified several technical challenges such as modelling the ship motion the ship airwake and the helicopter dynamics in 1992 he made the case for establishing a database of computational fluid dynamics cfd generated ship airwakes for use in flight simulators healey 1992 at the time cfd capability and computing resources were limited but the challenge had been made to the aerodynamics community during the 1990s the technical co operation programme ttcp a collaboration between in this case australia canada the uk and the us established a research programme to develop the potential for simulating the helicopter ship dynamic interface and had identified modelling the ship airwake and its effect on helicopter performance as one of the most significant technical challenges wilkinson et al 1998 finlay 2001 from this collaboration a simplified ship geometry known as the simple frigate shape sfs was defined for experimentalists and cfd modellers to generate and compare ship airwakes the sfs was and continues to be used by researchers across the world to validate simulation tools critical to the investigation of the helicopter ship dynamic interface a new international collaboration undertaken as a nato research task group avt 315 comparative assessment of modelling and simulation methods of shipboard launch and recovery of helicopters was established in 2019 to build on the significant progress that had been made in simulating the ship helicopter dynamic interface to this end a new generic ship geometry has been proposed to reflect better the design of frigates and destroyers that are now entering service with bulkier more angular and less fragmented superstructures the ship is known as the nato generic destroyer nato gd and was designed by defence research and development canada drdc atlantic for research purposes the member nations involved in avt 315 are canada france greece netherlands uk and the us as well as australia as a nato partner the research organisations include government research laboratories industry and universities the research organisations will apply their own modelling and simulation methods to the nato gd and a new challenge in this research will be to add ship motion to the cfd and experimental modelling the research will not just be concerned with the ship airwake but also with how the airwake and the ship motion will affect a helicopter operating to the ship the purpose of this paper is to briefly review the research that has been undertaken using the sfs and to introduce the nato gd and the ship motion profiles that have been specified for the nato research programme the overall aim of avt 315 and the nato gd is to build on the highly successful research stimulus that the sfs provided but with a more realistic ship and a more demanding set of conditions for the international community of computational and experimental modellers while there have been numerous research projects and publications on the helicopter ship dynamic interface this paper is focussed on the role of the sfs and the new nato gd although it is not the intention to review the broader research landscape of the helicopter ship dynamic interface such a review has recently been reported by shukla et al 2019 2 the simple frigate shape the sfs geometry was introduced in two stages in the first stage the geometry represented the back of a simplified ship with no bow section in the second stage a pointed bow section was added the first stage geometry was known as the sfs1 or just sfs while the second stage was called sfs2 fig 2 shows the geometry of sfs2 with the original sfs1 identified the helicopter landing deck is aft of the superstructure hangar of the ship zan 2005 the measurements are in feet and are for a full size ship 140 m long it was recognised from the outset that the computational challenges of such a large and complex flow field would stretch the cfd techniques of the day so efforts were put into developing both the cfd codes and computing methods in 1998 reddy et al 2000 used the cfd code fluent to solve the steady flow field over the sfs1 for winds from ahead 45 and 90 also in 1998 long et al 1998 used parallel processing and a rans cfd code cfl3d to compute the steady flow field over the sfs1 and reported on attempts to extend the solution to obtain the unsteady flow field for winds from ahead and from 40 the same code was later used by tai in 2001 tai 2001 to investigate the same steady flow conditions but with a rounded bow added to the sfs1 to prevent or reduce flow separation at the blunt bow the experimental work to provide measured velocity data for the cfd studies was carried out in the wind tunnels of the national research council nrc of canada using a 1 60 scale model of the sfs1 and a 1 100 scale model of the sfs2 shown in fig 3 zan 2001 2005 the experimental techniques used were hot wire anemometry with oil film and smoke streamers for visualising surface shear patterns and the airwake since those early studies even though more complex and realistic ship geometries have been used the sfs geometries continue to be employed for example in the development of cfd methodologies for computing airwakes both steady and unsteady syms 2008 zhang et al 2009 forrest and owen 2010 quon et al 2014 rui et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 tang 2017 yuan et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 haghiri et al 2020 similarly the sfs geometries continue to be used to explore the effect on the airwake of altering the superstructure geometry bardera mora and meseguer 2015 shukla et al 2015 forrest et al 2016 wang et al 2018 bardera et al 2020 and developing new experimental techniques bardera mora 2014 rosenfeld et al 2015 sydney et al 2017 seth et al 2020 gnanamanickam et al 2020 farish et al 2020 taymourtash et al 2019 studies have also been conducted to explore local flow phenomena with and without the presence of a helicopter rotor downwash polsky 2003 nacakli and lanmdman 2011 rajmohan and he 2016 orbay and sezer uzol 2016 bardera mora et al 2016 shi et al 2017 rao et al 2019 shukla et al 2020 and the sfs2 airwake has been used to develop coupled simulations of the unsteady air flow with helicopter flight dynamics models bludau et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 including the effects of atmospheric turbulence thedin et al 2019 2020 sfs2 airwakes have also been used to add realistic airwake disturbances in piloted flight simulation of deck landings hodge et al 2009 2012 roper et al 2006 there is no doubt therefore that the sfs geometries have proven their worth and continue to do so however modern combat ships particularly frigates and destroyers have more stealth like features such as continuous flat sides and upright surfaces that slope inwards with sharp edges to avoid reflecting search radar signals back to their source lavers 2012 they are also larger and bulkier than their predecessors fig 4 shows two classes of uk destroyers in the foreground is a type 42 destroyer a class that was in service between 1975 and 2013 in the background is its current successor a type 45 destroyer that entered service in 2009 it can be seen how the earlier design with its highly fragmented superstructure has evolved into a slab sided structure with flat continuous sides with sharp edges the newer ship is also larger the slender design of the sfs2 is therefore no longer representative of many ships coming into service hence the introduction of the nato gd 3 nato research task group avt 315 the majority of nato member nations operate naval vessels with shipboard helicopters and there have been several applied vehicle technology avt nato research task groups dedicated to better understanding the ship airwake and the helicopter ship dynamic interface in 2007 avt 102 published its report investigation of airwake control for safer shipboard aircraft operations task group avt 102 2007 the task group was established to assess whether modifications or appendages to the superstructure of both multi spot and single spot ships could improve the air flow over the ship from the perspective of aircraft handling qualities avt 102 focused primarily on techniques and methodologies that could lead to less aggressive airwakes but the scope and timeframe made it difficult to assess the impact of airwake changes on flight operations and aircraft handling qualities avt 102 was followed by avt 148 modelling and simulation of the ship environment for safer aircraft launch and recovery which reported in 2012 task group avt 148 2011 this task group summarised the research that member nations were carrying out in the areas of computational and experimental modelling of ship airwakes some of which included the interaction with a helicopter main rotor the report also described how some nations were integrating cfd generated airwakes with flight simulation the studies carried out in avts 102 and 148 were mainly concerned with how the ship airwakes could be simulated using cfd or experiment and how they would affect aircraft mainly rotorcraft avt 217 modelling and simulation of the effects of ship design on helicopter launch and recovery which reported in 2016 task group avt 217 2016 looked at the state of the art in modelling and simulation of the dynamic interface from the perspective of the ship and what design guidance could be provided from the knowledge that had been gained about ship airwakes and their interaction with rotorcraft what became clear in that study was that different nations were using their own dissimilar modelling and simulation techniques to inform ship designs and to predict how the airwake would affect the shol it was however difficult to compare the various simulation methods of each nation as they were measuring different parameters and operating with different ships and helicopters avt 217 therefore led to avt 315 where the purpose was to adopt a common ship i e the nato gd and a common helicopter the common helicopter has been named the nato generic rotorcraft or nato gr the sikorsky sh 60 seahawk has been adopted as the common helicopter the seahawk which is in service with several navies around the world is the maritime version of the ubiquitous uh 60 black hawk for which there is a widely used and validated mathematical non linear flight dynamics model known as genhel beck and funk 1994 howlett 1989 the avt 315 group have decided to model the helicopter within flightlab which is a commercially available software tool that provides a multi body modelling and simulation environment duval and he 2018 the flightlab generic rotorcraft model is also based on the genhel model a practical requirement for the seahawk configuration is that the tail wheel is brought forward because unlike the black hawk its primary function is to operate from ships with limited deck space while the flightlab modelling software is an appropriate way forward for the members of avt 315 and it has been successfully used in simulation studies of shipboard operations e g owen et al 2017 hodge et al 2012 forrest et al 2016 memon et al 2020 the genhel model has also been successfully used e g thedin et al 2019 2020 advani and wilkinson 2001 oruc et al 2017 and is therefore also a suitable modelling approach although the mass of an empty seahawk is about 6900 kg the mass of the nato gr has been set at 10 000 kg further details and applications of the nato gr will be published in due course using these common platforms the intention is that each member nation will apply their own simulation methods and will compare their derived metrics for example how does a measurement of turbulence over the flight deck relate to the unsteady loads measured on a model rotor or to the landing accuracy of a helicopter flight model in an airwake or to pilot workload ratings from piloted flight simulation a further challenge accepted by avt 315 is to include ship motion in the generation analysis and application of the ship airwake when moving through rough seas the ship can experience significant translational and rotational displacements in six axes heave surge and sway and pitch roll and yaw it is logical that the ship motion will affect the airwake but while this has long been recognised there are few studies which have included ship motion mainly because of the additional complexity for both experimental and computational modelling in a wind tunnel study employing the sfs2 sydney et al 2017 used time resolved particle imaging velocimetry piv to study the effect of pitching motion on the airwake for winds from ahead the initial part of their study measured the airwake when the ship was fixed for bow up pitch angles up to 2 5 before progressing to look at the effect of a regular oscillatory pitching motion with an amplitude of 2 5 the static tests showed how as the bow was progressively pitched up the forward edge of the superstructure was increasingly exposed to the oncoming flow and vortices were shed downstream from this source passing along the ship and over the flight deck when the ship was dynamically pitching the vertical motion at the stern of the ship was seen to inject a significant oscillatory component into the velocity field over the flight deck to add further complexity the local flow over the flight deck also interacted with the vortices being shed periodically from the front edge of the superstructure when it was pitched upwards the pitching motion of the ship therefore affected the air flow over the flight deck in a more complex way than just the local heaving action of the deck yuan et al 2018b also carried out wind tunnel tests using a model frigate to study the effect of ship motion on the airwake sinusoidal motion was applied separately in just one degree of freedom in heave roll or pitch multi holed pressure probes known as cobra probes chen et al 1998 were used to measure unsteady air velocities at points in the flow over the flight deck dooley et al 2019 conducted an extensive computational and experimental airwake study using a generic ship geometry representative of the us zumwalt class stealth destroyer and included the effects of atmospheric turbulence surface waves and ship motion on the airwake the three studies reported in references sydney et al 2017 yuan et al 2018b dooley et al 2019 showed that the frequency of the ship motion could clearly be seen in the power spectra of the measured velocities over the flight deck dooley et al went on to investigate the effect of the unsteady airwake on a theoretical model of a helicopter rotor disc and demonstrated that the periodic motion of the ship could also be detected in the unsteady thrust coefficient of the rotor the three studies described above confirmed that the ship motion affects the characteristics of the ship airwake what is not clear however is how that in turn affects the helicopter and the difficulty of the landing task presented to the pilot for a 150 m long ship the period of motion excited by a wide range of wave frequencies is typically 8 12 s as will be demonstrated later in this paper when a pilot moves the helicopter through the airwake during an approach to landing the highly unsteady airflow can cause large fluctuations in the aerodynamic loading on the aircraft fuselage and rotors making it difficult for the pilot to maintain position and attitude while the unsteady loading is broadband unsteady loads in the frequency range between 0 2 and 2 hz are particularly difficult for the pilot forces and moments with frequencies above this range are damped by the inertia of the aircraft while loads with frequencies below the range can be overcome by the pilot through aircraft control inputs disturbances with frequencies between 0 2 and 2 hz are considered to be in the closed loop pilot response frequency range lee and zan 2005 mcruer 1994 which is associated with high pilot workload and potentially dangerous pilot induced oscillations therefore although the ship motion will affect the airwake it appears that the additional disturbances will have a frequency that is below but not too different from 0 2 hz i e typically 0 1 hz furthermore as well as ship motion affecting the airwake the difficulty of the landing task can be strongly influenced by the moving deck therefore how ship motion through both the airwake and the moving deck affect the helicopter and the pilot is not straightforward 4 the nato generic destroyer in the same way that the sfs came about from a project conceived by collaborating nations who made the ship geometry available to all researchers so the nato gd geometry and motion is also being made available to the international research community with the aim of advancing current understanding of the ship helicopter dynamic interface the avt 315 research task group has specified not only the geometry of the nato gd for experimental and cfd modellers but also several ship motion profiles so that researchers can include ship motion in their modelling 4 1 nato gd geometry the requirement for a successor to the sfs2 was a ship geometry that is more representative of modern ship designs and that was agreeable to the member nations of avt 315 the geometry also had to be suitable for manufacturing for experimental testing and for meshing for cfd studies the final ship geometry is based on a design of ship created by drdc known as the notional destroyer nd which is primarily being used internationally for research into sea keeping and other related areas the topside geometry of the notional destroyer and the nato gd are identical however the hull form of the nato gd below the waterline has been simplified an overview of the nato gd is shown in fig 5 with the main dimensions and the principal features identified the full scale ship is 150 m long and has a displacement of 6169 metric tonnes the superstructure is continuous from the bridge to the flight deck and slopes inward at 5 a feature called the tumblehome it has a short bulky mast similar to the integrated masts found on modern warships a low rectangular exhaust funnel casing amidships and a fixed radar array ahead of the flight deck the size of the flight deck and the dimensions of the hangar are consistent with existing modern ship designs fig 6 shows orthographic views of the nato gd it can be seen that the hull has flat sides which extend from the deck to the bottom of the ship this is the simplification referred to above and has been implemented to ease some of the cfd challenges for modelling the intersection between the moving ship and the water surface also identified in fig 6 is the waterline the centre of rotation for ship motion and three coordinate systems the primary coordinate system x 1 y 1 z 1 with its origin at the intersection of the waterline and the bow is common practice for ships and is used to define the ship geometry x axis is positive from bow to stern y axis is positive from port to starboard and z axis is positive pointing up from the waterline the secondary coordinate system x 2 y 2 z 2 has been introduced to locate all points in space that are relevant to the helicopter e g the position of its centre of gravity relative to the flight deck its origin is at the intersection of the plane of the flight deck the face of the hangar and the centreline of the flight deck the third coordinate system x 3 y 3 z 3 θ φ has been introduced to define the ship motion its origin is at the ship s centre of rotation which is the point at which all ship motions shall be applied as well as defining operational limits for helicopter launch and recovery in terms of relative wind speed and direction it is also conventional to specify limiting deck motions in terms of pitch and roll angles and vertical displacements and velocities at the landing spot nato 2000 therefore although ship motion will be calculated for the nato gd in six axes surge sway heave roll pitch yaw only three components shall be considered in the simulations developed by the research task group i e heave displacement z positive upward roll rotation φ positive port down and pitch rotation θ positive stern down consistent with the accepted operational deck motion limits wind tunnel experiments will therefore be conducted with motion systems capable of moving the ship in heave roll and pitch and cfd computations will be conducted with the ship moving in the same axes the ship motion data to be provided will however also include computed values for surge sway and yaw so if researchers wish to include motion in these axes in their own studies they can do so fig 7 shows a 3 m long 1 50 scale model nato gd in the nrc 3 m 6 m wind tunnel the black circle around the model is a sheet of fabric that is attached to the ship at the waterline and is tensioned by springs located below the wind tunnel floor providing a flexible surface that moves with the ship as it is displaced in roll pitch and heave in the wind tunnel this surface inhibits air flow through the waterline or wind tunnel floor point measurements of unsteady three dimensional velocity components will be made using multiple cobra probes which can be fixed stationary in the wind tunnel or attached to the landing deck so they move with the ship additionally planar velocity measurements can be made using time resolved stereoscopic piv early exploratory and unpublished research conducted at nrc in 2011 used an earlier design of the nato gd together with a simpler prototype motion system fig 8 is an example of piv measurements taken over the ship s flight deck as contours of vertical w velocity component a vertical laser sheet was aligned with the longitudinal centreline of the landing deck originating from a laser mounted behind the ship that did not undergo ship motion the laser sheet covered more area than the data shown allowing the analysis window to move with the ship without moving the laser each image corresponds with the same rectangle shown over the flight deck the rectangle is 260 mm wide by 160 mm high and the dimensions in the top centre image show its location in millimetres relative to the intersection of the flight deck and the hangar face i e x 2 z 2 for the data shown in this paper one motion case is shown heave only with a sinusoidal motion of amplitude 50 mm and frequency 2 hz and the air flow was from ahead the motion is shown schematically in the left hand images in fig 8 for four positions in the cycle for reference the amplitude of 50 mm compares with a hangar height of 160 mm for the model ship the top image is when the ship is at the top of the cycle the second image is when the ship is moving downwards through its neutral position the third image is when the ship is at the bottom of the cycle and the fourth image is when the ship is moving upwards through its neutral position the air flow is from right to left and the vertical velocity component is normalised by the freestream velocity u of 6 5 m s the images in the middle column of fig 8 are piv measurements taken when the ship was fixed at the positions shown in the first column i e the velocity field when the ship was stationary at the position of interest the images in the right hand column are piv measurements of the vertical velocity component as the moving ship passes through the position indicated in the first column the images are phase averaged piv measurements of the instantaneous vertical velocity components recorded each time the ship passes through the position of interest the phase averaged velocities were obtained from 400 image pairs the piv images were taken at a frequency of 8 hz and synchronised with the motion system to capture each image pair as the ship passed through the four positions of interest considering first the images for the stationary ship in the middle column it can be seen that the flow is negative i e downwards towards the flight deck which is expected as the air is essentially flowing over a backward facing step formed by the hangar face at the front of the landing deck when the ship is at its maximum height the area enclosed by the 0 1 contour is smaller possibly because the ship is presenting a greater profile to the oncoming flow otherwise the stationary images are similar considering next the right hand column for the moving ship in the top image it can be seen that the normalised vertical velocity component is close to zero 0 to 0 1 because the deck has just ascended to its maximum height imparting an upward motion to what would otherwise be a downward flow in the second image the deck is now descending through its neutral position thereby inducing an additional downward component to an already downward flow so the vertical velocity component is typically double that of the stationary ship at that position in the third image while the deck has stopped descending it is at the end of its motion and the downflow is greater than when there is no motion finally in the bottom image the deck is ascending through its neutral position and so the negative downflow seen in the stationary image is reduced by the rising superstructure and deck from the perspective of the helicopter therefore the airwake over the flight deck is affected by the ship motion consistent with the findings of sydney et al 2017 yuan et al 2018b dooley et al 2019 amongst the research questions that arise are how does the moving ship superstructure affect the airwake how does this modified flow affect the flying environment over the flight deck and how does this affect the difficulty of the landing task 4 2 ship motion profiles the ship motion has been calculated by drdc using their shipmo3d ship motion modelling software mctaggart 2010 2012 2014 because the nato gd has a simplified below water hull form the ship motion calculations were carried out using the original hull form of the notional destroyer with curved surfaces and appendages such as bilge keels stabilisers rudders and propellers therefore although the nato gd has a simplified hull below the water line to assist the cfd calculations the motion of the ship is that expected of a modern combat ship modelling the airwake for a moving ship with heave roll and pitch either by experiment or cfd is challenging in the wind tunnel a motion system is required to move the ship in a way that reflects the three axes at sea motion while maintaining a continuous surface for the floor of the wind tunnel similarly with cfd the movement of the ship and the complexity of the intersection where the hull meets the sea surface must be taken into account how the ship motion is created and accounted for in the experiments and cfd analyses is not being stipulated by the research task group because the purpose is to stimulate research on a common platform and to invite the international research community to develop their own approaches what is being provided is the ship geometry a set of motion profiles and experimental airwake validation data for the moving ship at a selection of relative wind speeds details of how to access this information is provided in the final section of the paper table 1 lists the test cases that the avt 315 participants will be addressing the values are for the full scale ship some nations will be conducting experiments some will be undertaking cfd studies and others will be taking the outputs from those studies and integrating them with helicopter flight dynamics models the cases are developmental in that cases 1 to 3 are for a static ship with three wind directions while cases 4 5 and 6 are for sinusoidal motion solely in heave roll or pitch respectively with winds from ahead case 7 is where the ship motion has been calculated for an ideal seaway with single frequency unidirectional waves coming from ahead in cases 8 to 13 the ship motions have been calculated for realistic seaways with short crested random waves in all cases the ship speed is 15 kts the angles of incidence for the realistic waves match the three wind angles ahead green 15 and green 30 each wind wave direction has two relative wind speeds 25 and 40 kts so for example in the headwind the atmospheric wind speeds are 10 and 25 kts respectively for the green winds the atmospheric wind speeds are the vector difference between the relative wind speed and the ship speed for a given relative wind speed therefore the atmospheric wind speed will vary with the relative wind direction the seaway has been given significant wave heights of 2 and 4 m which correspond to sea states 4 and 5 ss4 and ss5 which are a little higher than the atmospheric winds would justify in a headwind nato 1993 but the combination of the relative winds and the deck motion were selected to create appropriately realistic and challenging conditions for a helicopter pilot attempting a deck landing scott et al 2017 as mentioned above the ship motion for case 7 is calculated for regular unidirectional waves coming from ahead in this case therefore there is no roll response from the ship and the calculated motion is as shown in fig 9 the motion is recorded at the ship s centre of rotation while the ship is moving at 15 kts through waves with a height of 2 m and a period of 15 s fig 9 shows the resulting heave has an amplitude of about 1 8 m while the pitch has an amplitude of about 2 2 the motion in both axes is regular with a period of about 11 3 s which is excited by the wave period of 15 s the computed ship motions for the realistic seaways in cases 8 to 13 are calculated using waves described by the bretschneider spectrum mctaggart 2010 with the significant wave heights and peak wave periods as listed in table 1 while a unidirectional bretschneider spectrum can be used to approximate long crested oceanic waves for waves from ahead the lateral ship motion roll sway and yaw will be absent due to the symmetry of the ship geometry travelling directly into two dimensional waves therefore a cosine squared spreading function was implemented to generate a more representative short crested wave spectrum with a 90 spreading angle and 5 heading interval for wave components the purpose of this paper and of avt 315 is not to focus on the method of generating the ship motion but rather to make available a set of motion profiles for the nato gd for a range of conditions for more information on the method used to generate the realistic ship motion the reader is referred to references mctaggart 2010 2012 2014 fig 10 shows the nato gd ship motion for case 8 i e realistic waves coming from ahead with a significant wave height of 2 m and period of 10 s roughly corresponding to ss4 the ship is moving through the seaway at 15 kts in this case it can be seen that there is now a roll response from the ship even though the waves are from ahead it can be seen that the motion is irregular in each axis it can also be seen that there are quieter periods often called quiescent periods when the ship motion reduces e g at 0 and 100 s when landing to a ship at sea a helicopter pilot will often hover above the deck station keep and wait for a quiescent period before touching down so for the flight simulation aspect of avt 315 capturing the quiescent period in the ship motion is important fig 11 shows the computed ship motion for case 13 the most aggressive case with the ship moving at 15 kts through a ss5 seaway with waves of significant height 4 m period 12 s coming from 30 degrees off the starboard side green 30 the amplitude of the resultant ship motion is typically three to four times that of case 8 quiescent periods can be seen at about 33 and 85 s 4 3 preliminary investigation and observations the research groups involved with avt 315 will be embarking on projects using the nato gd to improve the current understanding of the ship helicopter dynamic interface and by using common platforms ship and helicopter models they will be able to share and directly compare the results obtained from their own particular simulation methods the static cases for both cfd and experiment i e cases 1 to 3 in table 1 will provide a baseline for both computational and experimental modelling fig 12 for example shows a cfd generated airwake for the static model scale nato gd in a headwind illustrated by mean streamlines and contours of turbulence intensity plotted on the vertical plane on the centreline of the ship the turbulence created by the mast and the radar array is clearly seen and it can also be seen that the radar array creates a significant downflow over the landing deck consistent with the earlier piv measurements in fig 8 which will affect the thrust produced by the helicopter s main rotor the point identified in fig 12 by the symbol is the location where experimental wind tunnel data was measured discussed later with reference to fig 14 the methodology for computing the airwake was that recommended by forrest and owen 2010 using delayed detached eddy simulation ddes a time accurate cfd method the computational grid consisted of an unstructured tetrahedral volume mesh with prism layers at all solid surfaces to accurately resolve boundary layer flows the surface mesh on the ship was limited to a maximum size of 6 mm as recommended by forrest and owen 2010 this sizing was also applied to the volume mesh over the flight deck to resolve a sufficient proportion of the turbulent length scales in this region the cfd code ansys fluent was employed and the solution was calculated with the sst k w turbulence model within the ddes a steady state rans solution was first obtained to be used as the initial data for the unsteady ddes solver an initial settling period of 1 s was calculated using a time step of 0 0004 s before sampling 5 s of unsteady flow to produce the mean and turbulent data shown in fig 12 cases 4 to 6 in table 1 provide the simplest test cases for cfd with ship motion for comparison with static ship data such as that shown in fig 12 before moving onto the more complex motion and wind conditions described by cases 7 to 13 fig 13 shows the ship motion at experimental scale for case 6 in table 1 i e a sinusoidal pitching motion in this case the motion is recorded at the centre of the landing deck and it can be seen that a pitching of 5 leads to a vertical heave of about 0 1 m the pitching frequency is 1 hz which with a freestream velocity of about 10 3 m s satisfies strouhal scaling between the model 1 50th scale 10 3 m s 1 hz and full scale 20 6 m s 0 04 hz the strouhal number in this case is given by st f l u where f is the frequency of motion l is the ship beam and u is the freestream air velocity the validity of applying strouhal scaling to complex ship geometries was demonstrated by scott et al 2014 examples of preliminary experimental velocity measurements are shown in fig 14 obtained using a cobra probe in the nrc wind tunnel shown earlier in fig 7 with the nato gd moving solely in pitch with deck motion as described in fig 13 the two graphs in fig 14 show the vertical velocity component w normalised by the freestream velocity u measured above the centre of the deck in the top figure the ship was stationary with the velocity probe located 19 cm above the deck 1 19 hangar height the probe was fixed to the wind tunnel this data is therefore for a single point within the cfd flow field shown earlier in fig 12 the point marked by the symbol in fig 12 the normalised w component at the probe location extracted from the cfd data in fig 12 was seen to have a mean of 0 14 and coincidentally a standard deviation of 0 14 which compare reasonably well with the measured values of 0 149 and 0 134 in the upper graph of fig 14 the lower graph in fig 14 shows the velocity measured by the probe fixed in the same location relative to the wind tunnel while the ship moved below it as can be seen the two graphs do not look significantly different furthermore the respective mean and standard deviation calculated over 120 s of experimental data are not very different for the two cases which may be unexpected since as discussed earlier the ship motion does affect the airwake however the two values for the mean w velocity were calculated over 120 cycles so the bias in the vertical velocity component created by the upward motion of the deck will be compensated by a similar bias created by the downward motion it is therefore more revealing to look at the vertical velocity component at the same time in the displacement cycle averaged over the 120 cycles similar to the piv methodology used to produce fig 8 fig 15 shows the average of the w velocity component calculated every 1 100th of a second through the 1 s cycle considering first the with motion velocity measurements these were recorded at 5000 hz therefore over 120 cycles each average value of w plotted in fig 15 was calculated from 6000 i e 5000 100 120 measurements as can be seen in fig 15 the cyclic deck motion is influencing the vertical velocity component however because of the highly turbulent nature of the flow and the interaction between the localised deck motion and the flow coming from the forward superstructure identified by sydney et al 2017 and referred to earlier the cyclic nature of the velocity component is more complex than the regular cyclic motion of the deck shown in fig 13 the blue line in fig 15 showing the average w velocity over the static deck has been calculated in the same way as for the moving deck therefore the complexity of the airwake again means that the average w velocity over the full 1 s cycle is not a single value but varies in time due to the highly unsteady air flow fig 16 shows the power spectral density plots for the two sets of velocity data in fig 14 again they are not significantly different except there is a spike in the pitching motion data at 1 hz corresponding to the frequency of the ship motion consistent with the observations by sydney et al 2017 yuan et al 2018b dooley et al 2019 5 concluding remarks this paper has introduced the nato generic destroyer a conceptual ship with a simplified geometry that is representative of a modern helicopter enabled combat ship it is intended that the nato gd will replace the simple frigate shape that was introduced in the 1990s as a generic ship geometry for experimental and computational modelling of ship airwakes the sfs has been widely used not just for airwake studies but also for modelling helicopter flight dynamics at the helicopter ship dynamic interface the nato gd geometry is being made available and to further advance the research in this area ship motion profiles are being provided to facilitate studies that will not only use a common ship but with prescribed motion profiles files

20866,the helicopter ship dynamic interface is the environment above the landing deck of a ship where a helicopter pilot has to control the aircraft while contending with a moving deck and an unsteady airflow known as the ship airwake research into understanding this environment has included modelling the airwake using wind tunnel studies and computational fluid dynamics and has often used the simple frigate shape sfs a generic ship geometry representative of a naval frigate this paper reviews the contribution that the sfs has made to research into the helicopter ship dynamic interface and introduces a new ship geometry for future research the new ship developed within a nato research task group is the nato generic destroyer nato gd a concept ship with a simplified geometry that is more representative of a modern helicopter enabled combat ship with a stealthy superstructure as well as introducing the nato gd as a common platform for research the paper also introduces a number of ship motion profiles to encourage new research that will include the effect of ship motion on the airwake it is anticipated that future research on a common ship with prescribed motion and adopting a common helicopter will lead to improved or new modelling methodologies keywords airwake ship helicopter cfd wind tunnel shol 1 introduction there has been a considerable international research effort for many years into understanding modelling and simulating the helicopter ship dynamic interface i e the flying environment around the landing deck of a ship in which a maritime helicopter will operate shukla et al 2019 owen et al 2017 the research has been aimed at developing a better understanding of the dynamic interface the modelling of the ship airwake and the modelling of a helicopter operating in that environment the landing deck of a ship presents one of the most challenging environments for a helicopter pilot single spot ships such as frigates and destroyers have a restricted landing area on a pitching rolling and heaving deck above which the pilot has also to contend with the presence of a highly dynamic airflow this phenomenon known as the ship airwake is caused by the air flowing over and around the ship s superstructure as a result of the combined effect of the prevailing wind and the forward motion of the ship the maritime helicopter regarded as one of the most important tactical systems on the ship is used to perform a variety of different roles including anti submarine warfare surveillance troop transfer and supply replenishment at sea the challenge of landing the helicopter in bad weather is acknowledged as being both demanding and dangerous moreover if the flying conditions are too difficult the helicopter will not be cleared to take off and an important component of the ship s capability will be lost lumsden et al 1998 whether or not the helicopter is cleared for take off is determined by the ship helicopter operating limits or shol an example of a shol diagram for a uk port side landing approach is shown in fig 1 extracted from hodge et al 2012 the shol is an envelope of limiting wind speeds and directions relative to the ship for a given helicopter type and mass operating to a particular ship with specified limits for acceptable deck motion the red and green winds denoted in fig 1 are respectively naval terminology for winds approaching from port and starboard shol envelopes are normally determined through sea trials where test pilots fly repeated launch and recovery missions for as wide a range of relative wind conditions as possible to determine the safe operating limits for an average fleet pilot research and technology organisation rto 2003 a major aim of the ongoing research into the helicopter ship dynamic interface is to develop modelling and simulation tools to support and inform the shol trials which are costly and time consuming in 1987 healey 1987 identified the difficulty of clearing the growing number of us navy helicopters to their ships and he articulated the possibility of using flight simulation to support the clearance process healey identified several technical challenges such as modelling the ship motion the ship airwake and the helicopter dynamics in 1992 he made the case for establishing a database of computational fluid dynamics cfd generated ship airwakes for use in flight simulators healey 1992 at the time cfd capability and computing resources were limited but the challenge had been made to the aerodynamics community during the 1990s the technical co operation programme ttcp a collaboration between in this case australia canada the uk and the us established a research programme to develop the potential for simulating the helicopter ship dynamic interface and had identified modelling the ship airwake and its effect on helicopter performance as one of the most significant technical challenges wilkinson et al 1998 finlay 2001 from this collaboration a simplified ship geometry known as the simple frigate shape sfs was defined for experimentalists and cfd modellers to generate and compare ship airwakes the sfs was and continues to be used by researchers across the world to validate simulation tools critical to the investigation of the helicopter ship dynamic interface a new international collaboration undertaken as a nato research task group avt 315 comparative assessment of modelling and simulation methods of shipboard launch and recovery of helicopters was established in 2019 to build on the significant progress that had been made in simulating the ship helicopter dynamic interface to this end a new generic ship geometry has been proposed to reflect better the design of frigates and destroyers that are now entering service with bulkier more angular and less fragmented superstructures the ship is known as the nato generic destroyer nato gd and was designed by defence research and development canada drdc atlantic for research purposes the member nations involved in avt 315 are canada france greece netherlands uk and the us as well as australia as a nato partner the research organisations include government research laboratories industry and universities the research organisations will apply their own modelling and simulation methods to the nato gd and a new challenge in this research will be to add ship motion to the cfd and experimental modelling the research will not just be concerned with the ship airwake but also with how the airwake and the ship motion will affect a helicopter operating to the ship the purpose of this paper is to briefly review the research that has been undertaken using the sfs and to introduce the nato gd and the ship motion profiles that have been specified for the nato research programme the overall aim of avt 315 and the nato gd is to build on the highly successful research stimulus that the sfs provided but with a more realistic ship and a more demanding set of conditions for the international community of computational and experimental modellers while there have been numerous research projects and publications on the helicopter ship dynamic interface this paper is focussed on the role of the sfs and the new nato gd although it is not the intention to review the broader research landscape of the helicopter ship dynamic interface such a review has recently been reported by shukla et al 2019 2 the simple frigate shape the sfs geometry was introduced in two stages in the first stage the geometry represented the back of a simplified ship with no bow section in the second stage a pointed bow section was added the first stage geometry was known as the sfs1 or just sfs while the second stage was called sfs2 fig 2 shows the geometry of sfs2 with the original sfs1 identified the helicopter landing deck is aft of the superstructure hangar of the ship zan 2005 the measurements are in feet and are for a full size ship 140 m long it was recognised from the outset that the computational challenges of such a large and complex flow field would stretch the cfd techniques of the day so efforts were put into developing both the cfd codes and computing methods in 1998 reddy et al 2000 used the cfd code fluent to solve the steady flow field over the sfs1 for winds from ahead 45 and 90 also in 1998 long et al 1998 used parallel processing and a rans cfd code cfl3d to compute the steady flow field over the sfs1 and reported on attempts to extend the solution to obtain the unsteady flow field for winds from ahead and from 40 the same code was later used by tai in 2001 tai 2001 to investigate the same steady flow conditions but with a rounded bow added to the sfs1 to prevent or reduce flow separation at the blunt bow the experimental work to provide measured velocity data for the cfd studies was carried out in the wind tunnels of the national research council nrc of canada using a 1 60 scale model of the sfs1 and a 1 100 scale model of the sfs2 shown in fig 3 zan 2001 2005 the experimental techniques used were hot wire anemometry with oil film and smoke streamers for visualising surface shear patterns and the airwake since those early studies even though more complex and realistic ship geometries have been used the sfs geometries continue to be employed for example in the development of cfd methodologies for computing airwakes both steady and unsteady syms 2008 zhang et al 2009 forrest and owen 2010 quon et al 2014 rui et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 tang 2017 yuan et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 haghiri et al 2020 similarly the sfs geometries continue to be used to explore the effect on the airwake of altering the superstructure geometry bardera mora and meseguer 2015 shukla et al 2015 forrest et al 2016 wang et al 2018 bardera et al 2020 and developing new experimental techniques bardera mora 2014 rosenfeld et al 2015 sydney et al 2017 seth et al 2020 gnanamanickam et al 2020 farish et al 2020 taymourtash et al 2019 studies have also been conducted to explore local flow phenomena with and without the presence of a helicopter rotor downwash polsky 2003 nacakli and lanmdman 2011 rajmohan and he 2016 orbay and sezer uzol 2016 bardera mora et al 2016 shi et al 2017 rao et al 2019 shukla et al 2020 and the sfs2 airwake has been used to develop coupled simulations of the unsteady air flow with helicopter flight dynamics models bludau et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 including the effects of atmospheric turbulence thedin et al 2019 2020 sfs2 airwakes have also been used to add realistic airwake disturbances in piloted flight simulation of deck landings hodge et al 2009 2012 roper et al 2006 there is no doubt therefore that the sfs geometries have proven their worth and continue to do so however modern combat ships particularly frigates and destroyers have more stealth like features such as continuous flat sides and upright surfaces that slope inwards with sharp edges to avoid reflecting search radar signals back to their source lavers 2012 they are also larger and bulkier than their predecessors fig 4 shows two classes of uk destroyers in the foreground is a type 42 destroyer a class that was in service between 1975 and 2013 in the background is its current successor a type 45 destroyer that entered service in 2009 it can be seen how the earlier design with its highly fragmented superstructure has evolved into a slab sided structure with flat continuous sides with sharp edges the newer ship is also larger the slender design of the sfs2 is therefore no longer representative of many ships coming into service hence the introduction of the nato gd 3 nato research task group avt 315 the majority of nato member nations operate naval vessels with shipboard helicopters and there have been several applied vehicle technology avt nato research task groups dedicated to better understanding the ship airwake and the helicopter ship dynamic interface in 2007 avt 102 published its report investigation of airwake control for safer shipboard aircraft operations task group avt 102 2007 the task group was established to assess whether modifications or appendages to the superstructure of both multi spot and single spot ships could improve the air flow over the ship from the perspective of aircraft handling qualities avt 102 focused primarily on techniques and methodologies that could lead to less aggressive airwakes but the scope and timeframe made it difficult to assess the impact of airwake changes on flight operations and aircraft handling qualities avt 102 was followed by avt 148 modelling and simulation of the ship environment for safer aircraft launch and recovery which reported in 2012 task group avt 148 2011 this task group summarised the research that member nations were carrying out in the areas of computational and experimental modelling of ship airwakes some of which included the interaction with a helicopter main rotor the report also described how some nations were integrating cfd generated airwakes with flight simulation the studies carried out in avts 102 and 148 were mainly concerned with how the ship airwakes could be simulated using cfd or experiment and how they would affect aircraft mainly rotorcraft avt 217 modelling and simulation of the effects of ship design on helicopter launch and recovery which reported in 2016 task group avt 217 2016 looked at the state of the art in modelling and simulation of the dynamic interface from the perspective of the ship and what design guidance could be provided from the knowledge that had been gained about ship airwakes and their interaction with rotorcraft what became clear in that study was that different nations were using their own dissimilar modelling and simulation techniques to inform ship designs and to predict how the airwake would affect the shol it was however difficult to compare the various simulation methods of each nation as they were measuring different parameters and operating with different ships and helicopters avt 217 therefore led to avt 315 where the purpose was to adopt a common ship i e the nato gd and a common helicopter the common helicopter has been named the nato generic rotorcraft or nato gr the sikorsky sh 60 seahawk has been adopted as the common helicopter the seahawk which is in service with several navies around the world is the maritime version of the ubiquitous uh 60 black hawk for which there is a widely used and validated mathematical non linear flight dynamics model known as genhel beck and funk 1994 howlett 1989 the avt 315 group have decided to model the helicopter within flightlab which is a commercially available software tool that provides a multi body modelling and simulation environment duval and he 2018 the flightlab generic rotorcraft model is also based on the genhel model a practical requirement for the seahawk configuration is that the tail wheel is brought forward because unlike the black hawk its primary function is to operate from ships with limited deck space while the flightlab modelling software is an appropriate way forward for the members of avt 315 and it has been successfully used in simulation studies of shipboard operations e g owen et al 2017 hodge et al 2012 forrest et al 2016 memon et al 2020 the genhel model has also been successfully used e g thedin et al 2019 2020 advani and wilkinson 2001 oruc et al 2017 and is therefore also a suitable modelling approach although the mass of an empty seahawk is about 6900 kg the mass of the nato gr has been set at 10 000 kg further details and applications of the nato gr will be published in due course using these common platforms the intention is that each member nation will apply their own simulation methods and will compare their derived metrics for example how does a measurement of turbulence over the flight deck relate to the unsteady loads measured on a model rotor or to the landing accuracy of a helicopter flight model in an airwake or to pilot workload ratings from piloted flight simulation a further challenge accepted by avt 315 is to include ship motion in the generation analysis and application of the ship airwake when moving through rough seas the ship can experience significant translational and rotational displacements in six axes heave surge and sway and pitch roll and yaw it is logical that the ship motion will affect the airwake but while this has long been recognised there are few studies which have included ship motion mainly because of the additional complexity for both experimental and computational modelling in a wind tunnel study employing the sfs2 sydney et al 2017 used time resolved particle imaging velocimetry piv to study the effect of pitching motion on the airwake for winds from ahead the initial part of their study measured the airwake when the ship was fixed for bow up pitch angles up to 2 5 before progressing to look at the effect of a regular oscillatory pitching motion with an amplitude of 2 5 the static tests showed how as the bow was progressively pitched up the forward edge of the superstructure was increasingly exposed to the oncoming flow and vortices were shed downstream from this source passing along the ship and over the flight deck when the ship was dynamically pitching the vertical motion at the stern of the ship was seen to inject a significant oscillatory component into the velocity field over the flight deck to add further complexity the local flow over the flight deck also interacted with the vortices being shed periodically from the front edge of the superstructure when it was pitched upwards the pitching motion of the ship therefore affected the air flow over the flight deck in a more complex way than just the local heaving action of the deck yuan et al 2018b also carried out wind tunnel tests using a model frigate to study the effect of ship motion on the airwake sinusoidal motion was applied separately in just one degree of freedom in heave roll or pitch multi holed pressure probes known as cobra probes chen et al 1998 were used to measure unsteady air velocities at points in the flow over the flight deck dooley et al 2019 conducted an extensive computational and experimental airwake study using a generic ship geometry representative of the us zumwalt class stealth destroyer and included the effects of atmospheric turbulence surface waves and ship motion on the airwake the three studies reported in references sydney et al 2017 yuan et al 2018b dooley et al 2019 showed that the frequency of the ship motion could clearly be seen in the power spectra of the measured velocities over the flight deck dooley et al went on to investigate the effect of the unsteady airwake on a theoretical model of a helicopter rotor disc and demonstrated that the periodic motion of the ship could also be detected in the unsteady thrust coefficient of the rotor the three studies described above confirmed that the ship motion affects the characteristics of the ship airwake what is not clear however is how that in turn affects the helicopter and the difficulty of the landing task presented to the pilot for a 150 m long ship the period of motion excited by a wide range of wave frequencies is typically 8 12 s as will be demonstrated later in this paper when a pilot moves the helicopter through the airwake during an approach to landing the highly unsteady airflow can cause large fluctuations in the aerodynamic loading on the aircraft fuselage and rotors making it difficult for the pilot to maintain position and attitude while the unsteady loading is broadband unsteady loads in the frequency range between 0 2 and 2 hz are particularly difficult for the pilot forces and moments with frequencies above this range are damped by the inertia of the aircraft while loads with frequencies below the range can be overcome by the pilot through aircraft control inputs disturbances with frequencies between 0 2 and 2 hz are considered to be in the closed loop pilot response frequency range lee and zan 2005 mcruer 1994 which is associated with high pilot workload and potentially dangerous pilot induced oscillations therefore although the ship motion will affect the airwake it appears that the additional disturbances will have a frequency that is below but not too different from 0 2 hz i e typically 0 1 hz furthermore as well as ship motion affecting the airwake the difficulty of the landing task can be strongly influenced by the moving deck therefore how ship motion through both the airwake and the moving deck affect the helicopter and the pilot is not straightforward 4 the nato generic destroyer in the same way that the sfs came about from a project conceived by collaborating nations who made the ship geometry available to all researchers so the nato gd geometry and motion is also being made available to the international research community with the aim of advancing current understanding of the ship helicopter dynamic interface the avt 315 research task group has specified not only the geometry of the nato gd for experimental and cfd modellers but also several ship motion profiles so that researchers can include ship motion in their modelling 4 1 nato gd geometry the requirement for a successor to the sfs2 was a ship geometry that is more representative of modern ship designs and that was agreeable to the member nations of avt 315 the geometry also had to be suitable for manufacturing for experimental testing and for meshing for cfd studies the final ship geometry is based on a design of ship created by drdc known as the notional destroyer nd which is primarily being used internationally for research into sea keeping and other related areas the topside geometry of the notional destroyer and the nato gd are identical however the hull form of the nato gd below the waterline has been simplified an overview of the nato gd is shown in fig 5 with the main dimensions and the principal features identified the full scale ship is 150 m long and has a displacement of 6169 metric tonnes the superstructure is continuous from the bridge to the flight deck and slopes inward at 5 a feature called the tumblehome it has a short bulky mast similar to the integrated masts found on modern warships a low rectangular exhaust funnel casing amidships and a fixed radar array ahead of the flight deck the size of the flight deck and the dimensions of the hangar are consistent with existing modern ship designs fig 6 shows orthographic views of the nato gd it can be seen that the hull has flat sides which extend from the deck to the bottom of the ship this is the simplification referred to above and has been implemented to ease some of the cfd challenges for modelling the intersection between the moving ship and the water surface also identified in fig 6 is the waterline the centre of rotation for ship motion and three coordinate systems the primary coordinate system x 1 y 1 z 1 with its origin at the intersection of the waterline and the bow is common practice for ships and is used to define the ship geometry x axis is positive from bow to stern y axis is positive from port to starboard and z axis is positive pointing up from the waterline the secondary coordinate system x 2 y 2 z 2 has been introduced to locate all points in space that are relevant to the helicopter e g the position of its centre of gravity relative to the flight deck its origin is at the intersection of the plane of the flight deck the face of the hangar and the centreline of the flight deck the third coordinate system x 3 y 3 z 3 θ φ has been introduced to define the ship motion its origin is at the ship s centre of rotation which is the point at which all ship motions shall be applied as well as defining operational limits for helicopter launch and recovery in terms of relative wind speed and direction it is also conventional to specify limiting deck motions in terms of pitch and roll angles and vertical displacements and velocities at the landing spot nato 2000 therefore although ship motion will be calculated for the nato gd in six axes surge sway heave roll pitch yaw only three components shall be considered in the simulations developed by the research task group i e heave displacement z positive upward roll rotation φ positive port down and pitch rotation θ positive stern down consistent with the accepted operational deck motion limits wind tunnel experiments will therefore be conducted with motion systems capable of moving the ship in heave roll and pitch and cfd computations will be conducted with the ship moving in the same axes the ship motion data to be provided will however also include computed values for surge sway and yaw so if researchers wish to include motion in these axes in their own studies they can do so fig 7 shows a 3 m long 1 50 scale model nato gd in the nrc 3 m 6 m wind tunnel the black circle around the model is a sheet of fabric that is attached to the ship at the waterline and is tensioned by springs located below the wind tunnel floor providing a flexible surface that moves with the ship as it is displaced in roll pitch and heave in the wind tunnel this surface inhibits air flow through the waterline or wind tunnel floor point measurements of unsteady three dimensional velocity components will be made using multiple cobra probes which can be fixed stationary in the wind tunnel or attached to the landing deck so they move with the ship additionally planar velocity measurements can be made using time resolved stereoscopic piv early exploratory and unpublished research conducted at nrc in 2011 used an earlier design of the nato gd together with a simpler prototype motion system fig 8 is an example of piv measurements taken over the ship s flight deck as contours of vertical w velocity component a vertical laser sheet was aligned with the longitudinal centreline of the landing deck originating from a laser mounted behind the ship that did not undergo ship motion the laser sheet covered more area than the data shown allowing the analysis window to move with the ship without moving the laser each image corresponds with the same rectangle shown over the flight deck the rectangle is 260 mm wide by 160 mm high and the dimensions in the top centre image show its location in millimetres relative to the intersection of the flight deck and the hangar face i e x 2 z 2 for the data shown in this paper one motion case is shown heave only with a sinusoidal motion of amplitude 50 mm and frequency 2 hz and the air flow was from ahead the motion is shown schematically in the left hand images in fig 8 for four positions in the cycle for reference the amplitude of 50 mm compares with a hangar height of 160 mm for the model ship the top image is when the ship is at the top of the cycle the second image is when the ship is moving downwards through its neutral position the third image is when the ship is at the bottom of the cycle and the fourth image is when the ship is moving upwards through its neutral position the air flow is from right to left and the vertical velocity component is normalised by the freestream velocity u of 6 5 m s the images in the middle column of fig 8 are piv measurements taken when the ship was fixed at the positions shown in the first column i e the velocity field when the ship was stationary at the position of interest the images in the right hand column are piv measurements of the vertical velocity component as the moving ship passes through the position indicated in the first column the images are phase averaged piv measurements of the instantaneous vertical velocity components recorded each time the ship passes through the position of interest the phase averaged velocities were obtained from 400 image pairs the piv images were taken at a frequency of 8 hz and synchronised with the motion system to capture each image pair as the ship passed through the four positions of interest considering first the images for the stationary ship in the middle column it can be seen that the flow is negative i e downwards towards the flight deck which is expected as the air is essentially flowing over a backward facing step formed by the hangar face at the front of the landing deck when the ship is at its maximum height the area enclosed by the 0 1 contour is smaller possibly because the ship is presenting a greater profile to the oncoming flow otherwise the stationary images are similar considering next the right hand column for the moving ship in the top image it can be seen that the normalised vertical velocity component is close to zero 0 to 0 1 because the deck has just ascended to its maximum height imparting an upward motion to what would otherwise be a downward flow in the second image the deck is now descending through its neutral position thereby inducing an additional downward component to an already downward flow so the vertical velocity component is typically double that of the stationary ship at that position in the third image while the deck has stopped descending it is at the end of its motion and the downflow is greater than when there is no motion finally in the bottom image the deck is ascending through its neutral position and so the negative downflow seen in the stationary image is reduced by the rising superstructure and deck from the perspective of the helicopter therefore the airwake over the flight deck is affected by the ship motion consistent with the findings of sydney et al 2017 yuan et al 2018b dooley et al 2019 amongst the research questions that arise are how does the moving ship superstructure affect the airwake how does this modified flow affect the flying environment over the flight deck and how does this affect the difficulty of the landing task 4 2 ship motion profiles the ship motion has been calculated by drdc using their shipmo3d ship motion modelling software mctaggart 2010 2012 2014 because the nato gd has a simplified below water hull form the ship motion calculations were carried out using the original hull form of the notional destroyer with curved surfaces and appendages such as bilge keels stabilisers rudders and propellers therefore although the nato gd has a simplified hull below the water line to assist the cfd calculations the motion of the ship is that expected of a modern combat ship modelling the airwake for a moving ship with heave roll and pitch either by experiment or cfd is challenging in the wind tunnel a motion system is required to move the ship in a way that reflects the three axes at sea motion while maintaining a continuous surface for the floor of the wind tunnel similarly with cfd the movement of the ship and the complexity of the intersection where the hull meets the sea surface must be taken into account how the ship motion is created and accounted for in the experiments and cfd analyses is not being stipulated by the research task group because the purpose is to stimulate research on a common platform and to invite the international research community to develop their own approaches what is being provided is the ship geometry a set of motion profiles and experimental airwake validation data for the moving ship at a selection of relative wind speeds details of how to access this information is provided in the final section of the paper table 1 lists the test cases that the avt 315 participants will be addressing the values are for the full scale ship some nations will be conducting experiments some will be undertaking cfd studies and others will be taking the outputs from those studies and integrating them with helicopter flight dynamics models the cases are developmental in that cases 1 to 3 are for a static ship with three wind directions while cases 4 5 and 6 are for sinusoidal motion solely in heave roll or pitch respectively with winds from ahead case 7 is where the ship motion has been calculated for an ideal seaway with single frequency unidirectional waves coming from ahead in cases 8 to 13 the ship motions have been calculated for realistic seaways with short crested random waves in all cases the ship speed is 15 kts the angles of incidence for the realistic waves match the three wind angles ahead green 15 and green 30 each wind wave direction has two relative wind speeds 25 and 40 kts so for example in the headwind the atmospheric wind speeds are 10 and 25 kts respectively for the green winds the atmospheric wind speeds are the vector difference between the relative wind speed and the ship speed for a given relative wind speed therefore the atmospheric wind speed will vary with the relative wind direction the seaway has been given significant wave heights of 2 and 4 m which correspond to sea states 4 and 5 ss4 and ss5 which are a little higher than the atmospheric winds would justify in a headwind nato 1993 but the combination of the relative winds and the deck motion were selected to create appropriately realistic and challenging conditions for a helicopter pilot attempting a deck landing scott et al 2017 as mentioned above the ship motion for case 7 is calculated for regular unidirectional waves coming from ahead in this case therefore there is no roll response from the ship and the calculated motion is as shown in fig 9 the motion is recorded at the ship s centre of rotation while the ship is moving at 15 kts through waves with a height of 2 m and a period of 15 s fig 9 shows the resulting heave has an amplitude of about 1 8 m while the pitch has an amplitude of about 2 2 the motion in both axes is regular with a period of about 11 3 s which is excited by the wave period of 15 s the computed ship motions for the realistic seaways in cases 8 to 13 are calculated using waves described by the bretschneider spectrum mctaggart 2010 with the significant wave heights and peak wave periods as listed in table 1 while a unidirectional bretschneider spectrum can be used to approximate long crested oceanic waves for waves from ahead the lateral ship motion roll sway and yaw will be absent due to the symmetry of the ship geometry travelling directly into two dimensional waves therefore a cosine squared spreading function was implemented to generate a more representative short crested wave spectrum with a 90 spreading angle and 5 heading interval for wave components the purpose of this paper and of avt 315 is not to focus on the method of generating the ship motion but rather to make available a set of motion profiles for the nato gd for a range of conditions for more information on the method used to generate the realistic ship motion the reader is referred to references mctaggart 2010 2012 2014 fig 10 shows the nato gd ship motion for case 8 i e realistic waves coming from ahead with a significant wave height of 2 m and period of 10 s roughly corresponding to ss4 the ship is moving through the seaway at 15 kts in this case it can be seen that there is now a roll response from the ship even though the waves are from ahead it can be seen that the motion is irregular in each axis it can also be seen that there are quieter periods often called quiescent periods when the ship motion reduces e g at 0 and 100 s when landing to a ship at sea a helicopter pilot will often hover above the deck station keep and wait for a quiescent period before touching down so for the flight simulation aspect of avt 315 capturing the quiescent period in the ship motion is important fig 11 shows the computed ship motion for case 13 the most aggressive case with the ship moving at 15 kts through a ss5 seaway with waves of significant height 4 m period 12 s coming from 30 degrees off the starboard side green 30 the amplitude of the resultant ship motion is typically three to four times that of case 8 quiescent periods can be seen at about 33 and 85 s 4 3 preliminary investigation and observations the research groups involved with avt 315 will be embarking on projects using the nato gd to improve the current understanding of the ship helicopter dynamic interface and by using common platforms ship and helicopter models they will be able to share and directly compare the results obtained from their own particular simulation methods the static cases for both cfd and experiment i e cases 1 to 3 in table 1 will provide a baseline for both computational and experimental modelling fig 12 for example shows a cfd generated airwake for the static model scale nato gd in a headwind illustrated by mean streamlines and contours of turbulence intensity plotted on the vertical plane on the centreline of the ship the turbulence created by the mast and the radar array is clearly seen and it can also be seen that the radar array creates a significant downflow over the landing deck consistent with the earlier piv measurements in fig 8 which will affect the thrust produced by the helicopter s main rotor the point identified in fig 12 by the symbol is the location where experimental wind tunnel data was measured discussed later with reference to fig 14 the methodology for computing the airwake was that recommended by forrest and owen 2010 using delayed detached eddy simulation ddes a time accurate cfd method the computational grid consisted of an unstructured tetrahedral volume mesh with prism layers at all solid surfaces to accurately resolve boundary layer flows the surface mesh on the ship was limited to a maximum size of 6 mm as recommended by forrest and owen 2010 this sizing was also applied to the volume mesh over the flight deck to resolve a sufficient proportion of the turbulent length scales in this region the cfd code ansys fluent was employed and the solution was calculated with the sst k w turbulence model within the ddes a steady state rans solution was first obtained to be used as the initial data for the unsteady ddes solver an initial settling period of 1 s was calculated using a time step of 0 0004 s before sampling 5 s of unsteady flow to produce the mean and turbulent data shown in fig 12 cases 4 to 6 in table 1 provide the simplest test cases for cfd with ship motion for comparison with static ship data such as that shown in fig 12 before moving onto the more complex motion and wind conditions described by cases 7 to 13 fig 13 shows the ship motion at experimental scale for case 6 in table 1 i e a sinusoidal pitching motion in this case the motion is recorded at the centre of the landing deck and it can be seen that a pitching of 5 leads to a vertical heave of about 0 1 m the pitching frequency is 1 hz which with a freestream velocity of about 10 3 m s satisfies strouhal scaling between the model 1 50th scale 10 3 m s 1 hz and full scale 20 6 m s 0 04 hz the strouhal number in this case is given by st f l u where f is the frequency of motion l is the ship beam and u is the freestream air velocity the validity of applying strouhal scaling to complex ship geometries was demonstrated by scott et al 2014 examples of preliminary experimental velocity measurements are shown in fig 14 obtained using a cobra probe in the nrc wind tunnel shown earlier in fig 7 with the nato gd moving solely in pitch with deck motion as described in fig 13 the two graphs in fig 14 show the vertical velocity component w normalised by the freestream velocity u measured above the centre of the deck in the top figure the ship was stationary with the velocity probe located 19 cm above the deck 1 19 hangar height the probe was fixed to the wind tunnel this data is therefore for a single point within the cfd flow field shown earlier in fig 12 the point marked by the symbol in fig 12 the normalised w component at the probe location extracted from the cfd data in fig 12 was seen to have a mean of 0 14 and coincidentally a standard deviation of 0 14 which compare reasonably well with the measured values of 0 149 and 0 134 in the upper graph of fig 14 the lower graph in fig 14 shows the velocity measured by the probe fixed in the same location relative to the wind tunnel while the ship moved below it as can be seen the two graphs do not look significantly different furthermore the respective mean and standard deviation calculated over 120 s of experimental data are not very different for the two cases which may be unexpected since as discussed earlier the ship motion does affect the airwake however the two values for the mean w velocity were calculated over 120 cycles so the bias in the vertical velocity component created by the upward motion of the deck will be compensated by a similar bias created by the downward motion it is therefore more revealing to look at the vertical velocity component at the same time in the displacement cycle averaged over the 120 cycles similar to the piv methodology used to produce fig 8 fig 15 shows the average of the w velocity component calculated every 1 100th of a second through the 1 s cycle considering first the with motion velocity measurements these were recorded at 5000 hz therefore over 120 cycles each average value of w plotted in fig 15 was calculated from 6000 i e 5000 100 120 measurements as can be seen in fig 15 the cyclic deck motion is influencing the vertical velocity component however because of the highly turbulent nature of the flow and the interaction between the localised deck motion and the flow coming from the forward superstructure identified by sydney et al 2017 and referred to earlier the cyclic nature of the velocity component is more complex than the regular cyclic motion of the deck shown in fig 13 the blue line in fig 15 showing the average w velocity over the static deck has been calculated in the same way as for the moving deck therefore the complexity of the airwake again means that the average w velocity over the full 1 s cycle is not a single value but varies in time due to the highly unsteady air flow fig 16 shows the power spectral density plots for the two sets of velocity data in fig 14 again they are not significantly different except there is a spike in the pitching motion data at 1 hz corresponding to the frequency of the ship motion consistent with the observations by sydney et al 2017 yuan et al 2018b dooley et al 2019 5 concluding remarks this paper has introduced the nato generic destroyer a conceptual ship with a simplified geometry that is representative of a modern helicopter enabled combat ship it is intended that the nato gd will replace the simple frigate shape that was introduced in the 1990s as a generic ship geometry for experimental and computational modelling of ship airwakes the sfs has been widely used not just for airwake studies but also for modelling helicopter flight dynamics at the helicopter ship dynamic interface the nato gd geometry is being made available and to further advance the research in this area ship motion profiles are being provided to facilitate studies that will not only use a common ship but with prescribed motion profiles files of the ship geometry the motion files in table 1 and measured velocity data from experiments conducted at nrc using a 1 50 scale model nato gd can be found at https search open canada ca en od sort score 20desc page search text using the search terms nato generic destroyer avt 315 is also proposing that a common generic rotorcraft model the nato gr be adopted for studies that will include a helicopter operating to the nato gd and whose motion affects both the airwake and the landing deck the nato gr will be representative of a sikorsky sh 60b seahawk a maritime version of the uh 60 black hawk with a mass of 10 000 kg it is anticipated that future research on a common ship with prescribed motion and with a common helicopter will lead to new studies with results that will be directly comparable between researchers the longer term aim is to improve understanding of the helicopter ship dynamic interface and to develop modelling and simulation tools that will inform and support the

20867,taking a t300k vlcc oil tanker as the research object the ship route estimation model with minimum fuel consumption co2 emissions and shortest eta as the objective function is established which considers the weather conditions and constraints of the main engine rated power and safety comprehensively on the basis of model verification combined with the weather forecast data and the current maritime market conditions the estimation indicators were analyzed the research results show that prefabricated route 1 and 2 were the shortest eta and the minimum fuel consumption routes respectively although the prefabricated route 1 saved 36 58 h compared with the prefabricated route 2 the fuel consumption and co2 emissions of the prefabricated route 2 were reduced by 0 94 t h and 2 92 t h and under the shortest eta objective function if keeping the initial speed the main engine would be limited by rated power when the ship encounters beaufort number 4 headwind or bow wind accordingly the ship route estimation method comprehensively considering weather conditions and constraints can analyze the variation rules of the fuel consumption speed loss co2 emissions and costs of multiple prefabricated routes under different objective functions which can provide decision support for shipping companies to improve operation economy keywords weather conditions constraints ship speed loss route estimation 1 introduction more than 80 of global trade is carried out by shipping transports which provides a low cost and reliable method of international transportation the international maritime organization imo 2018 approved an agreement in 2018 to reduce co2 emissions per transport unit by 40 by 2030 and 70 by 2050 compared with 2008 facing such a severe situation it is very important for marine energy conservation and emissions reduction and improve the operating efficiency to estimate the fuel consumption co2 emission and economy of prefabricated routes which planned by the captain based on voyage mission hydrometeorology and ship structure characteristics in order to select a reasonable route according to the voyage task at present the research on ship route estimation mainly focuses on two aspects one is considering ship safety and crew comfort in ship route design stage kanellopoulou 2019 yong bai et al 2015 the other is ship routing which aiming at the maximum profit of fleet to reasonably arrange ship routes and ship schedules meng et al 2012 szlapczynski r 2006 used the strategy of analyzing collision avoidance and steering conditions to estimate the safety of routes shenping hu et al 2017 carried out ship navigation safety risk assessment based on the fuzzy function risk assessment method cho s c et al 1996 proposed a route estimation model based on fleet size and liner routes bendall et al 2001 set an assign tasks model of the container ship branch transportation with the maximum profit goal perakis et al 1991 studied route planning using linear programming and mixed integer programming methods jeong et al 2019 proposed a multiple standard route planning technology which allows operators to objectively activate routes according to their own intentions dimitris konovessis and nicolas bialystocki 2016 estimated the energy consumption of the remaining voyage and proposed decision making and saving methods based on the main factors affecting fuel consumption and speed thomas dickson et al 2019 proposed a new relative risk assessment model based on fuzzy function on the basis of comprehensive safety assessment method and this model conducted risk assessment by calculating the probability of occurrence of hazards during ship navigation silvia pennino et al 2020 used dijkstra method to detect the optimum route with the highest seakeeping performance of the ship under the constraint of maximizing the non negative cost function without significantly affecting the voyage duration or the route length from the above analysis it can be seen that the current research on route estimation does not consider the impact of weather conditions especially rough sea conditions main engine rated power safety and other constraints on voyage fuel consumption co2 emissions and economy comprehensively the activated route is mostly based on the captain s experience and lack of quantitative scientific basis resulting in the selected route not being the most economical or time saving route huang daoguang and wang lei 2002 based on this under the constraints of the main engine rated power and ship navigation safety and considering the ship s seakeeping characteristics fully this paper intends to establish a ship route estimation model the model can analyze the impact of the difference in weather condition and voyage of multiple prefabricated routes between the departure port and the destination port on important indicators such as ship speed fuel consumption estimated time of arrival eta co2 emissions basic costs etc and can select the optimum route according to voyage mission so as to provide a practical way for operating ships to save fuel and improve efficiency corbett james j et al 2009 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem description taking the vlcc oil tanker as the research object the ship route estimation method comprehensively considering weather conditions and constraints is established under the constraints of ship speed the main engine rated power and safety with shortest eta lowest fuel consumption and co2 emissions of voyage as objective function respectively the method can analyze variation rules of ship speed resistance fuel consumption etc under the influence of winds and waves and estimate the key indicators such as voyage distance eta fuel consumption co2 emission and basic cost of different prefabricated route so as to provide theoretical basis for operating ships to select an appropriate route according to the voyage mission and their concerned targets 2 2 calculation of ship navigation resistance the total ship resistance mainly includes calm water resistance and additional resistance from winds and waves the additional resistance from winds and waves is the key influencing factors of speed loss fuel consumption and co2 emissions 2 2 1 ship resistance in calm water the calm water resistance r t i in each sailing leg mainly includes friction resistance r f i and residual resistance r r i 1 r t i r f i r r i 1 the frictional resistance in each sailing leg is calculated using the flat formula 2 r f i c f i δ c f 1 2 ρ v c i 2 s where c f i and δ c f are the coefficient of frictional resistance and roughness subsidy in the i th sailing leg respectively ρ is the seawater density kg m3 v c i is the calm water ship speed in the i th sailing leg m s and s is the wet surface area m2 the frictional resistance coefficient c f i is calculated using the schoenherr formula and the roughness subsidy coefficient δ c f is calculated using the ittc 1957 formula 3 c f i 0 4631 lgre i 2 6 4 re i v c i l w l ν 5 δ c f 105 k s l w l 1 3 0 64 10 3 where re i is the reynolds number in the i th sailing leg l w l is the designed waterline length m ν is the kinematic viscosity m2 s k s is the hull surface roughness where k s 150 10 6 calculated using the ittc method 2 a lap keller graph is used to calculate residual resistance through polynomial fitting of the graph the residual resistance coefficient c r is obtained by interpolation and the residual resistance correction coefficient is introduced at the same time the residual resistance calculation formula in each sailing leg is as follows 6 r r i a ξ 100 1 c r 1 2 ρ v c i 2 s 7 a a 1 sin b 1 l w l c 1 a 2 sin b 2 l w l c 2 where a is the residual resistance correction coefficient ξ is the percentage of length width correction and a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 and c 2 are the parameters obtained by fitting a number of ship model test data finally we combine 2 and 7 to obtain the total resistance in calm water 8 r t i r f i r r i c f i δ c f a ξ 100 1 c r 1 2 ρ v c i 2 s 2 2 2 ship speed loss in winds and waves as a consequence of the added resistance due to winds and waves the ship speed is often reduced from the service speed so called involuntary speed reduction the kwon s method can predict the involuntary drop of speed in irregular waves and winds in order to maintain the constant speed the main engine is necessary to provide more power under rough sea conditions townsin and kwon 1993 kwon 2008 proposed a corresponding formula for various sea states 9 δ v i v c i 100 c β i c u i c f i 10 δ v

in table 2 a function of ship type the beaufort number and ship displacement m3 f r i is the i th sailing leg froude number which associated with designed ship operation speed v c i in calm water conditions l p p is ship length between perpendiculars m g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 as shown in table 3 during the ship s navigation not only the involuntary speed reduction caused by winds and waves but also the voluntary speed reduction caused by safety constraints must be considered in order to ensure navigation safety for higher beaufort number b n 7 involuntary speed loss is as important as voluntary and voluntary speed loss needs to be considered at this time in addition prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 also showed that the voluntary speed loss is more significant than the involuntary speed loss only when significant wave height hs 3 m here the navigation safety is judged by ship s synchronous rolling wavelength λ s y n i under rough sea conditions when λ s y n i is between ship s length l o a and the maximum energy wavelength λ max e 40 times hs the ship must consider the voluntary speed reduction and sails at a speed less than the critical speed in the winds and waves krata and szlapczynska 2018 fengwu wang 1998 12 λ i 1 56 τ i 2 13 τ e i λ i 1 25 λ i v s i 14 λ s y n i v s i τ e i 0 78 τ e i 2 v s i τ e i 0 78 τ e i 2 2 v s i 2 τ e i 2 15 v s i v limit i

respectively l b p is length between perpendiculars m m and n are coefficients that depend on the course and beaufort number respectively as shown in table 4 2 3 calculation of sailing time the ship sailing time depends on the voyage and speed the difference of routes is not only reflected in the difference of voyage but more importantly the encounter of different winds and waves having a significant impact on the ship speed therefore it is necessary to divide the route to several sailing legs according to the weather information on the route such as the wind direction angle and bn as shown in fig 1 the total sailing time t t o t a l is the sum of the navigation time of each sailing leg 16 t t o t a l 0 5144 i 1 n d i s i v s i where n is total number of the sailing legs d i s i is voyage of the i th sailing leg nm 2 4 calculation of fuel consumption and emissions 2 4 1 calculation of voyage fuel consumption the total fuel consumption on the voyage consists of two parts one is the diesel generator fuel consumption f g e related to the sailing time the other is the main engine fuel consumption f m e which has a great impact on the total navigation fuel consumption the total fuel consumption of the voyage is as follows 17 f t o t a l f m e f g e the diesel generator fuel consumption is as follows 18 f g e q g e t t o t a l 10 3 19 q g e s f o c g e p g e 10 3 where q g e s f o c g e and p g e are fuel consumption per hour kg h fuel consumption rate g kw h and power kw of the diesel generator respectively according to the ship configuration and the diesel generator load is almost unchanged during the voyage s f o c g e is 190 g kw h and p g e is 800 kw the main engine fuel consumption is as follows 20 f m e 0 5144 i 1 n d i s i v s i q m e i 21 q m e i s f o c m

related to the type and load of main engine in this paper the main engine bench test data of vlcc oil tanker are used to fit the data 22 s f o c m e i 17 277 b m e i 3 11 226 b m e i 2 47 363 b m e i

and safety the main engine power in each sailing leg includes the calm water main engine power and the additional main engine power under the influence of weather conditions such as winds and waves 24 p m e i p t m e i δ p m e i 25 p t m e i p t i η d η s 26 p t i r t i v s i where p t m e i δ p m e i and p t i are the calm water main engine power kw main engine additional power kw and ship calm water resistance power kw in the i th sailing leg respectively η d is the propulsion efficiency which is a function of the main engine power obtained by fitting ship model test data η s is the shaft efficiency which is 0 99 generally the ship s additional resistance power and main engine power 27 δ p t i p t i n 1 δ v i v c i 28 δ p m e i δ p t i η s η d where δ p t i is the additional resistance power in the i th sailing leg kw n is an empirical constant related to ship type and loading status as shown in table 5 2 4 2 calculation of voyage emissions ship emissions are closely related to ship fuel consumption and selecting different prefabricated route has a great impact on ship emissions for example although a certain prefabricated route has a short voyage the fuel consumption is not the least affected by winds and waves etc so it is great significance to select an appropriate prefabricated route for ship energy conservation and emissions reduction 29 e t o t a l e m e e g e 30 e m e f m e c f m e 31 e g e f g e c f g e where e t o t a l e m e and e g e are the total co2 emissions t main engine co2 emissions t and diesel generator co2 emissions t respectively c f m e and c f g e are the main engine co2 emission factor kg co2 kg fuel and diesel generator co2 emission factor kg co2 kg fuel respectively the emission factors of various fuels are shown in table 6 iso 8217 2010 2 5 calculation of navigation costs the costs incurred during a complete voyage are numerous and complexes which are not easy to count so the costs incurred during the voyage only consider charter fees fuel costs and emission costs here perakis et al 1991 the total cost of the voyage is as follows 32 c t o t a l p c r e n t a l t t o t a l p c f u e l f t o t a l p c e m i e t o t a l where p c r e n t a l p c f u e l and p c e m i are the daily charter fee day fuel price t and co2 emission fee t respectively 2 6 ship route estimation model after the ship accepts a new voyage task the captain and the second mate carefully study the nautical charts the port of departure and arrival the hydro meteorological according to the voyage task and the ship s characteristics and preplan the route on the premise of safety by virtue of navigation experience however the hydro meteorological conditions of different prefabricated routes lead to the ship resistance increase differently and the ships will suffer different speed loss resulting in different indicators such as eta fuel consumption co2 emissions and costs based on this considering the constraints of the main engine rated power and safety and avoiding the subjectivity of the route planning the objective function and constraints are constructed as follows in order to obtain the shortest eta or the lowest fuel consumption and co2 emissions prefabricated route more accurately the shortest eta objective function 33 min t min t t o t a l 1 t t o t a l 2 t t o t a l 3 the minimum fuel consumption and co2 emissions objective

e i is the main engine power in the i th sailing leg kw p max m e is the main engine rated power kw e t a limit is the expected time of arrival required by voyage mission h by solving the constrained multivariable nonlinear objective function the estimation indicators of voyage eta fuel consumption costs and co2 emissions of each prefabricated route are obtained and the variation rules of speed additional resistance power main engine power and main engine fuel consumption per nautical mile with the weather conditions in each sailing leg of the prefabricated routes are analyzed and then the effects of weather conditions especially rough sea conditions on the estimation indicators of ship fuel consumption emissions and economy are also analyzed 3 model verification the accuracy of ship s calm water resistance model and speed loss model in winds and waves directly affects the accuracy of the route estimation model calculation therefore the data of ship model test and main engine bench test are used to verify the calm water resistance model respectively and the ship speed loss model in winds and waves is verified by referring to the research results of other scholars 3 1 verification of calm water resistance model figs 2 and 3 show the comparison between the simulation results and the ship model test results and calculation error for calm water resistance at different speeds of the vlcc oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively the results show that the maximum errors under full load and ballast are 1 73 and 0 20 respectively which are not more than 2 0 figs 4 and 5 show the comparison between the simulation results and the main engine bench test data provided by man company under full load and ballast respectively man b w 7g80me c9 5 2017 it can be seen from the figures that the maximum errors under full load and ballast are 1 52 and 0 30 respectively meeting the calculation requirements 3 2 verification of ship speed loss model due to the different design and structure parameters of each ship the influence of winds and waves is also different it is difficult to obtain the data of ship speed loss caused by winds and waves therefore by referring to the research results of other scholars on ship speed reduction we verify the characteristics of ship speed loss by using kwon method kwon 2008 indirectly kwon method has been widely used in the study of ship speed loss under different wind and wave conditions such as ore carriers nikolopoulos l 2016 meng et al 2016 containerships second imo ghg study 2009 shao et al 2012 m kim et al 2017 and oil tankers second imo ghg study 2009 lu et al 2015 etc in addition the approximation method in kwon 2008 showed good accuracy in comparison to more extensive calculation methods and this method was also recommended by the international maritime organization second imo ghg study et al 2009 to predict the involuntary speed loss of the ship with the use of the kwon s method the prediction of speed loss can be achieved quickly without complex hydrodynamic calculations shao 2013 the kwon s method kwon 2008 was also adopted to predict added resistance for weather routing in many previous researches such as larsson and simonsen 2014 and shao 2013 it was proved that the kwon s method kwon 2008 is very fast and reliable on ship operational performance prediction in lu et al 2015 xiaohe li et al 2018 also used the same method to verify ship stall in the study of speed optimization considering the influence of irregular winds and waves in addition to the influence of winds and waves under the condition of keeping the main engine power and initial speed unchanged the variation rule of ship speed loss under the head sea and wind and bow sea and wind when 3 b n 8 is analyzed respectively as shown in fig 6 as can be seen from the figures the ship s speed changes nonlinearly with b n and the speed loss under head sea and wind is more than bow sea and wind which is consistent with the ship s actual sailing speed therefore kwon method can accurately calculate the ship s stall characteristics under different wind and wave conditions 4 route estimation results and analysis 4 1 shipping market conditions and route information considering that the shipping market in different periods is different fuel oil prices and ship chartering fees also vary greatly therefore according to the recent shipping market information of clarkson research shipping intelligence network the vlcc oil tanker time charter rate is1400 d co2 emission fee is 10 t hfo and mdo is 53 pmt and 654 5 pmt respectively and ignoring fuel consumption and emissions when entering and leaving ports and loading and unloading cargo according to the voyage task and weather forecast data the ship s different prefabricated routes are estimated this paper analyzes the basic costs voyage eta fuel consumption and co2 emissions of three prefabricated routes as shown in fig 7 from tarifa port latitude 36 131753 n longitude 5 380438 w to dos bocas port latitude 19 829503 n longitude 91 92854 w and the global weather forecast data of august 2019 including u and v components of wind vector wave height etc in netcdf format are downloaded from ecmwf and the u and v components of wind vector and significant wave height at each turning point are obtained by each turning point information longitude latitude and time interpolation the true wind direction bn and other information of each turning point are obtained by combining the u and u component vectors the relative wind direction is calculated by the course and the true wind direction under the assumption that the vlcc ship does not deviate during its navigation the processed meteorological information is shown in table 7 it can be seen from table 7 and fig 7 that the voyage of prefabricated route 1 and 3 is shorter than that of prefabricated route 2 but the bn in prefabricated route 2 is very low and many sailing legs are in the downwind or crosswind the prefabricated route 1 and 3 are just the opposite and even these two prefabricated routes encounter bn 7 headwind or bow skew wind this sea condition will not only cause the increase of additional resistance and more involuntary speed loss but also due to the constraints of the main engine rated power and the navigation safety the ship must slow down 4 2 route estimation results and discussion the route estimation calculation program with constraints is developed independently according to the weather information in tables 7 and 8 main characteristic parameters of vlcc the initial speed and the limit eta are 16 knot and 340 h respectively and the voyage eta fuel consumption basic costs and co2 emissions of the three prefabricated routes under the shortest eta minimum fuel consumption and emissions are calculated respectively which are shown in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8 prefabricated route 1 is the shortest eta route compared with prefabricated route 1 and 2 the eta saves 36 58 h and 21 08 h but the fuel consumption increases by 179 00 t and 102 17 t and the co2 emissions also increase by 557 48 t and 318 21 t respectively prefabricated route 2 is the lowest fuel consumption the voyage fuel consumption and co2 emissions are reduced by 179 00 t 76 83 t and 557 48 t 239 27 t compared with prefabricated route 1 and 3 respectively however the voyage is 329 23 nm and 386 52 nm longer than the other two routes respectively it can be seen that taking the current weather forecast data as an example if the shortest eta objective function is chose eta per shorten 1 h will result in fuel consumption of prefabricated route 2 increases by 0 94 t h and 0 87 t h compared with the prefabricated route 2 and 3 the co2 emission also increases by 2 92 t h and 1 78 t h respectively and finally the cost increases by 18 27 h and 6 44 h if the minimum fuel consumption objective function is chose although eta increases 36 58 h and 14 79 h compared with prefabricated route 1 and 3 respectively the fuel consumption and co2 emission per nautical mile are reduced by 0 05 t nm 0 03 t nm and 0 16 t nm 0 10 t nm respectively and the cost is also saved by 18 27 nm and 11 83 nm this shows that the ship route estimation method comprehensively considering the influence of the voyage and the weather conditions such as winds and waves can estimate multiple ship prefabricated routes and analyze the differences of estimation indicators among prefabricated routes table 7 shows that due to the differences in the voyage and the relative wind direction bn and hs of each sailing leg the additional resistance power main engine power speed and fuel consumption per nautical mile are also different under the comprehensive influence of weather conditions and constraints the variation rules are respectively shown in figs 9 12 through calculation and analysis of the route estimation program it can be seen from figs 9 and 10 that the speed and additional resistance power of prefabricated route 1 are significantly higher than those of the other two prefabricated routes if keeping the initial speed 16 knot the main engine power of almost all sailing legs are higher than the rated power 24720 kw as shown by the red dotted line in fig 11 and the maximum value is 25775 76 kw so under the influence of weather conditions such as winds and waves and the main engine rated power there are different degrees of speed reduction in each sailing leg for example leg 17 occurs 0 49 knot speed reduction affected by winds and waves and the main engine rated power as shown in fig 11 and because of leg 19 is near the strait as shown in fig 8 the speed is reduced by 0 69 knot considering navigation safety on the contrary to prefabricated route 1 the speed and additional resistance power of prefabricated route 2 are less than those of the other two prefabricated routes at the same time the main engine power of each sailing leg is less than the main engine rated power as shown in the blue dotted line in fig 11 since the main engine power is not limited the blue dotted line and the solid line coincide the main engine power of leg 15 and 16 are the both largest which is 19739 26 kw and the speed and additional resistance power of these two sailing legs are also the largest which are 15 91 knot and 2144 34 kw respectively in addition under the constraint of eta limit the speed of leg 9 is the minimum which is 14 08 knot except for considering the safety factors although the voyage of prefabricated route 2 is not the shortest many sailing legs are in sea conditions such as downwind cross wind and low significant wave height which greatly reduces the increase of additional resistance power caused by winds and waves especially rough sea conditions which resulting in speed loss and fuel consumption as shown in fig 8 that although the voyage of prefabricated route 3 is the shortest the fuel consumption and eta are not the minimum moreover the sea conditions of prefabricated route 3 are similar to those of prefabricated route 1 the ship encounters headwind or crosswind in multiple sailing legs which is bound to increase additional resistance and although the main engine power of each sailing leg does not exceed the rated power the black dotted line and solid line overlapped in fig 11 but the ship encounters rough sea conditions with bn 7 hs 4 5 m and headwind in sailing leg 14 even the ship s synchronous rolling wavelength is 99 79 m which is less than the maximum energy wavelength 180 m the main engine power and additional resistance power are 22671 89 kw and 2333 18 kw respectively and the ship stalls at 1 64 knot as shown in figs 9 and 10 hence under the influence of sea conditions such as winds and waves shortening the voyage may not save fuel and navigation time the fuel consumption per nautical mile of each prefabricated route is shown in fig 12 affected by different sea conditions and speeds the average fuel consumption per nautical mile of prefabricated route 1 2 and 3 are 246 86 kg nm 195 14 kg nm and 227 55 kg nm respectively and the fuel consumption per nautical mile of prefabricated route 1 is higher than the other two prefabricated routes prefabricated route 3 is between them these show that the increasing ship speed and rough sea conditions cause different additional resistance which lead to different main engine power and ultimately affects the fuel consumption and emissions of the voyage 5 conclusions taking t300k vlcc oil tanker as the research object the mathematical model of ship route estimation that comprehensively considering weather conditions and constraints is established and the calculation program is developed with c language to estimate the voyage eta fuel consumption basic costs co2 emissions and other indicators of multiple prefabricated routes so as to provide a method for operating ships to select an appropriate prefabricated route according to voyage task the main conclusions are as follows 1 comparing the simulation results of calm water resistance with ship model test results the calculation error of calm water resistance under different loading conditions is less than 2 which verifies the accuracy and applicability of the calm water resistance model the variation trend of ship speed loss calculated by the route estimation model under the influence of weather conditions is also the same as other research results which verifies the applicability of the additional resistance simulation module 2 according to the current weather forecast data prefabricated route 1 is the shortest eta objective function route which saves 36 58 h and 21 80 h compared with prefabricated route 1 and 2 respectively however due to encounter sea conditions such as headwind bow wind and high wave height the average fuel consumption and co2 emissions per nautical mile of prefabricated route 1 are increased by 20 95 and 7 82 compared with prefabricated route 1 and 2 respectively resulting in the cost increase by 14 44 and 8 23 3 under the same sea conditions prefabricated route 2 is the lowest fuel consumption and co2 emissions objective function route but its voyage is larger than that of prefabricated route 1 and 3 because appropriately increasing the navigation distance is to avoid rough sea conditions and take advantage of favorable weather conditions then multiple sailing legs of prefabricated route 2 are in the downwind or crosswind the ship s additional resistance is also reduced so the average fuel consumption and co2 emission per nautical mile are reduced by 26 51 and 16 61 and the cost is also saved by 16 88 and 7 26 respectively moreover the increased cost caused by longer navigation time and voyage is far less than the benefits brought by the reduction of fuel consumption and co2 emissions 4 affected by irregular winds and waves the additional resistance in each sailing leg of the prefabricated routes has increased to varying degrees the main engine power needs to be adjusted according to sea conditions under the shortest eta objective function if the ship maintains the initial speed 16 knot when the ship encounters bn 4 headwind or bow wind and hs 1 3 m the main engine power exceeds the rated power and the speed is reduced by at least 0 3 knot under the main engine rated power constraint under the minimum fuel consumption and co2 emissions objective function in order to reduce the ship s fuel consumption and co2 emissions the ship makes full use of favorable weather conditions to reduce speed within the allowable voyage of the voyage eta limit this shows that different objective function leads to different choices of prefabricated routes and due to the comprehensive influence of weather conditions and constraints ships have different benefits in terms of fuel consumption co2 emissions and navigation time although some research results have been achieved in the prefabricated routes estimation there are still some shortcomings in the research method of this paper for example weather forecast data only considers the influence of wind speed wind direction and significant wave height not ocean currents in the follow up work it will be further improved on the basis of current research credit authorship contribution statement wei du

20867,taking a t300k vlcc oil tanker as the research object the ship route estimation model with minimum fuel consumption co2 emissions and shortest eta as the objective function is established which considers the weather conditions and constraints of the main engine rated power and safety comprehensively on the basis of model verification combined with the weather forecast data and the current maritime market conditions the estimation indicators were analyzed the research results show that prefabricated route 1 and 2 were the shortest eta and the minimum fuel consumption routes respectively although the prefabricated route 1 saved 36 58 h compared with the prefabricated route 2 the fuel consumption and co2 emissions of the prefabricated route 2 were reduced by 0 94 t h and 2 92 t h and under the shortest eta objective function if keeping the initial speed the main engine would be limited by rated power when the ship encounters beaufort number 4 headwind or bow wind accordingly the ship route estimation method comprehensively considering weather conditions and constraints can analyze the variation rules of the fuel consumption speed loss co2 emissions and costs of multiple prefabricated routes under different objective functions which can provide decision support for shipping companies to improve operation economy keywords weather conditions constraints ship speed loss route estimation 1 introduction more than 80 of global trade is carried out by shipping transports which provides a low cost and reliable method of international transportation the international maritime organization imo 2018 approved an agreement in 2018 to reduce co2 emissions per transport unit by 40 by 2030 and 70 by 2050 compared with 2008 facing such a severe situation it is very important for marine energy conservation and emissions reduction and improve the operating efficiency to estimate the fuel consumption co2 emission and economy of prefabricated routes which planned by the captain based on voyage mission hydrometeorology and ship structure characteristics in order to select a reasonable route according to the voyage task at present the research on ship route estimation mainly focuses on two aspects one is considering ship safety and crew comfort in ship route design stage kanellopoulou 2019 yong bai et al 2015 the other is ship routing which aiming at the maximum profit of fleet to reasonably arrange ship routes and ship schedules meng et al 2012 szlapczynski r 2006 used the strategy of analyzing collision avoidance and steering conditions to estimate the safety of routes shenping hu et al 2017 carried out ship navigation safety risk assessment based on the fuzzy function risk assessment method cho s c et al 1996 proposed a route estimation model based on fleet size and liner routes bendall et al 2001 set an assign tasks model of the container ship branch transportation with the maximum profit goal perakis et al 1991 studied route planning using linear programming and mixed integer programming methods jeong et al 2019 proposed a multiple standard route planning technology which allows operators to objectively activate routes according to their own intentions dimitris konovessis and nicolas bialystocki 2016 estimated the energy consumption of the remaining voyage and proposed decision making and saving methods based on the main factors affecting fuel consumption and speed thomas dickson et al 2019 proposed a new relative risk assessment model based on fuzzy function on the basis of comprehensive safety assessment method and this model conducted risk assessment by calculating the probability of occurrence of hazards during ship navigation silvia pennino et al 2020 used dijkstra method to detect the optimum route with the highest seakeeping performance of the ship under the constraint of maximizing the non negative cost function without significantly affecting the voyage duration or the route length from the above analysis it can be seen that the current research on route estimation does not consider the impact of weather conditions especially rough sea conditions main engine rated power safety and other constraints on voyage fuel consumption co2 emissions and economy comprehensively the activated route is mostly based on the captain s experience and lack of quantitative scientific basis resulting in the selected route not being the most economical or time saving route huang daoguang and wang lei 2002 based on this under the constraints of the main engine rated power and ship navigation safety and considering the ship s seakeeping characteristics fully this paper intends to establish a ship route estimation model the model can analyze the impact of the difference in weather condition and voyage of multiple prefabricated routes between the departure port and the destination port on important indicators such as ship speed fuel consumption estimated time of arrival eta co2 emissions basic costs etc and can select the optimum route according to voyage mission so as to provide a practical way for operating ships to save fuel and improve efficiency corbett james j et al 2009 2 mathematical model 2 1 problem description taking the vlcc oil tanker as the research object the ship route estimation method comprehensively considering weather conditions and constraints is established under the constraints of ship speed the main engine rated power and safety with shortest eta lowest fuel consumption and co2 emissions of voyage as objective function respectively the method can analyze variation rules of ship speed resistance fuel consumption etc under the influence of winds and waves and estimate the key indicators such as voyage distance eta fuel consumption co2 emission and basic cost of different prefabricated route so as to provide theoretical basis for operating ships to select an appropriate route according to the voyage mission and their concerned targets 2 2 calculation of ship navigation resistance the total ship resistance mainly includes calm water resistance and additional resistance from winds and waves the additional resistance from winds and waves is the key influencing factors of speed loss fuel consumption and co2 emissions 2 2 1 ship resistance in calm water the calm water resistance r t i in each sailing leg mainly includes friction resistance r f i and residual resistance r r i 1 r t i r f i r r i 1 the frictional resistance in each sailing leg is calculated using the flat formula 2 r f i c f i δ c f 1 2 ρ v c i 2 s where c f i and δ c f are the coefficient of frictional resistance and roughness subsidy in the i th sailing leg respectively ρ is the seawater density kg m3 v c i is the calm water ship speed in the i th sailing leg m s and s is the wet surface area m2 the frictional resistance coefficient c f i is calculated using the schoenherr formula and the roughness subsidy coefficient δ c f is calculated using the ittc 1957 formula 3 c f i 0 4631 lgre i 2 6 4 re i v c i l w l ν 5 δ c f 105 k s l w l 1 3 0 64 10 3 where re i is the reynolds number in the i th sailing leg l w l is the designed waterline length m ν is the kinematic viscosity m2 s k s is the hull surface roughness where k s 150 10 6 calculated using the ittc method 2 a lap keller graph is used to calculate residual resistance through polynomial fitting of the graph the residual resistance coefficient c r is obtained by interpolation and the residual resistance correction coefficient is introduced at the same time the residual resistance calculation formula in each sailing leg is as follows 6 r r i a ξ 100 1 c r 1 2 ρ v c i 2 s 7 a a 1 sin b 1 l w l c 1 a 2 sin b 2 l w l c 2 where a is the residual resistance correction coefficient ξ is the percentage of length width correction and a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 and c 2 are the parameters obtained by fitting a number of ship model test data finally we combine 2 and 7 to obtain the total resistance in calm water 8 r t i r f i r r i c f i δ c f a ξ 100 1 c r 1 2 ρ v c i 2 s 2 2 2 ship speed loss in winds and waves as a consequence of the added resistance due to winds and waves the ship speed is often reduced from the service speed so called involuntary speed reduction the kwon s method can predict the involuntary drop of speed in irregular waves and winds in order to maintain the constant speed the main engine is necessary to provide more power under rough sea conditions townsin and kwon 1993 kwon 2008 proposed a corresponding formula for various sea states 9 δ v i v c i 100 c β i c u i c f i 10 δ v

sailing leg speed direction reduction coefficient depending on wind direction angle with respect to the ship s bow as shown fig 1 and the beaufort number bn as shown table 1 c u i is the i th sailing leg speed reduction coefficient varying with ship s block coefficient c b loading conditions and the i th sailing leg froude number f r i c f i is the i th sailing leg hull form coefficient as shown in table 2 a function of ship type the beaufort number and ship displacement m3 f r i is the i th sailing leg froude number which associated with designed ship operation speed v c i in calm water conditions l p p is ship length between perpendiculars m g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 as shown in table 3 during the ship s navigation not only the involuntary speed reduction caused by winds and waves but also the voluntary speed reduction caused by safety constraints must be considered in order to ensure navigation safety for higher beaufort number b n 7 involuntary speed loss is as important as voluntary and voluntary speed loss needs to be considered at this time in addition prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 also showed that the voluntary speed loss is more significant than the involuntary speed loss only when significant wave height hs 3 m here the navigation safety is judged by ship s synchronous rolling wavelength λ s y n i under rough sea conditions when λ s y n i is between ship s length l o a and the maximum energy wavelength λ max e 40 times hs the ship must consider the voluntary speed reduction and sails at a speed less than the critical speed in the winds and waves krata and szlapczynska 2018 fengwu wang 1998 12 λ i 1 56 τ i 2 13 τ e i λ i 1 25 λ i v s i 14 λ s y n i v s i τ e i 0 78 τ e i 2 v s i τ e i 0 78 τ e i 2 2 v s i 2 τ e i 2 15 v s i v limit i

respectively l b p is length between perpendiculars m m and n are coefficients that depend on the course and beaufort number respectively as shown in table 4 2 3 calculation of sailing time the ship sailing time depends on the voyage and speed the difference of routes is not only reflected in the difference of voyage but more importantly the encounter of different winds and waves having a significant impact on the ship speed therefore it is necessary to divide the route to several sailing legs according to the weather information on the route such as the wind direction angle and bn as shown in fig 1 the total sailing time t t o t a l is the sum of the navigation time of each sailing leg 16 t t o t a l 0 5144 i 1 n d i s i v s i where n is total number of the sailing legs d i s i is voyage of the i th sailing leg nm 2 4 calculation of fuel consumption and emissions 2 4 1 calculation of voyage fuel consumption the total fuel consumption on the voyage consists of two parts one is the diesel generator fuel consumption f g e related to the sailing time the other is the main engine fuel consumption f m e which has a great impact on the total navigation fuel consumption the total fuel consumption of the voyage is as follows 17 f t o t a l f m e f g e the diesel generator fuel consumption is as follows 18 f g e q g e t t o t a l 10 3 19 q g e s f o c g e p g e 10 3 where q g e s f o c g e and p g e are fuel consumption per hour kg h fuel consumption rate g kw h and power kw of the diesel generator respectively according to the ship configuration and the diesel generator load is almost unchanged during the voyage s f o c g e is 190 g kw h and p g e is 800 kw the main engine fuel consumption is as follows 20 f m e 0 5144 i 1 n d i s i v s i q m e i 21 q m e i s f o c m

related to the type and load of main engine in this paper the main engine bench test data of vlcc oil tanker are used to fit the data 22 s f o c m e i 17 277 b m e i 3 11 226 b m e i 2 47 363 b m e i

and safety the main engine power in each sailing leg includes the calm water main engine power and the additional main engine power under the influence of weather conditions such as winds and waves 24 p m e i p t m e i δ p m e i 25 p t m e i p t i η d η s 26 p t i r t i v s i where p t m e i δ p m e i and p t i are the calm water main engine power kw main engine additional power kw and ship calm water resistance power kw in the i th sailing leg respectively η d is the propulsion efficiency which is a function of the main engine power obtained by fitting ship model test data η s is the shaft efficiency which is 0 99 generally the ship s additional resistance power and main engine power 27 δ p t i p t i n 1 δ v i v c i 28 δ p m e i δ p t i η s η d where δ p t i is the additional resistance power in the i th sailing leg kw n is an empirical constant related to ship type and loading status as shown in table 5 2 4 2 calculation of voyage emissions ship emissions are closely related to ship fuel consumption and selecting different prefabricated route has a great impact on ship emissions for example although a certain prefabricated route has a short voyage the fuel consumption is not the least affected by winds and waves etc so it is great significance to select an appropriate prefabricated route for ship energy conservation and emissions reduction 29 e t o t a l e m e e g e 30 e m e

are the main engine co2 emission factor kg co2 kg fuel and diesel generator co2 emission factor kg co2 kg fuel respectively the emission factors of various fuels are shown in table 6 iso 8217 2010 2 5 calculation of navigation costs the costs incurred during a complete voyage are numerous and complexes which are not easy to count so the costs incurred during the voyage only consider charter fees fuel costs and emission costs here perakis et al 1991 the total cost of the voyage is as follows 32 c t o t a l p c r e n t a l t t o t a l p c f u e l f t o t a l p c e m i e t o t a l where p c r e n t a l p c f u e l and p c e m i are the daily charter fee day fuel price t and co2 emission fee t respectively 2 6 ship route estimation model after the ship accepts a new voyage task the captain and the second mate carefully study the nautical charts the port of departure and arrival the hydro meteorological according to the voyage task and the ship s characteristics and preplan the route on the premise of safety by virtue of navigation experience however the hydro meteorological conditions of different prefabricated routes lead to the ship resistance increase differently and the ships will suffer different speed loss resulting in different indicators such as eta fuel consumption co2 emissions and costs based on this considering the constraints of the main engine rated power and safety and avoiding the subjectivity of the route planning the objective function and constraints are constructed as follows in order to obtain the shortest eta or the lowest fuel consumption and co2 emissions prefabricated route more accurately the shortest eta objective function 33 min t min t t o t a l 1 t t o t a l 2 t t o t a l 3 the minimum fuel consumption and co2 emissions objective

additional resistance power main engine power and main engine fuel consumption per nautical mile with the weather conditions in each sailing leg of the prefabricated routes are analyzed and then the effects of weather conditions especially rough sea conditions on the estimation indicators of ship fuel consumption emissions and economy are also analyzed 3 model verification the accuracy of ship s calm water resistance model and speed loss model in winds and waves directly affects the accuracy of the route estimation model calculation therefore the data of ship model test and main engine bench test are used to verify the calm water resistance model respectively and the ship speed loss model in winds and waves is verified by referring to the research results of other scholars 3 1 verification of calm water resistance model figs 2 and 3 show the comparison between the simulation results and the ship model test results and calculation error for calm water resistance at different speeds of the vlcc oil tanker under full load and ballast load respectively the results show that the maximum errors under full load and ballast are 1 73 and 0 20 respectively which are not more than 2 0 figs 4 and 5 show the comparison between the simulation results and the main engine bench test data provided by man company under full load and ballast respectively man b w 7g80me c9 5 2017 it can be seen from the figures that the maximum errors under full load and ballast are 1 52 and 0 30 respectively meeting the calculation requirements 3 2 verification of ship speed loss model due to the different design and structure parameters of each ship the influence of winds and waves is also different it is difficult to obtain the data of ship speed loss caused by winds and waves therefore by referring to the research results of other scholars on ship speed reduction we verify the characteristics of ship speed loss by using kwon method kwon 2008 indirectly kwon method has been widely used in the study of ship speed loss under different wind and wave conditions such as ore carriers nikolopoulos l 2016 meng et al 2016 containerships second imo ghg study 2009 shao et al 2012 m kim et al 2017 and oil tankers second imo ghg study 2009 lu et al 2015 etc in addition the approximation method in kwon 2008 showed good accuracy in comparison to more extensive calculation methods and this method was also recommended by the international maritime organization second imo ghg study et al 2009 to predict the involuntary speed loss of the ship with the use of the kwon s method the prediction of speed loss can be achieved quickly without complex hydrodynamic calculations shao 2013 the kwon s method kwon 2008 was also adopted to predict added resistance for weather routing in many previous researches such as larsson and simonsen 2014 and shao 2013 it was proved that the kwon s method kwon 2008 is very fast and reliable on ship operational performance prediction in lu et al 2015 xiaohe li et al 2018 also used the same method to verify ship stall in the study of speed optimization considering the influence of irregular winds and waves in addition to the influence of winds and waves under the condition of keeping the main engine power and initial speed unchanged the variation rule of ship speed loss under the head sea and wind and bow sea and wind when 3 b n 8 is analyzed respectively as shown in fig 6 as can be seen from the figures the ship s speed changes nonlinearly with b n and the speed loss under head sea and wind is more than bow sea and wind which is consistent with the ship s actual sailing speed therefore kwon method can accurately calculate the ship s stall characteristics under different wind and wave conditions 4 route estimation results and analysis 4 1 shipping market conditions and route information considering that the shipping market in different periods is different fuel oil prices and ship chartering fees also vary greatly therefore according to the recent shipping market information of clarkson research shipping intelligence network the vlcc oil tanker time charter rate is1400 d co2 emission fee is 10 t hfo and mdo is 53 pmt and 654 5 pmt respectively and ignoring fuel consumption and emissions when entering and leaving ports and loading and unloading cargo according to the voyage task and weather forecast data the ship s different prefabricated routes are estimated this paper analyzes the basic costs voyage eta fuel consumption and co2 emissions of three prefabricated routes as shown in fig 7 from tarifa port latitude 36 131753 n longitude 5 380438 w to dos bocas port latitude 19 829503 n longitude 91 92854 w and the global weather forecast data of august 2019 including u and v components of wind vector wave height etc in netcdf format are downloaded from ecmwf and the u and v components of wind vector and significant wave height at each turning point are obtained by each turning point information longitude latitude and time interpolation the true wind direction bn and other information of each turning point are obtained by combining the u and u component vectors the relative wind direction is calculated by the course and the true wind direction under the assumption that the vlcc ship does not deviate during its navigation the processed meteorological information is shown in table 7 it can be seen from table 7 and fig 7 that the voyage of prefabricated route 1 and 3 is shorter than that of prefabricated route 2 but the bn in prefabricated route 2 is very low and many sailing legs are in the downwind or crosswind the prefabricated route 1 and 3 are just the opposite and even these two prefabricated routes encounter bn 7 headwind or bow skew wind this sea condition will not only cause the increase of additional resistance and more involuntary speed loss but also due to the constraints of the main engine rated power and the navigation safety the ship must slow down 4 2 route estimation results and discussion the route estimation calculation program with constraints is developed independently according to the weather information in tables 7 and 8 main characteristic parameters of vlcc the initial speed and the limit eta are 16 knot and 340 h respectively and the voyage eta fuel consumption basic costs and co2 emissions of the three prefabricated routes under the shortest eta minimum fuel consumption and emissions are calculated respectively which are shown in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8 prefabricated route 1 is the shortest eta route compared with prefabricated route 1 and 2 the eta saves 36 58 h and 21 08 h but the fuel consumption increases by 179 00 t and 102 17 t and the co2 emissions also increase by 557 48 t and 318 21 t respectively prefabricated route 2 is the lowest fuel consumption the voyage fuel consumption and co2 emissions are reduced by 179 00 t 76 83 t and 557 48 t 239 27 t compared with prefabricated route 1 and 3 respectively however the voyage is 329 23 nm and 386 52 nm longer than the other two routes respectively it can be seen that taking the current weather forecast data as an example if the shortest eta objective function is chose eta per shorten 1 h will result in fuel consumption of prefabricated route 2 increases by 0 94 t h and 0 87 t h compared with the prefabricated route 2 and 3 the co2 emission also increases by 2 92 t h and 1 78 t h respectively and finally the cost increases by 18 27 h and 6 44 h if the minimum fuel consumption objective function is chose although eta increases 36 58 h and 14 79 h compared with prefabricated route 1 and 3 respectively the fuel consumption and co2 emission per nautical mile are reduced by 0 05 t nm 0 03 t nm and 0 16 t nm 0 10 t nm respectively and the cost is also saved by 18 27 nm and 11 83 nm this shows that the ship route estimation method comprehensively considering the influence of the voyage and the weather conditions such as winds and waves can estimate multiple ship prefabricated routes and analyze the differences of estimation indicators among prefabricated routes table 7 shows that due to the differences in the voyage and the relative wind direction bn and hs of each sailing leg the additional resistance power main engine power speed and fuel consumption per nautical mile are also different under the comprehensive influence of weather conditions and constraints the variation rules are respectively shown in figs 9 12 through calculation and analysis of the route estimation program it can be seen from figs 9 and 10 that the speed and additional resistance power of prefabricated route 1 are significantly higher than those of the other two prefabricated routes if keeping the initial speed 16 knot the main engine power of almost all sailing legs are higher than the rated power 24720 kw as shown by the red dotted line in fig 11 and the maximum value is 25775 76 kw so under the influence of weather conditions such as winds and waves and the main engine rated power there are different degrees of speed reduction in each sailing leg for example leg 17 occurs 0 49 knot speed reduction affected by winds and waves and the main engine rated power as shown in fig 11 and because of leg 19 is near the strait as shown in fig 8 the speed is reduced by 0 69 knot considering navigation safety on the contrary to prefabricated route 1 the speed and additional resistance power of prefabricated route 2 are less than those of the other two prefabricated routes at the same time the main engine power of each sailing leg is less than the main engine rated power as shown in the blue dotted line in fig 11 since the main engine power is not limited the blue dotted line and the solid line coincide the main engine power of leg 15 and 16 are the both largest which is 19739 26 kw and the speed and additional resistance power of these two sailing legs are also the largest which are 15 91 knot and 2144 34 kw respectively in addition under the constraint of eta limit the speed of leg 9 is the minimum which is 14 08 knot except for considering the safety factors although the voyage of prefabricated route 2 is not the shortest many sailing legs are in sea conditions such as downwind cross wind and low significant wave height which greatly reduces the increase of additional resistance power caused by winds and waves especially rough sea conditions which resulting in speed loss and fuel consumption as shown in fig 8 that although the voyage of prefabricated route 3 is the shortest the fuel consumption and eta are not the minimum moreover the sea conditions of prefabricated route 3 are similar to those of prefabricated route 1 the ship encounters headwind or crosswind in multiple sailing legs which is bound to increase additional resistance and although the main engine power of each sailing leg does not exceed the rated power the black dotted line and solid line overlapped in fig 11 but the ship encounters rough sea conditions with bn 7 hs 4 5 m and headwind in sailing leg 14 even the ship s synchronous rolling wavelength is 99 79 m which is less than the maximum energy wavelength 180 m the main engine power and additional resistance power are 22671 89 kw and 2333 18 kw respectively and the ship stalls at 1 64 knot as shown in figs 9 and 10 hence under the influence of sea conditions such as winds and waves shortening the voyage may not save fuel and navigation time the fuel consumption per nautical mile of each prefabricated route is shown in fig 12 affected by different sea conditions and speeds the average fuel consumption per nautical mile of prefabricated route 1 2 and 3 are 246 86 kg nm 195 14 kg nm and 227 55 kg nm respectively and the fuel consumption per nautical mile of prefabricated route 1 is higher than the other two prefabricated routes prefabricated route 3 is between them these show that the increasing ship speed and rough sea conditions cause different additional resistance which lead to different main engine power and ultimately affects the fuel consumption and emissions of the voyage 5 conclusions taking t300k vlcc oil tanker as the research object the mathematical model of ship route estimation that comprehensively considering weather conditions and constraints is established and the calculation program is developed with c language to estimate the voyage eta fuel consumption basic costs co2 emissions and other indicators of multiple prefabricated routes so as to provide a method for operating ships to select an appropriate prefabricated route according to voyage task the main conclusions are as follows 1 comparing the simulation results of calm water resistance with ship model test results the calculation error of calm water resistance under different loading conditions is less than 2 which verifies the accuracy and applicability of the calm water resistance model the variation trend of ship speed loss calculated by the route estimation model under the influence of weather conditions is also the same as other research results which verifies the applicability of the additional resistance simulation module 2 according to the current weather forecast data prefabricated route 1 is the shortest eta objective function route which saves 36 58 h and 21 80 h compared with prefabricated route 1 and 2 respectively however due to encounter sea conditions such as headwind bow wind and high wave height the average fuel consumption and co2 emissions per nautical mile of prefabricated route 1 are increased by 20 95 and 7 82 compared with prefabricated route 1 and 2 respectively resulting in the cost increase by 14 44 and 8 23 3 under the same sea conditions prefabricated route 2 is the lowest fuel consumption and co2 emissions objective function route but its voyage is larger than that of prefabricated route 1 and 3 because appropriately increasing the navigation distance is to avoid rough sea conditions and take advantage of favorable weather conditions then multiple sailing legs of prefabricated route 2 are in the downwind or crosswind the ship s additional resistance is also reduced so the average fuel consumption and co2 emission per nautical mile are reduced by 26 51 and 16 61 and the cost is also saved by 16 88 and 7 26 respectively moreover the increased cost caused by longer navigation time and voyage is far less than the benefits brought by the reduction of fuel consumption and co2 emissions 4 affected by irregular winds and waves the additional resistance in each sailing leg of the prefabricated routes has increased to varying degrees the main engine power needs to be adjusted according to sea conditions under the shortest eta objective function if the ship maintains the initial speed 16 knot when the ship encounters bn 4 headwind or bow wind and hs 1 3 m the main engine power exceeds the rated power and the speed is reduced by at least 0 3 knot under the main engine rated power constraint under the minimum fuel consumption and co2 emissions objective function in order to reduce the ship s fuel consumption and co2 emissions the ship makes full use of favorable weather conditions to reduce speed within the allowable voyage of the voyage eta limit this shows that different objective function leads to different choices of prefabricated routes and due to the comprehensive influence of weather conditions and constraints ships have different benefits in terms of fuel consumption co2 emissions and navigation time although some research results have been achieved in the prefabricated routes estimation there are still some shortcomings in the research method of this paper for example weather forecast data only considers the influence of wind speed wind direction and significant wave height not ocean currents in the follow up work it will be further improved on the basis of current research credit authorship contribution statement wei du

20868,traditionally it has been difficult to evaluate the operating efficiency of ships using objective and credible indicators in order for ship owners and seafarers to confidently plan an optimized transportation strategy considering accurate ship performance this is due to a number of factors that affect operating performance the type of ship cargo ship speed sea route and weather conditions

shipbuilding and the shipping industry due to the increase in fuel costs it affects the corporate strategies of main agents in the industries including shipyards ship owners charterers operators or seafarers and equipment manufacturers however it has traditionally been difficult to evaluate operating efficiency in terms of economical transportation by using some kind of objective and credible indicator for individual ships or whole fleets since there were many factors including the type of ship cargo ship speed sea route weather conditions which affected operating performance recently as technologies to measure store and transmit on board data had developed researchers had begun to suggest diverse approaches for quantifying the operating efficiency there were studies that quantify expenditure as a value amount drewry maritime research categorized cost factors that affected the operating expenditure of ships they explored the statistical operating costs according to ship type including container dry bulk oil tanker chemical tanker lngc and so on nationality and year drewry maritime research 2019 the operating costs were subdivided into manning insurance stores spares lubricating oils repair maintenance dry docking management administration and so on polo suggested a cost structure considering three cost factors fixed cost voyage cost and voyage cost eventually he also distinguished technical factors from economic factors polo 2012 after polo investigated the changes in opex from 2000 to 2009 he tried to anticipate the future of marine transportation from past trends schinas and bulter proposed a method to evaluate the commercial incentives of an lng fueled vessel schinas and bulter 2016 and the numerical examples of a 1500 teu container ship considering capex opex and voyex were presented in addition there were studies that estimate full scale performance including rpm power and fuel oil consumption bialystocki and konovessis quantified the effect of the draft displacement environmental load and direction as well as hull and propeller roughness on fuel oil consumption by analyzing 418 noon reports in order to reduce fuel oil consumption bialystocki and konovessis 2016 you et al verified estimated rpm and power in comparison with the measured values you et al 2018a you et al proposed an approach to estimate the most efficient speed for an lngc after the operating cost was evaluated by considering fuel oil and gas consumption as well as bog combustion you et al 2018b as a follow up research you et al investigated the effect of fouling on the sea margin as well as fuel oil and gas consumption you et al 2020 meng et al proposed modeling to calculate the fuel oil consumption rate by considering sailing speed displacement sea conditions weather conditions and shipping log data meng et al 2016 wiesmann explained the economic benefits of slow steaming and summarized the technological problems that could arise not in design condition but in slow steaming conditions wiesmann 2010 while the summarized studies were focusing on the economics and performance separately there have been attempts to combine the economics with the performance to make decisions on the transportation strategy of ships wang and meng proposed an approach to decide the sea route and transportation plan by considering uncertainties at ports or at sea wang and meng 2012 du et al obtained the optimal solution for a 9000 teu container ship by considering trim optimization as well as sailing speed displacement sea conditions and weather conditions du et al 2019 the presented approaches were developed by assuming the simplified performance of a ship from a pragmatic point of view engineers in a shipbuilding company had strong demands considering detailed design information and accurate mathematical model this is due to the fact that engineers prefer to decide the optimum design condition in terms of expenditure with physical and engineering evidence a ship owner who operates large fleets of lngcs require the optimized operation condition in terms of ship speed and bor to decide the initial fleet operation plans it is in line with technological trends focusing on the optimized transportation strategy considering detailed equipment operation and operational profile of a ship kim et al 2020 in this paper it was aimed to estimate the operating profit based on a mathematical by considering detailed design information accurate hydrodynamic performance and operation after the estimated values including capex opex and voyex were reviewed it was attempted to decide an optimized transportation strategy in terms of ship speed and bor to maximize the estimated operating profit the acquired strategy can be an option that ship owners look into as the potential design condition and can be an initial fleet operation plan for a series of lngcs to accomplish the described purpose the mathematical model from the maneuvering equations of motion for an lngc was first constructed operating profit was assumed to be the value of the expected income representatively shipping rate minus capex opex and voyex an integrated model considering the performance and operation was suggested considering the consistency of each expenditure especially the simulation method was focusing on the quantification of the uncertain values of voyex the feasibility was evaluated for the given sea route and weather conditions by assuming a representative operation profile of a liner the operating profits of 1 cycle of operation were respectively estimated for the laden voyage design condition and ballast voyage according to ship speed and bor to find the optimized transportation strategy over the entire project life cycle of 25 years the operating profit was converted into a value considering the working day re docking period and travel time for repairing work the operating profit surface was plotted according to ship speeds of both ways the operating profit surface was replotted to consider the effect of the number of deliveries on the shipping rate 2 mathematical model for evaluating the operating profit of lngc detailed categorization or subdivision of income and expenditure was needed to construct an integrated mathematical model for evaluating operating profit operating profit could be acquired by considering the expected income capex opex and voyex as shown in fig 1 schinas and bulter 2016 and eq 1 since a ship owner earns a profit from a charterer based on a mid term or long term contract lng freight rate could be expected during the period of the contract therefore this income was represented as the shipping rate in the figure ship owners pay for the newbuilding price including the debt for ship financing to purchase new ships capex was the summation of newbuilding prices and total interest using the compound interest method the periodic expense for maintenance of the lngc and contract based expenses including insurance or salary could be anticipated opex is denoted as the expected expenditure and includes manning insurance stores spares lubricating oils repair maintenance dry docking and management administration the values were acquired from the statistical investigation of 170 180 k lng carriers with me gi engines drewry maritime research 2019 in addition there were voyex that could not be estimated in advance because of significant uncertainties of environmental loads including wind and waves draft ship speed control logic to follow the planned sea route operating of main engine and generator bor of lng cargo tanks gcu operation and etc voyex mainly consists of fuel oil and gas consumption costs port fee and channel fee for most of merchant ships and bog combustion costs for lngcs here the channel fee denoted in fig 1 was not included in the estimated voyex since the ship did not pass through a channel 2 1 expected operating income fig 2 shows the shipping rate in 2018 disclosed by bloomberg bloomberg intelligence 2019 since most of the countries that consume lng are located in east asia e g china japan south korea or europe which are part of the northern hemisphere we could observe the lng shipping rate tendency to be higher in autumn and winter and lower in spring and summer the variation of the shipping rate could be taken into account in the integrated mathematical model however the shipping rate was assumed to be fixed it was not meaningful in the initial design stage where there were a lot of uncertain factors in addition it was necessary to analyze the estimated operating profit by reducing any potential misinterpretation due to the consideration of too many variables here the shipping rate was 115 000 usd day and it was the mean value of the highest and the lowest values for the 2018 shipping rate 2 2 expected capex opex and voyex table 1 shows the detailed operating income capex opex and voyex for an lngc extracted from the referred documents all the subdivided values for operating income capex and opex were set using the operating costs specified for 170 k 180 k class lngcs with me gi engines otherwise values for voyex were set considering the fleet management in particular the assumed total financing budget was estimated by summing the newbuilding price of an lngc compound interest and entire project life cycle they were 186 million dollars 1 7 interest rate and 25 years 2 3 fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost the fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost have to be separately considered with other costs of voyex in this research an integrated mathematical model was constructed based on the maneuvering equations of motion to estimate those values accurately the model was developed from a modular concept that was the basis of the maneuvering equations of motion the detailed design information and mathematical model to consider hydrodynamic characteristics are described as follows table 2 shows the principal particulars and assumed operation profile of the 173 k class lngc studied in this research the lngc was constructed as a membrane type and had two main engines of me gi type and three generators for electric power supply it was assumed that electric power requested for supplying the lng fuel from lng fuel tanks or bog from lng cargo tanks to the main engines were identical fig 3 shows the coordinates used to solve the mathematical model body fixed coordinate including forces and moment as well as earth fixed coordinate are defined the incident angle and magnitude of wind and waves are also indicated the maneuvering equations of motion are shown in eq 2 2 3 1 maneuvering equations of motion considering hull propellers and rudders as described the hydrodynamic forces and moment of the hull are constructed as shown in eq 3 hydrodynamic coefficients to calculate the propeller forces and moment were obtained from model tests and they are shown in eq 4 hydrodynamic coefficients to calculate the rudder forces and moment could be acquired using empirical formulae proposed by fujii and tsuda and they are shown in eq 5 fujii and tsuda

power and fuel oil and gas consumptions for main engines the decision of rpm was regarded as an important connecting link between the maneuvering equations of motion and the integrated mathematical model to estimate the operating profit you 2019 compared three approaches to conduct simulations for estimating rpm by following a given speed given rpm or given power since the simulation was conducted according to the given speed here this was assumed to be command speed therefore the rpm needed to follow the command speed was determined by referring to a look up table suggested in the referred papers you et al 2018b you 2019 after rpm at an arbitrary time was estimated the torque and power acting on propellers could be estimated using eqs 8 and 9 8 q p p o r t ρ n 2 d p 5 k q j p p

entire voyage by multiplying the estimated power with the relationship between power and sgc and between power and spoc for the main engine as shown in eq 10 the sgc and spoc curves according to engine load were given in the engine specification representatively the minimum value of the sgc was observed at the engine load of 75 and it was 130 7 g kwh and they are specified in the referred document man diesel and turbo 2017 from the specification pilot oil consumptions ranged from 4 5 to 12 1 of lng fuel consumption according to the engine load ranged from 100 to 25 as engine load decreased the relative ratio between them increased sharply 10 f g c p t i t f p p t s g c f p p t d t f p o c c t i t f p p t s p o c f p p t d t 2 3 4 estimation of fuel oil and gas consumptions for

were specified in the ela report dsme 2017 here the actual electric power of the lngc was considered as listed in table 2 the fuel oil and gas consumption for electric power could be estimated over the entire voyage by multiplying the required electric power with the relationship between power and sgc and between power and sfoc for the generators as shown in eq 11 the amount of fuel oil and gas consumption for electric power was estimated using the sgc and sfoc specified in the generator specification representatively sgc and sfoc had the minimum values at the generator load of 100 and those were 147 7 g kwh and 190 5 g kwh and they are specified in the referred document wärtisilä 2019 from the specification pilot oil consumptions ranged from 1 5 to 12 3 of lng fuel consumption according to the electric load ranged from 100 to 25 as electric load decreased the relative ratio the pilot oil consumption increased rapidly 11 f g c g t i t f p g t s g c f p g t d t h f o c g t i t f p g t s f o c f p g t d t 2 3 5 estimation of combustion cost considering lng containment system and gcu operation the accumulated bog in lng cargo tanks caused an increase of the tank pressure to reduce the tank pressure it was popular to install a gcu or a re liquefaction unit in lngc here the gcu was only considered to estimate the operating profit once the gcu was activated the tank pressure decreased due to bog combustion the allowable pressure boundaries of lng cargo tanks were assumed to be 50 mbarg for the lower limit and 200 mbarg for the upper limit as shown in fig 4 two operating modes of lng cargo tanks could be distinguished according to the tank pressure caused by accumulated bog and bog consumption when lng cargo was completely loaded into the lng cargo tanks the tank pressure was 50 mbarg lower limit and initial condition if the accumulated bog was larger than the supplied bog to main engines and generators the tank pressure increased when the tank pressure became 200 mbarg upper limit the gcu was activated to protect the lng cargo tank from over pressure as the gcu burned off the accumulated bog to supply the main engines and generators the tank pressure decreased when the tank pressure became 50 mbarg the gcu was deactivated to protect the lng cargo tank from a pressure deficit after the gcu was deactivated the cycle repeated eq 12 was used to calculate the amount of accumulated bog in the lng cargo tanks based on the given heat ingress the amount of heat ingress could be estimated according to bor that was assumed to be maintained over a voyage it was also assumed that the heat energy flowing into the lng cargo spreads evenly throughout all the lng cargo therefore the temperature of the lng cargo rose equally as the temperature of the lng cargo tanks increased the tank pressure also increased the figure of 385 694 248 kj of heat energy flowing into the lng cargo to increase the pressure from 50 mbarg to 200 mbarg was estimated this was the same as the energy from evaporating 741 9 tons of lng cargo since a linear relationship was assumed between the tank pressure and the amount of heat ingress or bog accumulation eq 13 was obtained in eq 14 the combusted bog could be estimated by multiplying the combustion rate or bor with the mass of the stored lng cargo the combusted bog due to gcu activation could be estimated by integrating the combusted bog over the gcu activation time 12 q h e a t m l n g c p d t 13 p t 0 19 a c c u m u l a t e d b o g 50 0 14 b o g c c t i g c u t f g c u b o r m l n g t d t it was possible to estimate the fuel oil and gas consumption and combusted bog the costs were defined as the summation of the lng fuel cost mgo cost hfo cost and the bog combustion cost at the final destination as shown in eq 15 in common with the shipping rates shown in fig 2 it was necessary to prevent the incorrect estimation of the fuel oil and gas consumption cost since bunkering prices were sensitively affected by an uncertain regional issue and the real economy this research was carried out using the bunkering price report for the second half of 2017 although the fuel prices increased very fast in the third quarter of 2017 the prices were starting to level off in the fourth quarter of the year therefore the actual prices of lng fuel mgo and hfo denoted in eq 15 were used and they were the market price on december 8 2017 they were 298 0 708 0 375 6 usd mt respectively ship bunker www shipandbunker com disclosed the bunker prices of lng fuel mgo and hfo in vancouver especially the lngc did not pass by vancouver port for refueling in the given sea route however in the initial stage of this research there were few ports where the lng fuel price was disclosed therefore the inconsistency between sea route and referred fuel price at vancouver port was inevitable 15 fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost l n g f u e l p r i c e f g c p f g c g b o g c c m g

to eliminate the potential misunderstandings due to the accumulation of the fixed shipping rate the optical illusion produced due to different sailing times and accumulation was settled by eq 16 that indicated the operating profit considering operation profile this could be acquired by dividing the accumulated operating profit by the entire sailing time for 25 years the entire sailing time was the summation of time for transportation anchoring at a terminal to load or unload the lng freight and re docking work 16 d p r o f i t e n t i r e o p e r a t i n g p r o f i t u s d e n t i r e s a i l i n g t i m e d a y 3 details of simulation 3 1 description of simulation procedure the integrated mathematical model was solved from the departing terminal to the arriving terminal by following the steps summarized in table 3 the descriptions were matched with the equations explained in ch 2 of particular note is the fact that the calculation was repeated from step 2 to step 8 until the lngc arrived at the final destination to update the values related to ship behavior and operating profit in the simulation inputs acquired from ais data and ecmwf database were at 5 min intervals 3 2 sea route and environmental conditions the record based on the acquired ais data of an lngc was shown in table 4 the ship was assumed to be a liner lngc which traveled from bonny island in nigeria to osaka in japan since the ais data was recorded for a tramp lngc the return path was not the same as the recorded path based on our assumptions about the liner lngc the return path was made by emulating the acquired ais data in reverse order detailed information for design and ballast conditions were written in table 4 the environmental condition including wind and waves were obtained from the ecmwf database 6 h interval 0 25 0 25 size from may 20 2016 to july 16 2016 it was assumed that the environmental conditions were fixed according to the recorded location acquired from the ais data therefore the lngc encountered identical environmental conditions at a given location regardless of ship speed and time at that certain point fig 6 shows histories of wind speed and significant wave height since weather condition obtained from ecmwf database is similar to actual measurement weather data the applicability of the ecmwf database has been confirmed in the previous research you et al 2017 here appropriateness of the considered weather conditions as representative values in the given record was reviewed by comparing the values with representative weather conditions along the sea route studied by young 1999 young divided the world s seas into 19 zones and analyzed monthly changes of the environmental data for 10 years it was meaningful for us to investigate 5 seas named aes asts as ies and pstn near the recorded route among the 19 seas in comparison to the values obtained from the ecmwf database as shown in table 5 each value denoted as ecmwf was obtained value from the ecmwf database for the recorded location and utc as shown in figs 5 and 6 otherwise values denoted as young 1999 were extracted from the referred paper in table 5 day indicates that the estimated time for the ship passed through the chosen sea area as shown in fig 6 the values predicted from the ecmwf database are mostly similar to the referred values of wind speed wind direction significant wave height wave mean period and wave direction although there are some differences in distributed ranges the difference was insignificant in addition it could be understood from the uncertainty of sea weather therefore the weather conditions were regarded as representative values along the sea route 3 3 simulation conditions considering ship speed bor and fuel type table 6 shows a detailed simulation matrix with the draft ship speed bor and fuel type since the accumulated bog for ballast condition was insignificant there was no gcu activation and bog combustion therefore the simulation for ballast condition was only carried out for bor of 0 150 day the combustion rate of the gcu was assumed to be the value of the considered bor from the perspective of practical ship design supplied fuel to the two main engines and three generators were respectively written in table 6 4 simulation results before the estimated operating profit was investigated the estimated performance including rpm power and fuel oil and gas consumption was reviewed to confirm the feasibility of the integrated mathematical model after the estimated performance was confirmed the estimated operating profit and optimized transportation strategy were investigated fig 7 shows the estimated rpm and power from the mathematical model the features of the acquired rpm and power of the lngc were briefly described in the following here the estimated rpm and power at 20 knots for design condition were representatively plotted although the estimated rpm fluctuated insignificantly with time the estimated power saw significant changes and the fluctuations were intensively observed at certain times in eq 4 the external force of the hull could be compensated for in proportion to n 2 in eqs 8 and 9 the power was in proportion to n 3 therefore it was inevitable that the power was relatively amplified in comparison with rpm when following the suggested mathematical model nevertheless fluctuations of the estimated power were intensively observed from 16th day to 18th day and from 23rd day to 24th day as the lngc passed by the strait of malacca and osaka bay where there was a lot of traffic during these times in these areas frequent steering of the lngc was needed to avoid other vessels to compensate for the speed loss due to steering the rpm was increased or decreased rapidly to find balance with the command speed the fluctuating rpm affected the fluctuation of the power significantly the duration of frequent steering was relatively short in comparison with the entire voyage and the effect from fluctuating power could be ignored in terms of the averaged values or accumulated values furthermore the simulations using the integrated mathematical model were repeated according to ship speed and bor consequently the effect of the fluctuating rpm and power on the estimated operating profit can be ignored in addition the tendencies of rpm and power were entirely similar the trend where peak of rpm and peak of power gradually increased was observed on the 5th day also the lngc traveling at 20 knots passed near by cape town where the lngc encountered the strongest environmental loads since the simulation was set to follow the command speed environmental loads including wind and waves disturbed the lngc causing it not to maintain the command speed at the ordered rpm to maintain the command speed the rpm had to be increased time averaged rpm and power could be obtained as shown in fig 8 in eqs 3 and 4 the resistance of the hull was dominantly affected by x u u and thrust to compensate for the resistance was in proportion to n 2 therefore the rpm was in proportion to ship speed and power was in proportion to the cube of ship speed the tendencies of the estimated rpm and power were well matched with those anticipated for an actual ship explained in the referred paper behrendt and kucharski 1997 in fig 8 the averaged rpm and power for a design draft were always larger than those for a ballast draft since the resistance for design draft was larger than that for ballast condition of course the projected area giving wind resistance for ballast draft was larger than that for design draft due to the difference in ρ a i r and ρ the increase of wind load could be ignored in terms of rpm and power as shown in eq 10 the fuel oil and gas consumption was in proportion to the power given this fact the benefit of slow steaming is then apparent as the command speed became lower the fuel oil and gas consumption decreased in proportion to the cube of ship speed as well the difference in consumption due to power was dominantly affected not by the specified values including sgc and spoc but by power it was natural that slow steaming was the best solution for an optimized transportation strategy from the perspective of fuel oil and gas consumption only fig 9 shows the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption consumed by the main engines and generators according to time in comparison with figs 7 and 8 generators were additionally considered in the plot in fig 9 the fuel oil and gas consumption for propulsion show a similar tendency to the propulsion power due to eqs 10 and 11 the fuel oil and gas consumption for electric power must be constant since the required electric power was constant hfo supplied to generators as pilot oil was constant in order to generate constant electric power over the entire voyage consequently it was anticipated that the lng fuel required for electric power must be constant the fuel gas consumed by the generators could make the summation of the lng fuel shift therefore the tendency observed in fig 9 was dominantly affected by the fuel oil and gas consumption of the main engines the dlngc curve shows a similar tendency to the estimated power shown in fig 7 since the amount of dmgoc which was supplied to main engines as pilot oil was small it was difficult to point out this feature was affected by power only fluctuations on the 18th and 23rd day were observed to be similar to the fluctuation of estimated power fig 10 shows the summation of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost of the lngc at 16 knots according to bor the combustion cost was additionally considered as shown in eq 15 the reason for plotting the estimated cost for 16 knots was to observe the effect of gcu operation including gcu activation partial gcu activation and gcu deactivation together since the command speeds were all 16 knots in fig 10 fuel oil and gas consumption at an arbitrary time was always the same regardless of bor consequently the slopes of the summation of costs were identical until 10th day after departure the accumulated bog increased as bor increased therefore gcu activation had to occur first for the bor of 0 150 day and occurred last for the bor of 0 075 day in fact the tank pressure for the bor of 0 075 day did not reach the upper limit so the gcu was not activated at any time in the voyage after the gcu was activated the tank pressure was lowered due to bog combustion since the combustion rate of gcu was designed according to bor the slope of the summation of costs after 10th day had to be different in the case of a bor of 0 150 day tank pressure reached the lower limit on the 28th day and the gcu was deactivated to secure the structural safety of the lng cargo tanks in the period without gcu activation the summation of costs was the same as the fuel oil and gas consumption cost in fig 10 the minimum fuel oil and gas consumption cost while bog was not combusted was about 478 784 usd and the maximum summation of costs while bog was combusted with a combustion rate of 0 150 day reached 969 435 usd from this point it was confirmed that combustion cost and fuel oil and gas consumption cost must be considered together to estimate a credible voyex of lngc fig 11 shows the summation of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost of the lngc for a bor of 0 150 day according to ship speed the reason for plotting the estimated cost for a bor of 0 150 day was the same as that for fig 10 since the command ship speed varied from 12 knots to 20 knots the slopes of the fuel oil and gas consumption costs in the early stages of travel were different consequently the slopes of the summation of costs plotted in fig 11 were different the difference was identically observed in the slopes of the expenditure after the gcu was activated the starting times of gcu activation were also affected by the fuel oil and gas consumption according to ship speed namely as the fuel oil and gas consumption became less gcu activation began earlier as shown in fig 11 gcu activation occurred first with a ship speed of 12 knots and occurred last with a ship speed of 19 knots after the gcu was activated the tank pressure was lowered until the gcu could be deactivated before the lngc arrived at the final destination in the case of ship speeds of 20 knots tank pressure did not reach the upper limit over the entire voyage from fig 11 it could be seen that slow steaming was not an optimized transportation strategy for an lngc due to the bog combustion to secure the safety of the lng cargo tanks since the summation of estimated costs with 20 knots was about 618 182 usd while at 12 knots it was about 1 201 951 usd the acquired values show the opposite tendency from the perspective of slow steaming consequently the slow steaming could be the optimum solution only when the benefit of low speed for reducing the fuel oil and gas consumption cost for propulsion was obviously larger than the loss of increased bog combustion cost from figs 7 11 the tendencies of the estimated rpm power fuel oil and gas consumption fuel oil and gas consumption cost combustion cost could be understood based on the constructed mathematical model the integrated model in terms of the performance was confirmed as feasible hence the estimated values considering the operation profile will be investigated fig 12 shows the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost according to ship speed and bor which were supplied to main engines and generators the fuel oil and gas consumption cost estimated from eqs 9 11 showed a similar tendency to propulsion power according to ship speed however the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption costs for design conditions were larger than 5 83 11 97 of the values for ballast conditions the increase of the relative magnitudes of the costs was apparent in comparison to those of the estimated powers in fig 8 where the estimated powers for design conditions were larger than 1 27 1 84 of the values for ballast conditions in terms of efficiency the estimated power and fuel oil and gas consumption cost was additionally investigated about 78 of the maximum power could be saved by choosing the low speed ranging from 12 knots to 20 knots as shown in fig 8 about 36 40 of the maximum fuel oil and gas consumption cost could be saved by choosing a slow steaming strategy ranging from 12 knots to 20 knots the actual effectiveness in terms of cost was smaller than that of power by choosing the slow steaming strategy the consideration of the mathematical model and combination of the supplied fuel oil and gas including mgo hfo and lng fuel affected the difference fig 13 shows the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost according to ship speed and bor there were some points that were the same value that are marked in fig 12 the points which were listed in table 7 indicated the conditions where the gcu was not activated especially the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost for ballast condition was always identical with the fuel oil and gas consumption cost since gcu was not activated at all due to the initial lngc cargo volume about 1 of the lng cargo volume for design condition if the lngc was operated with the ship speed listed in table 7 according to bor a ship owner could save profit by keeping to the minimum voyex the ship speed at the minimum values in fig 13 was different according to bor for example the minimum value for a bor of 0 150 day was estimated at 20 knots since the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost decreased as ship speed increased since the accumulated bog was larger than the supplied bog to the main engines and generators the bog combustion affected the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost significantly therefore the fastest transportation could be advantageous in an lngc with a bor of 0 150 day however lngc with bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day showed different tendencies the minimum values were observed at 18 16 and 13 knots respectively the accumulated bog for the conditions became smaller in comparison to a bor of 0 150 day consequently the ship speeds that give the minimum values decreased as bor decreased from the perspective of ship design and operation fig 13 gave us new insights regarding the actual transportation and the design of lng containment systems and bor first it will be possible for a seafarer to predict expenditures and find the optimum speed under the given sea route and predicted weather conditions due to technological advances in weather forecasting technology estimated weather conditions including wind and waves can be anticipated on board they can be combined with the mathematical model considering the design and hydrodynamic performance for accurate evaluation second an optimized transportation strategy in terms of ship speed can be an alternative to the development of an enhanced lng cargo containment system since low bor for lng containment systems was regarded as the most important factor shipyards had been developing the new insulation material or structures for lng cargo tanks regardless of any increased capex they might cause although our simulation was carried out with a fixed sea route and environmental conditions a low bor did not produce large savings in certain speed ranges from 19 knots to 20 knots for a bor of 0 125 day from 16 knots to 20 knots for a bor of 0 100 day and from 14 knots to 20 knots for a bor of 0 075 day when an lngc traveled under higher sea states the certain speed ranges that low bor was not cost effective had to be extended fig 14 shows the accumulated operating profit for design condition according to ship speed and bor to plan an optimized transportation strategy the operating profit had to be investigated considering income capex opex and voyex synthetically in fig 14 the maximum operating profit was expected at the minimum speed of 12 knots although there were some inflection points under bors of 0 150 0 125 and 0 100 day it indicates that the accumulated operating profit depends more on the slow steaming strategy the dependency of the accumulated operating profit on the ship speed came from eq 1 and its associated assumptions the operating profit was the accumulated values of the shipping rate minus capex opex and voyex for an entire voyage as expressed in eq 1 since the shipping rate was assumed to be a fixed value regardless of shipping schedule cargo volume and number of deliveries the accumulated operating profit naturally increased as eta increased to investigate the estimated values successfully the accumulated operating profit had to be converted as the values per unit period which was defined in eq 16 and they were marked according to speeds for design and ballast conditions as shown in fig 15 it shows the estimated operating profit considering operation profile herein named operating profit surface the maximum or minimum values shown in fig 15 were summarized in table 9 by using the d p r o f i t the dependency of the accumulated operating profit was weakened due to the consideration of the operation profile the plotted operating profit surface shows apparent inflection points in terms of the operating profit the maximum values that were observed at 20 18 16 and 13 knots for design conditions and bors of 0 150 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day respectively it depended on fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost shown in fig 13 although there were slight differences of the maximum speed for bors of 0 125 and 0 075 day the insignificant difference came from the relation of t i m e d i s t a n c e s p e e d as ship speed decreased the eta became faster due to the relation from above in addition the accumulated port fee for the entire project life cycle changed they affected the insignificant difference the maximum values were commonly observed for 12 knots for ballast conditions it was affected by the slow steaming strategy because there was no effect of bog combustion the minimum values that were observed at 17 15 20 and 20 knots for design conditions and bors of 0 150 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day and the minimum values were commonly observed for 20 knots for ballast conditions they show the opposite direction in comparison with the maximum values from the perspective of slow steaming the shipping rate according to delivered lng cargo volume or the number of deliveries had to be considered the actual shipping rate was determined based on a contract considering the sea route shipping schedule cargo volume and number of deliveries if the eta was taken into account as shown in table 8 traveling at 20 knots was likely to produce a better shipping rate than traveling at 12 knots because the time required to deliver the lng cargo was reduced by about 40 it was reasonable that this decrease in time to delivery increased the number of deliveries and it helps a ship owner earn greater profits the variation of shipping rates could be considered as a variable according to the transportation schedule in the integrated mathematical model since there were a lot of uncertainties in the assumed shipping rate in the initial design stage the operating profit considering the fixed shipping rate incentives or penalties according to the number of deliveries was appropriate the number of deliveries per year was calculated as shown in table 10 they ranged from 4 38 to 6 96 times per year due to the decimal places which were not meaningful table 10 was subdivided according to integer values blue black and red colored groups corresponded to 6 5 and 4 deliveries per year the contract price which a charterer paid to the ship owner was assumed to be linearly affected by the number of deliveries the shipping rate of 115 000 usd day shown in fig 2 was assumed to be the contract price for 6 deliveries per year when a linear proportional relation between the shipping rate and the number of deliveries was assumed the shipping rates for 5 and 4 deliveries were 98 833 and 76 667 usd day respectively the operating profit surface was newly acquired considering the shipping rate according to penalties due to the number of deliveries as shown in fig 16 table 11 shows the maximum and minimum operating profit considering the operation profile according to ship speed and bor acquired in fig 16 the directions of axis for design draft and ballast draft in fig 16 were different from those in fig 15 to improve the readability of the figure the maximum values that were observed at 20 18 17 and 16 knots for design conditions and 15 16 17 and 18 knots for ballast condition under bors of 0 150 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day respectively the expected profit per day was reduced since the shipping rate with penalties was additionally considered in comparison with fig 15 the operating profit surface in fig 16 was affected by the optimized combination of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost as well as the number of deliveries three groups indicate the estimated operating profit was clearly affected by the number of deliveries in the same group the tendencies were matched with that observed in fig 15 since the optimum combination of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost was important to get the highest profit in addition the optimized conditions were observed near integer values over six deliveries as shown in table 10 since it was advantageous that the number of deliveries was closer to an integer the estimated operating profit surface could be applied to decision of the initial fleet operation plan when ship owners launch a course for a fleet from a production site to a consumer country the basic schedule is necessary to decide a variety of fleet operation plans for example the basic schedule of 18 knots for the laden voyage and 16 knots for the ballast voyage was regarded as the reference for the lngcs with bor of 0 125 day the reference schedule has to be affected according to bors of the lngcs which ship owners purchase or own furthermore it will possible for a ship owner or a seafarer to decide a detailed transportation plan considering actual weather conditions around the reference speed to get the highest operating profit 5 conclusion this paper aimed to estimate the operating profit based on a mathematical model by considering detailed design information accurate hydrodynamic performance and operation to achieve this an integrated model was necessary in order to consider fixed income capex opex and voyex systematically by reviewing the main components of the operating profit especially the simulation method was focusing on the quantification of the uncertain values of voyex there were three conclusions as follows first the suggested mathematical model was confirmed by analyzing the estimated rpm power and fuel oil and gas consumptions based on the physical background from the mathematical model it was possible for us to estimate operating profit considering income capex opex and voyex since all the values were acquired from the mathematical model with a modular concept each term could be separately dealt with especially the effect of detailed design information hydrodynamic performance and operation on the operating profit could be independently investigated moreover operating efficiency could be evaluated in the early design stage by following an objective procedure second the optimized transportation strategy for a single voyage was confirmed from the perspective of voyex due to consideration of the combustion of bog slow steaming could not be an optimized strategy for the laden voyage although the optimized speed for a single voyage was affected by bor it was perceived that low bor did not produce large savings in certain speed ranges from a shipbuilding point of view the technological trend for an lngc with low bor had to be further studied in terms of capex and voyex third an optimized transportation strategy was discovered according to ship speed and bor after the operating profit surface was corrected by applying incentives and penalties according to the number of deliveries a transportation strategy that gave the greatest profit under given restrictions could be chosen from the acquired values it could be the initial fleet operation plan for a series of lngcs along the given sea route from the initial plan reference speed according to bor the plan could be periodically updated considering uncertainties of weather bunkering prices and others this research did not take into account the fleets of ships different vessels different lng cargo containment systems constraints of transportation schedule or environmental conditions in real time consequently the hasty generalization had to be cautious using the suggested approach it was possible for us to evaluate and investigate the effect of each factor on the operating profit with the physical background it was anticipated that this model will help us to overcome the limitations of empirically evaluated operating profit and transportation decisions furthermore the approach can be developed combining the ensemble forecasting or super ensemble technique that are forms of monte carlo analysis roulston et al 2005 lenartz et al 2010 considering the

20868,traditionally it has been difficult to evaluate the operating efficiency of ships using objective and credible indicators in order for ship owners and seafarers to confidently plan an optimized transportation strategy considering accurate ship performance this is due to a number of factors that affect operating performance the type of ship cargo ship speed sea route and weather conditions this paper aimed to estimate the operating profit of a liner lngc based on a mathematical model developed considering design information accurate hydrodynamic performance and operation operating

shipbuilding and the shipping industry due to the increase in fuel costs it affects the corporate strategies of main agents in the industries including shipyards ship owners charterers operators or seafarers and equipment manufacturers however it has traditionally been difficult to evaluate operating efficiency in terms of economical transportation by using some kind of objective and credible indicator for individual ships or whole fleets since there were many factors including the type of ship cargo ship speed sea route weather conditions which affected operating performance recently as technologies to measure store and transmit on board data had developed researchers had begun to suggest diverse approaches for quantifying the operating efficiency there were studies that quantify expenditure as a value amount drewry maritime research categorized cost factors that affected the operating expenditure of ships they explored the statistical operating costs according to ship type including container dry bulk oil tanker chemical tanker lngc and so on nationality and year drewry maritime research 2019 the operating costs were subdivided into manning insurance stores spares lubricating oils repair maintenance dry docking management administration and so on polo suggested a cost structure considering three cost factors fixed cost voyage cost and voyage cost eventually he also distinguished technical factors from economic factors polo 2012 after polo investigated the changes in opex from 2000 to 2009 he tried to anticipate the future of marine transportation from past trends schinas and bulter proposed a method to evaluate the commercial incentives of an lng fueled vessel schinas and bulter 2016 and the numerical examples of a 1500 teu container ship considering capex opex and voyex were presented in addition there were studies that estimate full scale performance including rpm power and fuel oil consumption bialystocki and konovessis quantified the effect of the draft displacement environmental load and direction as well as hull and propeller roughness on fuel oil consumption by analyzing 418 noon reports in order to reduce fuel oil consumption bialystocki and konovessis 2016 you et al verified estimated rpm and power in comparison with the measured values you et al 2018a you et al proposed an approach to estimate the most efficient speed for an lngc after the operating cost was evaluated by considering fuel oil and gas consumption as well as bog combustion you et al 2018b as a follow up research you et al investigated the effect of fouling on the sea margin as well as fuel oil and gas consumption you et al 2020 meng et al proposed modeling to calculate the fuel oil consumption rate by considering sailing speed displacement sea conditions weather conditions and shipping log data meng et al 2016 wiesmann explained the economic benefits of slow steaming and summarized the technological problems that could arise not in design condition but in slow steaming conditions wiesmann 2010 while the summarized studies were focusing on the economics and performance separately there have been attempts to combine the economics with the performance to make decisions on the transportation strategy of ships wang and meng proposed an approach to decide the sea route and transportation plan by considering uncertainties at ports or at sea wang and meng 2012 du et al obtained the optimal solution for a 9000 teu container ship by considering trim optimization as well as sailing speed displacement sea conditions and weather conditions du et al 2019 the presented approaches were developed by assuming the simplified performance of a ship from a pragmatic point of view engineers in a shipbuilding company had strong demands considering detailed design information and accurate mathematical model this is due to the fact that engineers prefer to decide the optimum design condition in terms of expenditure with physical and engineering evidence a ship owner who operates large fleets of lngcs require the optimized operation condition in terms of ship speed and bor to decide the initial fleet operation plans it is in line with technological trends focusing on the optimized transportation strategy considering detailed equipment operation and operational profile of a ship kim et al 2020 in this paper it was aimed to estimate the operating profit based on a mathematical by considering detailed design information accurate hydrodynamic performance and operation after the estimated values including capex opex and voyex were reviewed it was attempted to decide an optimized transportation strategy in terms of ship speed and bor to maximize the estimated operating profit the acquired strategy can be an option that ship owners look into as the potential design condition and can be an initial fleet operation plan for a series of lngcs to accomplish the described purpose the mathematical model from the maneuvering equations of motion for an lngc was first constructed operating profit was assumed to be the value of the expected income representatively shipping rate minus capex opex and voyex an integrated model considering the performance and operation was suggested considering the consistency of each expenditure especially the simulation method was focusing on the quantification of the uncertain values of voyex the feasibility was evaluated for the given sea route and weather conditions by assuming a representative operation profile of a liner the operating profits of 1 cycle of operation were respectively estimated for the laden voyage design condition and ballast voyage according to ship speed and bor to find the optimized transportation strategy over the entire project life cycle of 25 years the operating profit was converted into a value considering the working day re docking period and travel time for repairing work the operating profit surface was plotted according to ship speeds of both ways the operating profit surface was replotted to consider the effect of the number of deliveries on the shipping rate 2 mathematical model for evaluating the operating profit of lngc detailed categorization or subdivision of income and expenditure was needed to construct an integrated mathematical model for evaluating operating profit operating profit could be acquired by considering the expected income capex opex and voyex as shown in fig 1 schinas and bulter 2016 and eq 1 since a ship owner earns a profit from a charterer based on a mid term or long term contract lng freight rate could be expected during the period of the contract therefore this income was represented as the shipping rate in the figure ship owners pay for the newbuilding price including the debt for ship financing to purchase new ships capex was the summation of newbuilding prices and total interest using the compound interest method the periodic expense for maintenance of the lngc and contract based expenses including insurance or salary could be anticipated opex is denoted as the expected expenditure and includes manning insurance stores spares lubricating oils repair maintenance dry docking and management administration the values were acquired from the statistical investigation of 170 180 k lng carriers with me gi engines drewry maritime research 2019 in addition there were voyex that could not be estimated in advance because of significant uncertainties of environmental loads including wind and waves draft ship speed control logic to follow the planned sea route operating of main engine and generator bor of lng cargo tanks gcu operation and etc voyex mainly consists of fuel oil and gas consumption costs port fee and channel fee for most of merchant ships and bog combustion costs for lngcs here the channel fee denoted in fig 1 was not included in the estimated voyex since the ship did not pass through a channel 2 1 expected operating income fig 2 shows the shipping rate in 2018 disclosed by bloomberg bloomberg intelligence 2019 since most of the countries that consume lng are located in east asia e g china japan south korea or europe which are part of the northern hemisphere we could observe the lng shipping rate tendency to be higher in autumn and winter and lower in spring and summer the variation of the shipping rate could be taken into account in the integrated mathematical model however the shipping rate was assumed to be fixed it was not meaningful in the initial design stage where there were a lot of uncertain factors in addition it was necessary to analyze the estimated operating profit by reducing any potential misinterpretation due to the consideration of too many variables here the shipping rate was 115 000 usd day and it was the mean value of the highest and the lowest values for the 2018 shipping rate 2 2 expected capex opex and voyex table 1 shows the detailed operating income capex opex and voyex for an lngc extracted from the referred documents all the subdivided values for operating income capex and opex were set using the operating costs specified for 170 k 180 k class lngcs with me gi engines otherwise values for voyex were set considering the fleet management in particular the assumed total financing budget was estimated by summing the newbuilding price of an lngc compound interest and entire project life cycle they were 186 million dollars 1 7 interest rate and 25 years 2 3 fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost the fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost have to be separately considered with other costs of voyex in this research an integrated mathematical model was constructed based on the maneuvering equations of motion to estimate those values accurately the model was developed from a modular concept that was the basis of the maneuvering equations of motion the detailed design information and mathematical model to consider hydrodynamic characteristics are described as follows table 2 shows the principal particulars and assumed operation profile of the 173 k class lngc studied in this research the lngc was constructed as a membrane type and had two main engines of me gi type and three generators for electric power supply it was assumed that electric power requested for supplying the lng fuel from lng fuel tanks or bog from lng cargo tanks to the main engines were identical fig 3 shows the coordinates used to solve the mathematical model body fixed coordinate including forces and moment as well as earth fixed coordinate are defined the incident angle and magnitude of wind and waves are also indicated the maneuvering equations of motion are shown in eq 2 2 3 1 maneuvering equations of motion considering hull propellers and rudders as described the hydrodynamic forces and moment of the hull are constructed as shown in eq 3 hydrodynamic coefficients to calculate the propeller forces and moment were obtained from model tests and they are shown in eq 4 hydrodynamic coefficients to calculate the rudder forces and moment could be acquired using empirical formulae proposed by fujii and tsuda and they are shown in eq 5 fujii and tsuda

power and fuel oil and gas consumptions for main engines the decision of rpm was regarded as an important connecting link between the maneuvering equations of motion and the integrated mathematical model to estimate the operating profit you 2019 compared three approaches to conduct simulations for estimating rpm by following a given speed given rpm or given power since the simulation was conducted according to the given speed here this was assumed to be command speed therefore the rpm needed to follow the command speed was determined by referring to a look up table suggested in the referred papers you et al 2018b you 2019 after rpm at an arbitrary time was estimated the torque and power acting on propellers could be estimated using eqs 8 and 9 8 q p p o r t ρ n 2 d p 5 k q j p p

entire voyage by multiplying the estimated power with the relationship between power and sgc and between power and spoc for the main engine as shown in eq 10 the sgc and spoc curves according to engine load were given in the engine specification representatively the minimum value of the sgc was observed at the engine load of 75 and it was 130 7 g kwh and they are specified in the referred document man diesel and turbo 2017 from the specification pilot oil consumptions ranged from 4 5 to 12 1 of lng fuel consumption according to the engine load ranged from 100 to 25 as engine load decreased the relative ratio between them increased sharply 10 f g c p t i t f p p t s g c f p p t d t f p o c c t i t f p p t s p o c f p p t d t 2 3 4 estimation of fuel oil and gas consumptions for

were specified in the ela report dsme 2017 here the actual electric power of the lngc was considered as listed in table 2 the fuel oil and gas consumption for electric power could be estimated over the entire voyage by multiplying the required electric power with the relationship between power and sgc and between power and sfoc for the generators as shown in eq 11 the amount of fuel oil and gas consumption for electric power was estimated using the sgc and sfoc specified in the generator specification representatively sgc and sfoc had the minimum values at the generator load of 100 and those were 147 7 g kwh and 190 5 g kwh and they are specified in the referred document wärtisilä 2019 from the specification pilot oil consumptions ranged from 1 5 to 12 3 of lng fuel consumption according to the electric load ranged from 100 to 25 as electric load decreased the relative ratio the pilot oil consumption increased rapidly 11 f g c g t i t f p g t s g c f p g t d t h f o c g t i t f p g t s f o c f p g t d t 2 3 5 estimation of combustion cost considering lng containment system and gcu operation the accumulated bog in lng cargo tanks caused an increase of the tank pressure to reduce the tank pressure it was popular to install a gcu or a re liquefaction unit in lngc here the gcu was only considered to estimate the operating profit once the gcu was activated the tank pressure decreased due to bog combustion the allowable pressure boundaries of lng cargo tanks were assumed to be 50 mbarg for the lower limit and 200 mbarg for the upper limit as shown in fig 4 two operating modes of lng cargo tanks could be distinguished according to the tank pressure caused by accumulated bog and bog consumption when lng cargo was completely loaded into the lng cargo tanks the tank pressure was 50 mbarg lower limit and initial condition if the accumulated bog was larger than the supplied bog to main engines and generators the tank pressure increased when the tank pressure became 200 mbarg upper limit the gcu was activated to protect the lng cargo tank from over pressure as the gcu burned off the accumulated bog to supply the main engines and generators the tank pressure decreased when the tank pressure became 50 mbarg the gcu was deactivated to protect the lng cargo tank from a pressure deficit after the gcu was deactivated the cycle repeated eq 12 was used to calculate the amount of accumulated bog in the lng cargo tanks based on the given heat ingress the amount of heat ingress could be estimated according to bor that was assumed to be maintained over a voyage it was also assumed that the heat energy flowing into the lng cargo spreads evenly throughout all the lng cargo therefore the temperature of the lng cargo rose equally as the temperature of the lng cargo tanks increased the tank pressure also increased the figure of 385 694 248 kj of heat energy flowing into the lng cargo to increase the pressure from 50 mbarg to 200 mbarg was estimated this was the same as the energy from evaporating 741 9 tons of lng cargo since a linear relationship was assumed between the tank pressure and the amount of heat ingress or bog accumulation eq 13 was obtained in eq 14 the combusted bog could be estimated by multiplying the combustion rate or bor with the mass of the stored lng cargo the combusted bog due to gcu activation could be estimated by integrating the combusted bog over the gcu activation time 12 q h e a t m l n g c p d t 13 p t 0 19 a c c u m u l a t e d b o g 50 0 14 b o g c c t i g c u t f g c u b o r m l n g t d t it was possible to estimate the fuel oil and gas consumption and combusted bog the costs were defined as the summation of the lng fuel cost mgo cost hfo cost and the bog combustion cost at the final destination as shown in eq 15 in common with the shipping rates shown in fig 2 it was necessary to prevent the incorrect estimation of the fuel oil and gas consumption cost since bunkering prices were sensitively affected by an uncertain regional issue and the real economy this research was carried out using the bunkering price report for the second half of 2017 although the fuel prices increased very fast in the third quarter of 2017 the prices were starting to level off in the fourth quarter of the year therefore the actual prices of lng fuel mgo and hfo denoted in eq 15 were used and they were the market price on december 8 2017 they were 298 0 708 0 375 6 usd mt respectively ship bunker www shipandbunker com disclosed the bunker prices of lng fuel mgo and hfo in vancouver especially the lngc did not pass by vancouver port for refueling in the given sea route however in the initial stage of this research there were few ports where the lng fuel price was disclosed therefore the inconsistency between sea route and referred fuel price at vancouver port was inevitable 15 fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost l n g f u e l p r i c e f g c p f g c g b o g c c m g

to eliminate the potential misunderstandings due to the accumulation of the fixed shipping rate the optical illusion produced due to different sailing times and accumulation was settled by eq 16 that indicated the operating profit considering operation profile this could be acquired by dividing the accumulated operating profit by the entire sailing time for 25 years the entire sailing time was the summation of time for transportation anchoring at a terminal to load or unload the lng freight and re docking work 16 d p r o f i t e n t i r e o p e r a t i n g p r o f i t u s d e n t i r e s a i l

steps summarized in table 3 the descriptions were matched with the equations explained in ch 2 of particular note is the fact that the calculation was repeated from step 2 to step 8 until the lngc arrived at the final destination to update the values related to ship behavior and operating profit in the simulation inputs acquired from ais data and ecmwf database were at 5 min intervals 3 2 sea route and environmental conditions the record based on the acquired ais data of an lngc was shown in table 4 the ship was assumed to be a liner lngc which traveled from bonny island in nigeria to osaka in japan since the ais data was recorded for a tramp lngc the return path was not the same as the recorded path based on our assumptions about the liner lngc the return path was made by emulating the acquired ais data in reverse order detailed information for design and ballast conditions were written in table 4 the environmental condition including wind and waves were obtained from the ecmwf database 6 h interval 0 25 0 25 size from may 20 2016 to july 16 2016 it was assumed that the environmental conditions were fixed according to the recorded location acquired from the ais data therefore the lngc encountered identical environmental conditions at a given location regardless of ship speed and time at that certain point fig 6 shows histories of wind speed and significant wave height since weather condition obtained from ecmwf database is similar to actual measurement weather data the applicability of the ecmwf database has been confirmed in the previous research you et al 2017 here appropriateness of the considered weather conditions as representative values in the given record was reviewed by comparing the values with representative weather conditions along the sea route studied by young 1999 young divided the world s seas into 19 zones and analyzed monthly changes of the environmental data for 10 years it was meaningful for us to investigate 5 seas named aes asts as ies and pstn near the recorded route among the 19 seas in comparison to the values obtained from the ecmwf database as shown in table 5 each value denoted as ecmwf was obtained value from the ecmwf database for the recorded location and utc as shown in figs 5 and 6 otherwise values denoted as young 1999 were extracted from the referred paper in table 5 day indicates that the estimated time for the ship passed through the chosen sea area as shown in fig 6 the values predicted from the ecmwf database are mostly similar to the referred values of wind speed wind direction significant wave height wave mean period and wave direction although there are some differences in distributed ranges the difference was insignificant in addition it could be understood from the uncertainty of sea weather therefore the weather conditions were regarded as representative values along the sea route 3 3 simulation conditions considering ship speed bor and fuel type table 6 shows a detailed simulation matrix with the draft ship speed bor and fuel type since the accumulated bog for ballast condition was insignificant there was no gcu activation and bog combustion therefore the simulation for ballast condition was only carried out for bor of 0 150 day the combustion rate of the gcu was assumed to be the value of the considered bor from the perspective of practical ship design supplied fuel to the two main engines and three generators were respectively written in table 6 4 simulation results before the estimated operating profit was investigated the estimated performance including rpm power and fuel oil and gas consumption was reviewed to confirm the feasibility of the integrated mathematical model after the estimated performance was confirmed the estimated operating profit and optimized transportation strategy were investigated fig 7 shows the estimated rpm and power from the mathematical model the features of the acquired rpm and power of the lngc were briefly described in the following here the estimated rpm and power at 20 knots for design condition were representatively plotted although the estimated rpm fluctuated insignificantly with time the estimated power saw significant changes and the fluctuations were intensively observed at certain times in eq 4 the external force of the hull could be compensated for in proportion to n 2 in eqs 8 and 9 the power was in proportion to n 3 therefore it was inevitable that the power was relatively amplified in comparison with rpm when following the suggested mathematical model nevertheless fluctuations of the estimated power were intensively observed from 16th day to 18th day and from 23rd day to 24th day as the lngc passed by the strait of malacca and osaka bay where there was a lot of traffic during these times in these areas frequent steering of the lngc was needed to avoid other vessels to compensate for the speed loss due to steering the rpm was increased or decreased rapidly to find balance with the command speed the fluctuating rpm affected the fluctuation of the power significantly the duration of frequent steering was relatively short in comparison with the entire voyage and the effect from fluctuating power could be ignored in terms of the averaged values or accumulated values furthermore the simulations using the integrated mathematical model were repeated according to ship speed and bor consequently the effect of the fluctuating rpm and power on the estimated operating profit can be ignored in addition the tendencies of rpm and power were entirely similar the trend where peak of rpm and peak of power gradually increased was observed on the 5th day also the lngc traveling at 20 knots passed near by cape town where the lngc encountered the strongest environmental loads since the simulation was set to follow the command speed environmental loads including wind and waves disturbed the lngc causing it not to maintain the command speed at the ordered rpm to maintain the command speed the rpm had to be increased time averaged rpm and power could be obtained as shown in fig 8 in eqs 3 and 4 the resistance of the hull was dominantly affected by x u u and thrust to compensate for the resistance was in proportion to n 2 therefore the rpm was in proportion to ship speed and power was in proportion to the cube of ship speed the tendencies of the estimated rpm and power were well matched with those anticipated for an actual ship explained in the referred paper behrendt and kucharski 1997 in fig 8 the averaged rpm and power for a design draft were always larger than those for a ballast draft since the resistance for design draft was larger than that for ballast condition of course the projected area giving wind resistance for ballast draft was larger than that for design draft due to the difference in ρ a i r and ρ the increase of wind load could be ignored in terms of rpm and power as shown in eq 10 the fuel oil and gas consumption was in proportion to the power given this fact the benefit of slow steaming is then apparent as the command speed became lower the fuel oil and gas consumption decreased in proportion to the cube of ship speed as well the difference in consumption due to power was dominantly affected not by the specified values including sgc and spoc but by power it was natural that slow steaming was the best solution for an optimized transportation strategy from the perspective of fuel oil and gas consumption only fig 9 shows the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption consumed by the main engines and generators according to time in comparison with figs 7 and 8 generators were additionally considered in the plot in fig 9 the fuel oil and gas consumption for propulsion show a similar tendency to the propulsion power due to eqs 10 and 11 the fuel oil and gas consumption for electric power must be constant since the required electric power was constant hfo supplied to generators as pilot oil was constant in order to generate constant electric power over the entire voyage consequently it was anticipated that the lng fuel required for electric power must be constant the fuel gas consumed by the generators could make the summation of the lng fuel shift therefore the tendency observed in fig 9 was dominantly affected by the fuel oil and gas consumption of the main engines the dlngc curve shows a similar tendency to the estimated power shown in fig 7 since the amount of dmgoc which was supplied to main engines as pilot oil was small it was difficult to point out this feature was affected by power only fluctuations on the 18th and 23rd day were observed to be similar to the fluctuation of estimated power fig 10 shows the summation of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost of the lngc at 16 knots according to bor the combustion cost was additionally considered as shown in eq 15 the reason for plotting the estimated cost for 16 knots was to observe the effect of gcu operation including gcu activation partial gcu activation and gcu deactivation together since the command speeds were all 16 knots in fig 10 fuel oil and gas consumption at an arbitrary time was always the same regardless of bor consequently the slopes of the summation of costs were identical until 10th day after departure the accumulated bog increased as bor increased therefore gcu activation had to occur first for the bor of 0 150 day and occurred last for the bor of 0 075 day in fact the tank pressure for the bor of 0 075 day did not reach the upper limit so the gcu was not activated at any time in the voyage after the gcu was activated the tank pressure was lowered due to bog combustion since the combustion rate of gcu was designed according to bor the slope of the summation of costs after 10th day had to be different in the case of a bor of 0 150 day tank pressure reached the lower limit on the 28th day and the gcu was deactivated to secure the structural safety of the lng cargo tanks in the period without gcu activation the summation of costs was the same as the fuel oil and gas consumption cost in fig 10 the minimum fuel oil and gas consumption cost while bog was not combusted was about 478 784 usd and the maximum summation of costs while bog was combusted with a combustion rate of 0 150 day reached 969 435 usd from this point it was confirmed that combustion cost and fuel oil and gas consumption cost must be considered together to estimate a credible voyex of lngc fig 11 shows the summation of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost of the lngc for a bor of 0 150 day according to ship speed the reason for plotting the estimated cost for a bor of 0 150 day was the same as that for fig 10 since the command ship speed varied from 12 knots to 20 knots the slopes of the fuel oil and gas consumption costs in the early stages of travel were different consequently the slopes of the summation of costs plotted in fig 11 were different the difference was identically observed in the slopes of the expenditure after the gcu was activated the starting times of gcu activation were also affected by the fuel oil and gas consumption according to ship speed namely as the fuel oil and gas consumption became less gcu activation began earlier as shown in fig 11 gcu activation occurred first with a ship speed of 12 knots and occurred last with a ship speed of 19 knots after the gcu was activated the tank pressure was lowered until the gcu could be deactivated before the lngc arrived at the final destination in the case of ship speeds of 20 knots tank pressure did not reach the upper limit over the entire voyage from fig 11 it could be seen that slow steaming was not an optimized transportation strategy for an lngc due to the bog combustion to secure the safety of the lng cargo tanks since the summation of estimated costs with 20 knots was about 618 182 usd while at 12 knots it was about 1 201 951 usd the acquired values show the opposite tendency from the perspective of slow steaming consequently the slow steaming could be the optimum solution only when the benefit of low speed for reducing the fuel oil and gas consumption cost for propulsion was obviously larger than the loss of increased bog combustion cost from figs 7 11 the tendencies of the estimated rpm power fuel oil and gas consumption fuel oil and gas consumption cost combustion cost could be understood based on the constructed mathematical model the integrated model in terms of the performance was confirmed as feasible hence the estimated values considering the operation profile will be investigated fig 12 shows the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost according to ship speed and bor which were supplied to main engines and generators the fuel oil and gas consumption cost estimated from eqs 9 11 showed a similar tendency to propulsion power according to ship speed however the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption costs for design conditions were larger than 5 83 11 97 of the values for ballast conditions the increase of the relative magnitudes of the costs was apparent in comparison to those of the estimated powers in fig 8 where the estimated powers for design conditions were larger than 1 27 1 84 of the values for ballast conditions in terms of efficiency the estimated power and fuel oil and gas consumption cost was additionally investigated about 78 of the maximum power could be saved by choosing the low speed ranging from 12 knots to 20 knots as shown in fig 8 about 36 40 of the maximum fuel oil and gas consumption cost could be saved by choosing a slow steaming strategy ranging from 12 knots to 20 knots the actual effectiveness in terms of cost was smaller than that of power by choosing the slow steaming strategy the consideration of the mathematical model and combination of the supplied fuel oil and gas including mgo hfo and lng fuel affected the difference fig 13 shows the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost according to ship speed and bor there were some points that were the same value that are marked in fig 12 the points which were listed in table 7 indicated the conditions where the gcu was not activated especially the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost for ballast condition was always identical with the fuel oil and gas consumption cost since gcu was not activated at all due to the initial lngc cargo volume about 1 of the lng cargo volume for design condition if the lngc was operated with the ship speed listed in table 7 according to bor a ship owner could save profit by keeping to the minimum voyex the ship speed at the minimum values in fig 13 was different according to bor for example the minimum value for a bor of 0 150 day was estimated at 20 knots since the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost decreased as ship speed increased since the accumulated bog was larger than the supplied bog to the main engines and generators the bog combustion affected the summation of the estimated fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost significantly therefore the fastest transportation could be advantageous in an lngc with a bor of 0 150 day however lngc with bors of 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day showed different tendencies the minimum values were observed at 18 16 and 13 knots respectively the accumulated bog for the conditions became smaller in comparison to a bor of 0 150 day consequently the ship speeds that give the minimum values decreased as bor decreased from the perspective of ship design and operation fig 13 gave us new insights regarding the actual transportation and the design of lng containment systems and bor first it will be possible for a seafarer to predict expenditures and find the optimum speed under the given sea route and predicted weather conditions due to technological advances in weather forecasting technology estimated weather conditions including wind and waves can be anticipated on board they can be combined with the mathematical model considering the design and hydrodynamic performance for accurate evaluation second an optimized transportation strategy in terms of ship speed can be an alternative to the development of an enhanced lng cargo containment system since low bor for lng containment systems was regarded as the most important factor shipyards had been developing the new insulation material or structures for lng cargo tanks regardless of any increased capex they might cause although our simulation was carried out with a fixed sea route and environmental conditions a low bor did not produce large savings in certain speed ranges from 19 knots to 20 knots for a bor of 0 125 day from 16 knots to 20 knots for a bor of 0 100 day and from 14 knots to 20 knots for a bor of 0 075 day when an lngc traveled under higher sea states the certain speed ranges that low bor was not cost effective had to be extended fig 14 shows the accumulated operating profit for design condition according to ship speed and bor to plan an optimized transportation strategy the operating profit had to be investigated considering income capex opex and voyex synthetically in fig 14 the maximum operating profit was expected at the minimum speed of 12 knots although there were some inflection points under bors of 0 150 0 125 and 0 100 day it indicates that the accumulated operating profit depends more on the slow steaming strategy the dependency of the accumulated operating profit on the ship speed came from eq 1 and its associated assumptions the operating profit was the accumulated values of the shipping rate minus capex opex and voyex for an entire voyage as expressed in eq 1 since the shipping rate was assumed to be a fixed value regardless of shipping schedule cargo volume and number of deliveries the accumulated operating profit naturally increased as eta increased to investigate the estimated values successfully the accumulated operating profit had to be converted as the values per unit period which was defined in eq 16 and they were marked according to speeds for design and ballast conditions as shown in fig 15 it shows the estimated operating profit considering operation profile herein named operating profit surface the maximum or minimum values shown in fig 15 were summarized in table 9 by using the d p r o f i t the dependency of the accumulated operating profit was weakened due to the consideration of the operation profile the plotted operating profit surface shows apparent inflection points in terms of the operating profit the maximum values that were observed at 20 18 16 and 13 knots for design conditions and bors of 0 150 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day respectively it depended on fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost shown in fig 13 although there were slight differences of the maximum speed for bors of 0 125 and 0 075 day the insignificant difference came from the relation of t i m e d i s t a n c e s p e e d as ship speed decreased the eta became faster due to the relation from above in addition the accumulated port fee for the entire project life cycle changed they affected the insignificant difference the maximum values were commonly observed for 12 knots for ballast conditions it was affected by the slow steaming strategy because there was no effect of bog combustion the minimum values that were observed at 17 15 20 and 20 knots for design conditions and bors of 0 150 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day and the minimum values were commonly observed for 20 knots for ballast conditions they show the opposite direction in comparison with the maximum values from the perspective of slow steaming the shipping rate according to delivered lng cargo volume or the number of deliveries had to be considered the actual shipping rate was determined based on a contract considering the sea route shipping schedule cargo volume and number of deliveries if the eta was taken into account as shown in table 8 traveling at 20 knots was likely to produce a better shipping rate than traveling at 12 knots because the time required to deliver the lng cargo was reduced by about 40 it was reasonable that this decrease in time to delivery increased the number of deliveries and it helps a ship owner earn greater profits the variation of shipping rates could be considered as a variable according to the transportation schedule in the integrated mathematical model since there were a lot of uncertainties in the assumed shipping rate in the initial design stage the operating profit considering the fixed shipping rate incentives or penalties according to the number of deliveries was appropriate the number of deliveries per year was calculated as shown in table 10 they ranged from 4 38 to 6 96 times per year due to the decimal places which were not meaningful table 10 was subdivided according to integer values blue black and red colored groups corresponded to 6 5 and 4 deliveries per year the contract price which a charterer paid to the ship owner was assumed to be linearly affected by the number of deliveries the shipping rate of 115 000 usd day shown in fig 2 was assumed to be the contract price for 6 deliveries per year when a linear proportional relation between the shipping rate and the number of deliveries was assumed the shipping rates for 5 and 4 deliveries were 98 833 and 76 667 usd day respectively the operating profit surface was newly acquired considering the shipping rate according to penalties due to the number of deliveries as shown in fig 16 table 11 shows the maximum and minimum operating profit considering the operation profile according to ship speed and bor acquired in fig 16 the directions of axis for design draft and ballast draft in fig 16 were different from those in fig 15 to improve the readability of the figure the maximum values that were observed at 20 18 17 and 16 knots for design conditions and 15 16 17 and 18 knots for ballast condition under bors of 0 150 0 125 0 100 and 0 075 day respectively the expected profit per day was reduced since the shipping rate with penalties was additionally considered in comparison with fig 15 the operating profit surface in fig 16 was affected by the optimized combination of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost as well as the number of deliveries three groups indicate the estimated operating profit was clearly affected by the number of deliveries in the same group the tendencies were matched with that observed in fig 15 since the optimum combination of fuel oil and gas consumption cost and combustion cost was important to get the highest profit in addition the optimized conditions were observed near integer values over six deliveries as shown in table 10 since it was advantageous that the number of deliveries was closer to an integer the estimated operating profit surface could be applied to decision of the initial fleet operation plan when ship owners launch a course for a fleet from a production site to a consumer country the basic schedule is necessary to decide a variety of fleet operation plans for example the basic schedule of 18 knots for the laden voyage and 16 knots for the ballast voyage was regarded as the reference for the lngcs with bor of 0 125 day the reference schedule has to be affected according to bors of the lngcs which ship owners purchase or own furthermore it will possible for a ship owner or a seafarer to decide a detailed transportation plan considering actual weather conditions around the reference speed to get the highest operating profit 5 conclusion this paper aimed to estimate the operating profit based on a mathematical model by considering detailed design information accurate hydrodynamic performance and operation to achieve this an integrated model was necessary in order to consider fixed income capex opex and voyex systematically by reviewing the main components of the operating profit especially the simulation method was focusing on the quantification of the uncertain values of voyex there were three conclusions as follows first the suggested mathematical model was confirmed by analyzing the estimated rpm power and fuel oil and gas consumptions based on the physical background from the mathematical model it was possible for us to estimate operating profit considering income capex opex and voyex since all the values were acquired from the mathematical model with a modular concept each term could be separately dealt with especially the effect of detailed design information hydrodynamic performance and operation on the operating profit could be independently investigated moreover operating efficiency could be evaluated in the early design stage by following an objective procedure second the optimized transportation strategy for a single voyage was confirmed from the perspective of voyex due to consideration of the combustion of bog slow steaming could not be an optimized strategy for the laden voyage although the optimized speed for a single voyage was affected by bor it was perceived that low bor did not produce large savings in certain speed ranges from a shipbuilding point of view the technological trend for an lngc with low bor had to be further studied in terms of capex and voyex third an optimized transportation strategy was discovered according to ship speed and bor after the operating profit surface was corrected by applying incentives and penalties according to the number of deliveries a transportation strategy that gave the greatest profit under given restrictions could be chosen from the acquired values it could be the initial fleet operation plan for a series of lngcs along the given sea route from the initial plan reference speed according to bor the plan could be periodically updated considering uncertainties of weather bunkering prices and others this research did not take into account the fleets of ships different vessels different lng cargo containment systems constraints of transportation schedule or environmental conditions in real time consequently the hasty generalization had to be cautious using the suggested approach it was possible for us to evaluate and investigate the effect of each factor on the operating profit with the physical background it was anticipated that this model will help us to overcome the limitations of empirically evaluated operating profit and transportation decisions furthermore the approach can be developed combining the ensemble forecasting or super ensemble technique that are forms of monte carlo analysis roulston et al 2005 lenartz et al 2010 considering the

factors that should be considered is the rules and regulations for navigation e g colregs etc for collision avoidance on the conventional manned ship where oow is responsible for such tasks they mainly carry out collision avoidance operations in accordance with colregs and regional regulations as for the theoretical research especially for the development of autonomous ships however until now there is no clear or common regulations framework designated for it campbell et al 2012 as for theoretical research ship collision avoidance decision making can be divided into two types 1 ship collision avoidance research with oows participation i e oow or shore control centre scc will be responsible for making the collision avoidance decisions and 2 ship collision avoidance research without oows participation i e the ship is fully autonomous and can conduct collision avoidance operation by itself to make the theoretical research and practice of collision avoidance comparable and to identify the commonalities and discrepancies between them the following characteristics are considered in the searching and selection of the literature 1 the collision avoidance action meets the requirements of the colregs 2 the collision avoidance objects are mainly dynamic obstacles 3 collision avoidance measures include collision free maneuvering and safety trajectory following the characteristics mentioned above extensive literature is collected from the library of the wuhan university of technology through the internet 2 2 http lib whut edu cn which includes the resources from web of science scopus etc the scope of this research focuses on ship collision avoidance decision making and the time span of the literature is between 2010 and 2020 due to the contents of the literature in these databases english is the primary language among them ship collision avoidance prevention collision avoid collision path planning etc are utilized as the keywords for the literature search and such a process was conducted on may 30 2020 via evaluating the titles and abstracts of the papers based on the aforementioned characteristics and snowballing the relevant articles 73 pieces are selected at the end of the process 2 2 questionnaire design and expert elicitation in practice ship collision avoidance decision making often depends on the experience of the oows therefore to understand the knowledge structure of ship collision avoidance decision making in practice we designed a questionnaire and sent 35 questionnaires to the oows with profound practical experience each oow who received the questionnaire was told that the questionnaire was only for research purposes they needed to fill in the questionnaire according to their experience and knowledge all participants completed the questionnaire voluntarily and anonymously a total of 33 questionnaires were collected and the unqualified ones were screened out e g incomplete answers the same answers for all items specific rules for the overall distribution of answers and contradictions between choices finally 29 valid questionnaires were retained 3 knowledge structure of theoretical research 3 1 bibliometric analysis among all the literature collected for our research they focus on different aspects of collision avoidance decision making processes and are published in various journals to have an overview of the scope and distribution of the literature from different dimensions and obtain their focal points here we have conducted a brief bibliometric analysis of the literature 1 publishing sources the source of the publications collected for the research is shown in fig 2 the top four journals that publish the most papers related to collision avoidance of ships are as follows ocean engineering 21 52 journal of navigation 10 13 and polish maritime research 8 86 and ifac paperonline 7 59 fig 2 is the word cloud that represents the journals publishing collision avoidance decision making works the size of the journal titles indicates the number of publications in the corresponding journal i e the larger the journal titles are the more researches are published on it from the distributions of the publication sources one can see that the researches on collision avoidance decision making are mainly published in the research areas of marine and ocean engineering ocean engineering and also the navigation related journals such as journal of navigation and polish maritime research besides the control related journals such as ifac paperonline also attract many works to publish based on the information obtained from the publication sources one can see that research on collision avoidance decision making is a highly inter discipline topic that needs knowledge and experience from at least three major aspects mentioned above 2 keywords to better understand the development and focal points of collision avoidance decision making research from the literature vosviewer software 3 3 https www vosviewer com is used to analyze the titles and abstracts of the collected literature and the popular research keywords are shown in fig 3 the words of different colors in the figure represent the research hotspots chronologically which is indicated by the color bar the bubbles size reflects the number of occurrences of the literature s keywords and the lines represent the correlation between them from fig 3 one can see that various keywords are included in the theoretical research such as encounter situation simulation collision avoidance strategy deep reinforcement learning etc these keywords either indicate the factors considered in the literature or the methods or technical approaches utilized i e such a figure has presented the overview of the research on ship collision avoidance decision making in recent years besides the trend of hot spots in collision avoidance decision making research is also presented in the early stage the researches mainly focuses on own ship navigator open sea colregs and encounter situation simulation action as time goes by many new hot words of ship collision avoidance research appear such as restricted water speed alternation course alternation uncertainty ship domain ship maneuverability recently unmanned surface vehicle deep reinforcement learning experiment accuracy disturbance situational awareness intention estimation are drawing more attention from the academia this indicates that the research has been considering more constraints that can reflect actual situations and take advantage of new ideas and technologies such as deep reinforcement learning to propose more optimum solutions from the chronological perspective the focuses of collision avoidance are shifting from traditional collision avoidance to autonomous collision avoidance however this does not mean that the research of traditional collision avoidance has stopped but more researchers begin to pay attention to autonomous collision avoidance as the development of such system are still at an early stage e g fan et al 2020 he et al 2017 from the perspective of environmental interference the research on collision avoidance focused on open seas and then restricted waters became the research focus from the perspective of the ship encounter situation s complexity the research on two ship encounter situation is relatively mature and the research on multi ship encounter situation has become a new hot spot in recent years e g chen et al 2018 li et al 2019 besides with the improvement of the accuracy stability and reliability of collision avoidance more and more factors related to collision avoidance are considered such as ship maneuverability ship domain and experiment etc 3 2 research factors section 3 1 utilizes vosviewer to analyze the titles and abstracts in the collected literature to get the research hotspots through a thorough reading of all the literature combined with the navigator experience and the above hot cloud words the research area is analyzed and divided into open sea areas and restricted water areas the restricted water area in this paper is defined as the water area with shallow water narrow width and more static obstacles such as approach channel and harbor water area if the description of the research area in the literature meets the above definition it will be classified as the research on collision avoidance in restricted water areas otherwise it will be considered as the study in the open sea according to the classification criterion 44 papers 55 70 are about open sea 23 papers 29 11 are about restricted water and 12 papers 15 19 are about open sea restricted water which is shown in fig 4 to further analyze the characteristics of research on collision avoidance decision making in different waters area the literature on both open and restricted waters are furtherly classified into open seas and restricted waters the reason for such an operation is to follow the design of research scenarios in the previous section therefore the research on open seas accounts for 61 54 56 papers and that of restricted waters accounts for 38 46 35 papers according to the ship encounter situation s complexity the study of collision avoidance decision making can be divided into two parts 1 for two ship encounter situation and for 2 multi ship encounter situation respectively as shown in fig 5 in the open sea the collision avoidance decision making for multi ship encounter situation is mainly studied 51 79 in the restricted water the collision avoidance decision making for multi ship encounter situation is the major part 77 14 combined with different water areas and ship encounter situations the research environment can be divided into four categories two ship encounter in the open sea multi ship encounter in the open sea two ship encounter in restricted water and multi ship encounter in restricted water these four research environments have different influences on the research of collision avoidance decision making the differences can be analyzed from two dimensions one is that the complexity of the encounter situation is not the same the other one is that water restrictions are not the same to furtherly explore the research framework of collision avoidance decision making in different environments the following factors are considered in all four environments the classification criteria are shown in table 1 f1 ship anti collision responsibility which means the responsibility of the ship should take in the encounter situation according to colregs the ships in an encounter situation can be classified as a give way ship stand on ship or ship with equal responsibility f2 environment interference which means the interference of wind wave current and other factors in the process of ship motion in this research we classified the literature into two types considered and not considered f3 ship maneuverability which means the ability of a ship to keep or change its state of motion under the control actions xia et al 2018 i e to keep the straight ahead course with speed constraint or to change the speed course and or the position of the ship according to the intention of the helmsman in this research the literature is divided into considering and not considering the ship maneuverability in the collision avoidance decision making research f4 target ship s maneuvering which means that the target ship will not necessarily keep the course and speed during the collision avoidance operation the motion of the target ship is uncertain so the intention of the target ship needs to be estimated the literature collected in this paper is therefore divided into considered or not considered f5 ship domain which means the area around the ship that avoids the entrance of other ships to keep navigation safety in our research the literature collected can be divided into two types considering the ship domain or not f6 expert experience which means the navigation experience and good seamanship of ship officers on board the literature collected in our research can be divided into consideration and non consideration f7 collision avoidance action which means the ship s maneuvering behavior to avoid the collision including speed alteration course alteration speed and course alteration trajectory planning based on the aforementioned criteria 91 collected literature are classified and the results are shown in fig 6 the detailed results of the analysis will be elaborated in the following sections 3 3 analysis of the factors obtained from the literature in the aforementioned section a set of definition of the factors considered in our research are presented and the literature collected are generally classified according to the corresponding factors to obtain deeper insights on the research topics of the literature in this section the literature is classified according to the corresponding factor and a detailed result of the classification will be elaborated the discussions on the results obtained from the analysis will be illustrated in section 6 3 3 1 ship anti collision responsibility ship collision avoidance responsibility party refers to the object that the ship should take actions to avoid the collision in different environments according to the colregs the ships that need to bear the responsibility of collision avoidance can be divided into the give way ship g stand on ship s and ship with equal responsibility g s as rule 16 of colregs mandate the give way ship shall so as far as possible take early and substantial action to keep well clear from the ship that is in an encounter situation and have the potential for collision accident table 2 illustrates the distribution of the ship s anti collision responsibility assumed in academic research as shown in table 2 the give way ship is the main research object in collision avoidance decision making this can be explained by the duty of the give way ship and also the focus of the research is more on proposing optimized and safe collision avoidance decisions the proportion of research that considers give way ship to take collision avoidance responsibility in two ship encounter situation is higher than that in multi ship encounter situation in the multi ship encounter situation a large proportion of studies do not consider the ship s avoidance responsibility and it is rare to discuss which ship should bear the responsibility of avoiding the collision 3 3 2 environment interference environment interference refers to the interference of wind wave current and other factors in the process of ship motion that would have an influence on the effect of collision avoidance maneuver most studies 82 42 do not consider the environmental interference in their models e g zhang et al 2015 thinks that the environmental interference of ships in the same environment is at the same level so the influence of wind wave and current can be ignored in the decision making process in the meantime some works think that environment interference is a very important factor as a part of future research which is not considered in the current development of collision avoidance decision making model kumagai et al 2012 naeem et al 2016 woo and kim 2020 xie et al 2019a b the consideration of the influencing factors is also different in the literature some only consider the impact of current candeloro et al 2017 another group of works considers the impact of wind lazarowska 2012 szlapczynski and krata 2018 on top of these szlapczynski et al 2018a tam and bucknall 2010 consider the impact of wind and current and fang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 consider the impact of wind wave and current comprehensively as shown in table 3 the proportions of literature that considers environmental factors in restricted waters are higher than that in open seas the proportion of paper which considers environment interference in two ship encounter situation is also higher than that of multi ship encounter situation 3 3 3 ship maneuverability the ship has characteristics of large inertia and its change of course or speed has an obvious time delay effect mou et al 2020 therefore ship motion control has the characteristics of nonholonomic constraint and underdrive and ship course alteration is a non linear motion process ship maneuverability is the ability of a ship to keep or change its state of motion under the control actions i e to keep the straight ahead course with constant speed or to change the speed the course and or the position of the ship according to the intention of the helmsman the ship motion model is generally used to describe the maneuverability of ships and to develop ship control methods in the literature collected most studies have considered ship maneuverability in the collected literature about half of the studies 53 85 consider ship maneuverability the three degrees of freedom 3 dof model kozynchenko and kozynchenko 2018 lee et al 2019 xue et al 2011 and six degrees of freedom 6 dof model fang et al 2019 szlapczynski et al 2018a szlapczynski and krata 2018 are frequently utilized in their models as shown in table 4 the consideration of ship maneuverability in open and restricted waters is at the same level the proportion of research that considers ship maneuverability in two ship encounter situations more than that in multi ship encounter situations 3 3 4 target ship manoeuvring target ship maneuvering in our research means that the target ship is not necessarily keeping the course and speed during the encounter process in navigation practice the target ship is not always keeping course and speed the motion of the target ship is uncertain therefore the intention of the target ship needs to be estimated from the perspective of the own ship to avoid the collision the course and speed could fluctuate within a certain range in the actual movement of the ship due to the development of the encounter situation or the influence of the environmental factors at the same time in the traditional collision avoidance process the stand on ships need to keep the course and speed but some of them will violate the rules in this case if it is still assumed that the target ship can maintain the course and speed the own ship may not be able to achieve safe collision avoidance therefore considering the maneuvering of the target ship and predicting the trajectory of the target ship is an important aspect to improve the effectiveness of collision avoidance in general target ship maneuvering has been considered by a few researchers 20 88 chen et al 2010 szlapczynski 2015 szłapczyński 2013 tsou et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 have considered the maneuvering of the target ship and predicted the intention of the target ship as shown in table 5 most of the studies 79 12 do not consider the dynamics of the target ship regardless of the research area there are not many papers considering the maneuvering of the target ship which accounts for 21 43 and 20 00 in the open sea and restricted waters respectively among them the proportion of literature considering target ship maneuvering in multi ship encounter situations is higher than that in two ship encounter situations 3 3 5 ship domain ship domain theory was originally proposed by fujii fujii and tanaka 1971 which is the area around the ship that avoids the entrance of other ships to keep navigation safety in the research on ship collision risk and avoidance the ship domain can be utilized as one of the criteria for measuring safety between ships e g chen et al 2019a b in the process of collision avoidance the ship shall not violate the ship domain of the target ship song et al 2018 yang et al 2019 or the own ship domain shall not be violated by the target ship he et al 2017 hu and he 2018 mou et al 2020 as shown in table 6 for the open sea 74 07 of the papers considered the ship domain in a two ship encounter situation while 51 72 considered the ship domain in a multi ship encounter situation for the restricted water 62 50 of the papers considered the ship domain in the two ship encounter situation and 70 37 considered the ship domain in a multi ship encounter situation 3 3 6 expert experience expert experience in our research refers to the navigation experience of the navigator which includes good seamanship traditional collision avoidance is a process that depends heavily and crucially on the navigator s experience and judgment as there are no specific rules governing the optimum use of collision avoidance apart from colregs coupled with the traditional practices of seamanship tam et al 2009 we have analyzed the consideration of the expert experience in the literature collected in our work as shown in table 7 in restricted waters the proportion of paper considering experts experience is 14 29 in open seas the proportion of paper considering expert experience in multi ship encounter situation is 17 24 and that in a two ship encounter situation is 22 22 3 3 7 collision avoidance action collision avoidance action in our research refers to the actions or behaviors of the ship s maneuvering to avoid a collision collision avoidance actions can be divided into collision free maneuvers and the safety trajectory tam et al 2009 the research of collision free maneuvers can also be furtherly divided into the course and speed alteration du et al 2020 nakamura et al 2019 ni et al 2019 course alteration he et al 2017 hu and he 2018 and speed alteration ma and yang 2013 zhang et al 2019 as for the safety trajectory here we refer to the collision free trajectory i e a series of waypoints or a series of control inputs provided to the autonomous ship or oows onboard in various ways the process which can refer to trajectory planning is not in the scope of this research tam and bucknall 2010 and naeem et al 2016 used trajectory planning to solve ship conflict within which the significance of the collision free path is emphasized as shown in table 8 for both the restricted water and open sea the proportion of literature using the safety trajectory to solve the conflict is the largest 3 4 knowledge structure in the aforementioned sections the detailed proportion of literature considering each factor has been elaborated the results of the analysis can provide insights on what factors are considered in the works and can be utilized to identify the aspects that can be improved for further development of collision avoidance decision making combining all factors considered in the current research with high occurrence frequencies the knowledge framework of collision avoidance decision making theoretical research is constructed which is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 the color of bars in the middle indicates the factors discussed in the aforementioned sections the black arrows indicate the factors considered in different scenarios e g two ship encounters in the open sea or multi ship encounters in restricted waters in the figure we can see the knowledge structure for collision avoidance decision making in four different environments 1 multi ship encounter in the open sea 2 two ship encounter situation in the open sea 3 multi ship encounter situation in restricted water and 4 two ship encounter situation in restricted water for example in the case of a multi ship encounter situation in the open sea most studies consider the responsibility of collision avoidance as the give way ship ship domain safety trajectory for collision avoidance action and simulation for algorithm verification however factors such as environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering expert experience are not universally considered among the works 4 knowledge structure for navigation practices safety of navigation relies heavily on the knowledge and experience of ship officers as they are the main role in proposing and executing the collision avoidance decision making such knowledge and experience would be of great significance for the development of collision avoidance decision making models and methods to obtain the knowledge and experience an expert knowledge elicitation process is conducted in our research 4 1 description of the questionnaire results according to the results of the questionnaire all the participants in this survey are senior ship officers as shown in fig 8 there are 9 captains 31 03 3 first mates 10 34 6 s mates 20 69 8 third mates 27 59 and 3 pilots 10 34 participating in the survey the average length of service of the captain was 16 2 years the first mate is 8 7 years the second mate is 5 years the third mate is 1 5 years and the pilot is 5 years statistics of the predominant working conditions of the oows indicate that 13 79 worked in the open sea 20 69 worked in restricted water and 65 52 worked in both open and restricted water 4 2 analysis of the factors obtained from an expert survey 4 2 1 ship anti collision responsibility as is shown in table 9 in a two ship encounter situation regardless of the environment the ship officers assume the own ship as a give way ship to assume the responsibility for avoidance however in a multi ship encounter such conception is different from that in two ship encounters besides some oows believe that in a multi ship encounter situation it is necessary first to determine the ship s anti collision responsibility based on the risk priority 4 2 2 environment interference environment disturbances wind current wave etc can have an influence on the behavior of the ships during encounter situations which need to be thoroughly considered in the collision avoidance decision making process as shown in table 10 in both restricted waters and open seas and in both multi ship encounter and two ship encounter situations most ship officers agree that environment interference needs to be considered in the ship collision avoidance process 4 2 3 ship maneuverability as is shown in table 11 regardless of the environment most navigators believe that ship maneuverability should be considered in ship collision avoidance 4 2 4 target ship maneuvering as is shown in table 12 being consistent with ship maneuverability and environment interference factors regardless of the environment most oows believe that ship collision avoidance requires consideration of target ship maneuvering when analyzing the encounter situation and collision avoidance decision making 4 2 5 ship domain as is shown in table 13 regardless of the environment the acceptance of the ship domain for the ship officers in their decision making process is between 50 and 60 in addition most officers only take their own ship s domain into consideration when making the collision avoidance decision 4 2 6 expert experience according to emsa 2020 the total number of reported marine casualties and incidents with a ship over the period 2014 2019 is 13 204 among which 44 are caused by collision contact and grounding stranding for 1801 accident events analyzed by emsa over the 2014 2019 period analyzed during safety investigations 54 were attributed to human error human error is often due to crew did not follow colregs and good seamanship such as failing to take measures in time improper action of avoidance inadequate risk assessment not proceed at a safe speed etc gong et al 2016 hänninen and kujala 2012 from the statistics one can see the significance of colregs and good seamanship in safe navigation and collision avoidance as shown in table 14 in practice most ship officers apply their expert experience to combine the colregs in the collision avoidance decision making process 4 2 7 collision avoidance action speed and course alterations are considered the frequently used measures for the ship to avoid collision generally ship officers prefer to change course to avoid collision to save time and preparation of the ship s main engine however in certain situations where course change is insufficient to perform the task speed adjustment will still be applied as is shown in table 15 in the open sea most of the navigators choose course alteration as the major option to avoid the collision in both multi ship and two ship encounter situations in restricted water most of the navigators choose to utilize speed and course alteration at the same time to avoid the collision in both multi ship and two ship encounter situations 4 3 knowledge structure based on the aforementioned sections the perception of the majority of ship officers with regards to collision avoidance decision making is consistent combined with the empirical data from most of the oows the framework for collision avoidance decision making in practice is shown in fig 9 similar to fig 7 the color of bars in the middle indicates the factors discussed in the aforementioned sections the black arrows indicate the factors considered in different scenarios from the figure we can identify the knowledge structure of collision avoidance of multi ship encounter situations in the open sea two ship encounter situations in the open sea multi ship encounter situations in restricted water and two ship encounter situations in restricted water for example in the case of a multi ship encounter situation most officers consider the own ship as a give way ship and environmental interference ship maneuverability expert experience ship domain target ship maneuvering course alteration are also considered to avoid the collision as for the multi ship encounter situations in restricted waters the factors considered are the same as those in the open seas while the choice of collision avoidance action would be the same the detailed comparisons among the knowledge structures are elaborated in section 5 5 comparison between the knowledge structures in the previous sections we have obtained the knowledge structures on collision avoidance decision making from both the literature and expert knowledge to represent how this topic is analyzed from a theoretical and navigation practical perspective respectively in this section we would like to discuss the common knowledge and discrepancies between these two knowledge structures through the comparative analysis of the two frameworks in different dimensions three dimensions of analysis are considered in this section following the research scenarios in the previous sections which are 1 the comparison between the complete collision avoidance framework between theoretical and practical perspectives 2 the comparison between collision avoidance framework in multi ship and two ship encounter situations 3 the comparison between collision avoidance framework comparison in the open sea and restricted water through the comparisons we have obtained insights on which factors are considered in different scenarios and how they are considered a thorough discussion of the insights obtained in this section will be illustrated in section 6 5 1 comparison of complete collision avoidance framework between theoretical and practical perspectives the knowledge structure of theoretical and practical ship collision avoidance decision making is compared and analyzed in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 shows the comparison of ship collision avoidance decision making framework in open seas fig 11 presents the comparison of ship collision avoidance decision making framework in restricted waters three types of lines are utilized in the figure to represent different categories of the factors 1 the red dash line refers to the factors that are considered in the knowledge structure of navigational practices 2 the black line represents the factors considered in the theoretical research 3 the grey line represents the factors that are considered in both perspectives as for multi ship encounter in the open sea the collision avoidance decision making in theoretical research and practice mainly consider the own ship as the give way ship to avoid the collision and also considers the ship domain the difference between the two scenarios lies in the occurrences of them in the two aspects e g for theoretical research the ship domain is frequently utilized as the criteria for collision risk while its usage in navigation practices is lower in the meantime for two ship encounter situations in the open sea the similarity between theoretical and practical decision making framework for collision avoidance decision making is higher for example in the area of ship anti collision responsibility ship domain and collision avoidance action the consideration is consistent with deeper analysis on the occurrences of each factor and their states we have found that the overlapping degree of knowledge structure between theory and practice is low i e for some factors the preference between the two scenarios is different for environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering and expert experience most of the navigators consider these factors in practice but only a small number of studies have considered these factors in theoretical research for collision avoidance action factors safety trajectory is the main method in theoretical research but in practices course alteration is the main choice for collision avoidance decision making as for the restricted water scenario similar to the open sea theoretical research and practice have some similarities ship anti collision responsibility and ship domain are both considered in the knowledge structure of different encounter situations besides ship maneuverability and environment interference are the same in collision avoidance decision making knowledge structure of two ship encounter situations in addition to the above similarities there are differences between theory and practice in the following aspects 1 for environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering and expert experience most of the navigators consider these factors in their collision avoidance practices but few studies have considered these factors in theoretical research for collision avoidance action safety trajectory is the main method in theoretical research but in practice speed and course alteration is the main choice 5 2 comparison between the knowledge structures in theoretical research as for the collision avoidance decision making in theoretical research the comparison is conducted following two dimensions 1 one is the comparison between different encounter situations in the same water area fig 12 and 2 the comparison of collision avoidance decision making framework in different waters with the same encounter situations fig 13 fig 12 shows the comparison results of the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making in different situations in the same water area three different color lines represent the factors considered in different scenarios 1 the red dash line refers to the factors that are considered in a multi ship encounter situation 2 the black line represents the factors that are considered in a two ship encounter situation 3 the grey line represents the factors that are considered in both perspectives it can be seen from the figure that to a large extent the collision avoidance decision making framework for multi ship encounter situations is consistent with that of two ship encounter situations in both the open sea and restricted waters in the meantime there are some differences in the following aspects in the open sea most studies consider ship maneuverability in two ship encounter situations while a few studies consider ship maneuverability in multi ship encounter situations in the case of a two ship encounter situation in open sea navigation most of the researches focuses on utilizing course alteration to avoid the collision in restricted waters the consideration of ship maneuverability is consistent with that in the open sea i e course and speed alteration are both considered fig 13 shows the comparison of knowledge structure in different water areas with the same encounter complexity situation the red black and grey lines indicate the factors of the knowledge structure in restricted water in the open sea and the common factors of the knowledge structure in the two waters it can be seen from the figure that the collision avoidance decision making framework of open sea shares a large extent of similarities with that of restricted water especially in multi ship encounter situations the knowledge structure of open sea and restricted water is completely the same however in the two ship encounter situation in the open sea half of the studies considered the course alteration to avoid the collision but in restricted waters the safety trajectory to avoid a collision was the main consideration 5 3 comparison of the factors considered in navigation practices in navigational practices the knowledge framework of collision avoidance decision making is divided into two dimensions 1 one is the comparison between different encounter situations in the same water area fig 14 2 the other is the comparison between the collision avoidance decision making frameworks in different waters in the same encounter situation fig 15 fig 14 shows the comparison results of the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making in different encounter situations in the same water area the grey lines indicate the common factors of the knowledge structure in the two waters it can be seen from the figure that the decision making structures for different encounter situations are the same in the open sea and restricted waters the only discrepancy lies in the option for the collision avoidance actions that in the open sea the decision would be course change and for the restricted waters the option would be speed and course change fig 15 shows the comparison of knowledge structure in different water areas in the same encounter situation three different color lines represent the factors in different knowledge structures 1 the red dash line refers to the factors that are considered in the knowledge structure of restricted water 2 the black line represents the factors that are considered in the open sea 3 the grey line represents the factors that are considered in both perspectives as shown in the figure all factors considered in the collision avoidance decision making framework of the open sea and restricted waters are consistent except for collision avoidance action in the open sea regardless of it is a multi ship encounter situation or two ship encounter situation most of the ship officers adopt the course alteration to solve the conflict while in restricted water most of the ship officers adopt course and speed alteration to solve the conflict in any encounter situation 6 discussion 6 1 discussion on the results of comparisons based on the comparative results in section 5 it is clear that certain gaps exist between practical and theoretical research ship anti collision responsibility and ship domain factor are both considered in the knowledge structure of theoretical research and navigation practice however environment interference target ship maneuvering and expert experience factors are different in the knowledge structures of theory and practice this section will discuss the details of such differences 6 1 1 the differences between the knowledge framework in theoretical research and navigation practices for environment interference compared with navigational practices such a factor is not always considered in theoretical research three reasons could explain why such a factor is not popular in the theoretical research of collision avoidance decision making 1 wind waves currents and other environmental interference are highly non linear and difficult to simulate and its influence on the ship motion models is not accurately and reliably models and estimated 2 some studies assume their collision avoidance decision making is carried out at calm seas the environment interference therefore does not need to be included in the ship motion model and 3 some decision making methods for collision avoidance can counteract environmental interference i e the control models in such collision avoidance process is robust with regards to the external influences however the value of the ship turning circle which is one of the indicators of the ship s maneuverability may be influenced by wind waves and sea current in practices szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 the prediction of the ship s motion may not be accurate when the interference of the environment is ignored which will ultimately affect the accuracy of the decision making process for collision avoidance besides the environmental interference may also have an influence on the oows to perform adequate collision avoidance decisions which may violate the colregs and good seamanship and ultimately caused the accident chen et al 2019a b to increase the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method in a real world domain it is therefore necessary to consider collision avoidance under the sea environmental interference sun et al 2018 at present many studies have considered environmental interference in collision avoidance decision making for example vujičić et al 2017 use the simulator simulation method to find the law of environment interference on ship motion wu et al 2017 added the external force caused by environment interference into the ship motion model these methods can provide a reference for solving the impact of environmental interference in collision avoidance decision making at the same time further investigation and modeling are necessary to better consider such influences in the collision avoidance decision making process for ship maneuverability similar to the environmental influences it is not fully considered in the knowledge structure of theoretical collision avoidance decision making for the multi ship encounter the reasons may be as follows 1 for some researches the focus of their works are on coordinating the decision making of collision avoidance between ships in multi ship encounter situation so that the individual ship maneuverability could be ignored 2 taking ship maneuverability into the modeling will increase the computational burden of the ship collision avoidance decision making and may not meet the real time requirements to generate the collision avoidance decision in the proper time frame in the meantime the reliability of the collision avoidance decision is affected by ship maneuverability ni et al 2019 this is due to the following characteristics of the ship 1 the ship has the characteristics of large inertia and its course of change has an obvious time delay effect 2 the motion control has the characteristics of nonholonomic constraint and underdrive and the course of change is non linear mou et al 2020 hence ship maneuverability is a very important factor in collision avoidance decision making among all the theoretical research ship maneuverability has been considered in most studies of restricted waters 51 43 and open sea 55 36 in collision avoidance decision making of two ship encounter situations as for the target ship maneuvering most of the current research 79 12 assumes the target ship s maintain their speed and course during the encounter situation but in the navigation practice the target ship s will have certain maneuvering due to the external influences their own manoeuvering operations and the influences from the other ships in the vicinity that are not involved in the encounter through theoretical analysis and expert experience the reasons for not considering the maneuvering of the target ship in most theoretical studies could be as follows 1 when the target ship is a stand on ship according to the rules the target ship needs to keep the course and speed constant according to colregs 2 collision avoidance decision making is a process of continuous updating and iteration so the error caused by not considering the maneuvering of target ship can be ignored in fact through the observation of ais data we can see that the ship s course speed and other motion parameters are constantly changing in practice according to the situation of the target ship the oow will adjust the collision avoidance decision making of the ship in real time therefore there could be some discrepancies between the theoretical research and practice without considering the maneuvering of the target ship which could lead to the differences between the collision avoidance decisions proposed in the models and practices this also leads to possible scenarios where theoretical collision avoidance decision making results can not adapt to the real encounter scenario in the literature rong et al 2019 proposed a probabilistic trajectory prediction model to describes the uncertainty in future positions along with the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions huang et al 2019 proposed generalized velocity obstacle algorithm which discards the holonomic assumption and is capable of handling the ship s dynamics considering the new development from the literature these methods could be used to deal with the uncertainty of the target ship s maneuvering for expert experience about 17 58 of the studies considered this factor the reasons why this factor has not been adopted by most researches could be as follows 1 expert experience is like a supplement to colregs for the works that only considers colregs the detailed parameters for risk analysis might be based on a preset threshold which is not obtained from experts such as oows onboard 2 expert experience is an abstract knowledge which is very difficult to quantify as an alternative indicators e g relative distance relative bearing cpa etc based approaches for collision avoidance decision making are applied in the theoretical models however due to the qualitative description of the colregs expert experience is necessary to assist the collision avoidance decision making process which is suitable for the colregs expert experience is inseparable from the existing colregs as it is an important resource to understand the contents of colregs which is not expressed explicitly in such a situation the expert experience can provide some guidance on when and what kind of avoidance action should be taken some researchers such as he et al 2017 and hu and he 2018 has considered expert knowledge in the collision avoidance decision making modeling li et al 2010 established a large database of expert experience to realize ship collision avoidance decision making but due to its ambiguity the expert experience is still very difficult to be quantified in a theoretical study further research on this topic is necessary to fully exploit its advantage especially at this stage big data artificial intelligence and other methods are constantly developing these methods make it possible for expert experience to be used in collision avoidance decision making for ship collision avoidance action most of the theoretical researches adopt safety trajectory as the solution to collision avoidance e g perera 2020 tsou 2016 yang et al 2019 however in practice specific collision avoidance actions speed and course alteration are usually adopted by oows to avoid the collision the reason for the difference between theory and practice is because of the controller of the ship the collision avoidance trajectory which is a series of waypoints of control inputs gives specific information on the location and navigation status speed course to the ship to avoid the collision such information is more suitable for the controller onboard autonomous ship as they can accurately calculate and execute the manoeuver to follow the safety trajectory but in navigational practice according to the colregs the operation of ship collision avoidance does not follow such a detailed design in practice collision avoidance actions in different waters are different in the open sea oows mostly take course alteration to avoid the collision while restricted waters mostly consider both course and speed alteration to avoid the collision this is determined by colregs according to the 8th rule of the colregs under most circumstances alteration of course is the most effective action to avoid a close quarters situation especially at the open sea when ample sea room is available besides when sailing in open waters the oows often adopts constant speed to navigate therefore oows give priority to course alteration to avoid the collision in the open sea in addition a collision free trajectory is easier to obtain in theoretical research but it may satisfy the colregs according to the colregs and good seamanship a succession of small alterations of course and or speed should be avoided hence the safety trajectory should avoid such design in the trajectory that needs a series of small alterations these changes are enough to attract the attention of the target ship of course the premise of the above consideration is to follow the colregs and a safety trajectory can be utilized to facilitate the operation of manned ships for unmanned ships the safety trajectory can be directly followed by the controller onboard the ship and executed by the actuators but for the manned ship the navigator may not be able to directly control the ship navigation based on the given trajectory effectively therefore for the manned ship the collision avoidance actions need to be specified in a course or speed manner while for an unmanned ship the corresponding trajectory can be given by specific algorithms and navigation preferences using methods such a trajectory planning etc 6 1 2 general remarks in general the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making is determined according to the encounter situation complexity in theory but in practice the knowledge structure of collision avoidance is determined according to the water area the specific differences have been discussed in the aforementioned section besides in all the above knowledge structures of collision avoidance decision making ship domain factors are included most of the theoretical studies 64 84 have considered the ship domain but through the literature summary we know that the ship domain can be divided into the target ship domain and own ship domain in practice the officers consider the ship domain as the own ship domain the analysis from the oows point of view should be self centered to avoid the intrusion of the target ship into the own ship s domain however this is inconsistent with some theoretical studies which have considered the ship domain of the target ship song et al 2019a b yang et al 2019 however from a safety point of view ship collision avoidance can be achieved at a safe distance this means that in the case of ensuring that the two ships have sufficient safety distance no matter whose ship domain is acceptable for the testing of the collision avoidance decision making models most of the theoretical studies use the simulation for algorithm testing while in practice the oows constantly monitor the course of the collision avoidance process and make corresponding changes if the decision is not effective to avoid the collision simulation is the well known first step towards model verification at present simulation testing is mostly used in theoretical research because of the limitation of experimental cost and testing technology but with the development of testing technology the ultimate goal is to go to the field test field tests can be divided into small middle and full scale tests different algorithm validation testing methods can meet the research needs of different periods by combining the simulation and field testing on every level the verification calibration and validation process of the collision avoidance decision making can be furtherly improved 6 2 limitation of theoretical research navigation practices can be a great resource to facilitate the development of theoretical research on collision avoidance decision making compared with navigation practices theoretical research needs to be further expanded in the following aspects 1 environmental interference is a very important factor in the collision avoidance decision making process its influence on collision avoidance decision making is mainly reflected in the influence on ship maneuverability thus affecting the accuracy of collision avoidance at present environment interference is highly non linear and difficult to simulate and there are few works on environment interference 2 ship maneuverability has a great influence on the applicability of the collision avoidance action without considering the maneuverability of the ship the collision avoidance operation of the ship may not be applied to the real ship mou et al 2020 at present in the theoretical research of multi ship encounter situations the consideration of ship maneuverability is not enough 3 at present most of the researchers assume the target ship to keep the course and speed constant during the encounter but in the navigation practice target ships do not necessarily maintain the original motion state once the target ship changes its course and or speed the collision avoidance algorithm based on this assumption can not be applied there are some differences between the research and practice without considering the maneuvering of the target ship and further research is necessary for the application of the collision avoidance decision making algorithm in practices 4 although some of the literature in this comparative research consider colregs in their decision making models the understanding and application of rules are not deep and comprehensive of course there are many qualitative descriptions of the rules themselves so good seamanship has become an effective means to realize collision avoidance by explaining the details of the colregs based on the experience of the oows as for the theoretical research the seamanship and experience from oows would be beneficial for its development 6 3 the connection between the knowledge structures of theoretical research and navigation practices based on the analysis in the previous sections we can also clearly recognize that there is a certain connection between theoretical research and navigation practices theoretical research and practice should be inseparable the authors believe that the study of ship collision avoidance can be divided into three stages one is when there are only manned ships at sea the second is when there are manned ships and unmanned ships at sea the third is that there are only unmanned ships at sea the second stage is the inevitable stage in the development of unmanned ship and it will last for a long time this period is also the time when the factors considered in theory and practice overlap most in practice the decision of collision avoidance mainly depends on the colregs when the decision making of collision avoidance is in the stage of assisting ship navigation the colregs can not be ignored and collision avoidance decision making should be more in line with the practice when the collision avoidance decision making is in the stage of unmanned navigation there could be a more quantitative rule system based on colregs to regulate the collision avoidance process between unmanned ships collision i e to fully embrace the era of co existence of manned and unmanned ship and ultimately fully unmanned maritime traffic the discussion and revisions on the current rules and regulations are also necessary 7 conclusion collision avoidance decision making is one of the significant tasks for the safety of navigation for both manned and unmanned ships this paper collected and analyzed the theoretical research related to the ship collision avoidance decision making from 2010 to 2020 and classifies the research environment into multi ship encounter situations in the open sea two ship encounter situation in the open sea multi ship encounter situation in restricted water and two ship encounter situation in restricted water based on the detailed analysis of the literature eight factors relevant to collision avoidance research were extracted and a theoretical framework for collision avoidance research was established in addition a questionnaire survey was conducted to summarize the oows experience of collision avoidance in practice and a framework for research on collision avoidance in practice was established finally the aforementioned frameworks are compared in three different dimensions to analyze the similarities and differences in the factors considered in different aspects of collision avoidance decision making which is furtherly discussed in the manuscript to identify the research gap and experience from both parts the results of the analysis can be concluded as follows 1 the theoretical research and navigation practices of collision avoidance decision making can be mutually beneficial to each other i e the experience from oows can facilitate the development of the theoretical collision avoidance decision making methods and the research outcome from the theoretical research can also provide a reference for the collision avoidance in navigation practices 2 through literature and questionnaire analysis the knowledge structure of collision avoidance in theory and practice is established respectively 3 the knowledge structure of collision avoidance in theory and practice is mainly determined according to encounter situation complexity and water area respectively 4 by comparing differences in collision avoidance knowledge structures between theory and practice the shortcomings of existing research are summarized combining the limitations of current research future research on collision avoidance decision making could have further development on the following aspects 1 environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering expert experience and other factors should be furtherly considered in the theoretical research of ship collision avoidance decision making 2 the form of collision avoidance decision should be dependant on the research objects a manned ship s collision avoidance actions are more likely to be directed by the alteration of course and speed while the unmanned ship can follow a certain collision free trajectory planned by the control unit onboard 3 in the experience of the oows multi ship collision avoidance is complicated and needs a cooperative collision avoidance procedure this may also be the development of the trend of collision avoidance decision making in both theoretical research and navigation practices credit authorship contribution statement mengxia li

20869,collison between ships is one of the major contributors to maritime accidents to reduce ship collision accidents the research on collision avoidance decision making has been drawing much attention from various parties in this research extensive literature and expert knowledge are collected and analyzed to identify the common sense and discrepancies between collision avoidance decision making for theoretical research and navigation practices the key factors that are considered in the two perspectives are identified and discussed based on which the knowledge structures that can represent the development of the process in the two perspectives are established a series of comparisons between the knowledge structure based on theoretical research and navigation practices are conducted the comparisons indicate clear common sense and discrepancies between the theoretical research and navigation practices regarding collision avoidance decision making the potential causes of them are also analyzed the research results would be beneficial for the development of collision avoidance decision making for both autonomous and conventional manned ships in maritime traffic keywords ship collision collision avoidance decision making navigation practices autonomous ship maritime safety 1 introduction maritime shipping is the main pillar of international trade and the global economy unctad 2020 in the past decades accidents at sea caused serious damage to individuals and societies among all the types of maritime accidents the collision between ships is one of the major contributors j li et al 2019 to create a safe and efficient shipping in a clean ocean international maritime organization imo 1 1 http www imo org en about pages faqs aspx and to reduce the occurrence of ship collision accidents and improve the safety level of maritime traffic much effort has been devoting to the research and development of new technology from both the academia and industries there are various researches on ship collision avoidance to better understand these research contents various literature reviews have been conducted tam et al 2009 analyzed the development of collision avoidance techniques and path planning for ships to identify the state of the art and research questions in close range encounters campbell et al 2012 discussed the current development of collision avoidance of unmanned surface vehicle usv including vehicle control path planning and collision avoidance architecture colregs in the proposed methods were also analyzed polvara et al 2018 summarized the collision risk monitoring methods and path planning compared local path planning with global path planning and analyzed the shortcomings of these methods huang et al 2020 identified three collision avoidance processes i e motion prediction conﬂict detection and conﬂict resolution and provided a comprehensive overview of the techniques used for the different processes of collision avoidance for both the manned ships and unmanned ships as for the objectives and scopes of these works they are mainly from the technical perspective of collision avoidance such as the methods and algorithms utilized in the research although these studies have fully elaborated the development of ship collision avoidance decision making from a technical perspective the common aspects and discrepancies between the collision avoidance decision making in theoretical research and navigation practices are rarely discussed for navigation practices the collision avoidance decision is made by the officers on watch oow based on various factors such as encounter situations expert knowledge etc during such a process certain methods or variables such as cpa closest point of approach and colregs will be utilized to propose the plausible collision avoidance decision as for developing the collision avoidance decision making methods for the autonomous ship this knowledge is beneficial to develop intelligent control methods in the meantime with the advancement of artificial intelligence algorithms the collision avoidance decision making process for the autonomous ship may also be different from the traditional way to a certain extent to bridge the gap between collision avoidance decision making in theoretical research and navigational practices and to identify what could benefit the development in both aspects in our research we have conducted a comprehensive analysis on analyzing collision avoidance decision making in both aspects with a series of thorough comparisons the common senses and discrepancies between theoretical research and practices are obtained and discussed to identify the possible advancement that can be made in future research considering the objective of this research the following questions will be analyzed and answered 1 what factors should be considered in ship collision avoidance decision making 2 what are the similarities and differences between the current collision avoidance research and collision avoidance decision in navigation practice 3 what are the similarities and differences in the research framework of different research environments the focus of this research is not to elaborate on the details of existing methodologies and models for collision avoidance on the contrary we intend to analyze the factors considered in these works based on which we have obtained the knowledge structure of different research aspects and compare them with the knowledge structure of collision avoidance in practices to promote peer work researchers the main contributions of our work are as follows 1 according to the existing literature the collision avoidance decision making s knowledge structure is summarized 2 based on the well designed questionnaire ship officers knowledge structure for ship collision avoidance decision making is collected and summarized 3 through comparative analysis the framework of theoretical collision avoidance research and navigation practice the research for collision avoidance in various environment interference and the research for collision avoidance of individual or multiple ships are comprehensively analyzed and elaborated with this research the relationships between the collision avoidance decision making theoretical research and navigation practices can be identified and utilized to facilitate the development of autonomous ships and collision avoidance in practices by learning from each aspect in the meantime this work could also be beneficial for the establishment of the common framework for the maritime traffic between autonomous ships and conventional manned ships which can promote the development of ship collision avoidance

between the navigation practices and theoretical research on knowledge structures section 4 compares the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making in different environments in practice section 5 compares the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making in different environments section 6 discusses the potential causes of the discrepancies between theoretical research and navigation practices and the potential development trend of collision avoidance research finally conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 methodology this research aims to identify the factors considered in the collision avoidance decision making process and obtain the knowledge structure from the theoretical research and navigational practices perspectives respectively based on the knowledge structures the commonalities and discrepancies between the research frameworks can be identified and discussed therefore the contents of this paper will be conducted with two sessions 1 to identify and summarize the research framework of collision avoidance decision making from existing literature and navigation practices the objective of this session is to analyze how the decision of collision avoidance is made and what factors could be considered from different perspectives 2 the characteristics of the current research framework and discrepancies between researches considering different environments and problem complexities are analyzed by comparing the corresponding knowledge structures focusing on different aspects based on this some insights on bridging the development of collision avoidance decision making for both theoretical research and practices are proposed the potential causes of such commonalities and discrepancies their implications and how they can benefit the development of collision avoidance decision making are then discussed and elaborated the details on literature searching and analysis and the questionnaire design for ship officers are elaborated in the subsequent sections the technical scheme of the research is as shown in fig 1 2 1 literature search and selection in the navigation and collision avoidance operations one of the most important factors that should be considered is the rules and regulations for navigation e g colregs etc for collision avoidance on the conventional manned ship where oow is responsible for such tasks they mainly carry out collision avoidance operations in accordance with colregs and regional regulations as for the theoretical research especially for the development of autonomous ships however until now there is no clear or common regulations framework designated for it campbell et al 2012 as for theoretical research ship collision avoidance decision making can be divided into two types 1 ship collision avoidance research with oows participation i e oow or shore control centre scc will be responsible for making the collision avoidance decisions and 2 ship collision avoidance research without oows participation i e the ship is fully autonomous and can conduct collision avoidance operation by itself to make the theoretical research and practice of collision avoidance comparable and to identify the commonalities and discrepancies between them the following characteristics are considered in the searching and selection of the literature 1 the collision avoidance action meets the requirements of the colregs 2 the collision avoidance objects are mainly dynamic obstacles 3 collision avoidance measures include collision free maneuvering and safety trajectory following the characteristics mentioned above extensive literature is collected from the library of the wuhan university of technology through the internet 2 2 http lib whut edu cn which includes the resources from web of science scopus etc the scope of this research focuses on ship collision avoidance decision making and the time span of the literature is between 2010 and 2020 due to the contents of the literature in these databases english is the primary language among them ship collision avoidance prevention collision avoid collision path planning etc are utilized as the keywords for the literature search and such a process was conducted on may 30 2020 via evaluating the titles and abstracts of the papers based on the aforementioned characteristics and snowballing the relevant articles 73 pieces are selected at the end of the process 2 2 questionnaire design and expert elicitation in practice ship collision avoidance decision making often depends on the experience of the oows therefore to understand the knowledge structure of ship collision avoidance decision making in practice we designed a questionnaire and sent 35 questionnaires to the oows with profound practical experience each oow who received the questionnaire was told that the questionnaire was only for research purposes they needed to fill in the questionnaire according to their experience and knowledge all participants completed the questionnaire voluntarily and anonymously a total of 33 questionnaires were collected and the unqualified ones were screened out e g incomplete answers the same answers for all items specific rules for the overall distribution of answers and contradictions between choices finally 29 valid questionnaires were retained 3 knowledge structure of theoretical research 3 1 bibliometric analysis among all the literature collected for our research they focus on different aspects of collision avoidance decision making processes and are published in various journals to have an overview of the scope and distribution of the literature from different dimensions and obtain their focal points here we have conducted a brief bibliometric analysis of the literature 1 publishing sources the source of the publications collected for the research is shown in fig 2 the top four journals that publish the most papers related to collision avoidance of ships are as follows ocean engineering 21 52 journal of navigation 10 13 and polish maritime research 8 86 and ifac paperonline 7 59 fig 2 is the word cloud that represents the journals publishing collision avoidance decision making works the size of the journal titles indicates the number of publications in the corresponding journal i e the larger the journal titles are the more researches are published on it from the distributions of the publication sources one can see that the researches on collision avoidance decision making are mainly published in the research areas of marine and ocean engineering ocean engineering and also the navigation related journals such as journal of navigation and polish maritime research besides the control related journals such as ifac paperonline also attract many works to publish based on the information obtained from the publication sources one can see that research on collision avoidance decision making is a highly inter discipline topic that needs knowledge and experience from at least three major aspects mentioned above 2 keywords to better understand the development and focal points of collision avoidance decision making research from the literature vosviewer software 3 3 https www vosviewer com is used to analyze the titles and abstracts of the collected literature and the popular research keywords are shown in fig 3 the words of different colors in the figure represent the research hotspots chronologically which is indicated by the color bar the bubbles size reflects the number of occurrences of the literature s keywords and the lines represent the correlation between them from fig 3 one can see that various keywords are included in the theoretical research such as encounter situation simulation collision avoidance strategy deep reinforcement learning etc these keywords either indicate the factors considered in the literature or the methods or technical approaches utilized i e such a figure has presented the overview of the research on ship collision avoidance decision making in recent years besides the trend of hot spots in collision avoidance decision making research is also presented in the early stage the researches mainly focuses on own ship navigator open sea colregs and encounter situation simulation action as time goes by many new hot words of ship collision avoidance research appear such as restricted water speed alternation course alternation uncertainty ship domain ship maneuverability recently unmanned surface vehicle deep reinforcement learning experiment accuracy disturbance situational awareness intention estimation are drawing more attention from the academia this indicates that the research has been considering more constraints that can reflect actual situations and take advantage of new ideas and technologies such as deep reinforcement learning to propose more optimum solutions from the chronological perspective the focuses of collision avoidance are shifting from traditional collision avoidance to autonomous collision avoidance however this does not mean that the research of traditional collision avoidance has stopped but more researchers begin to pay attention to autonomous collision avoidance as the development of such system are still at an early stage e g fan et al 2020 he et al 2017 from the perspective of environmental interference the research on collision avoidance focused on open seas and then restricted waters became the research focus from the perspective of the ship encounter situation s complexity the research on two ship encounter situation is relatively mature and the research on multi ship encounter situation has become a new hot spot in recent years e g chen et al 2018 li et al 2019 besides with the improvement of the accuracy stability and reliability of collision avoidance more and more factors related to collision avoidance are considered such as ship maneuverability ship domain and experiment etc 3 2 research factors section 3 1 utilizes vosviewer to analyze the titles and abstracts in the collected literature to get the research hotspots through a thorough reading of all the literature combined with the navigator experience and the above hot cloud words the research area is analyzed and divided into open sea areas and restricted water areas the restricted water area in this paper is defined as the water area with shallow water narrow width and more static obstacles such as approach channel and harbor water area if the description of the research area in the literature meets the above definition it will be classified as the research on collision avoidance in restricted water areas otherwise it will be considered as the study in the open sea according to the classification criterion 44 papers 55 70 are about open sea 23 papers 29 11 are about restricted water and 12 papers 15 19 are about open sea restricted water which is shown in fig 4 to further analyze the characteristics of research on collision avoidance decision making in different waters area the literature on both open and restricted waters are furtherly classified into open seas and restricted waters the reason for such an operation is to follow the design of research scenarios in the previous section therefore the research on open seas accounts for 61 54 56 papers and that of restricted waters accounts for 38 46 35 papers according to the ship encounter situation s complexity the study of collision avoidance decision making can be divided into two parts 1 for two ship encounter situation and for 2 multi ship encounter situation respectively as shown in fig 5 in the open sea the collision avoidance decision making for multi ship encounter situation is mainly studied 51 79 in the restricted water the collision avoidance decision making for multi ship encounter situation is the major part 77 14 combined with different water areas and ship encounter situations the research environment can be divided into four categories two ship encounter in the open sea multi ship encounter in the open sea two ship encounter in restricted water and multi ship encounter in restricted water these four research environments have different influences on the research of collision avoidance decision making the differences can be analyzed from two dimensions one is that the complexity of the encounter situation is not the same the other one is that water restrictions are not the same to furtherly explore the research framework of collision avoidance decision making in different environments the following factors are considered in all four environments the classification criteria are shown in table 1 f1 ship anti collision responsibility which means the responsibility of the ship should take in the encounter situation according to colregs the ships in an encounter situation can be classified as a give way ship stand on ship or ship with equal responsibility f2 environment interference which means the interference of wind wave current and other factors in the process of ship motion in this research we classified the literature into two types considered and not considered f3 ship maneuverability which means the ability of a ship to keep or change its state of motion under the control actions xia et al 2018 i e to keep the straight ahead course with speed constraint or to change the speed course and or the position of the ship according to the intention of the helmsman in this research the literature is divided into considering and not considering the ship maneuverability in the collision avoidance decision making research f4 target ship s maneuvering which means that the target ship will not necessarily keep the course and speed during the collision avoidance operation the motion of the target ship is uncertain so the intention of the target ship needs to be estimated the literature collected in this paper is therefore divided into considered or not considered f5 ship domain which means the area around the ship that avoids the entrance of other ships to keep navigation safety in our research the literature collected can be divided into two types considering the ship domain or not f6 expert experience which means the navigation experience and good seamanship of ship officers on board the literature collected in our research can be divided into consideration and non consideration f7 collision avoidance action which means the ship s maneuvering behavior to avoid the collision including speed alteration course alteration speed and course alteration trajectory planning based on the aforementioned criteria 91 collected literature are classified and the results are shown in fig 6 the detailed results of the analysis will be elaborated in the following sections 3 3 analysis of the factors obtained from the literature in the aforementioned section a set of definition of the factors considered in our research are presented and the literature collected are generally classified according to the corresponding factors to obtain deeper insights on the research topics of the literature in this section the literature is classified according to the corresponding factor and a detailed result of the classification will be elaborated the discussions on the results obtained from the analysis will be illustrated in section 6 3 3 1 ship anti collision responsibility ship collision avoidance responsibility party refers to the object that the ship should take actions to avoid the collision in different environments according to the colregs the ships that need to bear the responsibility of collision avoidance can be divided into the give way ship g stand on ship s and ship with equal responsibility g s as rule 16 of colregs mandate the give way ship shall so as far as possible take early and substantial action to keep well clear from the ship that is in an encounter situation and have the potential for collision accident table 2 illustrates the distribution of the ship s anti collision responsibility assumed in academic research as shown in table 2 the give way ship is the main research object in collision avoidance decision making this can be explained by the duty of the give way ship and also the focus of the research is more on proposing optimized and safe collision avoidance decisions the proportion of research that considers give way ship to take collision avoidance responsibility in two ship encounter situation is higher than that in multi ship encounter situation in the multi ship encounter situation a large proportion of studies do not consider the ship s avoidance responsibility and it is rare to discuss which ship should bear the responsibility of avoiding the collision 3 3 2 environment interference environment interference refers to the interference of wind wave current and other factors in the process of ship motion that would have an influence on the effect of collision avoidance maneuver most studies 82 42 do not consider the environmental interference in their models e g zhang et al 2015 thinks that the environmental interference of ships in the same environment is at the same level so the influence of wind wave and current can be ignored in the decision making process in the meantime some works think that environment interference is a very important factor as a part of future research which is not considered in the current development of collision avoidance decision making model kumagai et al 2012 naeem et al 2016 woo and kim 2020 xie et al 2019a b the consideration of the influencing factors is also different in the literature some only consider the impact of current candeloro et al 2017 another group of works considers the impact of wind lazarowska 2012 szlapczynski and krata 2018 on top of these szlapczynski et al 2018a tam and bucknall 2010 consider the impact of wind and current and fang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 consider the impact of wind wave and current comprehensively as shown in table 3 the proportions of literature that considers environmental factors in restricted waters are higher than that in open seas the proportion of paper which considers environment interference in two ship encounter situation is also higher than that of multi ship encounter situation 3 3 3 ship maneuverability the ship has characteristics of large inertia and its change of course or speed has an obvious time delay effect mou et al 2020 therefore ship motion control has the characteristics of nonholonomic constraint and underdrive and ship course alteration is a non linear motion process ship maneuverability is the ability of a ship to keep or change its state of motion under the control actions i e to keep the straight ahead course with constant speed or to change the speed the course and or the position of the ship according to the intention of the helmsman the ship motion model is generally used to describe the maneuverability of ships and to develop ship control methods in the literature collected most studies have considered ship maneuverability in the collected literature about half of the studies 53 85 consider ship maneuverability the three degrees of freedom 3 dof model kozynchenko and kozynchenko 2018 lee et al 2019 xue et al 2011 and six degrees of freedom 6 dof model fang et al 2019 szlapczynski et al 2018a szlapczynski and krata 2018 are frequently utilized in their models as shown in table 4 the consideration of ship maneuverability in open and restricted waters is at the same level the proportion of research that considers ship maneuverability in two ship encounter situations more than that in multi ship encounter situations 3 3 4 target ship manoeuvring target ship maneuvering in our research means that the target ship is not necessarily keeping the course and speed during the encounter process in navigation practice the target ship is not always keeping course and speed the motion of the target ship is uncertain therefore the intention of the target ship needs to be estimated from the perspective of the own ship to avoid the collision the course and speed could fluctuate within a certain range in the actual movement of the ship due to the development of the encounter situation or the influence of the environmental factors at the same time in the traditional collision avoidance process the stand on ships need to keep the course and speed but some of them will violate the rules in this case if it is still assumed that the target ship can maintain the course and speed the own ship may not be able to achieve safe collision avoidance therefore considering the maneuvering of the target ship and predicting the trajectory of the target ship is an important aspect to improve the effectiveness of collision avoidance in general target ship maneuvering has been considered by a few researchers 20 88 chen et al 2010 szlapczynski 2015 szłapczyński 2013 tsou et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 have considered the maneuvering of the target ship and predicted the intention of the target ship as shown in table 5 most of the studies 79 12 do not consider the dynamics of the target ship regardless of the research area there are not many papers considering the maneuvering of the target ship which accounts for 21 43 and 20 00 in the open sea and restricted waters respectively among them the proportion of literature considering target ship maneuvering in multi ship encounter situations is higher than that in two ship encounter situations 3 3 5 ship domain ship domain theory was originally proposed by fujii fujii and tanaka 1971 which is the area around the ship that avoids the entrance of other ships to keep navigation safety in the research on ship collision risk and avoidance the ship domain can be utilized as one of the criteria for measuring safety between ships e g chen et al 2019a b in the process of collision avoidance the ship shall not violate the ship domain of the target ship song et al 2018 yang et al 2019 or the own ship domain shall not be violated by the target ship he et al 2017 hu and he 2018 mou et al 2020 as shown in table 6 for the open sea 74 07 of the papers considered the ship domain in a two ship encounter situation while 51 72 considered the ship domain in a multi ship encounter situation for the restricted water 62 50 of the papers considered the ship domain in the two ship encounter situation and 70 37 considered the ship domain in a multi ship encounter situation 3 3 6 expert experience expert experience in our research refers to the navigation experience of the navigator which includes good seamanship traditional collision avoidance is a process that depends heavily and crucially on the navigator s experience and judgment as there are no specific rules governing the optimum use of collision avoidance apart from colregs coupled with the traditional practices of seamanship tam et al 2009 we have analyzed the consideration of the expert experience in the literature collected in our work as shown in table 7 in restricted waters the proportion of paper considering experts experience is 14 29 in open seas the proportion of paper considering expert experience in multi ship encounter situation is 17 24 and that in a two ship encounter situation is 22 22 3 3 7 collision avoidance action collision avoidance action in our research refers to the actions or behaviors of the ship s maneuvering to avoid a collision collision avoidance actions can be divided into collision free maneuvers and the safety trajectory tam et al 2009 the research of collision free maneuvers can also be furtherly divided into the course and speed alteration du et al 2020 nakamura et al 2019 ni et al 2019 course alteration he et al 2017 hu and he 2018 and speed alteration ma and yang 2013 zhang et al 2019 as for the safety trajectory here we refer to the collision free trajectory i e a series of waypoints or a series of control inputs provided to the autonomous ship or oows onboard in various ways the process which can refer to trajectory planning is not in the scope of this research tam and bucknall 2010 and naeem et al 2016 used trajectory planning to solve ship conflict within which the significance of the collision free path is emphasized as shown in table 8 for both the restricted water and open sea the proportion of literature using the safety trajectory to solve the conflict is the largest 3 4 knowledge structure in the aforementioned sections the detailed proportion of literature considering each factor has been elaborated the results of the analysis can provide insights on what factors are considered in the works and can be utilized to identify the aspects that can be improved for further development of collision avoidance decision making combining all factors considered in the current research with high occurrence frequencies the knowledge framework of collision avoidance decision making theoretical research is constructed which is shown in fig 7 in fig 7 the color of bars in the middle indicates the factors discussed in the aforementioned sections the black arrows indicate the factors considered in different scenarios e g two ship encounters in the open sea or multi ship encounters in restricted waters in the figure we can see the knowledge structure for collision avoidance decision making in four different environments 1 multi ship encounter in the open sea 2 two ship encounter situation in the open sea 3 multi ship encounter situation in restricted water and 4 two ship encounter situation in restricted water for example in the case of a multi ship encounter situation in the open sea most studies consider the responsibility of collision avoidance as the give way ship ship domain safety trajectory for collision avoidance action and simulation for algorithm verification however factors such as environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering expert experience are not universally considered among the works 4 knowledge structure for navigation practices safety of navigation relies heavily on the knowledge and experience of ship officers as they are the main role in proposing and executing the collision avoidance decision making such knowledge and experience would be of great significance for the development of collision avoidance decision making models and methods to obtain the knowledge and experience an expert knowledge elicitation process is conducted in our research 4 1 description of the questionnaire results according to the results of the questionnaire all the participants in this survey are senior ship officers as shown in fig 8 there are 9 captains 31 03 3 first mates 10 34 6 s mates 20 69 8 third mates 27 59 and 3 pilots 10 34 participating in the survey the average length of service of the captain was 16 2 years the first mate is 8 7 years the second mate is 5 years the third mate is 1 5 years and the pilot is 5 years statistics of the predominant working conditions of the oows indicate that 13 79 worked in the open sea 20 69 worked in restricted water and 65 52 worked in both open and restricted water 4 2 analysis of the factors obtained from an expert survey 4 2 1 ship anti collision responsibility as is shown in table 9 in a two ship encounter situation regardless of the environment the ship officers assume the own ship as a give way ship to assume the responsibility for avoidance however in a multi ship encounter such conception is different from that in two ship encounters besides some oows believe that in a multi ship encounter situation it is necessary first to determine the ship s anti collision responsibility based on the risk priority 4 2 2 environment interference environment disturbances wind current wave etc can have an influence on the behavior of the ships during encounter situations which need to be thoroughly considered in the collision avoidance decision making process as shown in table 10 in both restricted waters and open seas and in both multi ship encounter and two ship encounter situations most ship officers agree that environment interference needs to be considered in the ship collision avoidance process 4 2 3 ship maneuverability as is shown in table 11 regardless of the environment most navigators believe that ship maneuverability should be considered in ship collision avoidance 4 2 4 target ship maneuvering as is shown in table 12 being consistent with ship maneuverability and environment interference factors regardless of the environment most oows believe that ship collision avoidance requires consideration of target ship maneuvering when analyzing the encounter situation and collision avoidance decision making 4 2 5 ship domain as is shown in table 13 regardless of the environment the acceptance of the ship domain for the ship officers in their decision making process is between 50 and 60 in addition most officers only take their own ship s domain into consideration when making the collision avoidance decision 4 2 6 expert experience according to emsa 2020 the total number of reported marine casualties and incidents with a ship over the period 2014 2019 is 13 204 among which 44 are caused by collision contact and grounding stranding for 1801 accident events analyzed by emsa over the 2014 2019 period analyzed during safety investigations 54 were attributed to human error human error is often due to crew did not follow colregs and good seamanship such as failing to take measures in time improper action of avoidance inadequate risk assessment not proceed at a safe speed etc gong et al 2016 hänninen and kujala 2012 from the statistics one can see the significance of colregs and good seamanship in safe navigation and collision avoidance as shown in table 14 in practice most ship officers apply their expert experience to combine the colregs in the collision avoidance decision making process 4 2 7 collision avoidance action speed and course alterations are considered the frequently used measures for the ship to avoid collision generally ship officers prefer to change course to avoid collision to save time and preparation of the ship s main engine however in certain situations where course change is insufficient to perform the task speed adjustment will still be applied as is shown in table 15 in the open sea most of the navigators choose course alteration as the major option to avoid the collision in both multi ship and two ship encounter situations in restricted water most of the navigators choose to utilize speed and course alteration at the same time to avoid the collision in both multi ship and two ship encounter situations 4 3 knowledge structure based on the aforementioned sections the perception of the majority of ship officers with regards to collision avoidance decision making is consistent combined with the empirical data from most of the oows the framework for collision avoidance decision making in practice is shown in fig 9 similar to fig 7 the color of bars in the middle indicates the factors discussed in the aforementioned sections the black arrows indicate the factors considered in different scenarios from the figure we can identify the knowledge structure of collision avoidance of multi ship encounter situations in the open sea two ship encounter situations in the open sea multi ship encounter situations in restricted water and two ship encounter situations in restricted water for example in the case of a multi ship encounter situation most officers consider the own ship as a give way ship and environmental interference ship maneuverability expert experience ship domain target ship maneuvering course alteration are also considered to avoid the collision as for the multi ship encounter situations in restricted waters the factors considered are the same as those in the open seas while the choice of collision avoidance action would be the same the detailed comparisons among the knowledge structures are elaborated in section 5 5 comparison between the knowledge structures in the previous sections we have obtained the knowledge structures on collision avoidance decision making from both the literature and expert knowledge to represent how this topic is analyzed from a theoretical and navigation practical perspective respectively in this section we would like to discuss the common knowledge and discrepancies between these two knowledge structures through the comparative analysis of the two frameworks in different dimensions three dimensions of analysis are considered in this section following the research scenarios in the previous sections which are 1 the comparison between the complete collision avoidance framework between theoretical and practical perspectives 2 the comparison between collision avoidance framework in multi ship and two ship encounter situations 3 the comparison between collision avoidance framework comparison in the open sea and restricted water through the comparisons we have obtained insights on which factors are considered in different scenarios and how they are considered a thorough discussion of the insights obtained in this section will be illustrated in section 6 5 1 comparison of complete collision avoidance framework between theoretical and practical perspectives the knowledge structure of theoretical and practical ship collision avoidance decision making is compared and analyzed in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 shows the comparison of ship collision avoidance decision making framework in open seas fig 11 presents the comparison of ship collision avoidance decision making framework in restricted waters three types of lines are utilized in the figure to represent different categories of the factors 1 the red dash line refers to the factors that are considered in the knowledge structure of navigational practices 2 the black line represents the factors considered in the theoretical research 3 the grey line represents the factors that are considered in both perspectives as for multi ship encounter in the open sea the collision avoidance decision making in theoretical research and practice mainly consider the own ship as the give way ship to avoid the collision and also considers the ship domain the difference between the two scenarios lies in the occurrences of them in the two aspects e g for theoretical research the ship domain is frequently utilized as the criteria for collision risk while its usage in navigation practices is lower in the meantime for two ship encounter situations in the open sea the similarity between theoretical and practical decision making framework for collision avoidance decision making is higher for example in the area of ship anti collision responsibility ship domain and collision avoidance action the consideration is consistent with deeper analysis on the occurrences of each factor and their states we have found that the overlapping degree of knowledge structure between theory and practice is low i e for some factors the preference between the two scenarios is different for environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering and expert experience most of the navigators consider these factors in practice but only a small number of studies have considered these factors in theoretical research for collision avoidance action factors safety trajectory is the main method in theoretical research but in practices course alteration is the main choice for collision avoidance decision making as for the restricted water scenario similar to the open sea theoretical research and practice have some similarities ship anti collision responsibility and ship domain are both considered in the knowledge structure of different encounter situations besides ship maneuverability and environment interference are the same in collision avoidance decision making knowledge structure of two ship encounter situations in addition to the above similarities there are differences between theory and practice in the following aspects 1 for environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering and expert experience most of the navigators consider these factors in their collision avoidance practices but few studies have considered these factors in theoretical research for collision avoidance action safety trajectory is the main method in theoretical research but in practice speed and course alteration is the main choice 5 2 comparison between the knowledge structures in theoretical research as for the collision avoidance decision making in theoretical research the comparison is conducted following two dimensions 1 one is the comparison between different encounter situations in the same water area fig 12 and 2 the comparison of collision avoidance decision making framework in different waters with the same encounter situations fig 13 fig 12 shows the comparison results of the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making in different situations in the same water area three different color lines represent the factors considered in different scenarios 1 the red dash line refers to the factors that are considered in a multi ship encounter situation 2 the black line represents the factors that are considered in a two ship encounter situation 3 the grey line represents the factors that are considered in both perspectives it can be seen from the figure that to a large extent the collision avoidance decision making framework for multi ship encounter situations is consistent with that of two ship encounter situations in both the open sea and restricted waters in the meantime there are some differences in the following aspects in the open sea most studies consider ship maneuverability in two ship encounter situations while a few studies consider ship maneuverability in multi ship encounter situations in the case of a two ship encounter situation in open sea navigation most of the researches focuses on utilizing course alteration to avoid the collision in restricted waters the consideration of ship maneuverability is consistent with that in the open sea i e course and speed alteration are both considered fig 13 shows the comparison of knowledge structure in different water areas with the same encounter complexity situation the red black and grey lines indicate the factors of the knowledge structure in restricted water in the open sea and the common factors of the knowledge structure in the two waters it can be seen from the figure that the collision avoidance decision making framework of open sea shares a large extent of similarities with that of restricted water especially in multi ship encounter situations the knowledge structure of open sea and restricted water is completely the same however in the two ship encounter situation in the open sea half of the studies considered the course alteration to avoid the collision but in restricted waters the safety trajectory to avoid a collision was the main consideration 5 3 comparison of the factors considered in navigation practices in navigational practices the knowledge framework of collision avoidance decision making is divided into two dimensions 1 one is the comparison between different encounter situations in the same water area fig 14 2 the other is the comparison between the collision avoidance decision making frameworks in different waters in the same encounter situation fig 15 fig 14 shows the comparison results of the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making in different encounter situations in the same water area the grey lines indicate the common factors of the knowledge structure in the two waters it can be seen from the figure that the decision making structures for different encounter situations are the same in the open sea and restricted waters the only discrepancy lies in the option for the collision avoidance actions that in the open sea the decision would be course change and for the restricted waters the option would be speed and course change fig 15 shows the comparison of knowledge structure in different water areas in the same encounter situation three different color lines represent the factors in different knowledge structures 1 the red dash line refers to the factors that are considered in the knowledge structure of restricted water 2 the black line represents the factors that are considered in the open sea 3 the grey line represents the factors that are considered in both perspectives as shown in the figure all factors considered in the collision avoidance decision making framework of the open sea and restricted waters are consistent except for collision avoidance action in the open sea regardless of it is a multi ship encounter situation or two ship encounter situation most of the ship officers adopt the course alteration to solve the conflict while in restricted water most of the ship officers adopt course and speed alteration to solve the conflict in any encounter situation 6 discussion 6 1 discussion on the results of comparisons based on the comparative results in section 5 it is clear that certain gaps exist between practical and theoretical research ship anti collision responsibility and ship domain factor are both considered in the knowledge structure of theoretical research and navigation practice however environment interference target ship maneuvering and expert experience factors are different in the knowledge structures of theory and practice this section will discuss the details of such differences 6 1 1 the differences between the knowledge framework in theoretical research and navigation practices for environment interference compared with navigational practices such a factor is not always considered in theoretical research three reasons could explain why such a factor is not popular in the theoretical research of collision avoidance decision making 1 wind waves currents and other environmental interference are highly non linear and difficult to simulate and its influence on the ship motion models is not accurately and reliably models and estimated 2 some studies assume their collision avoidance decision making is carried out at calm seas the environment interference therefore does not need to be included in the ship motion model and 3 some decision making methods for collision avoidance can counteract environmental interference i e the control models in such collision avoidance process is robust with regards to the external influences however the value of the ship turning circle which is one of the indicators of the ship s maneuverability may be influenced by wind waves and sea current in practices szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 the prediction of the ship s motion may not be accurate when the interference of the environment is ignored which will ultimately affect the accuracy of the decision making process for collision avoidance besides the environmental interference may also have an influence on the oows to perform adequate collision avoidance decisions which may violate the colregs and good seamanship and ultimately caused the accident chen et al 2019a b to increase the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method in a real world domain it is therefore necessary to consider collision avoidance under the sea environmental interference sun et al 2018 at present many studies have considered environmental interference in collision avoidance decision making for example vujičić et al 2017 use the simulator simulation method to find the law of environment interference on ship motion wu et al 2017 added the external force caused by environment interference into the ship motion model these methods can provide a reference for solving the impact of environmental interference in collision avoidance decision making at the same time further investigation and modeling are necessary to better consider such influences in the collision avoidance decision making process for ship maneuverability similar to the environmental influences it is not fully considered in the knowledge structure of theoretical collision avoidance decision making for the multi ship encounter the reasons may be as follows 1 for some researches the focus of their works are on coordinating the decision making of collision avoidance between ships in multi ship encounter situation so that the individual ship maneuverability could be ignored 2 taking ship maneuverability into the modeling will increase the computational burden of the ship collision avoidance decision making and may not meet the real time requirements to generate the collision avoidance decision in the proper time frame in the meantime the reliability of the collision avoidance decision is affected by ship maneuverability ni et al 2019 this is due to the following characteristics of the ship 1 the ship has the characteristics of large inertia and its course of change has an obvious time delay effect 2 the motion control has the characteristics of nonholonomic constraint and underdrive and the course of change is non linear mou et al 2020 hence ship maneuverability is a very important factor in collision avoidance decision making among all the theoretical research ship maneuverability has been considered in most studies of restricted waters 51 43 and open sea 55 36 in collision avoidance decision making of two ship encounter situations as for the target ship maneuvering most of the current research 79 12 assumes the target ship s maintain their speed and course during the encounter situation but in the navigation practice the target ship s will have certain maneuvering due to the external influences their own manoeuvering operations and the influences from the other ships in the vicinity that are not involved in the encounter through theoretical analysis and expert experience the reasons for not considering the maneuvering of the target ship in most theoretical studies could be as follows 1 when the target ship is a stand on ship according to the rules the target ship needs to keep the course and speed constant according to colregs 2 collision avoidance decision making is a process of continuous updating and iteration so the error caused by not considering the maneuvering of target ship can be ignored in fact through the observation of ais data we can see that the ship s course speed and other motion parameters are constantly changing in practice according to the situation of the target ship the oow will adjust the collision avoidance decision making of the ship in real time therefore there could be some discrepancies between the theoretical research and practice without considering the maneuvering of the target ship which could lead to the differences between the collision avoidance decisions proposed in the models and practices this also leads to possible scenarios where theoretical collision avoidance decision making results can not adapt to the real encounter scenario in the literature rong et al 2019 proposed a probabilistic trajectory prediction model to describes the uncertainty in future positions along with the ship trajectories by continuous probability distributions huang et al 2019 proposed generalized velocity obstacle algorithm which discards the holonomic assumption and is capable of handling the ship s dynamics considering the new development from the literature these methods could be used to deal with the uncertainty of the target ship s maneuvering for expert experience about 17 58 of the studies considered this factor the reasons why this factor has not been adopted by most researches could be as follows 1 expert experience is like a supplement to colregs for the works that only considers colregs the detailed parameters for risk analysis might be based on a preset threshold which is not obtained from experts such as oows onboard 2 expert experience is an abstract knowledge which is very difficult to quantify as an alternative indicators e g relative distance relative bearing cpa etc based approaches for collision avoidance decision making are applied in the theoretical models however due to the qualitative description of the colregs expert experience is necessary to assist the collision avoidance decision making process which is suitable for the colregs expert experience is inseparable from the existing colregs as it is an important resource to understand the contents of colregs which is not expressed explicitly in such a situation the expert experience can provide some guidance on when and what kind of avoidance action should be taken some researchers such as he et al 2017 and hu and he 2018 has considered expert knowledge in the collision avoidance decision making modeling li et al 2010 established a large database of expert experience to realize ship collision avoidance decision making but due to its ambiguity the expert experience is still very difficult to be quantified in a theoretical study further research on this topic is necessary to fully exploit its advantage especially at this stage big data artificial intelligence and other methods are constantly developing these methods make it possible for expert experience to be used in collision avoidance decision making for ship collision avoidance action most of the theoretical researches adopt safety trajectory as the solution to collision avoidance e g perera 2020 tsou 2016 yang et al 2019 however in practice specific collision avoidance actions speed and course alteration are usually adopted by oows to avoid the collision the reason for the difference between theory and practice is because of the controller of the ship the collision avoidance trajectory which is a series of waypoints of control inputs gives specific information on the location and navigation status speed course to the ship to avoid the collision such information is more suitable for the controller onboard autonomous ship as they can accurately calculate and execute the manoeuver to follow the safety trajectory but in navigational practice according to the colregs the operation of ship collision avoidance does not follow such a detailed design in practice collision avoidance actions in different waters are different in the open sea oows mostly take course alteration to avoid the collision while restricted waters mostly consider both course and speed alteration to avoid the collision this is determined by colregs according to the 8th rule of the colregs under most circumstances alteration of course is the most effective action to avoid a close quarters situation especially at the open sea when ample sea room is available besides when sailing in open waters the oows often adopts constant speed to navigate therefore oows give priority to course alteration to avoid the collision in the open sea in addition a collision free trajectory is easier to obtain in theoretical research but it may satisfy the colregs according to the colregs and good seamanship a succession of small alterations of course and or speed should be avoided hence the safety trajectory should avoid such design in the trajectory that needs a series of small alterations these changes are enough to attract the attention of the target ship of course the premise of the above consideration is to follow the colregs and a safety trajectory can be utilized to facilitate the operation of manned ships for unmanned ships the safety trajectory can be directly followed by the controller onboard the ship and executed by the actuators but for the manned ship the navigator may not be able to directly control the ship navigation based on the given trajectory effectively therefore for the manned ship the collision avoidance actions need to be specified in a course or speed manner while for an unmanned ship the corresponding trajectory can be given by specific algorithms and navigation preferences using methods such a trajectory planning etc 6 1 2 general remarks in general the knowledge structure of collision avoidance decision making is determined according to the encounter situation complexity in theory but in practice the knowledge structure of collision avoidance is determined according to the water area the specific differences have been discussed in the aforementioned section besides in all the above knowledge structures of collision avoidance decision making ship domain factors are included most of the theoretical studies 64 84 have considered the ship domain but through the literature summary we know that the ship domain can be divided into the target ship domain and own ship domain in practice the officers consider the ship domain as the own ship domain the analysis from the oows point of view should be self centered to avoid the intrusion of the target ship into the own ship s domain however this is inconsistent with some theoretical studies which have considered the ship domain of the target ship song et al 2019a b yang et al 2019 however from a safety point of view ship collision avoidance can be achieved at a safe distance this means that in the case of ensuring that the two ships have sufficient safety distance no matter whose ship domain is acceptable for the testing of the collision avoidance decision making models most of the theoretical studies use the simulation for algorithm testing while in practice the oows constantly monitor the course of the collision avoidance process and make corresponding changes if the decision is not effective to avoid the collision simulation is the well known first step towards model verification at present simulation testing is mostly used in theoretical research because of the limitation of experimental cost and testing technology but with the development of testing technology the ultimate goal is to go to the field test field tests can be divided into small middle and full scale tests different algorithm validation testing methods can meet the research needs of different periods by combining the simulation and field testing on every level the verification calibration and validation process of the collision avoidance decision making can be furtherly improved 6 2 limitation of theoretical research navigation practices can be a great resource to facilitate the development of theoretical research on collision avoidance decision making compared with navigation practices theoretical research needs to be further expanded in the following aspects 1 environmental interference is a very important factor in the collision avoidance decision making process its influence on collision avoidance decision making is mainly reflected in the influence on ship maneuverability thus affecting the accuracy of collision avoidance at present environment interference is highly non linear and difficult to simulate and there are few works on environment interference 2 ship maneuverability has a great influence on the applicability of the collision avoidance action without considering the maneuverability of the ship the collision avoidance operation of the ship may not be applied to the real ship mou et al 2020 at present in the theoretical research of multi ship encounter situations the consideration of ship maneuverability is not enough 3 at present most of the researchers assume the target ship to keep the course and speed constant during the encounter but in the navigation practice target ships do not necessarily maintain the original motion state once the target ship changes its course and or speed the collision avoidance algorithm based on this assumption can not be applied there are some differences between the research and practice without considering the maneuvering of the target ship and further research is necessary for the application of the collision avoidance decision making algorithm in practices 4 although some of the literature in this comparative research consider colregs in their decision making models the understanding and application of rules are not deep and comprehensive of course there are many qualitative descriptions of the rules themselves so good seamanship has become an effective means to realize collision avoidance by explaining the details of the colregs based on the experience of the oows as for the theoretical research the seamanship and experience from oows would be beneficial for its development 6 3 the connection between the knowledge structures of theoretical research and navigation practices based on the analysis in the previous sections we can also clearly recognize that there is a certain connection between theoretical research and navigation practices theoretical research and practice should be inseparable the authors believe that the study of ship collision avoidance can be divided into three stages one is when there are only manned ships at sea the second is when there are manned ships and unmanned ships at sea the third is that there are only unmanned ships at sea the second stage is the inevitable stage in the development of unmanned ship and it will last for a long time this period is also the time when the factors considered in theory and practice overlap most in practice the decision of collision avoidance mainly depends on the colregs when the decision making of collision avoidance is in the stage of assisting ship navigation the colregs can not be ignored and collision avoidance decision making should be more in line with the practice when the collision avoidance decision making is in the stage of unmanned navigation there could be a more quantitative rule system based on colregs to regulate the collision avoidance process between unmanned ships collision i e to fully embrace the era of co existence of manned and unmanned ship and ultimately fully unmanned maritime traffic the discussion and revisions on the current rules and regulations are also necessary 7 conclusion collision avoidance decision making is one of the significant tasks for the safety of navigation for both manned and unmanned ships this paper collected and analyzed the theoretical research related to the ship collision avoidance decision making from 2010 to 2020 and classifies the research environment into multi ship encounter situations in the open sea two ship encounter situation in the open sea multi ship encounter situation in restricted water and two ship encounter situation in restricted water based on the detailed analysis of the literature eight factors relevant to collision avoidance research were extracted and a theoretical framework for collision avoidance research was established in addition a questionnaire survey was conducted to summarize the oows experience of collision avoidance in practice and a framework for research on collision avoidance in practice was established finally the aforementioned frameworks are compared in three different dimensions to analyze the similarities and differences in the factors considered in different aspects of collision avoidance decision making which is furtherly discussed in the manuscript to identify the research gap and experience from both parts the results of the analysis can be concluded as follows 1 the theoretical research and navigation practices of collision avoidance decision making can be mutually beneficial to each other i e the experience from oows can facilitate the development of the theoretical collision avoidance decision making methods and the research outcome from the theoretical research can also provide a reference for the collision avoidance in navigation practices 2 through literature and questionnaire analysis the knowledge structure of collision avoidance in theory and practice is established respectively 3 the knowledge structure of collision avoidance in theory and practice is mainly determined according to encounter situation complexity and water area respectively 4 by comparing differences in collision avoidance knowledge structures between theory and practice the shortcomings of existing research are summarized combining the limitations of current research future research on collision avoidance decision making could have further development on the following aspects 1 environment interference ship maneuverability target ship maneuvering expert experience and other factors should be furtherly considered in the theoretical research of ship collision avoidance decision making 2 the form of collision avoidance decision should be dependant on the research objects a manned ship s collision avoidance actions are more likely to be directed by the alteration of course and speed while the unmanned ship can follow a certain collision free trajectory planned by the control unit onboard 3 in the experience of the oows multi ship collision avoidance is complicated and needs a cooperative collision avoidance procedure this may also be the development of the trend of collision avoidance decision making in both theoretical research and navigation practices credit authorship contribution statement mengxia li
