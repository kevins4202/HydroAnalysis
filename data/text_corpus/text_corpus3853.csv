19265,carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios δ13c and δ15n were determined in activated sludge which was exposed to endogenous conditions for 36 days and contained a wide diversity of organisms across several trophic levels the aim of this study was to elucidate the fluctuation of δ13c and δ15n through trophic transfer in the microbial consortia the sludge was evaluated in view of sludge mass bacterial community higher trophic organisms sludge δ13c and δ15n and δ15n and δ18o of nitrate the results show that the activated sludge became more enriched with 15n as degradation proceeded eventually the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid concentrations in the activated sludge decreased from 1610 to 710 mg l and the δ15n of the sludge increased from 8 3 to 10 8 in contrast the δ13c values of the sludge were stable microscope observations confirmed that consumers such as rotifera tardigrada and annelida aelosoma sp were present in the activated sludge for the entire operational period the abundance of those organisms drastically changed during the operational periods and the diversity in bacterial community also changed resulting in community succession changes in biotic community reduction in sludge mass and increase in δ15n of the sludge occurred during the sludge degradation processes this implies that the sludge degradation was partly caused by the trophic conversion of the sludge derived nitrogen in the food web the δ15n of the sludge can be used as an indicator of the sludge degradation through trophic transfer in wastewater treatment reactors these

rulkens 1997 wei et al 2009 in contrast luxmy et al 2001 reported that metazoa were unable to reduce the sludge production in an aeration tank luxmy et al 2001 these contradictory reports may be related to the lack of effective methods to determine the role of feeding activities by biota fang et al 2006 hao et al 2010 the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios δ13c and δ15n have been used as a powerful tool to characterize the functional role of organisms in the food web in many study fields post 2002 post et al 2000 woodward and hildrew 2002 application of the technique relies on the empirical rule that the δ15n of a consumer is typically enriched by 3 4 relative to its diet deniro et al 1981 minagawa and wada 1984 peterson and fry 1987 post 2002 in contrast there is little increase in δ13c during trophic transfer e g 0 1 per trophic level deniro and epstein 1978 therefore δ15n can be used to estimate the trophic position of the consumer boecklen et al 2011 minagawa and wada 1984 peterson and fry 1987 post 2002 and δ13c is an indicator of the ultimate source of consumer s carbon when the isotopic signatures of the ultimate sources are different even though vast number of studies have used stable isotope ratios for ecosystem analysis little consideration has been given to wastewater treatment processes based on δ13c and δ15n onodera et al 2015 applied stable isotope analysis to determine the trophic structure of the organisms i e sludge in a novel trickling filter using sponge media as a packing material this study found dietary differences between the taxa even at the same spatial location in addition δ15n of the retained sludge increased along with wastewater flow in the reactor implying the trophic transfer processes in the microbial ecosystem onodera et al 2015 however there is a general lack of knowledge on stable isotope analysis for wastewater treatment technologies this study took an interdisciplinary approach combining ecology and engineering to determine the fate of organic materials through trophic transfer in microbial consortia within a wastewater treatment system based on the empirical rule of isotopic trophic enrichment and conventional experimental methods the general approach determines the organisms individually for identifying specific trophic links embedded in the food web post 2002 post et al 2000 woodward and hildrew 2002 however the general method was not applied to the microbial consortium because of small body size high species diversity and complex prey predator relationship as a result the information on stable isotope ratios of microbial consortia in biological wastewater technologies are still limited moreover the trophic transfer within biotic community in the biological treatment system is poorly understand therefore this study proposed to determine the stable isotope ratios of the microbial consortia sludge rather than those of individual organisms we hypothesize that the stable isotope ratio indicates the overall trophic level of microbial consortia and the change in δ15n of sludge indicates the trophic transfer of organic nitrogen through the food web the aim of this study was to elucidate the fluctuation of the natural abundance of stable isotopes in sludge with emphasis on trophic transfer in the sludge associated biotic community focusing on the community succession in the microbial food web the activated sludge was operated under endogenous conditions for 36 days to monitor the changes in δ13c and δ15n values in addition δ15n and δ18o of nitrate in the activated

the entire operational period to our best knowledge this is the first report on the application of stable isotope ratios to assess the fate of organic materials through trophic transfer in biological wastewater treatment this study will provide new insights into understanding trophic transfer during microbial community succession a crucial function in wastewater treatment technology and the effect of the feeding process on excess sludge reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration and operational conditions of the reactor the activated sludge was taken from an aeration tank of an anaerobic anoxic oxidation a2o process in a sewage treatment plant ibaraki japan the temperature of the activated sludge was 22 7 c the activated sludge was maintained at dissolved oxygen do of 4 mg l during transportation and it was re aerated to start the experiment within 1 h day 0 the key characteristics of the sludge were as follows ph 7 23 sludge volume index svi 97 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss 2170 mg l mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss 1610 mg l and chemical oxygen demand cod 2340 mg l the configuration of the reactor is shown in fig s1 three reactors were kept at temperatures between 19 7 c and 21 0 c the volume of the activated sludge was 2 0 l at start up airflow rate was 0 5 l min in each reactor the do was maintained above 8 mg l the ph of the activated sludge was measured daily the ph was controlled using k2hpo4 and the ph range was 6 51 7 61 during the entire operational period the activated sludge did not receive substrate during the operational period to generate starvation conditions the reactors were operated in triplicate reactors samples a b c in addition another reactor was operated without aeration as a reference reactor sample d 2 2

meter b 100z iijima electric corp aichi japan respectively the volume of the activated sludge was adjusted to the appropriate volume before sampling using ion exchanged water because water volume decreased by evaporation during the aeration furthermore the water volume decreased with every sampling thus the change in sludge concentration was identical to change in sludge mass the sludge

discussion 3 1 change in activated sludge mass under starvation conditions the activated sludge was measured under starvation conditions as shown in fig 1 the experimental temperature was about 20 c similar to that of the seed sludge 22 7 c the initial mlss mlvss and cod concentrations were 2170 1610 and 2340 mg l respectively the mlss mlvss and cod contents in activated sludge decreased gradually and approximately halved after 36 days with an average of 1150 730 and 1160 mg l respectively the three reactors each showed similar tendencies with regards to cod mlss and mlvss contents over time the soluble cod content was less than 50 mg l the sludge reduction during the starvation conditions has been reported by a number of researchers coello oviedo et al 2003 lopez et al 2006 torà et al 2011 they reported a wide range of sludge reduction rates a considerable decrease in vss from 1 97 to 0 43 g l 22 for 3 weeks at 24 c coello oviedo et al 2003 and only 29 of vss after 3 weeks lopez et al 2006 under the anaerobic starvation conditions the concentrations of mlss mlvss and cod in sludge were not significantly changed after the 36 day operational period the final mlss mlvss and cod contents were 1620 1130 and 1900 mg l respectively this agrees with previous reports lopez et al 2006 showed no significant decrease in mlss and mlvss under anaerobic conditions whereas a gradual decrease was observed under increased periods of aerobic starvation therefore anaerobic conditions can suppress sludge activity with regards to sludge degradation resulting in a decreased sludge reduction rate 3 2 microfauna observation the numbers of the representative microfauna mainly metazoa in the activated sludge are presented in fig 2 the microscopic observation confirmed that microfauna were present during the entire experimental period under the starvation conditions these microfauna were recognized as consumers that graze bacteria in the activated sludge a large number of sarcodine protozoa such as difflugia sp and arcella sp was found throughout the experimental period but it was difficult to determine whether alive or not these protozoa might graze bacteria and subsequently they might be grazed by a secondary consumer trachelophyllum sp and rotifers were secondary consumers dominating the microfaunal community on days 0 21 the tardigrada was frequently observed on days 14 28 the annelida aelosoma sp was observed after day 21 interestingly under the endogenous conditions the abundance of the dominant metazoa occurred as follows rotifers on day 0 21 tardigrades on days 7 28 and aelosoma sp on days 21 36 the increase in the number of higher organisms may result from their population growth through predation on smaller organisms this suggests that trophic transfer occurs in the microbial food web of activated sludge 3 3 microbial community structure to characterize the composition of the bacterial community and any shifts in the community during starvation conditions 16s rrna gene sequencing approaches using miseq technology were performed on the activated sludge on the sampling days the results show that saprospirae were the most abundant in the three reactors during the whole experimental period fig 3 during the starvation period the abundance of saprospirae decreased in the activated sludge whereas the abundance of uncultured group of proteobacteria ta18 phycisphaerae and acidobacteria increased the pca revealed a gradual change in microbial community structure of the retained sludge during the whole experimental period fig s2 the pca plot of bacterial communities showed different tendencies between aerated starvation conditions samples a c and non aerated starvation conditions reactor d the otu abundances were significant different p 0 05 between the activated sludge on day 7 and day 36 as seen in fig s3 and table s2 as a result there was a limited difference in otus 3 in the activated sludge moreover the diversity in bacterial community remained relatively consistent under the starvation conditions based on the alpha diversity indices table s1 and fig s4 this indicates that the starvation period did not significantly influence the microbial diversity indices interestingly the microscopic observations confirmed that the microfauna such as difflugia sp arcella sp and tardigrades were grazed by smaller organisms scavengers in activated sludge especially after a two week operational period video data 1 it is well known that bacteria acting as scavengers play a crucial role in degradation of detritus these observations suggest that the detritus feeders scavengers aggressively graze viable larger organisms such as metazoa which may contribute to sludge degradation therefore metazoa cannot always be in the top trophic position in activated sludge and they become prey for bacteria and or protozoa the role of each organism within the food web could change in activated sludge under starvation conditions supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 09 016 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video data 1 2 3 4 stable isotope ratios δ13c δ15n and δ18o the changes in the δ13c and δ15n of the activated sludge under starvation conditions are shown in fig 4 the δ13c of the activated sludge was similar over time at about 25 however the δ15n clearly increased from 8 3 to 10 8 as the sludge mass decreased this result confirmed that δ15n of the activated sludge including various microorganisms increased under the fate of organic matter though trophic transfer in the food web the δ13c of consumers usually are similar to those of their diets deniro and epstein 1978 however consumers are typically enriched in δ15n during trophic transfer deniro et al 1981 minagawa and wada 1984 peterson and fry 1987 post 2002 considering that the δ15n is an indicator for trophic transfer of organic nitrogen through a food chain and the sludge consists of various microbial organisms it is reasonable to expect that increased δ15n was mainly caused by the ingestion and degradation of organic nitrogen through the prey predator relationships in the activated sludge therefore change in δ15n could be an indicator for dietary intake trophic transfer and catabolism of organic matter in the food web the nitrate concentration increased in activated sludge under the starvation conditions fig 5 the nitrate was presumably produced by sludge degradation ammonification followed by nitrification in addition some nitrate was released via the metabolisms of protozoa and metazoa ammonium was not detected indicating that the ammonium was almost completely nitrified or immobilized ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria aoa and aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were present and abundant in the activated sludge figs s6 and s7 the δ15n and δ18o decreased from day 0 to day 7 the initial δ15n and δ18o of nitrate on day 0 was 11 8 and 1 2 respectively whereas the δ15n and δ18o of nitrate on day 7 was 8 79 and 2 84 respectively this indicates that nitrate produced during sludge degradation has a lower δ15n and δ18o than nitrate in sewage seed sludge the relatively lower δ15n of nitrate may be because of the source of nitrogen activated sludge the nitrate was probably produced during sludge degradation ammonification followed by nitrification the δ15n of the activated sludge in this experiment was about 8 6 on day 7 which corresponds well to the δ15n of nitrate on day 7 about 8 8 the δ15n of nitrate slightly increased after day 7 therefore the δ15n of nitrate produced by sludge degradation might be increased through increasing the δ15n of activated sludge it is also expected that light 15n was preferred by the denitrification process in activated sludge granger et al 2006 mariotti et al 1981 there was a relatively high δ15n and δ18o of nitrate in activated sludge on day 0 this relatively high δ15n and δ18o may result from nitrogen removal process such as nitrification and or denitrification in the activated sludge which employ the a2o process the nitrification and denitrification processes cause high isotopic fractionation and low residual ammonium and nitrate concentration leading to the high δ15n of residual ammonium and nitrate the process performance and sludge degradation were directly related to microbial dynamics in the activated sludge the microbial dynamics were associated with the prey predator interactions the prey predator interactions result in progressive trophic transfer in the microbial consortia despite that the importance of trophic transfer of organic matter through the microbial food chain was pointed out in practical fang et al 2006 hao et al 2010 and fundamental perspectives van loosdrecht and henze 1999 the trophic transfer has not yet been evaluated usually the predation function has been determined as a part of endogenous processes henze et al 2000 however there has been little previous investigation of the contribution of higher organisms to the degradation of organic matter hao et al 2010 they showed that the contribution of higher organisms to the oxygen uptake rate ranged from 9 4 to 25 0 considering the material transfer that occurs in microbial ecosystems across several trophic levels including smaller protozoa and scavenger bacteria heterotrophic organisms such as bacteria protozoa and metazoa should play important roles in the degradation of organic matter during aerobic wastewater treatment processes seviour and nielsen 2010 our results suggest that the natural abundance of stable isotopes can be used to determine trophic transfer of microbial consortia it is confirmed that the respiration mechanisms excluding predation did not clearly drive the variation in isotopic ratios fig s5 therefore the increase in δ15n under endogenous conditions was assumed to result from the prey predation interactions supplementary information s2 namely δ15n can serve as an effective integrator of the complex material transfer processes that occurs in the microbial consortia of the biological wastewater treatment system the δ15n can provide valuable information relating to the progress of degradation in the ecosystem future research should develop theoretical models coupled with empirical experiments such experiments also have the potential to expand our knowledge on the material transfer within the food web as a core function in wastewater treatment to deal with the predation function in wastewater treatment such as excess sludge degradation the evaluation methods for its function will be crucial 4 conclusion in this study the activated sludge was exposed to endogenous conditions for 36 days the sludge mass decreased with increasing δ15n of activated sludge and eventually sludge mass approximately halved and the nitrogen stable isotope ratio increased from 8 3 to 10 8 however the δ13c was nearly constant the biotic community changed drastically during the experimental period which was confirmed based on quantitative analyses of the composition of bacteria protozoa and metazoa the results of this study indicate that δ15n of sludge increases during trophic transfer under endogenous conditions therefore δ15n has the potential to serve as a valuable indicator of the dietary intake trophic transfer and catabolism of organic matter through the food web in biological wastewater treatment reactors acknowledgments this study was

manual japan sewage works association 2012 the large organisms mainly metazoa were counted in the activated sludge the average numbers of the microfauna were calculated using triplicate counting

carbonates after freeze drying fdu 1200 eyela tokyo rikakikai tokyo the sludge sample was then treated with a chloroform methanol solution 2 1 by volume to remove lipids natural abundances of 13c and

belemnite pdb atmospheric n2 and the vienna standard mean ocean water were used as references for δ13c δ15n and δ18o respectively d alanine was used as a working standard for δ13c 3 results and discussion 3 1 change in activated sludge mass under starvation conditions the activated sludge was measured under starvation conditions as shown in fig 1 the experimental temperature was about 20 c similar to that of the seed sludge 22 7 c the initial mlss mlvss and cod concentrations were 2170 1610 and 2340 mg l respectively the mlss mlvss and cod contents in activated sludge decreased gradually and approximately halved after 36 days with an average of 1150 730 and 1160 mg l respectively the three reactors each showed similar tendencies with regards to cod mlss and mlvss contents over time the soluble cod content was less than 50 mg l the sludge reduction during the starvation conditions has been reported by a number of researchers coello oviedo et al 2003 lopez et al 2006 torà et al 2011 they reported a wide range of sludge reduction rates a considerable decrease in vss from 1 97 to 0 43 g l 22 for 3 weeks at 24 c coello oviedo et al 2003 and only 29 of vss after 3 weeks lopez et al 2006 under the anaerobic starvation conditions the concentrations of mlss mlvss and cod in sludge were not significantly changed after the 36 day operational period the final mlss mlvss and cod contents were 1620 1130 and 1900 mg l respectively this agrees with previous reports lopez et al 2006 showed no significant decrease in mlss and mlvss under anaerobic conditions whereas a gradual decrease was observed under increased periods of aerobic starvation therefore anaerobic conditions can suppress sludge activity with regards to sludge degradation resulting in a decreased sludge reduction rate 3 2 microfauna observation the numbers of the representative microfauna mainly metazoa in the activated sludge are presented in fig 2 the microscopic observation confirmed that microfauna were present during the entire experimental period under the starvation conditions these microfauna were recognized as consumers that graze bacteria in the activated sludge a large number of sarcodine protozoa such as difflugia sp and arcella sp was found throughout the experimental period but it was difficult to determine whether alive or not these protozoa might graze bacteria and subsequently they might be grazed by a secondary consumer trachelophyllum sp and rotifers were secondary consumers dominating the microfaunal community on days 0 21 the tardigrada was frequently observed on days 14 28 the annelida aelosoma sp was observed after day 21 interestingly under the endogenous conditions the abundance of the dominant metazoa occurred as follows rotifers on day 0 21 tardigrades on days 7 28 and aelosoma sp on days 21 36 the increase in the number of higher organisms may result from their population growth through predation on smaller organisms this suggests that trophic transfer occurs in the microbial food web of activated sludge 3 3 microbial community structure to characterize the composition of the bacterial community and any shifts in the community during starvation conditions 16s rrna gene sequencing approaches using miseq technology were performed on the activated sludge on the sampling days the results show that saprospirae were the most abundant in the three reactors during the whole experimental period fig 3 during the starvation period the abundance of saprospirae decreased in the activated sludge whereas the abundance of uncultured group of proteobacteria ta18 phycisphaerae and acidobacteria increased the pca revealed a gradual change in microbial community structure of the retained sludge during the whole experimental period fig s2 the pca plot of bacterial communities showed different tendencies between aerated starvation conditions samples a c and non aerated starvation conditions reactor d the otu abundances were significant different p 0 05 between the activated sludge on day 7 and day 36 as seen in fig s3 and table s2 as a result there was a limited difference in otus 3 in the activated sludge moreover the diversity in bacterial community remained relatively consistent under the starvation conditions based on the alpha diversity indices table s1 and fig s4 this indicates that the starvation period did not significantly influence the microbial diversity indices interestingly the microscopic observations confirmed that the microfauna such as difflugia sp arcella sp and tardigrades were grazed by smaller organisms scavengers in activated sludge especially after a two week operational period video data 1 it is well known that bacteria acting as scavengers play a crucial role in degradation of detritus these observations suggest that the detritus feeders scavengers aggressively graze viable larger organisms such as metazoa which may contribute to sludge degradation therefore metazoa cannot always be in the top trophic position in activated sludge and they become prey for bacteria and or protozoa the role of each organism within the food web could change in activated sludge under starvation conditions supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 09 016 the following is the supplementary data related to this article video data 1 2 3 4 stable isotope ratios δ13c δ15n and δ18o the changes in the δ13c and δ15n of the activated sludge under starvation conditions are shown in fig 4 the δ13c of the activated sludge was similar over time at about 25 however the δ15n clearly increased from 8 3 to 10 8 as the sludge mass decreased this result confirmed that δ15n of the activated sludge including various microorganisms increased under the fate of organic matter though trophic transfer in the food web the δ13c of consumers usually are similar to those of their diets deniro and epstein 1978 however consumers are typically enriched in δ15n during trophic transfer deniro et al 1981 minagawa and wada 1984 peterson and fry 1987 post 2002 considering that the δ15n is an indicator for trophic transfer of organic nitrogen through a food chain and the sludge consists of various microbial organisms it is reasonable to expect that increased δ15n was mainly caused by the ingestion and degradation of organic nitrogen through the prey predator relationships in the activated sludge therefore change in δ15n could be an indicator for dietary intake trophic transfer and catabolism of organic matter in the food web the nitrate concentration increased in activated sludge under the starvation conditions fig 5 the nitrate was presumably produced by sludge degradation ammonification followed by nitrification in addition some nitrate was released via the metabolisms of protozoa and metazoa ammonium was not detected indicating that the ammonium was almost completely nitrified or immobilized ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria aoa and aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were present and abundant in the activated sludge figs s6 and s7 the δ15n and δ18o decreased from day 0 to day 7 the initial δ15n and δ18o of nitrate on day 0 was 11 8 and 1 2 respectively whereas the δ15n and δ18o of nitrate on day 7 was 8 79 and 2 84 respectively this indicates that nitrate produced during sludge degradation has a lower δ15n and δ18o than nitrate in sewage seed sludge the relatively lower δ15n of nitrate may be because of the source of nitrogen activated sludge the nitrate was probably produced during sludge degradation ammonification followed by nitrification the δ15n of the activated sludge in this experiment was about 8 6 on day 7 which corresponds well to the δ15n of nitrate on day 7 about 8 8 the δ15n of nitrate slightly increased after day 7 therefore the δ15n of nitrate produced by sludge degradation might be increased through increasing the δ15n of activated sludge it is also expected that light 15n was preferred by the denitrification process in activated sludge granger et al 2006 mariotti et al 1981 there was a relatively high δ15n and δ18o of nitrate in activated sludge on day 0 this relatively high δ15n and δ18o may result from nitrogen removal process such as nitrification and or denitrification in the activated sludge which employ the a2o process the nitrification and denitrification processes cause high isotopic fractionation and low residual ammonium and nitrate concentration leading to the high δ15n of residual ammonium and nitrate the process performance and sludge degradation were directly related to microbial dynamics in the activated sludge the microbial dynamics were associated with the prey predator interactions the prey predator interactions result in progressive trophic transfer in the microbial consortia despite that the importance of trophic transfer of organic matter through the microbial food chain was pointed out in practical fang et al 2006 hao et al 2010 and fundamental perspectives van loosdrecht and henze 1999 the trophic transfer has not yet been evaluated usually the predation function has been determined as a part of endogenous processes henze et al 2000 however there has been little previous investigation of the contribution of higher organisms to the degradation of organic matter hao et al 2010 they showed that the contribution of higher organisms to the oxygen uptake rate ranged from 9 4 to 25 0 considering the material transfer that occurs in microbial ecosystems across several trophic levels including smaller protozoa and scavenger bacteria heterotrophic organisms such as bacteria protozoa and metazoa should play important roles in the degradation of organic matter during aerobic wastewater treatment processes seviour and nielsen 2010 our results suggest that the natural abundance of stable isotopes can be used to determine trophic transfer of microbial consortia it is confirmed that the respiration mechanisms excluding predation did not clearly drive the variation in isotopic ratios fig s5 therefore the increase in δ15n under endogenous conditions was assumed to result from the prey predation interactions supplementary information s2 namely δ15n can serve as an effective integrator of the complex material transfer processes that occurs in the microbial consortia of the biological wastewater treatment system the δ15n can provide valuable information relating to the progress of degradation in the ecosystem future research should develop theoretical models coupled with empirical experiments such experiments also have the potential to expand our knowledge on the material transfer within the food web as a core function in wastewater treatment to deal with the predation function in wastewater treatment such as excess sludge degradation the evaluation methods for its function will be crucial 4 conclusion in this study the activated sludge was exposed to endogenous conditions for 36 days the sludge mass decreased with increasing δ15n of activated sludge and eventually sludge mass approximately halved and the nitrogen stable isotope ratio increased from 8 3 to 10 8 however the δ13c was nearly constant the biotic community changed drastically during the experimental period which was confirmed based on quantitative analyses of the composition of bacteria protozoa and metazoa the results of this study indicate that δ15n of sludge increases during trophic transfer under endogenous conditions therefore δ15n has the potential to serve as a valuable indicator of the dietary intake trophic transfer and catabolism of organic matter through the food web in biological wastewater treatment reactors acknowledgments this study was

19266,biodegradation of glyphosate glp and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa was numerically assessed for a vineyard and a wheat field in the po valley italy calculation of the hazard quotient suggested that glp and ampa can pose a risk of aquifer contamination in the top 1 5 m depth within 50 years of glp use numerical results relative to soil glp and ampa concentrations and glp age half life and turnover time show that glp was equivalently removed through hydrolysis and oxidation but the latter produced ampa biodegradation processes in the root zone removed more than 90 of applied glp and more than 23 of the produced ampa between two consecutive applications doubling organic carbon availability enhanced glp and ampa biodegradation especially glp hydrolysis to sarcosine this work highlights that glp and ampa removal is controlled by soil water dynamics that depend on ecohydrological boundary conditions and by carbon sources availability to biodegraders graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate ampa pesticide michaelis menten monod biodegradation contaminant ecohydrology 1 introduction glyphosate glp is a broad spectrum herbicide which first reached the market in 1974 and has since revolutionized the farming sector duke and powles 2008 glp based herbicides provide a low cost weed control treatment because it is effective also at low active ingredient doses glp use has increased further worldwide after some crops have been genetically modified to be glp resistant coupe and capel 2016 under laboratory conditions glp has been shown to be fast degraded biologically balthazor and hallas 1986 jacob et al 1988 mcauliffe et al 1990 moore et al 1983 and chemically barrett and mcbride 2005 li et al 2016 paudel et al 2015 thus posing a low risk for persistence glp is also strongly adsorbed onto soil particles al rajab and hakami 2014 sidoli et al 2016 thus lowering the likelihood of leaching finally glp has been found to be less toxic than other herbicides fishel et al 2015 as a result glp has become the most used herbicide in agriculture however field surveys have found that an increasing number of glp resistant weeds have made their appearance heap 2016 glp has been found in soil aparicio et al 2013 silva et al 2017 streams paris et al 2013 2016 lefrancq et al 2017 and groundwater paris et al 2016 thus indicating glp mobility and persistence in the environment which may eventually result in a risk to groundwater quality simonsen et al 2008 note that glp oxidation has been shown to produce aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa a toxic compound more persistent than glp grandcoin et al 2017 the comparison between paris et al 2013 and paris et al 2016 provides further evidence consistent with the wide spreading groundwater contamination by glp and ampa indeed contaminated sites out of tested sites increased from 0 9 to 5 8 for glp and from 0 9 to 4 8 for ampa in the period 2010 2013 a large amount of data have been collected about glp sorption and degradation in controlled laboratory and field conditions through short term and continuous monitoring campaigns these data may be used to validate numerical models with important applications in risk assessment and agriculture for example mamy et al 2005 numerically assessed the environmental sustainability of a proposed glp based weed management plan to replace four other used herbicides numerical models can be used with confidence for similar purposes if they at least account for the most important processes driving pesticides dynamics in agricultural soils most of the available models account for contaminant transport in soil water however only a few models allow the design and implementation of arbitrary biogeochemical reaction networks and describe their dynamics comprehensively e g hydrus langergraber and šimůnek 2005 modflow rt3d johnson and truex 2006 toughreact xu et al 2011 and brtsim maggi 2015 relative to glp and ampa degradation first order kinetics have been used in earlier numerical approaches in ghafoor et al 2011 guijarro et al 2018 and simonsen et al 2008 and in the pelmo and macro models to carry out the initial risk assessment for regulating glp use in europe efsa 2015 however cheyns et al 2010 suggested that michaelis menten monod mmm kinetics should be used in place of first order kinetics in pesticide fate models and used atrazine biodegradation in soil mini columns to prove that first order kinetics may underestimate pesticide leaching more recently a comprehensive numerical analysis of a real case scenario showed that atrazine disappearance from an agricultural soil was driven by water transport and controlled by biodegradation the latter was described explicitly by microbial functional groups and michaelis menten mm biochemical reactions la cecilia and maggi 2017 it is evident that additional kinetic mechanisms can control pesticide degradation in soil which are not necessarily included in single mm type kinetics and are certainly omitted in first order kinetics these may include multiple inhibitions and competitions for substrates and byproducts which can be accounted for by means of mm terms the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of hydrological boundary conditions to glp biodegradation and transport in soil and contamination of the shallow aquifer to this aim we couple a comprehensive mechanistic description of the glp reaction network with the nitrogen n cycle and soil organic matter som mineralization and we describe the biochemical system using mmm kinetics the assumptions made to frame the model were based on laboratory experiments on biogeochemical processes regarding the glp reaction network this high level of process coupling allowed us to quantify how water and biomass dynamics phosphate and ph inhibition and oxygen and substrate bioavailability affected glp dispersion degradation and aquifer contamination in two agricultural settings in the po valley italy simulation outcomes are compared with field data reported in the literature to quantitatively assess the postulated modelling approach implications relative to glp and ampa biodegradation by fungi and plants biodegradation of adsorbed substrates adsorption competition between phosphorus containing molecules and glp toxicity to microorganisms are discussed the information provided herein can be used to predict the outcomes of current glp uses or to setup site and scenario specific studies to assess and mitigate the environmental contamination risk 2 methods 2 1 glp reaction network coupled with n cycle the glp reaction network proposed in la cecilia and maggi 2018 was expanded to include a som pool and was coupled with the n cycle earlier described in maggi et al 2008 fig 1 the som pool released nutrients that support the microbial soil communities this allowed to investigate nonlinearities in glp and ampa soil biodegradation due to varying carbon c source bioavailability in the form of ch 2 o yet the glp reaction network and the n cycle share ch 2 o o 2 nh 3 and h thus highlighting the level of process coupling that was accounted for the biochemical reactions are reported in table a1 together with their corresponding reaction rate constant μ s 1 half saturation concentration k mol l 1 biomass yield coefficient y mg wet biomass mol substrate 1 and equilibrium constant k aq k g and k ad for aqueous complexation gaseous dissolution and adsorption the coupled biochemical system was implemented in the bioreactive transport simulator brtsim following the validation by construct approach mccarl and apland 1986 glp and ampa chemical degradation by birnessite mineral li et al 2016 paudel et al 2015 represented in fig 1 via pathways p2r1c and p1r2c respectively was not included because it is uncertain whether it occurs in field conditions i e barrett and mcbride 2005 observed that cu 2 ions preferentially adsorbed onto birnessite thus inhibiting glp and ampa degradation 2 2 equilibrium adsorption reactions experiments on glp and ampa sorption in agricultural soil appendix c sidoli et al 2016 were used to retrieve a linear adsorption coefficient as 1 k ad q e c e where q e mol kg soil 1 is the moles of adsorbed solute per unit mass of adsorbent and c e mol kg h 2 o 1 is the equilibrium solute concentration a linear k ad was used because glp and ampa concentrations in soils are very low and the tangent of the langmuir model fit in the low concentration low adsorption range was representative enough of soil buffer capacity for those compounds po 4 3 adsorption onto soil particles was not included in the model therefore the competition between glp ampa and po 4 3 for adsorptive sites was not modeled after sprankle et al 1975 showed a low sensitivity of adsorbed glp over a wide range of po 4 3 concentrations also munira et al 2016 showed more recently that p based fertilizers applied at a rate up to 80 kg p ha 1y 1 did not substantially affect the adsorbed glp 2 3 biogeochemical solver brtsim v2 2 based on maggi 2015 is a 1 d model suitable to simulate biogeochemical reaction advection dispersion processes in unsaturated soil systems the soil moisture dynamics are dealt with a finite volume scheme that solves the richards equation along the vertical direction brtsim can account for any number of chemical and biological species primary and secondary chemical species can be defined the latter being in equilibrium with the corresponding primary species equilibrium reactions can be defined for aqueous complexation ion exchange gas dissolution and mineral adsorption and are calculated in brtsim using the mass action law transport of chemical species is accounted for by the darcy s advection and fick s diffusion note that advection of gas species in the gas phase was neglected given the time scales of interest in this work chemical and biochemical reactions involving primary species and microbial functional groups described in this solver as primary species are accounted for by means of the mmm kinetic equations bekins et al 1998 belser 1979 monod 1949 2 4 experimental site the glp

characteristics were retrieved from sgss 2016 and are reported in table 1 the bottom soil layer in both sites was extended down to 5 m depth to predict glp and ampa dispersion in the aquifer assuming a 20 rainfall loss by crop interception the infiltrating precipitation p i averaged 540 mm y 1 in the vineyard and 515 mm y 1 in the wheat field in the 2006 2016 period data post processed after arpae simc 2016 the average potential evapotranspiration rate was 1133 mm y 1 in the vineyard and 828 mm y 1 in the wheat field during the same period data post processed after arpae simc 2016 the daily reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 was calculated using the approach in allen et al 1998 fig 2 the daily actual crop evapotranspiration was calculated as e t c e t 0 k c with the time varying crop coefficient k c taken from allen et al 1998 and represented in fig 2 daily irrigation rates i r r were not available hence these were estimated depending on the crop and fine tuned to match in situ groundwater observations from chiari et al 2016 fig 3 the vineyard was irrigated during its typical growing season between april and october while the wheat field was irrigated all year around daily precipitation irrigation and crop evapotranspiration rates were used as upper boundary conditions fig 3 while yearly cumulative rates were used for analyses described later table 2 in the vineyard 60 of the roots system was uniformly distributed within the first 0 6 m depth while the remaining 40 was uniformly distributed down to 1 4 m seguin 1986 the average roots depth in the wheat field was 0 3 m and the roots density was distributed with a negative exponential function down to 1 m depth bowdena et al 2008 passive uptake of nh 4 no 3 hco 3 po 4 3 and h was described as driven by evapotranspiration and nutrient concentrations in solution meteorological observations spanned 11 years from 2006 to 2016 and constituted one cycle of boundary conditions bccycle the bccycle was repeated to construct boundary conditions for longer time frames the biochemical system reached steady state in the top 1 m of soil after four bccycle 2 5 modelling framework soil microbial communities change over time and depends on environmental conditions such as water content nutrients availability o 2 levels etc detailed data on microbial communities present at the test sites were not available though it is likely that glp and ampa biodecomposers bhyo fig 1 inhabited the root zone where glp had been periodically applied as earlier observed in dick and quinn 1995 five other microbial functional groups were included to describe the following reactions non toxic metabolites of glp and ampa were consumed by b aer in aerobic conditions and by b anaer in anaerobic conditions two steps nitrification was carried out by b aob and b nob and denitrification was carried out by b den a biomass background recovery rate r b j for each functional group j was included in this biochemical system to allow for microbial ecology dynamic stability over time in case their c sources were depleted e g ch 2 o glp or ampa for bhyo those rates were calculated neglecting microbial growth from the breakdown of c sources as d b j d t δ j b j r b j 0 hence returning r b j δ j b j with b j the equilibrium concentration for b j in the absence of c sources values of b j were chosen such that b aer b hyo 1 aristilde et al 2017 newman et al 2016 smit et al 2001 while b aob b aer b aob b nob 5 and b den b aob 10 tang and maggi 2016 the minimum soil biomass concentration was therefore imposed while the instantaneous biomass concentration varied according to substrates availability and consumption cell mortality rate was assumed to be δ 10 6 s 1 for all microbial functional groups biodegradation of adsorbed compounds was excluded with the assumption that multiple forms of adsorption can prevent enzyme degradation effectiveness riley et al 2014 substrates consumption competition was not included in the glp reaction network due to the small range of different c sources available to each microbial group microbial competition for o 2 aq and ch 2 o was implicitly captured by the model thank to the different mmm parameter values corresponding to each different biological reactions the effect of ph on microbial activity was explicitly taken into account in all biologically mediated reactions using a mm term for high ph with constant 10 9 m and an inhibition term for low ph with constant 10 5 m respectively boon and laudelout 1962 the mm constant for o 2 aq consumption was k 1 4 10 5 m button and garver 1966 o 2 aq inhibition on anaerobic reactions p1r3b p2r2b and p2r3b was explicitly included using an inhibition term with constant 3 125 10 6 m kindred and celia 1989 the total organic carbon toc measured at the selected locations sgss 2016 table 1 was used to estimate the soil organic matter som as s o m 1 72 t o c hoyle 2015 which was assumed to slowly release ch 2 o nh 4 and po 4 3 with a first order kinetic reaction with rate constant r 10 11 s 1 and stoichiometry taken from tipping et al 2016 reaction r9 table a1 while som was assumed to be constant over time as a result of recharge from root mortality exudates and other debris riley et al 2014 note that ch 2 o was also released by sarcosine glycine and methylamine biodegradation reactions p2r2a and p2r2b p2r3b and p1r3a fig 1 aqueous po 4 3 inhibited glp oxidation pipke and amrhein 1988 and ampa oxidation balthazor and hallas 1986 2 6 analysis of glp application scenarios a range of glp yearly application rates and ch 2 o release rates from som were used to investigate nonlinearities in glp and ampa biodegradation dynamics glp yearly applications of 0 72 kg ha 1 in april and october in the vineyard and 2 kg ha 1 in november in the wheat field were used as the reference for our analyses table 3 it was assumed that all applied glp leached into the soil because some glp absorb into leaves in reality our predictions overestimate glp soil concentrations and the results are therefore cautionary glp and ampa distribution along the soil profile and their phase partitioning were calculated using masses averaged over the 5th bccycle when the biochemical system was at steady state in the top 1 m of soil these analyses were repeated along the soil profile also for glp application rates equal to half glplow and twice glphigh the reference rate glpref and for the stoichiometry coefficient relative to ch 2 o release from som equal to half ch 2 o low and twice ch 2 o high the reference value ch 2 o ref 2 7 assessment of aquifer contamination by glp and ampa the hazard quotient hq by suter 2007 was used to assess the aquifer contamination by glp and ampa as 2 h q c predicted t c threshold where c predicted t is the glp or ampa aqueous concentration or their sum as a function of time t and c threshold is the european safety limit to ensure the maintenance of an overall good groundwater quality directive 2006 118 ec 2006 c threshold 0 1 μg l 1 is used for a single pesticide and c threshold 0 5 μg l 1 for a pesticide mixture that causes similar adverse health effects the hq was averaged over the 5th bccycle and was represented as a function of soil depth and time figure b1 note that the contribution of microbial dynamics on contaminant dispersion can easily be quantified by calculating the biodegradation potential parameter ψ b tang et al 2017 based on la cecilia and maggi 2016 in simplistic models that do not account for biodegradation kinetics 2 8 analysis of glp age and turnover time a molecule tracking method was used to calculate glp age at each depth z as the time necessary for that molecule to move from depth z 0 m to depth z tracking was used for a single application of non reactive glp after the biochemical system reached steady state glp age variability due to different hydrological conditions was investigated by releasing and tracking the molecule for each of the eleven years of the bccycle table 2 glp turnover time was averaged at each depth over the 5th bccycle as 3 t t glp z g l p aq z g l p ad z r p 1 r 1 z r p 1 r 1 s z r p 2 r 1 s z f glp out z where t t glp z is glp turnover time g l p aq z is dissolved glp g l p ad z is adsorbed glp r p 1 r 1 z is biodegraded glp mass rate along p1r1 r p 1 r 1 s z is biodegraded glp mass rate along p1r1s r p 2 r 1 s z is biodegraded glp mass rate along p2r1s and f glp out z is glp mass flux exiting the node at depth z together with the overall turnover time the contribution of each of the biological and physical processes was calculated for example the turnover time corresponding to glp biodegraded along p1r1 was calculated as t t glp p 1 r 1 z g l p aq z g l p ad z r p 1 r 1 z 2 9 statistical analysis of glp breakthrough curves the biogeochemical system was exposed to eleven different ecohydrological boundary conditions of the bccycle table 2 between two consecutive glp applications a glp breakthrough curve in the top 10 cm of soil was defined as the time history of normalized glp mass m glp t that is the instantaneous glp mass subtracted from the applied glp mass m glp 0 times t when m glp t m glp 0 was between 0 99 and 0 01 were recorded glp half life t 1 2 was then calculated as the time necessary by the biochemical system to meet the condition m glp t m glp 0 0 5 metabolites ampa and sarcosine masses were monitored to calculate the percentage of biodegraded glp at the same times t relative to applied glp 2 10 inter annual variability to glp biodegradation the relationship between cumulative water input and glp biodegraded fraction between two consecutive glp applications under different hydrological boundary conditions was investigated using outputs from the breakthrough curves cumulative water inputs and glp biodegraded fractions were mapped for m glp t m glp 0 equal to 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 glp and ampa dispersion and aquifer contamination glp and ampa concentrations were nearly 200 μg l 1 in the top 0 5 m of soil for both sites in the 5th bccycle of the reference simulation and corresponded to h q 2000 fig 4 maximum glp and ampa concentrations of nearly 1 and 2 μg l 1 respectively were measured in groundwater samples in italy paris et al 2016 similar concentrations were numerically predicted at 1 5 m depth our predictions highlight a risk h q 1 of harmful exposure to one or a mixture of contaminants within 1 5 m depth fig 4 3 2 glp and ampa biodegradation rate glp oxidation via p1r1 and p1r1s was the main mechanism for glp biodegradation for the vineyard in the 5th bccycle of the reference simulation 38 and 10 respectively of glp biodegraded mass while hydrolysis via p2r1s accounted for 43 of glp biodegraded mass fig 5 a thus 48 of applied glp was converted into ampa only 23 by mass of produced ampa underwent biodegradation similar results were found for the wheat field glp and ampa biodegradation increased up to 45 via p2r1s and up to 34 via p1r2s fig 5b these predictions are in line with previous observations by zablotowicz et al 2009 who reported glp mineralization rates as high as 70 within 35 days after application however ampa poses an increasing environmental issue due to its slow degradation rate al rajab and hakami 2014 la cecilia and maggi 2018 this supports the importance of current practices according to which herbicide re approval must account for the release of toxic metabolites glp and ampa birnessite mediated chemical degradation was not accounted for in this numerical study although it could be a predominant degradation pathway la cecilia and maggi 2018 processes inhibiting glp and ampa chemical degradation such as competition for catalytic sites between cu 2 ions and glp barrett and mcbride 2005 have not been investigated in field conditions a beneficial aspect of glp chemical degradation is that any produced intermediate organophosphate is rapidly degraded to po 4 3 paudel et al 2015 3 3 glp and ampa distribution adsorbed glp and ampa represented 19 and 76 respectively of the total mass of phytotoxic molecules above the root zone of the vineyard in the 5th bccycle of the reference simulation while 2 was ampa in the aqueous phase fig 6 a adsorbed ampa was nearly 3 by mass below the root zone adsorbed glp and ampa represented 23 and 73 of the total mass of phytotoxic molecules above the root zone of the wheat field while 2 was ampa in the aqueous phase fig 6b adsorbed ampa was nearly 3 by mass below the root zone these results are in line with lysimeter studies and phase partitioning along the profile in al rajab and hakami 2014 it has been shown that phosphorus p fertilization can promote glp and ampa leaching and that the leaching mass is greater when glp applications are concomitant with rainfall events sasal et al 2015 however p application rates of 80 kg p ha 1y 1 can decrease glp adsorption capacity by 25 44 munira et al 2016 since glp can adsorb very firmly to soil particles a reduction by 44 may not result in an adsorption strength lower than that of po 4 3 moreover munira et al 2016 showed that most glp dispersion results from wind and transport of glp sediment aggregates rather than leaching and runoff of dissolved glp as a comparison glp and ampa spreading at a rate of about 20 mg ha 1 y 1 due to the former processes was found by silva et al 2017 3 4 glp and ch 2 o sensitivity analyses increasing glp application rates did not affect glp and ampa biodegradation in the test areas fig 5 while increasing ch 2 o release from som not only enhanced glp and ampa biodegradation but also enhanced the fraction of glp biodegraded along the beneficial pathway p2r1s similarly varying glp application rates did not affect glp and ampa partitioning along the soil profile in the test areas fig 6 while increasing ch 2 o release from som decreased the aqueous glp mass fraction to below 1 this result suggests that ampa can become an even more important emergent contaminant if greater glp applications will be adopted to control glp resistant weeds despite the generally high glp biodegradation glp and ampa residues reached 6 mg k g dry soil 1 and 17 mg kg dry soil 1 respectively in the vineyard and 7 mg kg dry soil 1 and 15 mg kg dry soil 1 in the wheat field fig 7 these concentrations fall within the values measured in agricultural soils silva et al 2017 increasing ch 2 o release from som resulted in glp and ampa residues of 3 mg kg dry soil 1 and 14 mg kg dry soil 1 in the vineyard and of 4 mg kg dry soil 1 and 19 mg kg dry soil 1 in the wheat field fig 7 interestingly total glp average soil residues decreased nonlinearly as ch 2 o increased orange and blue stacked bars in fig 7 while ampa showed a maximum average concentration at the reference ch 2 o release rate brown and yellow stacked bars in fig 7 this is explained by the interplay between p1r1 and p2r1s in glp biodegradation 3 5 glp age and turnover time the overall glp age in the reference simulation was similar for the two sites fig 8 a and b however a substantial discontinuity was found in the vineyard corresponding to a drop in the clay fraction at 0 8 m depth also the vineyard experienced slightly larger groundwater fluctuations which exacerbated the discontinuity because of higher frequency of dilutions and downward transport the overall glp turnover time t t glp was similar for the two sites fig 8c and d however the different contribution played by physical or biological processes was noticeable in line with the previous results the glp turnover time was shorter for the vineyard and longer for the wheat field and was explained by the same effect of groundwater fluctuations as above to the best of our knowledge this mechanism of glp mobilization remains yet to be systematically investigated in the field amongst the biological pathways p1r1 and p2r1s provided a similar contribution in the top 10 cm of soil while p2r1s allowed for the shortest turnover time along the soil profile this was likely due to a higher affinity lower k table a1 of bhyo to scavenge small glp concentrations along p2r1s an effect that decreased with increasing soil depth 3 6 glp tracking and breakthrough curve the ecohydrological conditions corresponding to the 11 years of the bccycle influenced the time necessary to remove the applied glp mass in the first 10 cm of soil fig 9 the minimum average and maximum removal times corresponding to m glp t mglp0 1 are tabulated in table 4 bento et al 2016 found that it took 280 40 days to remove 90 of applied glp mass which is in accordance with our predictions the minimum average and maximum half life values corresponding to μ glp t mglp0 50 are tabulated in table 4 the predicted half life values are well within or in accordance with the value of 151 days found by bergström et al 2011 the biodegraded glp mass corresponding to glp disappearance from the top soil over time is represented in fig 10 while minimum average and maximum values are tabulated in table 4 this result stresses that the biological activity explained up to 32 of glp mass removed from the top soil while the remaining percentage was advected to lower soil layers depending on the ecohydrological conditions μ glp advected t 1 μ glp t mglp0 100 μ glp biodegraded t 3 7 inter annual variability in glp biodegradation the cumulative inter annual glp biodegraded fraction was found to decrease for increasing cumulative water inputs fig 11 this relationship was weaker at low and normal ch 2 o bioavailability for both sites when irrigation water was provided note that glp was applied twice in the vineyard and only the first was followed by irrigation water transport likely played a smaller role in glp removal from the top soil in the not irrigated vineyard where a longer glp exposure to biodegraders resulted in higher glp biodegraded fractions irrigation increased glp leaching from the top 10 cm of soil as compared to no irrigation in the vineyard thus dry conditions caused glp accumulation in the top soil as shown by the fewer realizations for which μ glp t μ glp 0 0 01 between two glp applications fig 11a and b a similar relationship between glp biodegraded fraction and water input was found for the wheat field where only one glp application was used fig 11c a two fold increase in c source bioavailability increased the cumulative glp biodegraded fraction to at least 40 in the 10 cm of soil and nearly a two fold increase in glp biodegraded fraction as compared to the reference scenario in both the vineyard and wheat field the time varying glp cumulative biodegraded fractions and the corresponding water inputs show variabilities that are specific to each hydrological year as a result of different irrigation and glp application practices as well as biomass and water table dynamics figure d1 aslam et al 2015 suggested that optimal soil moisture content resulting from mild and frequent rainfall events favor bacteria growth and glp biodegradation in contrast intense rainfall events did not increase the risk of glp leaching below root zone likely as a consequence of glp high adsorption strength however extreme events may trigger glp transport via preferential flows through soil macropores and runoff of dissolved glp lefrancq et al 2017 or glp sediment aggregates munira et al 2016 these processes may be relevant for identifying the vulnerability of nearby ground and surface water resources 3 8 optimization of microbial biodegradation pathways in this work biological reactions and their corresponding kinetic parameters were estimated from laboratory experiments and were kept constant over time however this may have led to underestimation of biodegradation and overestimation of soil glp and ampa concentrations as well as glp removal times although newly synthesized herbicides may be very difficult to biodegrade some may have a chemical structure similar to compounds already biodegradable and very small genetic adjustments would be needed for bacteria to consume them arbeli and fuentes 2007 this is referred to as cross acclimation that is the capability to consume a new substrate elicited by the previous capability to consume a similar one early inefficiencies in degradation pathways may be offset via cometabolization of an additional c source for supplying the energy necessary to break chemical bonds these cometabolic reactions may allow scavenging of crucial macronutrients such as p n and s similarly microorganisms can cometabolically use glp as a p source dick and quinn 1995 and a n source balthazor and hallas 1986 some bacteria have adapted to use glp as a c source mcauliffe et al 1990 with no need of a co substrate microorganisms can also manifest enhanced contaminants biodegradation and more references can be found in arbeli and fuentes 2007 this process is stimulated by continuous exposure to a contaminant which may trigger selection pressure and an increase in the number of best fitted degraders in the soil community evidence of enhanced biodegradation should promote the characterization of new or optimized reaction pathways and their corresponding kinetic parameters via laboratory experiments so that contaminants reaction networks are always up to date this effort will result in more reliable modelling frameworks which may be relied upon by authorities to update policies on pesticides uses and best management practices other mechanisms for enhancing contaminants biodegradation may involve gene regulation optimization such as for the metabolism of organophosphates mcgrath et al 2013 possibly including also glp and ampa laboratory experiments suggested that biodegradation of glp pipke and amrhein 1988 and ampa balthazor and hallas 1986 liberating po 4 3 were inhibited by the availability of exogenous po 4 3 however duke 2011 noticed that glp and ampa were biodegraded in agricultural soils which very likely contained po 4 3 ions suppression of po 4 3 inhibition of glp and ampa biodegradation via p2r1s and p1r2s may result in higher biodegradation rates it has been generally assumed that adsorbed contaminants are not bioavailable thus do not undergo biodegradation however it is not uncommon that adsorbed pesticides can be biodegraded albeit at a very slow rate for example park et al 2003 found that some bacteria consumed adsorbed atrazine while others could biodegrade adsorbed glp schnürer et al 2006 eberbach 1998 a first attempt to predict adsorbed glp was carried out by zaranyika and nyandoro 1993 for sediment particles in the aquatic environment later eberbach 1998 estimated half life values relative to the biodegradation of dissolved and adsorbed glp in soil to be 9 and between 222 and 835 days respectively microorganisms can exploit different strategies to consume adsorbed compounds such as those suggested in park et al 2003 huang and schnitzer 1986 and schnürer et al 2006 as well as produce new extracellular enzymes or enhance the activity of old ones biodegradation of adsorbed compounds will affect the compounds distribution and decrease their residence time in soil in this work it was assumed that neither glp nor ampa were toxic to microorganisms therefore no killing or inhibition terms were accounted for at high glp or ampa concentrations however glp was shown to cause adverse effects on some non target species including soil microorganisms aristilde et al 2017 newman et al 2016 nguyen et al 2016 especially in areas with no previous history of glp contamination toxicity could result in no or low biodegradation however glp and ampa degraders are abundant in agricultural soils that have experienced glp applications dick and quinn 1995 absence of toxicity by glp and ampa in these bacteria is corroborated by glp half life as low as 1 5 days bento et al 2016 once again selective pressure may have acted to increase the number of glp degraders to the detriment of species diversity dick and quinn 1995 available bioreactive models neglect microbial adaptation to contaminants as a consequence those models may overestimate half life values krutz et al 2010 in the past typical time scales for bacteria to achieve such enhanced capabilities were 10 20 years krutz et al 2008 however nowadays such enhanced degradation may take very short time scales to manifest because microorganisms can easily biodegrade new xenobiotics as a result of cross acclimation arbeli and fuentes 2007 thus we can assume that biodegradation pathways are as a matter of fact mediated by specific enzymes raillard et al 2001 which catalyze degradation reactions at optimal rates when this does not hold true such as when microorganisms do not undergo cross acclimation or require a new enzyme to degraded xenobiotics like for ampa hove jensen et al 2014 adaptation should be described mechanistically however such quantitative treatment is still missing because enhanced degradation cannot be predicted periodic monitoring studies aiming to keep data up to date on the population of degraders biodegradation pathways and their kinetics are recommended 3 9 other biological processes influencing glp reaction network higher organisms as well as other culturable and unculturable microorganisms can degrade glp forlani et al 1999 even if to a smaller extent as compared to characterized bacteria borggaard and gimsing 2008 for example ten fungal strains were found to use glp as c or p source krzyśko et al 1997 also some crop plants can oxidize glp to ampa but still to a small extent duke 1988 2011 since plants were found to substantially degrade other herbicides coleman et al 2002 it may be worthy to monitor whether glp resistant weeds heap 2016 will develop enhanced glp and ampa degradation capabilities thus contributing to decrease the risk for glp and ampa persistence in the environment 4 conclusions a numerical model was developed to predict the dynamics of glp and ampa under the effects of nutrients release from som nitrogen cycle and fluctuating ecohydrological boundary conditions in two different agricultural systems experimental observations of glp and ampa biodegradation and field data of precipitation and water table dynamics were used to constrain the model parameters the major conclusions of this work are glp can be biodegraded to large extents in the root zone where microbial activity is high however the predominant pathway produced the toxic metabolite ampa which was predicted to be more persistent than glp concentrations of glp and ampa in the top 1 5 m of the shallow aquifer will eventually exceed the safety threshold of 0 1 μg l 1 within 50 years of glp use for the tested hydrological boundary conditions and agricultural practices addition of bioavailable c sources can substantially decrease glp and ampa concentrations in the test sites hence som management can represent an important bioremediation strategy for contaminated sites the use of coupled physical chemical and biological processes describing the glp biodegradation network under varying ecohydrological boundary conditions allowed to quantify glp and ampa dispersion degradation and aquifer contamination in two important agroecosystems of the po valley the proposed framework sets a crucial benchmark to develop models for environmental risk assessments under different land management practices that alter both microbial ecology and feedbacks amongst soil biogeochemical processes future studies may quantify uncertainties related to model structure and parameter estimation by means of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the confidence in the model it was here suggested the importance to understand the catalytic potential of mn oxides towards glp and ampa removal under field conditions glp and ampa chemical degradation would be crucial below the root zone where microbial activity is negligible acknowledgements dlc fhmt

terminate with a black bullet in figure d1a f the wheat field displayed patterns similar to the irrigated vineyard with some hydrological years resulting in either complete disappearance of glp or accumulation amongst different years it was found a negative relationship between glp biodegraded fraction and water input for each glp disappeared mass fraction each single scatter of bullets with the same color in figure d1 the relationship was significant at high ch 2 o bioavailability but it may turn out to be not significant at lower ch 2 o bioavailability or ratios of m g l p t m glp 0 down to 0 5 this analysis shows that for a given glp disappeared mass fraction an increase in water input results in a decrease in glp biodegradation with the remaining glp mass being transported to

19266,biodegradation of glyphosate glp and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa was numerically assessed for a vineyard and a wheat field in the po valley italy calculation of the hazard quotient suggested that glp and ampa can pose a risk of aquifer contamination in the top 1 5 m depth within 50 years of glp use numerical results relative to soil glp and ampa concentrations and glp age half life and turnover time show that glp was equivalently removed through hydrolysis and oxidation but the latter produced ampa biodegradation processes in the root zone removed more than 90 of applied glp and more than 23 of the produced ampa between two consecutive applications doubling organic carbon availability enhanced glp and ampa biodegradation especially glp hydrolysis to sarcosine this work highlights that glp and ampa removal is controlled by soil water dynamics that depend on ecohydrological boundary conditions and by carbon sources availability to biodegraders graphical abstract image 1 keywords glyphosate ampa pesticide michaelis menten monod biodegradation contaminant ecohydrology 1 introduction glyphosate glp is a broad spectrum herbicide which first reached the market in 1974 and has since revolutionized the farming sector duke and powles 2008 glp based herbicides provide a low cost weed control treatment because it is effective also at low active ingredient doses glp use has increased further worldwide after some crops have been genetically modified to be glp resistant coupe and capel 2016 under laboratory conditions glp has been shown to be fast degraded biologically balthazor and hallas 1986 jacob et al 1988 mcauliffe et al 1990 moore et al 1983 and chemically barrett and mcbride 2005 li et al 2016 paudel et al 2015 thus posing a low risk for persistence glp is also strongly adsorbed onto soil particles al rajab and hakami 2014 sidoli et al 2016 thus lowering the likelihood of leaching finally glp has been found to be less toxic than other herbicides fishel et al 2015 as a result glp has become the most used herbicide in agriculture however field surveys have found that an increasing number of glp resistant weeds have made their appearance heap 2016 glp has been found in soil aparicio et al 2013 silva et al 2017 streams paris et al 2013 2016 lefrancq et al 2017 and groundwater paris et al 2016 thus indicating glp mobility and persistence in the environment which may eventually result in a risk to groundwater quality simonsen et al 2008 note that glp oxidation has been shown to produce aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa a toxic compound more persistent than glp grandcoin et al 2017 the comparison between paris et al 2013 and paris et al 2016 provides further evidence consistent with the wide spreading groundwater contamination by glp and ampa indeed contaminated sites out of tested sites increased from 0 9 to 5 8 for glp and from 0 9 to 4 8 for ampa in the period 2010 2013 a large amount of data have been collected about glp sorption and degradation in controlled laboratory and field conditions through short term and continuous monitoring campaigns these data may be used to validate numerical models with important applications in risk assessment and agriculture for example mamy et al 2005 numerically assessed the environmental sustainability of a proposed glp based weed management plan to replace four other used herbicides numerical models can be used with confidence for similar purposes if they at least account for the most important processes driving pesticides dynamics in agricultural soils most of the available models account for contaminant transport in soil water however only a few models allow the design and implementation of arbitrary biogeochemical reaction networks and describe their dynamics comprehensively e g hydrus langergraber and šimůnek 2005 modflow rt3d johnson and truex 2006 toughreact xu et al 2011 and brtsim maggi 2015 relative to glp and ampa degradation first order kinetics have been used in earlier numerical approaches in ghafoor et al 2011 guijarro et al 2018 and simonsen et al 2008 and in the pelmo and macro models to carry out the initial risk assessment for regulating glp use in europe efsa 2015 however cheyns et al 2010 suggested that michaelis menten monod mmm kinetics should be used in place of first order kinetics in pesticide fate models and used atrazine biodegradation in soil mini columns to prove that first order kinetics may underestimate pesticide leaching more recently a comprehensive numerical analysis of a real case scenario showed that atrazine disappearance from an agricultural soil was driven by water transport and controlled by biodegradation the latter was described explicitly by microbial functional groups and michaelis menten mm biochemical reactions la cecilia and maggi 2017 it is evident that additional kinetic mechanisms can control pesticide degradation in soil which are not necessarily included in single mm type kinetics and are certainly omitted in first order kinetics these may include multiple inhibitions and competitions for substrates and byproducts which can be accounted for by means of mm terms the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of hydrological boundary conditions to glp biodegradation and transport in soil and contamination of the shallow aquifer to this aim we couple a comprehensive mechanistic description of the glp reaction network with the nitrogen n cycle and soil organic matter som mineralization and we describe the biochemical system using mmm kinetics the assumptions made to frame the model were based on laboratory experiments on biogeochemical processes regarding the glp reaction network this high level of process coupling allowed us to quantify how water and biomass dynamics phosphate and ph inhibition and oxygen and substrate bioavailability affected glp dispersion degradation and aquifer contamination in two agricultural settings in the po valley italy simulation outcomes are compared with field data reported in the literature to quantitatively assess the postulated modelling approach implications relative to glp and ampa biodegradation by fungi and plants biodegradation of adsorbed substrates adsorption competition between phosphorus containing molecules and glp toxicity to microorganisms are discussed the information provided herein can be used to predict the outcomes of current glp uses or to setup site and scenario specific studies to assess and mitigate the environmental contamination risk 2 methods 2 1 glp reaction network coupled with n cycle the glp reaction network proposed in la cecilia and maggi 2018 was expanded to include a som pool and was coupled with the n cycle earlier described in maggi et al 2008 fig 1 the som pool released nutrients that support the microbial soil communities this allowed to investigate nonlinearities in glp and ampa soil biodegradation due to varying carbon c source bioavailability in the form of ch 2 o yet the glp reaction network and the n cycle share ch 2 o o 2 nh 3 and h thus highlighting the level of process coupling that was accounted for the biochemical reactions are reported in table a1 together with their corresponding reaction rate constant μ s 1 half saturation concentration k mol l 1 biomass yield coefficient y mg wet biomass mol substrate 1 and equilibrium constant k aq k g and k ad for aqueous complexation gaseous dissolution and adsorption the coupled biochemical system was implemented in the bioreactive transport simulator brtsim following the validation by construct approach mccarl and apland 1986 glp and ampa chemical degradation by birnessite mineral li et al 2016 paudel et al 2015 represented in fig 1 via pathways p2r1c and p1r2c respectively was not included because it is uncertain whether it occurs in field conditions i e barrett and mcbride 2005 observed that cu 2 ions preferentially adsorbed onto birnessite thus inhibiting glp and ampa degradation 2 2 equilibrium adsorption reactions experiments on glp and ampa sorption in agricultural soil appendix c sidoli et al 2016 were used to retrieve a linear adsorption coefficient as 1 k ad q e c e where q e mol kg soil 1 is the moles of adsorbed solute per unit mass of adsorbent and c e mol kg h 2 o 1 is the equilibrium solute concentration a linear k ad was used because glp and ampa concentrations in soils are very low and the tangent of the langmuir model fit in the low concentration low adsorption range was representative enough of soil buffer capacity for those compounds po 4 3 adsorption onto soil particles was not included in the model therefore the competition between glp ampa and po 4 3 for adsorptive sites was not modeled after sprankle et al 1975 showed a low sensitivity of adsorbed glp over a wide range of po 4 3 concentrations also munira et al 2016 showed more recently that p based fertilizers applied at a rate up to 80 kg p ha 1y 1 did not substantially affect the adsorbed glp 2 3 biogeochemical solver brtsim v2 2 based on maggi 2015 is a 1 d model suitable to simulate biogeochemical reaction advection dispersion processes in unsaturated soil systems the soil moisture dynamics are dealt with a finite volume scheme that solves the richards equation along the vertical direction brtsim can account for any number of chemical and biological species primary and secondary chemical species can be defined the latter being in equilibrium with the corresponding primary species equilibrium reactions can be defined for aqueous complexation ion exchange gas dissolution and mineral adsorption and are calculated in brtsim using the mass action law transport of chemical species is accounted for by the darcy s advection and fick s diffusion note that advection of gas species in the gas phase was neglected given the time scales of interest in this work chemical and biochemical reactions involving primary species and microbial functional groups described in this solver as primary species are accounted for by means of the mmm kinetic equations bekins et al 1998 belser 1979 monod 1949 2 4 experimental site the glp

characteristics were retrieved from sgss 2016 and are reported in table 1 the bottom soil layer in both sites was extended down to 5 m depth to predict glp and ampa dispersion in the aquifer assuming a 20 rainfall loss by crop interception the infiltrating precipitation p i averaged 540 mm y 1 in the vineyard and 515 mm y 1 in the wheat field in the 2006 2016 period data post processed after arpae simc 2016 the average potential evapotranspiration rate was 1133 mm y 1 in the vineyard and 828 mm y 1 in the wheat field during the same period data post processed after arpae simc 2016 the daily reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 was calculated using the approach in allen et al 1998 fig 2 the daily actual crop evapotranspiration was calculated as e t c e t 0 k c with the time varying crop coefficient k c taken from allen et al 1998 and represented in fig 2 daily irrigation rates i r r were not available hence these were estimated depending on the crop and fine tuned to match in situ groundwater observations from chiari et al 2016 fig 3 the vineyard was irrigated during its typical growing season between april and october while the wheat field was irrigated all year around daily precipitation irrigation and crop evapotranspiration rates were used as upper boundary conditions fig 3 while yearly cumulative rates were used for analyses described later table 2 in the vineyard 60 of the roots system was uniformly distributed within the first 0 6 m depth while the remaining 40 was uniformly distributed down to 1 4 m seguin 1986 the average roots depth in the wheat field was 0 3 m and the roots density was distributed with a negative exponential function down to 1 m depth bowdena et al 2008 passive uptake of nh 4 no 3 hco 3 po 4 3 and h was described as driven by evapotranspiration and nutrient concentrations in solution meteorological observations spanned 11 years from 2006 to 2016 and constituted one cycle of boundary conditions bccycle the bccycle was repeated to construct boundary conditions for longer time frames the biochemical system reached steady state in the top 1 m of soil after four bccycle 2 5 modelling framework soil microbial communities change over time and depends on environmental conditions such as water content nutrients availability o 2 levels etc detailed data on microbial communities present at the test sites were not available though it is likely that glp and ampa biodecomposers bhyo fig 1 inhabited the root zone where glp had been periodically applied as earlier observed in dick and quinn 1995 five other microbial functional groups were included to describe the following reactions non toxic metabolites of glp and ampa were consumed by b aer in aerobic conditions and by b anaer in anaerobic conditions two steps nitrification was carried out by b aob and b nob and denitrification was carried out by b den a biomass background recovery rate r b j for each functional group j was included in this biochemical system to allow for microbial ecology dynamic stability over time in case their c sources were depleted e g ch 2 o glp or ampa for bhyo those rates were calculated neglecting microbial growth from the breakdown of c sources as d b j d t δ j b j r b j 0 hence returning r b j δ j b j with b j the equilibrium concentration for b j in the absence of c sources values of b j were chosen such that b aer b hyo 1 aristilde et al 2017 newman et al 2016 smit et al 2001 while b aob b aer b aob b nob 5 and b den b aob 10 tang and maggi 2016 the minimum soil biomass concentration was therefore imposed while the instantaneous biomass concentration varied according to substrates availability and consumption cell mortality rate was assumed to be δ 10 6 s 1 for all microbial functional groups biodegradation of adsorbed compounds was excluded with the assumption that multiple forms of adsorption can prevent enzyme degradation effectiveness riley et al 2014 substrates consumption competition was not included in the glp reaction network due to the small range of different c sources available to each microbial group microbial competition for o 2 aq and ch 2 o was implicitly captured by the model thank to the different mmm parameter values corresponding to each different biological reactions the effect of ph on microbial activity was explicitly taken into account in all biologically mediated reactions using a mm term for high ph with constant 10 9 m and an inhibition term for low ph with constant 10 5 m respectively boon and laudelout 1962 the mm constant for o 2 aq consumption was k 1 4 10 5 m button and garver 1966 o 2 aq inhibition on anaerobic reactions p1r3b p2r2b and p2r3b was explicitly included using an inhibition term with constant 3 125 10 6 m kindred and celia 1989 the total organic carbon toc measured at the selected locations sgss 2016 table 1 was used to estimate the soil organic matter som as s o m 1 72 t o c hoyle 2015 which was assumed to slowly release ch 2 o nh 4 and po 4 3 with a first order kinetic reaction with rate constant r 10 11 s 1 and stoichiometry taken from tipping et al 2016 reaction r9 table a1 while som was assumed to be constant over time as a result of recharge from root mortality exudates and other debris riley et al 2014 note that ch 2 o was also released by sarcosine glycine and methylamine biodegradation reactions p2r2a and p2r2b p2r3b and p1r3a fig 1 aqueous po 4 3 inhibited glp oxidation pipke and amrhein 1988 and ampa oxidation balthazor and hallas 1986 2 6 analysis of glp application scenarios a range of glp yearly application rates and ch 2 o release rates from som were used to investigate nonlinearities in glp and ampa biodegradation dynamics glp yearly applications of 0 72 kg ha 1 in april and october in the vineyard and 2 kg ha 1 in november in the wheat field were used as the reference for our analyses table 3 it was assumed that all applied glp leached into the soil because some glp absorb into leaves in reality our predictions overestimate glp soil concentrations and the results are therefore cautionary glp and ampa distribution along the soil profile and their phase partitioning were calculated using masses averaged over the 5th bccycle when the biochemical system was at steady state in the top 1 m of soil these analyses were repeated along the soil profile also for glp application rates equal to half glplow and twice glphigh the reference rate glpref and for the stoichiometry coefficient relative to ch 2 o release from som equal to half ch 2 o low and twice ch 2 o high the reference value ch 2 o ref 2 7 assessment of aquifer contamination by glp and ampa the hazard quotient hq by suter 2007 was used to assess the aquifer contamination by glp and ampa as 2 h q c predicted t c threshold where c predicted t is the glp or ampa aqueous concentration or their sum as a function of time t and c threshold is the european safety limit to ensure the maintenance of an overall good groundwater quality directive 2006 118 ec 2006 c threshold 0 1 μg l 1 is used for a single pesticide and c threshold 0 5 μg l 1 for a pesticide mixture that causes similar adverse health effects the hq was averaged over the 5th bccycle and was represented as a function of soil depth and time figure b1 note that the contribution of microbial dynamics on contaminant dispersion can easily be quantified by calculating the biodegradation potential parameter ψ b tang et al 2017 based on la cecilia and maggi 2016 in simplistic models that do not account for biodegradation kinetics 2 8 analysis of glp age and turnover time a molecule tracking method was used to calculate glp age at each depth z as the time necessary for that molecule to move from depth z 0 m to depth z tracking was used for a single application of non reactive glp after the biochemical system reached steady state glp age variability due to different hydrological conditions was investigated by releasing and tracking the molecule for each of the eleven years of the bccycle table 2 glp turnover time was averaged at each depth over the 5th bccycle as 3 t t glp z g l p aq z g l p ad z r p 1 r 1 z r p 1 r 1 s z r p 2 r 1 s z f glp out z where t t glp z is glp turnover time g l p aq z is dissolved glp g l p ad z is adsorbed glp r p 1 r 1 z is biodegraded glp mass rate along p1r1 r p 1 r 1 s z is biodegraded glp mass rate along p1r1s r p 2 r 1 s z is biodegraded glp mass rate along p2r1s and f glp out z is glp mass flux exiting the node at depth z together with the overall turnover time the contribution of each of the biological and physical processes was calculated for example the turnover time corresponding to glp biodegraded along p1r1 was calculated as t t glp p 1 r 1 z g l p aq z g l p ad z r p 1 r 1 z 2 9 statistical analysis of glp breakthrough curves the biogeochemical system was exposed to eleven different ecohydrological boundary conditions of the bccycle table 2 between two consecutive glp applications a glp breakthrough curve in the top 10 cm of soil was defined as the time history of normalized glp mass m glp t that is the instantaneous glp mass subtracted from the applied glp mass m glp 0 times t when m glp t m glp 0 was between 0 99 and 0 01 were recorded glp half life t 1 2 was then calculated as the time necessary by the biochemical system to meet the condition m glp t m glp 0 0 5 metabolites ampa and sarcosine masses were monitored to calculate the percentage of biodegraded glp at the same times t relative to applied glp 2 10 inter annual variability to glp biodegradation the relationship between cumulative water input and glp biodegraded fraction between two consecutive glp applications under different hydrological boundary conditions was investigated using outputs from the breakthrough curves cumulative water inputs and glp biodegraded fractions were mapped for m glp t m glp 0 equal to 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 glp and ampa dispersion and aquifer contamination glp and ampa concentrations were nearly 200 μg l 1 in the top 0 5 m of soil for both sites in the 5th bccycle of the reference simulation and corresponded to h q 2000 fig 4 maximum glp and ampa concentrations of nearly 1 and 2 μg l 1 respectively were measured in groundwater samples in italy paris et al 2016 similar concentrations were numerically predicted at 1 5 m depth our predictions highlight a risk h q 1 of harmful exposure to one or a mixture of contaminants within 1 5 m depth fig 4 3 2 glp and ampa biodegradation rate glp oxidation via p1r1 and p1r1s was the main mechanism for glp biodegradation for the vineyard in the 5th bccycle of the reference simulation 38 and 10 respectively of glp biodegraded mass while hydrolysis via p2r1s accounted for 43 of glp biodegraded mass fig 5 a thus 48 of applied glp was converted into ampa only 23 by mass of produced ampa underwent biodegradation similar results were found for the wheat field glp and ampa biodegradation increased up to 45 via p2r1s and up to 34 via p1r2s fig 5b these predictions are in line with previous observations by zablotowicz et al 2009 who reported glp mineralization rates as high as 70 within 35 days after application however ampa poses an increasing environmental issue due to its slow degradation rate al rajab and hakami 2014 la cecilia and maggi 2018 this supports the importance of current practices according to which herbicide re approval must account for the release of toxic metabolites glp and ampa birnessite mediated chemical degradation was not accounted for in this numerical study although it could be a predominant degradation pathway la cecilia and maggi 2018 processes inhibiting glp and ampa chemical degradation such as competition for catalytic sites between cu 2 ions and glp barrett and mcbride 2005 have not been investigated in field conditions a beneficial aspect of glp chemical degradation is that any produced intermediate organophosphate is rapidly degraded to po 4 3 paudel et al 2015 3 3 glp and ampa distribution adsorbed glp and ampa represented 19 and 76 respectively of the total mass of phytotoxic molecules above the root zone of the vineyard in the 5th bccycle of the reference simulation while 2 was ampa in the aqueous phase fig 6 a adsorbed ampa was nearly 3 by mass below the root zone adsorbed glp and ampa represented 23 and 73 of the total mass of phytotoxic molecules above the root zone of the wheat field while 2 was ampa in the aqueous phase fig 6b adsorbed ampa was nearly 3 by mass below the root zone these results are in line with lysimeter studies and phase partitioning along the profile in al rajab and hakami 2014 it has been shown that phosphorus p fertilization can promote glp and ampa leaching and that the leaching mass is greater when glp applications are concomitant with rainfall events sasal et al 2015 however p application rates of 80 kg p ha 1y 1 can decrease glp adsorption capacity by 25 44 munira et al 2016 since glp can adsorb very firmly to soil particles a reduction by 44 may not result in an adsorption strength lower than that of po 4 3 moreover munira et al 2016 showed that most glp dispersion results from wind and transport of glp sediment aggregates rather than leaching and runoff of dissolved glp as a comparison glp and ampa spreading at a rate of about 20 mg ha 1 y 1 due to the former processes was found by silva et al 2017 3 4 glp and ch 2 o sensitivity analyses increasing glp application rates did not affect glp and ampa biodegradation in the test areas fig 5 while increasing ch 2 o release from som not only enhanced glp and ampa biodegradation but also enhanced the fraction of glp biodegraded along the beneficial pathway p2r1s similarly varying glp application rates did not affect glp and ampa partitioning along the soil profile in the test areas fig 6 while increasing ch 2 o release from som decreased the aqueous glp mass fraction to below 1 this result suggests that ampa can become an even more important emergent contaminant if greater glp applications will be adopted to control glp resistant weeds despite the generally high glp biodegradation glp and ampa residues reached 6 mg k g dry soil 1 and 17 mg kg dry soil 1 respectively in the vineyard and 7 mg kg dry soil 1 and 15 mg kg dry soil 1 in the wheat field fig 7 these concentrations fall within the values measured in agricultural soils silva et al 2017 increasing ch 2 o release from som resulted in glp and ampa residues of 3 mg kg dry soil 1 and 14 mg kg dry soil 1 in the vineyard and of 4 mg kg dry soil 1 and 19 mg kg dry soil 1 in the wheat field fig 7 interestingly total glp average soil residues decreased nonlinearly as ch 2 o increased orange and blue stacked bars in fig 7 while ampa showed a maximum average concentration at the reference ch 2 o release rate brown and yellow stacked bars in fig 7 this is explained by the interplay between p1r1 and p2r1s in glp biodegradation 3 5 glp age and turnover time the overall glp age in the reference simulation was similar for the two sites fig 8 a and b however a substantial discontinuity was found in the vineyard corresponding to a drop in the clay fraction at 0 8 m depth also the vineyard experienced slightly larger groundwater fluctuations which exacerbated the discontinuity because of higher frequency of dilutions and downward transport the overall glp turnover time t t glp was similar for the two sites fig 8c and d however the different contribution played by physical or biological processes was noticeable in line with the previous results the glp turnover time was shorter for the vineyard and longer for the wheat field and was explained by the same effect of groundwater fluctuations as above to the best of our knowledge this mechanism of glp mobilization remains yet to be systematically investigated in the field amongst the biological pathways p1r1 and p2r1s provided a similar contribution in the top 10 cm of soil while p2r1s allowed for the shortest turnover time along the soil profile this was likely due to a higher affinity lower k table a1 of bhyo to scavenge small glp concentrations along p2r1s an effect that decreased with increasing soil depth 3 6 glp tracking and breakthrough curve the ecohydrological conditions corresponding to the 11 years of the bccycle influenced the time necessary to remove the applied glp mass in the first 10 cm of soil fig 9 the minimum average and maximum removal times corresponding to m glp t mglp0 1 are tabulated in table 4 bento et al 2016 found that it took 280 40 days to remove 90 of applied glp mass which is in accordance with our predictions the minimum average and maximum half life values corresponding to μ glp t mglp0 50 are tabulated in table 4 the predicted half life values are well within or in accordance with the value of 151 days found by bergström et al 2011 the biodegraded glp mass corresponding to glp disappearance from the top soil over time is represented in fig 10 while minimum average and maximum values are tabulated in table 4 this result stresses that the biological activity explained up to 32 of glp mass removed from the top soil while the remaining percentage was advected to lower soil layers depending on the ecohydrological conditions μ glp advected t 1 μ glp t mglp0 100 μ glp biodegraded t 3 7 inter annual variability in glp biodegradation the cumulative inter annual glp biodegraded fraction was found to decrease for increasing cumulative water inputs fig 11 this relationship was weaker at low and normal ch 2 o bioavailability for both sites when irrigation water was provided note that glp was applied twice in the vineyard and only the first was followed by irrigation water transport likely played a smaller role in glp removal from the top soil in the not irrigated vineyard where a longer glp exposure to biodegraders resulted in higher glp biodegraded fractions irrigation increased glp leaching from the top 10 cm of soil as compared to no irrigation in the vineyard thus dry conditions caused glp accumulation in the top soil as shown by the fewer realizations for which μ glp t μ glp 0 0 01 between two glp applications fig 11a and b a similar relationship between glp biodegraded fraction and water input was found for the wheat field where only one glp application was used fig 11c a two fold increase in c source bioavailability increased the cumulative glp biodegraded fraction to at least 40 in the 10 cm of soil and nearly a two fold increase in glp biodegraded fraction as compared to the reference scenario in both the vineyard and wheat field the time varying glp cumulative biodegraded fractions and the corresponding water inputs show variabilities that are specific to each hydrological year as a result of different irrigation and glp application practices as well as biomass and water table dynamics figure d1 aslam et al 2015 suggested that optimal soil moisture content resulting from mild and frequent rainfall events favor bacteria growth and glp biodegradation in contrast intense rainfall events did not increase the risk of glp leaching below root zone likely as a consequence of glp high adsorption strength however extreme events may trigger glp transport via preferential flows through soil macropores and runoff of dissolved glp lefrancq et al 2017 or glp sediment aggregates munira et al 2016 these processes may be relevant for identifying the vulnerability of nearby ground and surface water resources 3 8 optimization of microbial biodegradation pathways in this work biological reactions and their corresponding kinetic parameters were estimated from laboratory experiments and were kept constant over time however this may have led to underestimation of biodegradation and overestimation of soil glp and ampa concentrations as well as glp removal times although newly synthesized herbicides may be very difficult to biodegrade some may have a chemical structure similar to compounds already biodegradable and very small genetic adjustments would be needed for bacteria to consume them arbeli and fuentes 2007 this is referred to as cross acclimation that is the capability to consume a new substrate elicited by the previous capability to consume a similar one early inefficiencies in degradation pathways may be offset via cometabolization of an additional c source for supplying the energy necessary to break chemical bonds these cometabolic reactions may allow scavenging of crucial macronutrients such as p n and s similarly microorganisms can cometabolically use glp as a p source dick and quinn 1995 and a n source balthazor and hallas 1986 some bacteria have adapted to use glp as a c source mcauliffe et al 1990 with no need of a co substrate microorganisms can also manifest enhanced contaminants biodegradation and more references can be found in arbeli and fuentes 2007 this process is stimulated by continuous exposure to a contaminant which may trigger selection pressure and an increase in the number of best fitted degraders in the soil community evidence of enhanced biodegradation should promote the characterization of new or optimized reaction pathways and their corresponding kinetic parameters via laboratory experiments so that contaminants reaction networks are always up to date this effort will result in more reliable modelling frameworks which may be relied upon by authorities to update policies on pesticides uses and best management practices other mechanisms for enhancing contaminants biodegradation may involve gene regulation optimization such as for the metabolism of organophosphates mcgrath et al 2013 possibly including also glp and ampa laboratory experiments suggested that biodegradation of glp pipke and amrhein 1988 and ampa balthazor and hallas 1986 liberating po 4 3 were inhibited by the availability of exogenous po 4 3 however duke 2011 noticed that glp and ampa were biodegraded in agricultural soils which very likely contained po 4 3 ions suppression of po 4 3 inhibition of glp and ampa biodegradation via p2r1s and p1r2s may result in higher biodegradation rates it has been generally assumed that adsorbed contaminants are not bioavailable thus do not undergo biodegradation however it is not uncommon that adsorbed pesticides can be biodegraded albeit at a very slow rate for example park et al 2003 found that some bacteria consumed adsorbed atrazine while others could biodegrade adsorbed glp schnürer et al 2006 eberbach 1998 a first attempt to predict adsorbed glp was carried out by zaranyika and nyandoro 1993 for sediment particles in the aquatic environment later eberbach 1998 estimated half life values relative to the biodegradation of dissolved and adsorbed glp in soil to be 9 and between 222 and 835 days respectively microorganisms can exploit different strategies to consume adsorbed compounds such as those suggested in park et al 2003 huang and schnitzer 1986 and schnürer et al 2006 as well as produce new extracellular enzymes or enhance the activity of old ones biodegradation of adsorbed compounds will affect the compounds distribution and decrease their residence time in soil in this work it was assumed that neither glp nor ampa were toxic to microorganisms therefore no killing or inhibition terms were accounted for at high glp or ampa concentrations however glp was shown to cause adverse effects on some non target species including soil microorganisms aristilde et al 2017 newman et al 2016 nguyen et al 2016 especially in areas with no previous history of glp contamination toxicity could result in no or low biodegradation however glp and ampa degraders are abundant in agricultural soils that have experienced glp applications dick and quinn 1995 absence of toxicity by glp and ampa in these bacteria is corroborated by glp half life as low as 1 5 days bento et al 2016 once again selective pressure may have acted to increase the number of glp degraders to the detriment of species diversity dick and quinn 1995 available bioreactive models neglect microbial adaptation to contaminants as a consequence those models may overestimate half life values krutz et al 2010 in the past typical time scales for bacteria to achieve such enhanced capabilities were 10 20 years krutz et al 2008 however nowadays such enhanced degradation may take very short time scales to manifest because microorganisms can easily biodegrade new xenobiotics as a result of cross acclimation arbeli and fuentes 2007 thus we can assume that biodegradation pathways are as a matter of fact mediated by specific enzymes raillard et al 2001 which catalyze degradation reactions at optimal rates when this does not hold true such as when microorganisms do not undergo cross acclimation or require a new enzyme to degraded xenobiotics like for ampa hove jensen et al 2014 adaptation should be described mechanistically however such quantitative treatment is still missing because enhanced degradation cannot be predicted periodic monitoring studies aiming to keep data up to date on the population of degraders biodegradation pathways and their kinetics are recommended 3 9 other biological processes influencing glp reaction network higher organisms as well as other culturable and unculturable microorganisms can degrade glp forlani et al 1999 even if to a smaller extent as compared to characterized bacteria borggaard and gimsing 2008 for example ten fungal strains were found to use glp as c or p source krzyśko et al 1997 also some crop plants can oxidize glp to ampa but still to a small extent duke 1988 2011 since plants were found to substantially degrade other herbicides coleman et al 2002 it may be worthy to monitor whether glp resistant weeds heap 2016 will develop enhanced glp and ampa degradation capabilities thus contributing to decrease the risk for glp and ampa persistence in the environment 4 conclusions a numerical model was developed to predict the dynamics of glp and ampa under the effects of nutrients release from som nitrogen cycle and fluctuating ecohydrological boundary conditions in two different agricultural systems experimental observations of glp and ampa biodegradation and field data of precipitation and water table dynamics were used to constrain the model parameters the major conclusions of this work are glp can be biodegraded to large extents in the root zone where microbial activity is high however the predominant pathway produced the toxic metabolite ampa which was predicted to be more persistent than glp concentrations of glp and ampa in the top 1 5 m of the shallow aquifer will eventually exceed the safety threshold of 0 1 μg l 1 within 50 years of glp use for the tested hydrological boundary conditions and agricultural practices addition of bioavailable c sources can substantially decrease glp and ampa concentrations in the test sites hence som management can represent an important bioremediation strategy for contaminated sites the use of coupled physical chemical and biological processes describing the glp biodegradation network under varying ecohydrological boundary conditions allowed to quantify glp and ampa dispersion degradation and aquifer contamination in two important agroecosystems of the po valley the proposed framework sets a crucial benchmark to develop models for environmental risk assessments under different land management practices that alter both microbial ecology and feedbacks amongst soil biogeochemical processes future studies may quantify uncertainties related to model structure and parameter estimation by means of sensitivity analyses to evaluate the confidence in the model it was here suggested the importance to understand the catalytic potential of mn oxides towards glp and ampa removal under field conditions glp and ampa chemical degradation would be crucial below the root zone where microbial activity is negligible acknowledgements dlc fhmt

terminate with a black bullet in figure d1a f the wheat field displayed patterns similar to the irrigated vineyard with some hydrological years resulting in either complete disappearance of glp or accumulation amongst different years it was found a negative relationship between glp biodegraded fraction and water input for each glp disappeared mass fraction each single scatter of bullets with

19267,the development of new biomaterials for the remove of organic contaminants from wastewater has attracted much attention over the few past years one of the most cost effective approaches is to produce new high value biomaterials from low value solid agricultural biowastes in this work sugarcane bagasse and agricultural waste rich in reducing sugars acted as both a green bioreductant for graphene oxide go and a sustainable supporter for the immobilization of burkholderia cepacia therefore this new biomaterial which contained both reduced graphene oxide rgo and burkholderia cepacia was cable of initial adsorption of malachite green mg and its subsequent biodegradation after 60 h immobilized burkholderia cepacia degraded more mg 98 5 than a cell cultured burkholderia cepacia 87 7 alone raman spectroscopy confirmed that go was successfully reduced by bagasse and that consequently a composite b rgo was prepared sem indicated that burkholderia cepacia was well immobilized and kinetics studies showed that the adsorption of mg onto the developed composite fitted a pseudo second order kinetics model r2 0 99 biodegradation of mg was confirmed by the detection of appropriate degradation products such as n n dimethylaniline and 4 dimethylamino benzophenone using gc ms uv and ft ir and via best fit first order biodegration kinetics furthermore a response surface methodology rsm was applied to the removal process by varying four independent parameters using a box behnken design bbd optimum mg removal 99 3 was achieved at 31 5 c with an initial mg concentration of 114 5 mg l 1 initial ph of 5 85 and an adsorbent dosage of 0 11 g l 1 the excellent removal efficiency indicated that agricultural waste derived reduced graphene oxide bio adsorbents have significant potential for the removal of dyes such as mg from industrial wastewaters keywords nano biomaterials sugarcane bagasse reduced graphene oxide malachite green 1 introduction since its discovery due to its unique physiochemical proprieties e g high conductivity high intrinsic mobility high chemical thermal stability allen et al 2010 li et al 2014 and high specific surface area mhamane et al 2011 graphene has been widely studied in many industrial applications including as biomedical sensors reinforced composites catalysts and super capacitors allen et al 2010 thakur and karak 2015 xie et al 2014 in addition while graphene can also be used in the environmental remediation sectors for contaminant removal it does have some limitations including acting as a secondary source of pollution requiring some reprocessing after adsorption and is also generally not effective at removing low concentrations of persistent organic pollutants pops badmus et al 2018 chaukura et al 2016 li et al 2017b in addition most current methods for synthesizing graphene tend to be expensive and use a variety of toxic chemicals therefore our goal was to develop a low cost pollution free and environmentally friendly sustainable method for the preparation of nanoscale rgo sheets using a waste biomass to improve these current deficiencies while biodegradation is one of the traditional techniques to remove organic contaminants it also has certain flaws for example planktonic microorganisms commonly used for contaminant biodegradation are often limited by cell growth cell separation and sensitivity to environmental factors such as fluctuations in the influent quality and component concentrations of the waste streams to be treated gao et al 2011 however some of these problems may be overcome by combining graphene adsorption and biodegradation technology in one novel material bagasse is a major abundant and renewable agricultural waste that has not as yet been effectively reused sugarcane bagasse b is one of the main agricultural bagasse and is mainly composed of hemicellulose 25 35 lignin 15 35 and cellulose 40 45 gnansounou 2010 some researchers have already successfully used bagasse lin et al 2015 as an immobilization material for microorganisms extending this preliminary work the hypothesis of this paper is that bagasse can also be used as both a fibrous carbon adsorbent for pollutants as a natural reducing agent to produce reduced graphene oxide rgo and as a microbial nutrient source fabrication of such composite materials has the advantage that both adsorption and degradation of contaminants can be carried out simultaneously thus overcoming some of the limitations experienced when applying individual adsorption and biodegradation in isolation this combined approach also the significant advantage of also providing a feasible reuse option for a variety of solid waste resources malachite green mg is a triphenylmethane dye that is used extensively in the textile and fish farming industries as a biocide mg is toxic to humans affecting both the immune and reproductive systems lv et al 2013 mg is also toxic to freshwater fish following either acute or chronic exposure lee and kim 2012 saha et al 2012 therefore to protect environmental and human health it is critical to establish efficient methods to remove mg from waste streams bioremediation is currently the most commonly adopted method for dye remediation where the main microorganisms which have been reported to successfully degrade triphenylmethane dyes include white rot fungi actinomycetes and algae in contrast there are relatively few reports of bacterial degradation however burkholderia cepacia are a nutritionally diverse bacterial organism that can grow successfully in diverse environments and therefore in this paper burkholderia cepacia was evaluated for the first time for its potential to degrade mg thus the overall goal of this study was to develop a new functional material which contained nanoscale rgo sheets which was produced via a simple low cost and environmentally friendly synthetic route and which allowed for incorporation of a microbiological mg dye degradation agent such a functionalized material would have several advantages firstly rgo has good toughness and biocompatibility and can both strengthen bagasse and provide a surface for loading of microorganisms secondly in the long term even when bagasse is decomposed dispersed rgo can still provide a stable platform for supporting microorganisms thirdly sugarcane bagasse is also a natural biomass with excellent biocompatibility and is harmless to the bacteria sugarcane bagasse is also rich in nutrients and can act as both a carbon and nitrogen source to support microorganisms to our knowledge there are no reports of immobilization of burkholderia cepacia on bagasse reduced graphene oxide b rgo for the removal of mg and this is the first report of applying this novel technique to the degradation of mg therefore the objectives of this study were progressed in a series of structured steps firstly the appearance and morphology of the sample were studied using a scanning electron microscope sem secondly the degradation of malachite green products by nano biomaterils nbms was analyzed by ultraviolet visible uv fourier transform infrared ft ir and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms finally the obtained kinetic data for nbms removal of mg were fit to appropriate kinetic models and response surface methodology was used to optimize the removal of mg by nbms and a mechanism for removal of mg by nbms was proposed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and cultures a graphene oxide go aqueous suspension was prepared using the modified hummer s method li et al 2017a graphite powder 8000 mesh purity 99 95 and malachite green mg molecular weight 364 92 purity 99 95 were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china sugarcane bagasse was purchased locally from a market in fuzhou china all other inorganic and organic chemicals were of analytical grade cell suspensions were cultured in a liquid medium lb containing g l 1 peptone 10 yeast extract

cepacia was cultivated for 24 h at 30 c and 150 rpm using lb liquid medium containing 100 mg l 1 of mg after which time the biomass was collected the resulting cell sample was then centrifuged at 4000

biomaterials nbms 2 2 1 preparation of sugarcane bagasse sugarcane bagasse was initially washed with deionized water three times before drying at 60 c in oven for 24 h and grinding into a fine homogeneous powder an aqueous solution 400 ml containing sugarcane bagasse powder 4 g and sulfuric acid 300 μl was heated at 60 c for 5 h before cooling to room temperature and stored at 4 c 2 2 2 preparation of the sugarcane bagasse reduced graphene oxide b rgo a standard procedure was used to convert go to b rgo li et al 2018 briefly dried go 300 mg was dispersed in di water 600 ml and the solution was exfoliated by an ultrasonicator for 30 min in general the presence of hydrophilic functional groups at the edges and basal planes of go makes dispersion in water relatively easy li et al 2018 thus sonication led to a very fine dispersion of go nanosheets subsequently an aqueous solution of the sugarcane bagasse 4 g per 400 ml as prepared in section 2 2 1 was added to the suspension and ammonia 600 μl was added to the mixture and then stirred for 12 h at 95 c in the sugarcane bagasse extract fructose can be readily transformed into reducing sugars because ketoenol tautomerism occurs in the presence of base i e the ammonia solution zhu et al 2010 the resultant mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min and the precipitate collected and vacuum lyophilized for 48 h to produce a solid material b rgo 2 2 3 preparation of nano biomaterials nbms in brief the b rgo prepared in section 2 2 2 was washed with distilled water three times and dried in an oven at 105 c for 6 h and then autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min a cultured cell suspension solution of burkholderia cepacia od600 0 7 v v 1 5 and the modified b rgo particles 1 0 g were placed into a 150 ml erlenmeyer flask containing msm 25 ml and the mixture incubated for 24 h in a reciprocating shaker at 150 rpm and 30 c until all cells were adsorbed onto the b rgo s surface 2 3 characterization and analytical methods surface morphology of all nbms was studied using a jeol jsm s4800 field emission scanning electron microscope sem raman spectra were determined on a micro raman spectrometer labram aramis horiba jobin yvon france using a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm during degradation experiments cultures were periodically sampled withdrawn for subsequent degradation products analysis uv vis spectra were recorded on an uv1902 spectrometer phoenix shanghai china in the wavelength range from 190 to 800 nm at atmospheric pressure and room temperature samples suitable for fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopic analysis were pretreated by drying at 70 c for 5 h ft ir spectra were determined in the frequency range 4000 400 cm 1 using kbr pressed plates on a nicolet 6700 spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa potassium bromide was dried at 240 c for 12 h prior to combining with samples and the background peaks associated with any residual water and carbon dioxide were subtracted during the test using kbr blanks to determine any potential intermediate products resulting from mg degradation samples 25 ml were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min to remove the adsorbent and the supernatant solution was extracted twice with ethyl acetate 10 ml in triplicate the extracts were then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to a 1 ml for gc ms analysis intermediate and degradation products of mg were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms focus gc and dsq ii ms using a db 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 m id 0 25 μm the column temperature was programmed to ramp from 100 to 280 c at 8 c min 1 and to hold for 15 min at 290 c carrier gas helium flow rate was 1 ml min 1 where injector and detector temperatures were 250 and 280 c respectively analysis of the intermediate products was carried out in electron impact ei mode 70 ev and at full scan 2 4 removal experiments nbms degradation of mg was conducted as follows firstly a 1 5 v v suspension of cells od600 0 7 and b rgo 0 5 g were aseptically inoculated into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing msm 50 ml and an aqueous mg solution 100 mg l 1 triplicate samples were then agitated at 150 rpm on a reciprocating shaker at 30 c for 96 h in the removal experiment the nbms were initially washed with sterile water three times and subsequently again with msm three times to remove free cells control samples consisted of msm 50 ml containing b 0 5 g b rgo 0 5 g and free cells 1 5 v v in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask a separate biodegradation experiment was conducted to assess nbms reusability as follows nbms were washed sequentially with distilled water and msm the mg removal quantity q and efficiency e were calculated using the following two equations 1 q c 0 c t v m 2 w c 0 c t c 0 100 where q is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 w is the removal efficiency c0 and ct are respectively the solution concentrations of mg at time zero initial and at time t mg l 1 v is the volume of solution l and m is the quality of nbms added g 2 5 removal kinetics the aqueous adsorption of mg by nbms was fit to either pseudo first order equation 3 or pseudo second order equation 4 kinetics balarak et al 2015 3 ln q e q t lnq e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe is the amount of mg adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 qt is the amount of mg adsorbed at time t mg

model equation 5 is often used to describe the biodegradation of dyes 5 ln c c 0 kt where c is the concentration of mg dye mg l 1 at time t h k is the biodegradation rate constant h 1 the half life for biodegradation of mg can then be expressed as 6 t 1 2 ln 2 k 2 6 mg removal using response surface methodology response surface methodology rsm experiments were designed and analyzed using the design expert software version 8 0 6 and box behnken design bbd the experiment set comprised four factors concentration a temperature b ph c and dosage d each at three levels 1 0 1 table 1 experimental data were fitted to a quadratic polynomial model to obtain optimal regression coefficients the non linear generated quadratic model used in the response surface was as described by equation 7 dastkhoon et al 2017 kumar gupta et al 2017 7 y b 0 i 1 n b i x i i 1 n b ii x i 2 i 1 n b ij x i x j ε where y is mg adsorption efficiency b0 is the model coefficient bi is the linear coefficient bii is the quadratic coefficient bij is the interaction coefficient xj are the independent variables in coded levels n is the number of independent variables and ε is the model error analysis of variance anova was used to assess the significance and adequacy of the regression model the model s fitness was evaluated via examination of the correlation coefficient r2 and statistical significance was confirmed using the f test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 sem images sem analysis revealed that the sugarcane bagasse contained porous structures which could provide spaces for storing substrates to metabolize microorganisms fig 1 a based on previous studies li et al 2018 we have proven that the yellow box in fig 1b marks the reduced graphene oxide rgo during go reduction since the reducing sugar in the sugarcane bagasse acts as both a reducing agent and a stabilizer the oxygen containing functional groups hydroxyl epoxy and carboxyl groups of go are effectively removed via scheme 1 this reaction has previously been confirmed using various characterization techniques li et al 2018 the indigo blue boxes in fig 1a and b were the aqueous solution states of bagasse and b rgo respectively in combination with fig 1d it can be proved that rgo was dispersed on bagasse b rgo clearly contained numerous porous and fold structures fig 1b which could both physically stengthen sugarcane bagasse and simultaneously provide living spaces to protect microorganisms and prevent their external environmental poisoning the surface morphology of burkholderia cepacia on the b rgo fig 1c and d indicates short rod shaped cells approximately 1 μm 2 μm and confirms that burkholderia cepacia was successfully immobilized onto the internal and external walls of the large pores and folded structures of b rgo compared with fig 1c after mg degradation burkholderia cepacia shown in fig 1d on the surface of b rgo were poisoned by external adverse conditions causing a morphology deformations the efficiency of removal of mg by nbms was faster than that of planktonic cells alone due to the larger specific surface area higher adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity of b rgo microbial immobilization has also been reported to protect cells from the environmental changes and toxicity of contaminants hsieh et al 2008 thus the stable microenvironment of the pores can protect the immobilized cells from adverse environmental factors hou et al 2013 bacteria attached to b rgo particles were unevenly distributed with some cells clustering and others spreading we speculated that the attachment of microbial cells includes interaction between cells and b rgo and adhesion between b rgo and the extracellular secretion of cells lin et al 2010 3 1 2 raman spectroscopy in raman spectroscopy two main characteristic peaks have been used to identify the structure of graphene akhavan et al 2012 the d peak close to 1350 cm 1 and the g peak close to 1580 cm 1 as shown in fig 2 the raman spectrum of go resulted in a broad g peak at 1612 cm 1 corresponding to the in phase vibration of the graphite oxide lattice and the d band at 1356 cm 1 while the raman spectrum of b rgo is similar to go there are subtle but significant changes the intensity ratio id ig has previously been used as an indicator for identifying the size of the sp2 domain carbon structures containing sp3 and sp2 bonds akhavan et al 2012 and was applied here fig 2 shows that the id ig ratio for b rgo 1 32 which is significantly higher than the id ig ratio observed for go 0 86 indicating that in b rgo the graphene sheets are disordered and the size of the in plane sp2 domain decreases following reduction at the same time this result confirmed that the reduction of go led to fragmentation and produced many different sizes of rgo domains shen et al 2012 3 1 3 uv spectra the uv visible spectra of mg before and after treatment with nbms is shown in fig 3 the characteristic mg peak peak 4 at 617 nm λ max for mg disappeared gradually when incubated with burkholderia cepacia as did the two peaks at 318 and 425 nm at the same time small peaks appeared at 230 nm peak 1 and 257 nm peak 2 which increased in height as incubation time increased simultaneously a significant spectral band that likely represented a new metabolite with an absorption maximum at 375 nm peak 3 emerged therefore the decolorization of mg in the present study is attributed to degradation conjugated polycyclic aromatic compounds are known to have strong auxochromic moieties that appear at longer wavelengths than the band position of single benzene derivatives therefore it was speculated that peak 1 and peak 2 were generated by the vibrations of single benzene ring and that peak 3 was attributed to the vibrations from a conjugated polycyclic aromatic structure in support of this assignment ju et al 2009 had previously reported that 4 dimethylaminobenzophenone dlbp was one of the major products produced by the attack on the mg central carbon which has a significant absorbance at 360 nm and is therefore likely to support the assignment of peak 3 as being due to dlbp 3 1 4 ft ir spectra the variation in peaks of the fingerprint region 4000 400 cm 1 of the ft ir spectra of mg and its treatment products before and after treatment with nbms is depicted in fig 4 the ft ir spectra shows that following treatment with nbms new peaks appeared at 3734 cm 1 associated with oh stretching vibrations indicating the formation of hydroxylated metabolites together with peaks at 3417 cm 1 corresponding to stretching vibrations of nh2 groups peaks at 1628 cm 1 and 1385 cm 1 were attributed to nh or cn stretching vibrations in amine groups in addition the small peak at 1718 cm 1 was attributed to co stretching of ketones moreover new peaks at 1076 cm 1 cc and 542 cm 1 poc or pop were used to infer bacterial secretions therefore overall the results of ft ir analysis indicated that the main functional groups of mg metabolites included oh co and nh2 however while suggestive of dye gradation ft ir is not sensitive enough to identify specific metabolites and thus gc analysis was undertaken 3 1 5 gc ms applying an identification program from the nist library to the gc ms analysis of mg and its products after complete degradation identified three possible metabolites fig 5 the parent peak associated with mg eluted at 25 6 min and gradually degraded into infinitesimal quantities the incubation experiment progressed the first new metabolite peak eluting at 6 5 min was identified as n n dimethylaniline while a second metabolite peak eluting at 20 9 min was identified as 4 dimethylamino benzophenone abbreviation 4 dlbp these two metabolites detected by gc ms most likely result from the cleavage of the entire conjugated chromophore leading to aminobenzene derivatives in comparison saquib and muneer 2003 described the detection of 4 aminobenzoic acid and n methylaniline following the photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet via gc ms analysis signifying that different chemical bond breaking dispositions due to different strategies can lead to the differential accumulation of compounds 3 2 degradation of mg by b b rgo free cells and nbms the removal efficiency of mg by b rgo was 76 1 fig 6 which was significantly higher than the removal efficiency of sugarcane bagasse alone 54 2 this result indicated that b rgo was more suitable for mg removal than sugarcane bagasse in isolation after reacting for 60 h the highest mg removal efficiency 99 3 was achieved by nbms compared to only 87 7 mg degradation by free cells alone fig 6 this indicated that the free cells were capable of effectively degrading mg with more than 93 6 of mg being degraded by free cells alone within 96 h at ph 5 5 and 30 c after a short adaptation period fig 6 in comparison to nbms only 82 3 of mg was removed by b rgo and the adsorption of mg onto the b rgo reached equilibrium within 12 h fig 6 this indicated that while b rgo was an effective adsorbent for removing mg from aqueous medium it was not as good as nbms alone this was attributed to mg adsorbing onto b rgo using electrostatic interactions between mg and the surfaces of b rgo which had a constant negative charge the degradation efficiency of mg using nbms was higher than that of free cells in the first 48 h indicating that in agreement with other studies of immobilized cells for the dye degradation cheng et al 2012 that immobilizing cells on b rgo significantly improves mg degradation however in this study b rgo had a porous folded structure allowing both substrate and oxygen to diffuse into the internal pores while retaining high mechanical strength this consequently allowed for the b rgo component of the nbms to increase the stability of the microbial system and maintain a higher level of mg degradation compared to free cells alone it was also evident that b rgo could alter cell physiology and increase cell membrane permeability where the b rgo and the external cells of microcolonies on the surface of b rgo act as a barrier to protect internal cells ha et al 2009 in summary nbms exhibited superior mg degradation than both b rgo and free cells during the first 12 h the relative degradation efficiency for mg was 76 and 85 for b rgo and nbms respectively it was concluded that adsorption of mg onto the nbms plays an important role during the first 12 h and that b rgo can be practically used for the adsorption of mg the increased removal efficiency of mg using nbms compared to free cells was attributable to the mg initially being adsorbed onto b rgo and subsequently being degraded by burkholderia cepacia supported by the nbms cheng et al 2012 3 3 kinetics studies 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics the kinetics data for three initial mg concentrations were fit to both the first and second order kinetics models and the resulting best fit parameters are summarized in table 2 overall removal kinetics by nbms best fit the pseudo second order model r 1 2 0 980 which was consistently higher than the r 2 2 observed for fits to the pseudo first order model which were 0 648 additionally the calculated qe values 21 9 22 5 and 24 6 for the pseudo second order model were much closer to the experimental data 21 7 23 3 and 25 6 than the qe s obtained from fits to the pseudo first order model consistent with a previous analysis using immobilized cells for the biodegradation of highly concentrated phenolic water ma et al 2013 this suggested that the adsorption efficiency was more dependent on the availability of adsorption sites than on solution concentration of mg da silva lacerda et al 2015 in this study absorption capacity increased significantly with increasing initial mg concentration while the rate constant decreased from 6 9 10 3 to 1 2 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 this result suggested that as the concentration of mg increased the competition for active adsorption sites also increased and the adsorption process became slower cheng et al 2012 consistent with previous adsorption studies ahmad kumar 2010 as the initial mg concentration increased the value of qe rose from 21 9 to 24 6 mg g 1 due to the increased driving force of the concentration gradient 3 3 2 biodegradation kinetics investigation of the variation in biodegradation of mg by free cells and nbms with temperature showed that the time taken to degrade mg using nbms was quicker compared to free cells table 3 from analysis of the kinetics data for mg biodegradation it was concluded that mg degradation kinetics by both nbms and free cells was first order as evidenced by the high degree of linearity r2 0 99 obtained from a plot of ln c c0 versus time as the temperature increased from 25 to 35 c the degradation efficiency of free cells and nbms also increased from 0 86 to 1 35 mg l 1 h 1 and from 1 18 to 1 31 mg l 1 h 1 respectively however the values of the biodegradation efficiency constant k for nbms significantly decreased compared to that of free cells indicating that immobilization of burkholderia cepacia within nbms potentially provided a better thermally stable environment during storage and operation than for free cells wu et al 2009 a smaller half life t1 2 was obtained using nbms compared to free cells at all tested temperatures table 3 indicating that nbms was less sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature in summary consistent with previous research cheng et al 2012 comparison of the biodegradation efficiency constants k and half lives t1 2 of nbms and free cells suggested that the biodegradation of mg by nbms was much faster with a shorter half life 3 4 reusability and stability of the nbms the reusability of nbms was investigated to confirm its practical potential through 7 cycles of mg removal fig 7 during the first cycle the removal efficiency of mg by nbms was high at 97 7 and decreased only marginally with each cycle so that even after reusing nbms for 7 cycles of repeated batch experiments the removal efficiency was still relative high 93 6 thus it appears that physiological activity of the immobilized cells remained almost constant and close to the original activity even after the seventh cycle this material could thus maintain a high removal efficiency of more than 90 over an extended period this suggested that b rgo was an excellent cell carrier with multiple porosity providing enough space to support bacterial growth this result conclusively demonstrated that nbms have the potential to sustainably biologically remove mg 3 5 response surface methodology analysis 3 5 1 statistical analysis and analysis of variance the experimental design was previously detailed in table 1 and the of response surface method analysis are shown in table 4 across all experimental results the mg removal efficiency ranged from 0 to 99 7 the best fit of the data to a quadratic polynomial via regression analysis for the mg removal efficiency gave 8 y 53 79 0 580 a 7 540 b 2 775 c 473 550 d 0 022 ab 0 077 ac 2 022 ad 0 506 bc 11 964 bd 12 630 cd 3 063 e 003 a 2 0 136 b 2 2 255 c 2 3615 875 d 2 where the y is the concentration of mg removed a is the initial concentration b is temperature c is the ph and d is dosage the analysis of variance for the regression of predicted values is shown in table 4 the model f 6 45 and p 0 0001 values indicated that the model was a sufficiently good fit to explain mg removal efficiency as a function of just four system parameters in addition the lack of fit value was 2 45e 06 p 0 0001 which also implied that the regression equation described the relationship between response variables and the removal efficiency well the f values of b p 0 0050 d p 0 0045 bc p 0 0056 b2 p 0 0018 c2 p 0 0001 and d2 p 0 0236 were statistically significant the good fit of the regression equation r2 0 986 indicated that the four selected factors concentration temperature ph and dosage explained 98 6 of the experimental results and hence the regression model provided a good prediction of mg removal efficiency in water by nbms according to the model the effect of each factor on the removal of mg by nbms decreased in the order ph temperature dosage concentration the optimum adsorption conditions were ph 5 85 dosage 0 11 g l 1 temperature 31 5 c and an initial concentration 114 50 mg l 1 yielding an optimal removal rate for mg of 99 3 the results also showed that the interaction between ph and temperature had the most significant effect on the removal of mg by nbms this proves consistent with the results of anova table 5 3 5 2 effects of variable interaction on mg removal the response surface and contour plots examining the relationship between variables on mg removal efficiency are shown in fig 8 low temperature and ionic strength were not favorable for mg adsorption by nbms fig 8a greater amounts of mg were removed when the temperature increased and the initial concentrations ranged between 80 and 110 mg l 1 as shown in fig 8 b the removal of mg increased considerably when the ph was 6 and decreased considerably when the ph was 6 regardless of the concentration removal of mg increased with increasing nbms dosage and concentration fig 8c the removal rate of mg increased considerably when the ph was 6 and decreased considerably when the ph 6 regardless of dosage fig 8d more mg was removed at ph 6 when temperature ranged between 20 and 35 c fig 8e but declined with increasing ph above 6 when temperature ranged from 35 to 40 c the rate of mg removal also increased as dosage and temperature increased fig 8f 4 conclusions in this study a new nano biomaterial was successfully tested as a novel remediation agent for malachite green dye raman spectroscopy confirmed that go was successfully reduced by bagasse and that a new product b rgo was prepared the new material exhibited better mg degradability than that of free burkholderia cepacia cells which was attributable to mg being initially adsorbed onto b rgo and subsequently degraded by burkholderia cepacia immobilized in the nbms the adsorption of mg onto the nbms followed a pseudo second order kinetics model r2 0 99 which suggested that adsorption was more dependent on the availability of adsorption sites on the nbms than on the initial concentration of mg in solution biodegradation of mg using burkholderia cepacia immobilized on nbms also fitted well first order reaction kinetics sem analysis confirmed that burkholderia cepacia was immobilized on nbms the main degradation products were n n dimethylaniline and 4 dimethylamino benzophenone the best removal conditions for mg were 31 5 c at an initial mg concentration of 114 50 mg l 1 a ph of 5 85 and a nbms dosage of 0 11 g l 1 which removed 99 3 of mg thus this simple environmentally friendly low cost material is promising for the remediation of dyes from wastewaters acknowledgements this research was supported by the major project of fujian province china grant no 2015yz0001 1 the natural science foundation of fujian province china grant no 2016j01048

19267,the development of new biomaterials for the remove of organic contaminants from wastewater has attracted much attention over the few past years one of the most cost effective approaches is to produce new high value biomaterials from low value solid agricultural biowastes in this work sugarcane bagasse and agricultural waste rich in reducing sugars acted as both a green bioreductant for graphene oxide go and a sustainable supporter for the immobilization of burkholderia cepacia therefore this new biomaterial which contained both reduced graphene oxide rgo and burkholderia cepacia was cable of initial adsorption of malachite green mg and its subsequent biodegradation after 60 h immobilized burkholderia cepacia degraded more mg 98 5 than a cell cultured burkholderia cepacia 87 7 alone raman spectroscopy confirmed that go was successfully reduced by bagasse and that consequently a composite b rgo was prepared sem indicated that burkholderia cepacia was well immobilized and kinetics studies showed that the adsorption of mg onto the developed composite fitted a pseudo second order kinetics model r2 0 99 biodegradation of mg was confirmed by the detection of appropriate degradation products such as n n dimethylaniline and 4 dimethylamino benzophenone using gc ms uv and ft ir and via best fit first order biodegration kinetics furthermore a response surface methodology rsm was applied to the removal process by varying four independent parameters using a box behnken design bbd optimum mg removal 99 3 was achieved at 31 5 c with an initial mg concentration of 114 5 mg l 1 initial ph of 5 85 and an adsorbent dosage of 0 11 g l 1 the excellent removal efficiency indicated that agricultural waste derived reduced graphene oxide bio adsorbents have significant potential for the removal of dyes such as mg from industrial wastewaters keywords nano biomaterials sugarcane bagasse reduced graphene oxide malachite green 1 introduction since its discovery due to its unique physiochemical proprieties e g high conductivity high intrinsic mobility high chemical thermal stability allen et al 2010 li et al 2014 and high specific surface area mhamane et al 2011 graphene has been widely studied in many industrial applications including as biomedical sensors reinforced composites catalysts and super capacitors allen et al 2010 thakur and karak 2015 xie et al 2014 in addition while graphene can also be used in the environmental remediation sectors for contaminant removal it does have some limitations including acting as a secondary source of pollution requiring some reprocessing after adsorption and is also generally not effective at removing low concentrations of persistent organic pollutants pops badmus et al 2018 chaukura et al 2016 li et al 2017b in addition most current methods for synthesizing graphene tend to be expensive and use a variety of toxic chemicals therefore our goal was to develop a low cost pollution free and environmentally friendly sustainable method for the preparation of nanoscale rgo sheets using a waste biomass to improve these current deficiencies while biodegradation is one of the traditional techniques to remove organic contaminants it also has certain flaws for example planktonic microorganisms commonly used for contaminant biodegradation are often limited by cell growth cell separation and sensitivity to environmental factors such as fluctuations in the influent quality and component concentrations of the waste streams to be treated gao et al 2011 however some of these problems may be overcome by combining graphene adsorption and biodegradation technology in one novel material bagasse is a major abundant and renewable agricultural waste that has not as yet been effectively reused sugarcane bagasse b is one of the main agricultural bagasse and is mainly composed of hemicellulose 25 35 lignin 15 35 and cellulose 40 45 gnansounou 2010 some researchers have already successfully used bagasse lin et al 2015 as an immobilization material for microorganisms extending this preliminary work the hypothesis of this paper is that bagasse can also be used as both a fibrous carbon adsorbent for pollutants as a natural reducing agent to produce reduced graphene oxide rgo and as a microbial nutrient source fabrication of such composite materials has the advantage that both adsorption and degradation of contaminants can be carried out simultaneously thus overcoming some of the limitations experienced when applying individual adsorption and biodegradation in isolation this combined approach also the significant advantage of also providing a feasible reuse option for a variety of solid waste resources malachite green mg is a triphenylmethane dye that is used extensively in the textile and fish farming industries as a biocide mg is toxic to humans affecting both the immune and reproductive systems lv et al 2013 mg is also toxic to freshwater fish following either acute or chronic exposure lee and kim 2012 saha et al 2012 therefore to protect environmental and human health it is critical to establish efficient methods to remove mg from waste streams bioremediation is currently the most commonly adopted method for dye remediation where the main microorganisms which have been reported to successfully degrade triphenylmethane dyes include white rot fungi actinomycetes and algae in contrast there are relatively few reports of bacterial degradation however burkholderia cepacia are a nutritionally diverse bacterial organism that can grow successfully in diverse environments and therefore in this paper burkholderia cepacia was evaluated for the first time for its potential to degrade mg thus the overall goal of this study was to develop a new functional material which contained nanoscale rgo sheets which was produced via a simple low cost and environmentally friendly synthetic route and which allowed for incorporation of a microbiological mg dye degradation agent such a functionalized material would have several advantages firstly rgo has good toughness and biocompatibility and can both strengthen bagasse and provide a surface for loading of microorganisms secondly in the long term even when bagasse is decomposed dispersed rgo can still provide a stable platform for supporting microorganisms thirdly sugarcane bagasse is also a natural biomass with excellent biocompatibility and is harmless to the bacteria sugarcane bagasse is also rich in nutrients and can act as both a carbon and nitrogen source to support microorganisms to our knowledge there are no reports of immobilization of burkholderia cepacia on bagasse reduced graphene oxide b rgo for the removal of mg and this is the first report of applying this novel technique to the degradation of mg therefore the objectives of this study were progressed in a series of structured steps firstly the appearance and morphology of the sample were studied using a scanning electron microscope sem secondly the degradation of malachite green products by nano biomaterils nbms was analyzed by ultraviolet visible uv fourier transform infrared ft ir and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms finally the obtained kinetic data for nbms removal of mg were fit to appropriate kinetic models and response surface methodology was used to optimize the removal of mg by nbms and a mechanism for removal of mg by nbms was proposed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and cultures a graphene oxide go aqueous suspension was prepared using the modified hummer s method li et al 2017a graphite powder 8000 mesh purity 99 95 and malachite green mg molecular weight 364 92 purity 99 95 were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china sugarcane bagasse was purchased locally from a market in fuzhou china all other inorganic and organic chemicals were of analytical grade cell suspensions were cultured in a liquid medium lb containing g l 1 peptone 10 yeast extract

rpm for 10 min the supernatant removed and diluted with sterile phosphate buffered solution until the concentration of the cell suspension reached 0 7 au uv visible at 600 nm 2 2 preparation of nano biomaterials nbms 2 2 1 preparation of sugarcane bagasse sugarcane bagasse was initially washed with deionized water three times before drying at 60 c in oven for 24 h and grinding into a fine homogeneous powder an aqueous solution 400 ml containing sugarcane bagasse powder 4 g and sulfuric acid 300 μl was heated at 60 c for 5 h before cooling to room temperature and stored at 4 c 2 2 2 preparation of the sugarcane bagasse reduced graphene oxide b rgo a standard procedure was used to convert go to b rgo li et al 2018 briefly dried go 300 mg was dispersed in di water 600 ml and the solution was exfoliated by an ultrasonicator for 30 min in general the presence of hydrophilic functional groups at the edges and basal planes of go makes dispersion in water relatively easy li et al 2018 thus sonication led to a very fine dispersion of go nanosheets subsequently an aqueous solution of the sugarcane bagasse 4 g per 400 ml as prepared in section 2 2 1 was added to the suspension and ammonia 600 μl was added to the mixture and then stirred for 12 h at 95 c in the sugarcane bagasse extract fructose can be readily transformed into reducing sugars because ketoenol tautomerism occurs in the presence of base i e the ammonia solution zhu et al 2010 the resultant mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min and the precipitate collected and vacuum lyophilized for 48 h to produce a solid material b rgo 2 2 3 preparation of nano biomaterials nbms in brief the b rgo prepared in section 2 2 2 was washed with distilled water three times and dried in an oven at 105 c for 6

spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa potassium bromide was dried at 240 c for 12 h prior to combining with samples and the background peaks associated with any residual water and carbon dioxide were subtracted during the test using kbr blanks to determine any potential intermediate products resulting from mg degradation samples 25 ml were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 min to remove the adsorbent and the supernatant solution was extracted twice with ethyl acetate 10 ml in triplicate the extracts were then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to a 1 ml for gc ms analysis intermediate and degradation products of mg were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms focus gc and dsq ii ms using a db 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 m id 0 25 μm the column temperature was programmed to ramp from 100 to 280 c at 8 c min 1 and to hold for 15 min at 290 c carrier gas helium flow rate was 1 ml min 1 where injector and detector temperatures were 250 and 280 c respectively analysis of the intermediate products was carried out in electron impact ei mode 70 ev and at full scan 2 4 removal experiments nbms degradation of mg was conducted as follows firstly a 1 5 v v suspension of cells od600 0 7 and b rgo 0 5 g were aseptically inoculated into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing msm 50 ml and an aqueous mg solution 100 mg l 1 triplicate samples were then agitated at 150 rpm on a reciprocating shaker at 30 c for 96 h in the removal experiment the nbms were initially washed with sterile water three times and subsequently again with msm three times to remove free cells control samples consisted of msm 50 ml containing b 0 5 g b rgo 0 5 g and free cells 1 5 v v in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask a separate biodegradation experiment was conducted to assess nbms reusability as follows nbms were washed sequentially with distilled water and msm the mg removal quantity q and efficiency e were calculated using the following two equations 1 q c 0 c t v m 2 w c 0 c t c 0 100 where q is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 w is the removal efficiency c0 and ct are respectively the solution concentrations of mg at time zero initial and at time t mg l 1 v is the volume of solution l and m is the quality of nbms added g 2 5 removal kinetics the aqueous adsorption of mg by nbms was fit to either pseudo first order equation 3 or pseudo second order equation 4 kinetics balarak et al 2015 3 ln q e q t lnq e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe is the amount of mg adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 qt is the amount of mg adsorbed at time t mg

model equation 5 is often used to describe the biodegradation of dyes 5 ln c c 0 kt where c is the concentration of mg dye mg l 1 at time t h k is the biodegradation rate constant h 1 the half life for biodegradation of mg can then be expressed as 6 t 1 2 ln 2 k 2 6 mg removal using response surface methodology response surface methodology rsm experiments were designed and analyzed using the design expert software version 8 0 6 and box behnken design bbd the experiment set comprised four factors concentration a temperature b ph c and dosage d each at three levels 1 0 1 table 1 experimental data were fitted to a quadratic polynomial model to obtain optimal regression coefficients the non linear generated quadratic model used in the response surface was as described by equation 7 dastkhoon et al 2017 kumar gupta et al 2017 7 y b 0 i 1 n b i x i i 1 n b ii x i 2 i 1 n b ij x i x j ε where y is mg adsorption efficiency b0 is the model coefficient bi is the linear coefficient bii is the quadratic coefficient bij is the interaction coefficient xj are the independent variables in coded levels n is the number of independent variables and ε is the model error analysis of variance anova was used to assess the significance and adequacy of the regression model the model s fitness was evaluated via examination of the correlation coefficient r2 and statistical significance was confirmed using the f test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 sem images sem analysis revealed that the sugarcane bagasse contained porous structures which could provide spaces for storing substrates to metabolize microorganisms fig 1 a based on previous studies li et al 2018 we have proven that the yellow box in fig 1b marks the reduced graphene oxide rgo during go reduction since the reducing sugar in the sugarcane bagasse acts as both a reducing agent and a stabilizer the oxygen containing functional groups hydroxyl epoxy and carboxyl groups of go are effectively removed via scheme 1 this reaction has previously been confirmed using various characterization techniques li et al 2018 the indigo blue boxes in fig 1a and b were the aqueous solution states of bagasse and b rgo respectively in combination with fig 1d it can be proved that rgo was dispersed on bagasse b rgo clearly contained numerous porous and fold structures fig 1b which could both physically stengthen sugarcane bagasse and simultaneously provide living spaces to protect microorganisms and prevent their external environmental poisoning the surface morphology of burkholderia cepacia on the b rgo fig 1c and d indicates short rod shaped cells approximately 1 μm 2 μm and confirms that burkholderia cepacia was successfully immobilized onto the internal and external walls of the large pores and folded structures of b rgo compared with fig 1c after mg degradation burkholderia cepacia shown in fig 1d on the surface of b rgo were poisoned by external adverse conditions causing a morphology deformations the efficiency of removal of mg by nbms was faster than that of planktonic cells alone due to the larger specific surface area higher adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity of b rgo microbial immobilization has also been reported to protect cells from the environmental changes and toxicity of contaminants hsieh et al 2008 thus the stable microenvironment of the pores can protect the immobilized cells from adverse environmental factors hou et al 2013 bacteria attached to b rgo particles were unevenly distributed with some cells clustering and others spreading we speculated that the attachment of microbial cells includes interaction between cells and b rgo and adhesion between b rgo and the extracellular secretion of cells lin et al 2010 3 1 2 raman spectroscopy in raman spectroscopy two main characteristic peaks have been used to identify the structure of graphene akhavan et al 2012 the d peak close to 1350 cm 1 and the g peak close to 1580 cm 1 as shown in fig 2 the raman spectrum of go resulted in a broad g peak at 1612 cm 1 corresponding to the in phase vibration of the graphite oxide lattice and the d band at 1356 cm 1 while the raman spectrum of b rgo is similar to go there are subtle but significant changes the intensity ratio id ig has previously been used as an indicator for identifying the size of the sp2 domain carbon structures containing sp3 and sp2 bonds akhavan et al 2012 and was applied here fig 2 shows that the id ig ratio for b rgo 1 32 which is significantly higher than the id ig ratio observed for go 0 86 indicating that in b rgo the graphene sheets are disordered and the size of the in plane sp2 domain decreases following reduction at the same time this result confirmed that the reduction of go led to fragmentation and produced many different sizes of rgo domains shen et al 2012 3 1 3 uv spectra the uv visible spectra of mg before and after treatment with nbms is shown in fig 3 the characteristic mg peak peak 4 at 617 nm λ max for mg disappeared gradually when incubated with burkholderia cepacia as did the two peaks at 318 and 425 nm at the same time small peaks appeared at 230 nm peak 1 and 257 nm peak 2 which increased in height as incubation time increased simultaneously a significant spectral band that likely represented a new metabolite with an absorption maximum at 375 nm peak 3 emerged therefore the decolorization of mg in the present study is attributed to degradation conjugated polycyclic aromatic compounds are known to have strong auxochromic moieties that appear at longer wavelengths than the band position of single benzene derivatives therefore it was speculated that peak 1 and peak 2 were generated by the vibrations of single benzene ring and that peak 3 was attributed to the vibrations from a conjugated polycyclic aromatic structure in support of this assignment ju et al 2009 had previously reported that 4 dimethylaminobenzophenone dlbp was one of the major products produced by the attack on the mg central carbon which has a significant absorbance at 360 nm and is therefore likely to support the assignment of peak 3 as being due to dlbp 3 1 4 ft ir spectra the variation in peaks of the fingerprint region 4000 400 cm 1 of the ft ir spectra of mg and its treatment products before and after treatment with nbms is depicted in fig 4 the ft ir spectra shows that following treatment with nbms new peaks appeared at 3734 cm 1 associated with oh stretching vibrations indicating the formation of hydroxylated metabolites together with peaks at 3417 cm 1 corresponding to stretching vibrations of nh2 groups peaks at 1628 cm 1 and 1385 cm 1 were attributed to nh or cn stretching vibrations in amine groups in addition the small peak at 1718 cm 1 was attributed to co stretching of ketones moreover new peaks at 1076 cm 1 cc and 542 cm 1 poc or pop were used to infer bacterial secretions therefore overall the results of ft ir analysis indicated that the main functional groups of mg metabolites included oh co and nh2 however while suggestive of dye gradation ft ir is not sensitive enough to identify specific metabolites and thus gc analysis was undertaken 3 1 5 gc ms applying an identification program from the nist library to the gc ms analysis of mg and its products after complete degradation identified three possible metabolites fig 5 the parent peak associated with mg eluted at 25 6 min and gradually degraded into infinitesimal quantities the incubation experiment progressed the first new metabolite peak eluting at 6 5 min was identified as n n dimethylaniline while a second metabolite peak eluting at 20 9 min was identified as 4 dimethylamino benzophenone abbreviation 4 dlbp these two metabolites detected by gc ms most likely result from the cleavage of the entire conjugated chromophore leading to aminobenzene derivatives in comparison saquib and muneer 2003 described the detection of 4 aminobenzoic acid and n methylaniline following the photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet via gc ms analysis signifying that different chemical bond breaking dispositions due to different strategies can lead to the differential accumulation of compounds 3 2 degradation of mg by b b rgo free cells and nbms the removal efficiency of mg by b rgo was 76 1 fig 6 which was significantly higher than the removal efficiency of sugarcane bagasse alone 54 2 this result indicated that b rgo was more suitable for mg removal than sugarcane bagasse in isolation after reacting for 60 h the highest mg removal efficiency 99 3 was achieved by nbms compared to only 87 7 mg degradation by free cells alone fig 6 this indicated that the free cells were capable of effectively degrading mg with more than 93 6 of mg being degraded by free cells alone within 96 h at ph 5 5 and 30 c after a short adaptation period fig 6 in comparison to nbms only 82 3 of mg was removed by b rgo and the adsorption of mg onto the b rgo reached equilibrium within 12 h fig 6 this indicated that while b rgo was an effective adsorbent for removing mg from aqueous medium it was not as good as nbms alone this was attributed to mg adsorbing onto b rgo using electrostatic interactions between mg and the surfaces of b rgo which had a constant negative charge the degradation efficiency of mg using nbms was higher than that of free cells in the first 48 h indicating that in agreement with other studies of immobilized cells for the dye degradation cheng et al 2012 that immobilizing cells on b rgo significantly improves mg degradation however in this study b rgo had a porous folded structure allowing both substrate and oxygen to diffuse into the internal pores while retaining high mechanical strength this consequently allowed for the b rgo component of the nbms to increase the stability of the microbial system and maintain a higher level of mg degradation compared to free cells alone it was also evident that b rgo could alter cell physiology and increase cell membrane permeability where the b rgo and the external cells of microcolonies on the surface of b rgo act as a barrier to protect internal cells ha et al 2009 in summary nbms exhibited superior mg degradation than both b rgo and free cells during the first 12 h the relative degradation efficiency for mg was 76 and 85 for b rgo and nbms respectively it was concluded that adsorption of mg onto the nbms plays an important role during the first 12 h and that b rgo can be practically used for the adsorption of mg the increased removal efficiency of mg using nbms compared to free cells was attributable to the mg initially being adsorbed onto b rgo and subsequently being degraded by burkholderia cepacia supported by the nbms cheng et al 2012 3 3 kinetics studies 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics the kinetics data for three initial mg concentrations were fit to both the first and second order kinetics models and the resulting best fit parameters are summarized in table 2 overall removal kinetics by nbms best fit the pseudo second order model r 1 2 0 980 which was consistently higher than the r 2 2 observed for fits to the pseudo first order model which were 0 648 additionally the calculated qe values 21 9 22 5 and 24 6 for the pseudo second order model were much closer to the experimental data 21 7 23 3 and 25 6 than the qe s obtained from fits to the pseudo first order model consistent with a previous analysis using immobilized cells for the biodegradation of highly concentrated phenolic water ma et al 2013 this suggested that the adsorption efficiency was more dependent on the availability of adsorption sites than on solution concentration of mg da silva lacerda et al 2015 in this study absorption capacity increased significantly with increasing initial mg concentration while the rate constant decreased from 6 9 10 3 to 1 2 10 3 g mg 1 min 1 this result suggested that as the concentration of mg increased the competition for active adsorption sites also increased and the adsorption process became slower cheng et al 2012 consistent with previous adsorption studies ahmad kumar 2010 as the initial mg concentration increased the value of qe rose from 21 9 to 24 6 mg g 1 due to the increased driving force of the concentration gradient 3 3 2 biodegradation kinetics investigation of the variation in biodegradation of mg by free cells and nbms with temperature showed that the time taken to degrade mg using nbms was quicker compared to free cells table 3 from analysis of the kinetics data for mg biodegradation it was concluded that mg degradation kinetics by both nbms and free cells was first order as evidenced by the high degree of linearity r2 0 99 obtained from a plot of ln c c0 versus time as the temperature increased from 25 to 35 c the degradation efficiency of free cells and nbms also increased from 0 86 to 1 35 mg l 1 h 1 and from 1 18 to 1 31 mg l 1 h 1 respectively however the values of the biodegradation efficiency constant k for nbms significantly decreased compared to that of free cells indicating that immobilization of burkholderia cepacia within nbms potentially provided a better thermally stable environment during storage and operation than for free cells wu et al 2009 a smaller half life t1 2 was obtained using nbms compared to free cells at all tested temperatures table 3 indicating that nbms was less sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature in summary consistent with previous research cheng et al 2012 comparison of the biodegradation efficiency constants k and half lives t1 2 of nbms and free cells suggested that the biodegradation of mg by nbms was much faster with a shorter half life 3 4 reusability and stability of the nbms the reusability of nbms was investigated to confirm its practical potential through 7 cycles of mg removal fig 7 during the first cycle the removal efficiency of mg by nbms was high at 97 7 and decreased only marginally with each cycle so that even after reusing nbms for 7 cycles of repeated batch experiments the removal efficiency was still relative high 93 6 thus it appears that physiological activity of the immobilized cells remained almost constant and close to the original activity even after the seventh cycle this material could thus maintain a high removal efficiency of more than 90 over an extended period this suggested that b rgo was an excellent cell carrier with multiple porosity providing enough space to support bacterial growth this result conclusively demonstrated that nbms have the potential to sustainably biologically remove mg 3 5 response surface methodology analysis 3 5 1 statistical analysis and analysis of variance the experimental design was previously detailed in table 1 and the of response surface method analysis are shown in table 4 across all experimental results the mg removal efficiency ranged from 0 to 99 7 the best fit of the data to a quadratic polynomial via regression analysis for the mg removal efficiency gave 8 y 53 79 0 580 a 7 540 b 2 775 c 473 550 d 0 022 ab 0 077 ac 2 022 ad 0 506 bc 11 964 bd 12 630 cd 3 063 e 003 a 2 0 136 b 2 2 255 c 2 3615 875 d 2 where the y is the concentration of mg removed a is the initial concentration b is temperature c is the ph and d is dosage the analysis of variance for the regression of predicted values is shown in table 4 the model f 6 45 and p 0 0001 values indicated that the model was a sufficiently good fit to explain mg removal efficiency as a function of just four system parameters in addition the lack of fit value was 2 45e 06 p 0 0001 which also implied that the regression equation described the relationship between response variables and the removal efficiency well the f values of b p 0 0050 d p 0 0045 bc p 0 0056 b2 p 0 0018 c2 p 0 0001 and d2 p 0 0236 were statistically significant the good fit of the regression equation r2 0 986 indicated that the four selected factors concentration temperature ph and dosage explained 98 6 of the experimental results and hence the regression model provided a good prediction of mg removal efficiency in water by nbms according to the model the effect of each factor on the removal of mg by nbms decreased in the order ph temperature dosage concentration the optimum adsorption conditions were ph 5 85 dosage 0 11 g l 1 temperature 31 5 c and an initial concentration 114 50 mg l 1 yielding an optimal removal rate for mg of 99 3 the results also showed that the interaction between ph and temperature had the most significant effect on the removal of mg by nbms this proves consistent with the results of anova table 5 3 5 2 effects of variable interaction on mg removal the response surface and contour plots examining the relationship between variables on mg removal efficiency are shown in fig 8 low temperature and ionic strength were not favorable for mg adsorption by nbms fig 8a greater amounts of mg were removed when the temperature increased and the initial concentrations ranged between 80 and 110 mg l 1 as shown in fig 8 b the removal of mg increased considerably when the ph was 6 and decreased considerably when the ph was 6 regardless of the concentration removal of mg increased with increasing nbms dosage and concentration fig 8c the removal rate of mg increased considerably when the ph was 6 and decreased considerably when the ph 6 regardless of dosage fig 8d more mg was removed at ph 6 when temperature ranged between 20 and 35 c fig 8e but declined with increasing ph above 6 when temperature ranged from 35 to 40 c the rate of mg removal also increased as dosage and temperature increased fig 8f 4 conclusions in this study a new nano biomaterial was successfully tested as a novel remediation agent for malachite green dye raman spectroscopy confirmed that go was successfully reduced by bagasse and that a new product b rgo was prepared the new material exhibited better mg degradability than that of free burkholderia cepacia cells which was attributable to mg being initially adsorbed onto b rgo and subsequently degraded by burkholderia cepacia immobilized in the nbms the adsorption of mg onto the nbms followed a pseudo second order kinetics model r2 0 99 which suggested that adsorption was more dependent on the availability of adsorption sites on the nbms than on the initial concentration of mg in solution biodegradation of mg using burkholderia cepacia immobilized on nbms also fitted well first order reaction kinetics sem analysis confirmed that burkholderia cepacia was immobilized on nbms the main degradation products were n n dimethylaniline and 4 dimethylamino benzophenone the best removal conditions for mg were 31 5 c at an initial mg concentration of 114 50 mg l 1 a ph of 5 85 and a nbms dosage of 0 11 g l 1 which removed 99 3 of mg thus this simple environmentally friendly low cost material is promising for the remediation of dyes from wastewaters acknowledgements this research was supported by the major project of fujian province china grant no 2015yz0001 1 the natural science foundation of fujian province china grant no 2016j01048

19268,the removal and fate of contaminants of emerging concern cecs in water treatment systems is of interest given the widespread occurrence of cecs in water supplies and increase in direct potable reuse of wastewater in this study cec removal was investigated in pilot scale biologically active granular activated carbon gac sand and anthracite sand filters under different hydraulic loading rates and influent cec concentrations over a 15 month period eight of the most commonly detected compounds in a survey of cec occurrence in drinking water were selected for this study atenolol atrazine carbamazepine fluoxetine gemfibrozil metolachlor sulfamethoxazole and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep gac sand biofilters provided superior cec removal for all compounds mean removal efficiencies 49 1 94 4 compared to anthracite sand biofilters mean removal efficiencies 0 66 1 due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation adsorption was determined to be the dominant removal mechanism for most selected cecs except fluoxetine which had the greatest biodegradation rate constant 0 93 0 15 min 1 at 20 28 c the mean removal efficiency decreased by 16 5 when the loading rate increased from 2 to 4 gpm ft2 4 88 9 76 m h a significant reduction in cec removal was observed after 100 000 bed volumes when the influent cec concentration was low 100 200 ng l whereas no significant reduction was observed during spike dosing 1000 3000 ng l a regression analysis suggested that biodegradation rate hydraulic loading rate influent cec concentration throughput influent dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and cec charge are important parameters for predicting cec removal performance in gac sand biofilters graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular activated carbon anthracite trace organic contaminants drinking water treatment hydraulic loading rate throughput 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs include a wide variety of chemical classes such as insecticides and herbicides pharmaceuticals and personal care products and industrial and commercial chemicals based on a survey by benotti et al 2009 at least one cec was detected in the source water of nineteen different u s drinking water utilities serving more than 28 million people the cecs are present in source waters due to agricultural activity industrial effluents urban runoff and municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents it is not desirable to have these biologically active compounds present in finished drinking water because there are possible adverse effects on human health and negative consequences in terms of public perception biofiltration a process in which granular media filters are inhabited by viable bacteria has been used for water treatment since the 1800s collins et al 1992 innovative engineering is not required to establish a biofilter because most granular media filters are presumed to be biologically active regardless of upstream disinfection previous studies demonstrated that biofilters not only effectively remove particles but also remove a wide range of dissolved contaminants including ozonation byproducts hozalski et al 1995 melin and ødegaard 2000 halogenated disinfection byproducts e g haloacetic acids zhang et al 2009 geosmin ho et al 2007 scharf et al 2010 and methylisoborneol ho et al 2007 certainly biodegradation alone may not be able to treat all dissolved contaminants because some compounds may be recalcitrant or biodegrade at a rate too slow to affect the cec concentration in the short hydraulic residence time of a rapid biofilter thus biological treatment in a granular activated carbon gac filter is advantageous in that it provides the dual benefit of sorption and biodegradation furthermore biological activity has been shown to substantially increase gac bed life for some compounds such as geosmin scharf et al 2010 there are a few reports in the literature concerning the removal of cecs by drinking water treatment biofilters snyder et al 2007 zearley and summers 2012 kennedy et al 2015 hallé et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 conventional sand or anthracite sand biofilters can achieve 50 80 removal for biodegradable compounds but little or no removal for compounds that typically are persistent in the environment e g atrazine and carbamazepine zearley and summers 2012 hallé et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 gac biofilters however provided more than 90 removal of atrazine and carbamazepine over the first 200 days of operation kennedy et al 2015 despite this prior work there are several important knowledge gaps including 1 the relative roles of sorption and biodegradation in cec removal by gac sand biofilters and 2 the performance of biofilters when operated for both filtration and cec removal over a wide range of conditions including different empty bed contact times ebcts and or influent cec concentrations in this study six pilot scale biofilters three with gac sand and three with anthracite sand were operated in parallel for 15 months at a full scale water treatment plant to 1 evaluate the cec removal performance of gac sand biofilters 2 determine the relative contributions of sorption and biodegradation and 3 assess the influence of operational conditions including hydraulic loading rate or ebct influent cecs concentration and throughput 2 methods 2 1 pilot scale biofiltration system design and operation a pilot scale biofiltration system fig 1 was constructed at the minneapolis water treatment and distribution services mwtds fridley facility in fridley minnesota usa mwtds provides 57 million gallons per day 215 000 m 3 day of water to nearly a half million customers in the city of minneapolis and neighboring suburban communities the fridley facility treats the water by lime softening with coagulant addition flocculation primary sedimentation recarbonation secondary sedimentation and anthracite sand filtration water from the full scale recarbonation chambers was used as the feed water for the pilot plant fig 1 the ph of the water was adjusted to 8 5 using hydrochloric acid and then ferric chloride was added as the primary coagulant at a dose of 2 mg l as fe the water was settled for 1 2 h depending on the loading rate and then spiked with cecs before entering the biofilter columns although eight biofilter columns were operated in parallel only six biofilter columns are relevant for this manuscript because the feed water to other two was not dosed with cecs each column was constructed from polycarbonate tubes id 3 75 inches 9 53 cm total height 144 inches 3 66 m three columns were packed with 20 inches 0 51 m of gac calgon f300 over 10 inches 0 25 m of sand and three columns were packed with 20 inches 0 51 m of anthracite over 10 inches 0 25 m of sand the three anthracite sand biofilter columns served as non sorptive controls the pilot scale biofiltration system was operated for 15 months from october 2015 to january 2017 the water temperature was not controlled and ranged from 3 to 28 c the filters were operated at hydraulic loading rates of 2 or 4 gpm ft2 4 88 or 9 76 m h which provided 8 4 min or 4 2 min of empty bed contact time ebct respectively backwash was performed when the headloss was above 90 of the maximum value permitted by the system 60 inches 1 53 m the columns were backwashed using 1 3 scfm 36 8 l min of air for 5 min followed by 10 min of water wash at 15 gpm ft2 36 66 m h to achieve a 30 bed expansion environmentally relevant amounts of cecs 100 200 ng l were continuously dosed into the influent water using a syringe pump ne 1600 new era pump systems inc farmingdale ny for most of the 15 month period the biofilters also were challenged periodically with sudden increases in cecs concentrations 1000 3000 ng

eight different sets of conditions were repeated for a total of fourteen sampling periods throughout the experiment with two sampling events per period the same columns were used continuously throughout the study and exposed to the different conditions sequentially as described in table 1 a total of 616 samples were collected for cecs analysis over the entire course of the study biofilter influent water samples were collected daily during weekdays and analyzed for temperature and ph biofilter influent and effluent water samples were collected weekly for analysis of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration biofilter media samples were collected monthly from the top layer of the biofilters for analysis of microbial activity 2 2 cecs eight cecs were selected for this study atenolol atrazine carbamazepine fluoxetine gemfibrozil metolachlor sulfamethoxazole and tris 2 chloroethly phosphate tcep details concerning the supplier and purity of each compound are provided in the supplementary material table s2 these cecs were selected because they have been detected frequently in finished drinking water benotti et al 2009 and because they represent a wide range of uses and chemical characteristics aerobic biodegradation probabilities of the selected cecs were computed based on chemical structure using the miti model tunkel et al 2000 in biowin6 the properties of the selected cecs are summarized in table 2 2 3 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were performed to determine the gac sorption capacities for the cecs according to the procedure of graham et al 2000 briefly pre combusted amber glass bottles were filled with 500 ml of carbonate buffered 0 1 m ultrapure water ph 8 5 and then spiked with a cocktail of the target cecs 2 mg l each ground and sieved 65 mesh activated carbon ac media was added into the bottles 0 312 5 mg ac l to initiate the adsorption experiment the initial and equilibrium aqueous cec concentrations were measured via high performance liquid chromatography hplc with uv vis detection except for tcep where liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms was used additional batch experiments were performed in a similar manner but with mississippi river natural organic matter nom international humic substances society added the detailed experimental procedures and analytical methods are provided in the supplementary material the data from the batch sorption tests were fit to the langmuir isotherm model using non linear regression ibm spss statistics 22 when the aqueous concentration

effluent water samples was determined according to epa method 415 3 american public health association 1998 to assess microbial activity levels on the filter media the adenosine triphosphate atp concentration was determined immediately after sample collection using luminultra test kits according to the manufacturer s instructions for measurement of cecs quadruplicate influent water samples and triplicate effluent samples 500 ml each from each biofilter column were collected in pre combusted amber glass bottles and transported on ice to the laboratory upon arrival all samples were filtered through glass fiber filters 0 7 μm acidified to ph 2 0 with sulfuric acid and then spiked with eight surrogate compounds table s2 each at a concentration of 10 ng l to verify the relative recovery one influent and one effluent water sample from each column were spiked with 200 ng l cecs as a matrix spike then all samples were subjected to solid phase extraction spe using 500 mg oasis

biocatalysis biodegradation database pathway prediction system gao et al 2009 was attempted using ion trap mass spectrometry following the protocol of helbling et al 2010 2 5 data analysis biodegradation rate constants were calculated by assuming the biofilter column is a plug flow reactor and the biodegradation kinetics were pseudo first order according to eq 2 2 k b i o 1 t ln c e f f c i n f where k bio is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 t ε e b c t is the hydraulic residence time min ε 0 37 filter bed porosity c eff is the filter effluent cec concentration ng l and c inf is the filter influent cec concentration ng l the cumulative absorbent phase concentration q c for each cec on the gac media was calculated to assess the extent of bed capacity utilized over time because atp concentrations on the filter media were similar for the gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters fig s1 the contribution of biodegradation to cec removal within the gac sand biofilters was assumed to be the same as in the anthracite sand biofilters thus q c was calculated by subtracting cecs removal in the anthracite sand biofilters from the mass removed in the gac sand biofilters according to the approach of scharf et al 2010 3 q c q c i n f c e f f g a c c i n f c e f f a n t h t m g a c where q c is the cumulative cec concentration on the gac media ng cec g gac q is the flow

anthracite sand biofilter effluent cec concentration t is the biofilter operating time since cec dosing began min the maximum sorption capacity of the gac media in the biofilters q e was computed by inputting the biofilter influent cec concentration into the sorption isotherm equation eq 1 for each cec q e k d c i n f the value of q c q e was computed to represent the fraction of occupied sorption sites on the gac media in the biofilters the software program addesigns mertz et al 1994 based on the pore and surface diffusion model psdm was used to simulate the removal of cecs due to adsorption in the gac sand biofilters over the course of the experiment the isotherm parameters for the simulation were determined from the batch sorption experiments other parameters for the simulation were determined following addesigns manual recommendations mertz et al 1994 the statistical software ibm spss statistics 22 was used to perform all statistical analyses paired and unpaired one tailed two sample t tests were used to determine if the effects of hydraulic loading rate and throughput were statistically significant a one tailed one sample t test was used to determine if the mean of k bio was significantly greater than zero pearson s correlation test was used to determine if a statistically significant correlation existed between k bio and biowin6 2 6 multiple linear regression analysis a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to develop an empirical relationship between gac sand biofilter performance and parameters that were likely to affect cecs removal a total of 220 cecs removal efficiency values were used in the analysis 14 sampling periods 2 sampling events per period 8 different cecs analyzed per sample four removal efficiencies were excluded due to poor surrogate recovery operational and environmental factors that were likely to have a significant effect on cecs removal according to the literature ridder et al 2011 summers et al

3 1 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were performed to determine the sorption capacity of the gac media no significant reduction of any of the selected cecs was observed in control bottles without gac after 5 days of incubation in buffered di water ph 8 5 at room temperature data not shown suggesting that the selected compounds have low or negligible hydrolysis rates the data from the batch sorption tests in buffered ultrapure water ph 8 5 at room temperature 23 c were fit to the langmuir isotherm model and the isotherm parameters are summarized in table 3 similar results were obtained for experiments in which the water also contained 5 0 ppm as c of mississippi river nom table s3 3 2 cecs removal performance of the anthracite sand biofilters the selected cecs have negligible hydrolysis rates hence cecs removal in the anthracite sand biofilters is attributed solely due to biodegradation the removal efficiencies of three selected cecs carbamazepine metolachlor and fluoxetine in the anthracite sand biofilters for all sampling periods are shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies for the remaining cecs are shown in the supplementary material fig s2 among the eight cecs fluoxetine had the highest removal over the entire course of the experiment ranging from 13 3 to 62 8 at low temperature 3 10 c and from 49 2 to 97 3 at high temperature 20 28 c these results suggest that conventional biologically active anthracite sand filters are an effective method to remove fluoxetine in drinking water treatment low to moderate biodegradation of metolachlor atenolol gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole 10 50 was also observed in the anthracite sand biofilters but only at high temperature 20 28 c no significant removal of atrazine carbamazepine and tcep was observed in the anthracite sand biofilters over the entire course of the experiment indicating that these compounds are recalcitrant to biodegradation in this system the k bio values are summarized in table 4 for both high temperature and low temperature conditions fluoxetine was the only cec with a k bio value significantly greater than zero p 2 47 10 3 for the low temperature condition 3 10 c as expected at high temperature 20 28 c the k bio values of the cecs 0 05 0 03 to 0 93 0 15 min 1 were greater than those at low temperature table 4 no significant correlation p 0 617 was observed between biowin6 predictions and k bio suggesting that this structure activity based model is not a useful predictor of cecs biodegradation in biofilters preliminary work using ion trap mass spectrometry was performed to detect possible biodegradation products but the results were inconclusive partly due to a high background signal attributed to matrix interferences 3 3 cecs removal performance of the gac sand biofilters the eight selected cecs in the gac sand biofilters were moderately to effectively removed over the entire course of the experiment with mean standard deviation removals ranging from 49 1 27 7 to 94 4 7 0 the removal efficiencies of three selected cecs carbamazepine metolachlor and fluoxetine in the gac sand biofilters throughout all sampling periods are shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies over time for the remaining cecs atenolol atrazine gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole and tcep are shown in fig s2 for all selected cecs gac sand biofilters provided superior removal compared to anthracite sand biofilters due to the dual function of adsorption and biodegradation the biofilters were fed with water from full scale recarbonation chambers which contained 2 95 8 20 ppm doc during the course of the study fig s3 removal of doc in the gac sand biofilters was initially 15 22 but stabilized at 1 5 after 4 months of operation fig s3 suggesting that the gac filter media was essentially saturated with doc despite doc breakthrough effective removal of cecs was observed in the gac sand biofilters even after 15 months of operation the fraction of sorption sites occupied q c q e was computed for each cec in the gac sand biofilters throughout the experiment where q e was computed assuming an aqueous concentration of 100 ng l fig 3 among all selected cecs sulfamethoxazole had the highest q c q e at the end of the experiment 0 286 and gemfibrozil had the lowest 0 025 assuming carbon regeneration is required when 90 of the gac media is saturated with a target cec the estimated frequency of regeneration ranged from 1232 to 14244 days 3 4 39 0 years both adsorption and biodegradation need to be considered to explain the differences of q c q e among the cecs in general cecs with higher k d have lower end of experiment q c q e due to higher adsorption capacities some exceptions are noted for biodegradable cecs for example even though fluoxetine had a lower k d than that for tcep 2 86 and 4 68 respectively the end of experiment q c q e value of fluoxetine was still lower than that for tcep 0 048 and 0 059 respectively due to extensive biodegradation of fluoxetine effect of hydraulic loading rate cec removal in the gac sand biofilters was significantly greater p 8 33 10 9 at the low loading rate fig 4 the mean removal

performance the gac sand biofilters were operated under the same conditions for periods i and xiii and periods ii and xiv which occurred approximately 100 000 bed volumes of throughput apart table 1 the biofilter performance for these periods is compared in fig 5 significant reductions of cecs removal p 3 92 10 8 to 2 87 10 2 in gac sand biofilters for all selected cecs were observed after 100

comparison of observed c eff c inf values and c eff c inf values computed using eq 5 is shown in fig 6 the adjusted correlation coefficient of 0 660 indicates that 66 0 of the variation in c eff c inf for the pilot scale gac sand biofilters can be explained by this empirical relationship the coefficients for k b i o e b c t ebct and bv c inf 0 482 0 043 0 280 0 045 0 0015 0 0002 respectively indicated that as expected increasing biodegradation rate and ebct results in increased cec removal i e reduced c eff c inf while increasing the fraction of occupied sorption sites represented as bv c inf decreased cec removal all three factors were significant and should be considered when modeling cec removal performance in gac biofilters the coefficients for cec charge z at ph 8 5 and influent doc concentration 0 537 0 094 and 0 325 0 047 respectively suggest that cecs are more readily removed in gac sand biofilters when the compounds are positively charged and surprisingly when the influent doc concentration increases effluent cec concentrations from simulations using addesigns software fig s4 were in poor agreement with experimental observations for carbamazepine gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole the simulated effluent concentrations were consistently lower than the observed values the simulated effluent concentrations of metolachlor were constantly higher than the observed values for atenolol atrazine fluoxetine and tcep the simulated effluent concentrations were lower than the observed values for the first 200 days of operation then higher thereafter 4 discussion this study provided a comprehensive investigation of cecs removal in gac sand biofilters used for drinking water treatment a unique aspect of this study was the operation of gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters in parallel under actual drinking water treatment conditions with continuous cecs dosing for an extended period of time 1 year by comparing the performance of gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters operated in parallel the relative roles of adsorption and biodegradation were able to be estimated variation in operating and environmental conditions permitted evaluation of the effect of contaminant concentration filtration rate or ebct and water temperature on cecs removal these findings should be helpful to drinking water treatment facilities in predicting possible cecs removal and in optimizing the biofiltration process to maximize cecs removal the contribution of biodegradation to cecs removal in the biofilters varied significantly from compound to compound atrazine carbamazepine and tcep were recalcitrant to biodegradation in the pilot scale biofilters mean removal efficiencies 10 these findings are consistent with previous reports in the literature snyder et al 2007 hallé et al 2015 zearley and summers 2012 the consistency of observations between several studies suggests that these three cecs are not treatable using conventional biofiltration regardless of filter design and influent water quality the k bio value of fluoxetine was significantly greater than zero throughout the experiment suggesting conventional biofilters can be an effective method to remove fluoxetine in drinking water treatment other selected cecs had k bio values that were not significantly greater than zero p 0 076 to 0 495 at low temperature 3 10 c suggesting conventional biofiltration could be less effective in removing cecs from cold water even for some relatively biodegradable compounds i e metolachlor and atenolol our k bio values at high temperature 20 28 c were similar to those reported by zearley and summers 2012 but there were some differences for individual cec for example the mean k bio for metolachlor of 0 29 0 06 min 1 20 28 c was about 32 times greater than the previously reported value 0 009 min 1 at 20 c this difference in biodegradation rate is possibly due to differences in the amount of active biomass in the biofilters and feed water quality between the two studies the large difference in biodegradation rate also suggests that k bio values are system specific and methods to standardize biodegradation rate constant in biofilters need to be developed other than temperature ph ozonation and superficial velocity can also significantly affect cecs removal by biofiltration reungoat et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 carpenter and helbling 2017 understanding cecs biodegradation pathways is critical for estimating potential reductions in overall toxicity and may help drinking water treatment facilities optimize biofilter performance microbial hydrolysis of the amide bond on atenolol was observed in drinking water biofilters and wastewater bioreactors radjenović et al 2008 carpenter and helbling 2017 metolachlor is normally considered persistent in natural waters but microbial dechlorination has been observed in soil liu et al 1995 aga and thurman 2001 biodegradation of fluoxetine was observed in an activated sludge bioreactor likely due to oxidation or hydroxylation followed by dealkylation velázquez and nacheva 2017 the results of biodegradation product identification in the present study were inconclusive likely because of the low concentrations of cecs in the feed and high background nom concentrations which may interfere with product detection additional research is needed to identify the dominant cecs biodegradation products and elucidate the relevant pathways in drinking water biofilters the relative roles of sorption and biodegradation in the gac sand biofilters were estimated by comparing the cecs removal results for the gac sand filters with those in the anthracite sand biofilters this study is unique in that other investigations concerning cecs removal from drinking water supplies involved non sorptive media such as sand or anthracite snyder et al 2007 zearley and summers 2012 kennedy et al 2015 hallé et al 2015 or spent gac zhang et al 2017 it can be argued that the validity of this approach to determining the relative roles of sorption and biodegradation requires that the microbial activity levels and compositions of the communities in the gac sand biofilters and anthracite sand biofilters are similar which may not always be the case vignola et al 2018 an investigation of the microbial communities in the media from the biofilter columns in the present study is the subject of ongoing research for all selected cecs except fluoxetine gac sand biofilters provided at least double the removal in the anthracite sand biofilters fig 2 and fig s2 assuming that the rate of biodegradation was the same in both types of filters this result suggests that adsorption was the dominant cecs removal mechanism in gac sand biofilters over the first 15 months of operation with initially virgin gac the assumption of similar biodegradation rates seems reasonable because atp concentrations on the filter media were similar for the gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters fig s1 the abundance and activity of specific cec degrading bacteria would be needed to confirm the validity of this assumption but this would be challenging to determine and was beyond the scope of this study the observed effects of hydraulic loading rate on gac sand biofilter performance were expected because low loading rate provides greater contact time for both adsorption and biodegradation similar results also were found in other studies at a smaller scale involving rapid small scale column tests rssct or bench scale gac filters ternes et al 2002 corwin and summers 2010 summers et al 2014 the difference between the fraction of occupied gac sorption site q c q e values for biodegradable and non biodegradable cecs suggests that biodegradation can extend filter bed life either by reducing the initial amount of sorption or by enhancing desorption and regeneration of occupied sorption sites which is consistent with observations of geosmin removal in gac biofilters scharf et al 2010 the effect of throughput on cecs removal is explained by considering the usage of sorption sites for non biodegradable cecs a greater decrease in removal efficiency was observed for cecs with higher q c q e for example tcep vs carbamazepine biodegradable cecs such as fluoxetine and atenolol were less impacted by throughput because less sorption sites were occupied over time due to the significant role of biodegradation in removal the lack of an effect of throughput at high influent cecs concentrations 1000 3000 ng l is explained by the increase in driving force for sorption when the influent is suddenly switched from low to high concentration so that carbon saturated at the lower concentration is able to sorb more cecs a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate factors that significantly affected cecs removal in the gac sand biofilters unlike some previous studies magnuson and speth 2005 kennedy et al 2015 the dow of the compounds was not a significant factor in determining cecs removal it is important to note that many of the cecs in this study have polar and or charged functional groups which may also affect cecs sorption onto gac quinlivan et al 2005 ridder et al 2011 our results suggested that positively charged cecs were more sorptive than neutral or negatively charged compounds typical point of zero charge ph values ph pzc for activated carbon are between 3 4 and 7 newcombe et al 1993 bjelopavlic et al 1999 fairey et al 2006 thus the virgin gac media surface is expected to be negatively charged at ph 8 5 i e the influent water ph the enhanced adsorption of positively charged cecs was likely due to electrostatic attraction ridder et al 2011 anumol et al 2015 one unexpected result from the linear regression analysis was the negative coefficient for the doc term suggesting that increasing doc concentration was beneficial for cecs removal doc in influent water is often associated with a reduction in contaminant removal efficiency and earlier breakthrough due to competition for adsorption sites and pore blocking westerhoff et al 2005 kennedy and summers 2015 considering doc is mostly negatively charged in natural water increasing influent doc concentration may lead to a stronger electrostatic attraction for some compounds once doc absorbs to the gac for example ridder et al 2011 reported stronger electrostatic attraction of pharmaceuticals on gac preloaded with nom compared to fresh gac in addition as co metabolism is the likely biodegradation mechanism given the low concentrations of these compounds higher doc levels also should provide more labile carbon for increasing biomass and bioactivity levels in the filter media developing models for predicting cec removal in gac sand biofilters is challenging given the complexity of the process first the possible removal mechanisms include sorption biodegradation and chemical degradation e g hydrolysis second the performance is expected to be highly dynamic with short term variation in biodegradation rates due to the effects of backwashing on attached biomass levels emelko et al 2006 as well as moderate to longer term changes in sorption effectiveness due to accumulation of cecs and nom on the carbon surface and within the pores corwin and summers 2010 kennedy et al 2015 further the use of gac as a filter media means that particles and flocs can accumulate on the carbon and possibly block pores niquette et al 2000 or even provide more sites for sorption of cecs vieno et al 2007 khunjar et al 2011 we explored the use of addesigns for predicting the cecs removal performance of the gac sand biofilters in this investigation the addesigns program incorporates adsorption capacity adsorption kinetics and nom fouling but does not account for biodegradation and water quality variations i e influent doc concentration the agreement between the model predictions and experimental data was poor in some cases especially for compounds that were biodegradable scharf et al 2010 therefore an empirical relationship was developed via multiple linear regression that incorporated all potential factors that may affect cecs removal in gac sand biofilters including biodegradation rate adsorption capacity throughput ebct water quality variation influent doc concentration and cec chemical properties charge unfortunately the problem with such empirical relationships is that they tend to be site specific additional research is needed to determine how well the empirical relationship developed in this study applies to other systems 5 conclusions in conventional anthracite sand biofilters effective cecs removal was only achieved for highly biodegradable cecs like fluoxetine and primarily at high temperatures 20 c thus compound biodegradability and seasonal temperature changes must be considered if conventional anthracite sand biofilters are used for cecs removal gac sand biofilters can provide moderate to effective cecs removal over a wide range of operational conditions due to the dual function of adsorption and biodegradation for most selected cecs adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism in gac sand biofilters biodegradation can extend gac bed life by reducing contaminant loading to sorption sites and regenerating occupied sites operational conditions hydraulic loading rate temperature and throughput water qualities influent cecs and doc concentration and cecs properties biodegradability and charge can significantly impact cecs removal and should be considered to predict and maximize biofilter performance a multiple linear regression based empirical relationship was more effective at fitting cecs removal data from gac sand biofilters than the

19268,the removal and fate of contaminants of emerging concern cecs in water treatment systems is of interest given the widespread occurrence of cecs in water supplies and increase in direct potable reuse of wastewater in this study cec removal was investigated in pilot scale biologically active granular activated carbon gac sand and anthracite sand filters under different hydraulic loading rates and influent cec concentrations over a 15 month period eight of the most commonly detected compounds in a survey of cec occurrence in drinking water were selected for this study atenolol atrazine carbamazepine fluoxetine gemfibrozil metolachlor sulfamethoxazole and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep gac sand biofilters provided superior cec removal for all compounds mean removal efficiencies 49 1 94 4 compared to anthracite sand biofilters mean removal efficiencies 0 66 1 due to a combination of adsorption and biodegradation adsorption was determined to be the dominant removal mechanism for

observed during spike dosing 1000 3000 ng l a regression analysis suggested that biodegradation rate hydraulic loading rate influent cec concentration throughput influent dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and cec charge are important parameters for predicting cec removal performance in gac sand biofilters graphical abstract image 1 keywords granular activated carbon anthracite trace organic contaminants drinking water treatment hydraulic loading rate throughput 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs include a wide variety of chemical classes such as insecticides and herbicides pharmaceuticals and personal care products and industrial and commercial chemicals based on a survey by benotti et al 2009 at least one cec was detected in the source water of nineteen different u s drinking water utilities serving more than 28 million people the cecs are present in source waters due to agricultural activity industrial effluents urban runoff and municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents it is not desirable to have these biologically active compounds present in finished drinking water because there are possible adverse effects on human health and negative consequences in terms of public perception biofiltration a process in which granular media filters are inhabited by viable bacteria has been used for water treatment since the 1800s collins et al 1992 innovative engineering is not required to establish a biofilter because most granular media filters are presumed to be biologically active regardless of upstream disinfection previous studies demonstrated that biofilters not only effectively remove particles but also remove a wide range of dissolved contaminants including ozonation byproducts hozalski et al 1995 melin and ødegaard 2000 halogenated disinfection byproducts e g haloacetic acids zhang et al 2009 geosmin ho et al 2007 scharf et al 2010 and methylisoborneol ho et al 2007 certainly biodegradation alone may not be able to treat all dissolved contaminants because some compounds may be recalcitrant or biodegrade at a rate too slow to affect the cec concentration in the short hydraulic residence time of a rapid biofilter thus biological treatment in a granular activated carbon gac filter is advantageous in that it provides the dual benefit of sorption and biodegradation furthermore biological activity has been shown to substantially increase gac bed life for some compounds such as geosmin scharf et al 2010 there are a few reports in the literature concerning the removal of cecs by drinking water treatment biofilters snyder et al 2007 zearley and summers 2012 kennedy et al 2015 hallé et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 conventional sand or anthracite sand biofilters can achieve 50 80 removal for biodegradable

biofilters however provided more than 90 removal of atrazine and carbamazepine over the first 200 days of operation kennedy et al 2015 despite this prior work there are several important knowledge

system design and operation a pilot scale biofiltration system fig 1 was constructed at the minneapolis water treatment and distribution services mwtds fridley facility in fridley minnesota usa mwtds provides 57 million gallons per day 215 000 m 3 day of water to nearly a half million customers in the city of minneapolis and neighboring suburban communities the fridley facility treats the water by lime softening with coagulant addition flocculation primary sedimentation recarbonation secondary sedimentation and anthracite sand filtration water from the full scale recarbonation chambers was used as the feed water for the pilot plant fig 1 the ph of the water was adjusted to 8 5 using hydrochloric acid and then ferric chloride was added as the primary coagulant at a dose of 2 mg l as fe the water was settled for 1 2 h depending on the loading rate and then spiked with cecs before entering the biofilter columns although eight biofilter columns were operated in parallel only six biofilter columns are relevant for this manuscript because the feed water to other two was not dosed with cecs each column was constructed from polycarbonate tubes id 3 75 inches 9 53 cm total height 144 inches 3 66 m three columns were packed with 20 inches 0 51 m of gac calgon f300 over 10 inches 0 25 m of sand and three columns were packed with 20 inches 0 51 m of anthracite over 10 inches 0 25 m of sand the three anthracite sand biofilter columns served as non sorptive controls the pilot scale biofiltration system was operated for 15 months from october 2015 to january 2017 the water temperature was not controlled and ranged from 3 to 28 c the filters were operated at hydraulic loading rates of 2 or 4 gpm ft2 4 88 or 9 76 m h which provided 8 4 min or 4 2 min of empty bed contact time ebct respectively backwash was performed when the headloss was above 90 of the maximum value permitted by the system 60 inches 1 53 m the columns were backwashed using 1 3 scfm 36 8 l min of air for 5 min followed by 10 min of water wash at 15 gpm ft2 36 66 m h to achieve a 30 bed expansion environmentally relevant amounts of cecs 100 200 ng l were continuously dosed into the influent water using a syringe pump ne 1600 new era pump systems inc farmingdale ny for most of the 15 month period the biofilters also were challenged periodically with sudden increases in cecs concentrations 1000 3000 ng

eight different sets of conditions were repeated for a total of fourteen sampling periods throughout the experiment with two sampling events per period the same columns were used continuously throughout the study and exposed to the different conditions sequentially as described in table 1 a total of 616 samples were collected for cecs analysis over the entire course of the study biofilter

carbon doc concentration biofilter media samples were collected monthly from the top layer of the biofilters for analysis of microbial activity 2 2 cecs eight cecs were selected for this study atenolol atrazine carbamazepine fluoxetine gemfibrozil metolachlor sulfamethoxazole and tris 2 chloroethly phosphate tcep details concerning the supplier and purity of each compound are provided in the supplementary material table s2 these cecs were selected because they have been detected frequently in finished drinking water benotti et al 2009 and because they represent a wide range of uses and chemical characteristics aerobic biodegradation probabilities of the selected cecs were computed based on chemical structure using the miti model tunkel et al 2000 in biowin6 the properties of the selected cecs are summarized in table 2 2 3 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were performed to determine the gac sorption capacities for the cecs according to the procedure of graham et al 2000 briefly pre combusted amber glass bottles were filled with 500 ml of carbonate buffered 0 1 m ultrapure water ph 8 5 and then spiked with a cocktail of the target cecs 2 mg l each ground and sieved 65 mesh activated carbon ac media was added into the bottles 0 312 5 mg ac l to initiate the adsorption experiment the initial and equilibrium aqueous cec concentrations were measured via high performance liquid chromatography hplc with uv vis detection except for tcep where liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms was used additional batch experiments were performed in a similar manner but with mississippi river natural organic matter nom international humic substances society added the detailed experimental procedures and analytical methods are

effluent water samples was determined according to epa method 415 3 american public health association 1998 to assess microbial activity levels on the filter media the adenosine triphosphate atp concentration was determined immediately after sample collection using luminultra test kits according to the manufacturer s instructions for measurement of cecs quadruplicate influent water samples and triplicate effluent samples 500 ml each from each biofilter column were collected in pre combusted amber glass bottles and transported on ice to the laboratory upon arrival all samples were filtered through glass fiber filters 0 7 μm acidified to ph 2 0 with sulfuric acid and then spiked with eight surrogate compounds table s2 each at a concentration of 10 ng l to verify the relative recovery one influent and one effluent water sample from each column were spiked with 200 ng l cecs as a matrix spike then all samples were subjected to solid phase extraction spe using 500 mg oasis hlb cartridges following the protocol of vanderford and snyder 2006 and trenholm et al 2006 after loading the spe cartridge it was dried under vacuum 20 mmhg for 150 s and eluted with 5 ml methanol followed by 5 ml 90 methyl tert butyl ether 10 methanol v v and then the combined extracts were concentrated via nitrogen blowdown and solvent exchanged into 5 mm ammonium acetate solution 500 μl for analysis via lc ms ms lc ms ms method details are provided in the supplementary material identification of potential microbial transformation products predicted using the university of minnesota biocatalysis biodegradation database pathway prediction system gao et al 2009 was attempted using ion trap mass spectrometry following the protocol of helbling et al 2010 2 5 data analysis biodegradation rate constants were calculated by assuming the biofilter column is a plug flow reactor and the biodegradation kinetics were pseudo first order according to eq 2 2 k b i o 1 t ln c e f f c i n f where k bio is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 t ε e b c t is the hydraulic residence time min ε 0 37 filter bed porosity c eff is the filter effluent cec concentration ng l and c inf is the filter influent cec concentration ng l the cumulative absorbent phase concentration q c for each cec on the gac media was calculated to assess the extent of bed capacity utilized over time because atp concentrations on the filter media were similar for the gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters fig s1 the contribution of biodegradation to cec removal within the gac sand biofilters was assumed to be the same as in the anthracite sand biofilters thus q c was calculated by subtracting cecs removal in the anthracite sand biofilters from the mass removed in the gac sand biofilters according to the approach of scharf et al 2010 3 q c q c i n f c e f f g a c c i n f c e f f a n t h t m g a c where q c is the cumulative cec concentration on the gac media ng cec g gac q is the flow

anthracite sand biofilter effluent cec concentration t is the biofilter operating time since cec dosing began min the maximum sorption capacity of the gac media in the biofilters q e was computed by inputting the biofilter influent cec concentration into the sorption isotherm equation eq 1 for each cec q e k d c i n f the value of q c q e was computed to represent the fraction of occupied sorption sites on the gac media in the biofilters the software program addesigns mertz et al 1994 based on the pore and surface diffusion model psdm was used to simulate the removal of cecs due to adsorption in the gac sand biofilters over the course of the experiment the isotherm parameters for the simulation were determined from the batch sorption experiments other parameters for the simulation were determined following addesigns manual recommendations mertz et al 1994 the statistical software ibm spss statistics 22 was used to perform all statistical analyses paired and unpaired one tailed two sample t tests were used to determine if the effects of hydraulic loading rate and throughput were statistically significant a one tailed one sample t test was used to determine if the mean of k bio was significantly greater than zero pearson s correlation test was used to determine if a statistically significant correlation existed between k bio and biowin6 2 6 multiple linear regression analysis a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to develop an empirical relationship between gac sand biofilter performance and parameters that were likely to affect cecs removal a total of 220 cecs removal efficiency values were used in the analysis 14 sampling periods 2 sampling events per period 8 different cecs analyzed per sample four removal efficiencies were excluded due to poor surrogate recovery operational and environmental factors that were likely to have a significant effect on cecs removal according to the literature ridder et al 2011 summers et al

3 1 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were performed to determine the sorption capacity of the gac media no significant reduction of any of the selected cecs was observed in control bottles without gac after 5 days of incubation in buffered di water ph 8 5 at room temperature data not shown suggesting that the selected compounds have low or negligible hydrolysis rates the data from the batch sorption tests in buffered ultrapure water ph 8 5 at room temperature 23 c were fit to the langmuir isotherm model and the isotherm parameters are summarized in table 3 similar results were obtained for experiments in which the water also contained 5 0 ppm as c of mississippi river nom table s3 3 2 cecs removal performance of the anthracite sand biofilters the selected cecs have negligible hydrolysis rates hence cecs removal in the anthracite sand biofilters is attributed solely due to biodegradation the removal efficiencies of three selected cecs carbamazepine metolachlor and fluoxetine in the anthracite sand biofilters for all sampling periods are shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies for the remaining cecs are shown in the supplementary material fig s2 among the eight cecs fluoxetine had the highest removal over the entire course of the experiment ranging from 13 3 to 62 8 at low temperature 3 10 c and from 49 2 to 97 3 at high temperature 20 28 c these results suggest that conventional biologically active anthracite sand filters are an effective method to remove fluoxetine in drinking water treatment low to moderate biodegradation of metolachlor atenolol gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole 10 50 was also observed in the anthracite sand biofilters but only at high temperature 20 28 c no significant removal of atrazine carbamazepine and tcep was observed in the anthracite sand biofilters over the entire course of the experiment indicating that these compounds are recalcitrant to biodegradation in this system the k bio values are summarized in table 4 for both high temperature and low temperature conditions fluoxetine was the only cec with a k bio value significantly greater than zero p 2 47 10 3 for the low temperature condition 3 10 c as expected at high temperature 20 28 c the k bio values of the cecs 0 05 0 03 to 0 93 0 15 min 1 were greater than those at low temperature table 4 no significant correlation p 0 617 was observed between biowin6 predictions and k bio suggesting that this structure activity based model is not a useful predictor of cecs biodegradation in biofilters preliminary work using ion trap mass spectrometry was performed to detect possible biodegradation products but the results were inconclusive partly due to a high background signal attributed to matrix interferences 3 3 cecs removal performance of the gac sand biofilters the eight selected cecs in the gac sand biofilters were moderately to effectively removed over the entire course of the experiment with mean standard deviation removals ranging from 49 1 27 7 to 94 4 7 0 the removal efficiencies of three selected cecs carbamazepine metolachlor and fluoxetine in the gac sand biofilters throughout all sampling periods are shown in fig 2 the removal efficiencies over time for the remaining cecs atenolol atrazine gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole and tcep are shown in fig s2 for all selected cecs gac sand biofilters provided superior removal compared to anthracite sand biofilters due to the dual function of adsorption and biodegradation the biofilters were fed with water from full scale recarbonation chambers which contained 2 95 8 20 ppm doc during the course of the study fig s3 removal of doc in the gac sand biofilters was initially 15 22 but stabilized at 1 5 after 4 months of operation fig s3 suggesting that the gac filter media was essentially saturated with doc despite doc breakthrough effective removal of cecs was observed in the gac sand biofilters even after 15 months of operation the fraction of sorption sites occupied q c q e was computed for each cec in the gac sand biofilters throughout the experiment where q e was computed assuming an aqueous concentration of 100 ng l fig 3 among all selected cecs sulfamethoxazole had the highest q c q e at the end of the experiment 0 286 and gemfibrozil had the lowest 0 025 assuming carbon regeneration is required when 90 of the gac media is saturated with a target cec the estimated frequency of regeneration ranged from 1232 to 14244 days 3 4 39 0 years both adsorption and biodegradation need to be considered to explain the differences of q c q e among the cecs in general cecs with higher k d have lower end of experiment q c q e due to higher adsorption capacities some exceptions are noted for biodegradable cecs for example even though fluoxetine had a lower k d than that for tcep 2 86 and 4 68 respectively the end of experiment q c q e value of fluoxetine was still lower than that for tcep 0 048 and 0 059 respectively due to extensive biodegradation of fluoxetine effect of hydraulic loading rate cec removal in the gac sand biofilters was significantly greater p 8 33 10 9 at the low loading rate fig 4 the mean removal

performance the gac sand biofilters were operated under the same conditions for periods i and xiii and periods ii and xiv which occurred approximately 100 000 bed volumes of throughput apart table 1 the biofilter performance for these periods is compared in fig 5 significant reductions of cecs removal p 3 92 10 8 to 2 87 10 2 in gac sand biofilters for all selected cecs were observed after 100

removal performance p 0 056 to 0 430 for most selected cecs except metolachlor was observed when the influent cecs concentration was high 1000 3000 ng l fig 5 b 3 4 multiple linear regression analysis

comparison of observed c eff c inf values and c eff c inf values computed using eq 5 is shown in fig 6 the adjusted correlation coefficient of 0 660 indicates that 66 0 of the variation in c eff c inf for the pilot scale gac sand biofilters can be explained by this empirical relationship the coefficients for k b i o e b c t ebct and bv c inf 0 482 0 043 0 280 0 045 0 0015 0 0002 respectively indicated that as expected increasing biodegradation rate and ebct results in increased cec removal i e reduced c eff c inf while increasing the fraction of occupied sorption sites represented as bv c inf decreased cec removal all three factors were significant and should be considered when modeling cec removal performance in gac biofilters the coefficients for cec charge z at ph 8 5 and influent doc concentration 0 537 0 094 and 0 325 0 047 respectively suggest that cecs are more readily removed in gac sand biofilters when the compounds are positively charged and surprisingly when the influent doc concentration increases effluent cec concentrations from simulations using addesigns software fig s4 were in poor agreement with experimental observations for carbamazepine gemfibrozil and sulfamethoxazole the simulated effluent concentrations were consistently lower than the observed values the simulated effluent concentrations of metolachlor were constantly higher than the observed values for atenolol atrazine fluoxetine and tcep the simulated effluent concentrations were lower than the observed values for the first 200 days of operation then higher thereafter 4 discussion this study provided a comprehensive investigation of cecs removal in gac sand biofilters used for drinking water treatment a unique aspect of this study was the operation of gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters in parallel under actual drinking water treatment conditions with continuous cecs dosing for an extended period of time 1 year by comparing the performance of gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters operated in parallel the relative roles of adsorption and biodegradation were able to be estimated variation in operating and environmental conditions permitted evaluation of the effect of contaminant concentration filtration rate or ebct and water temperature on cecs removal these findings should be helpful to drinking water treatment facilities in predicting possible cecs removal and in optimizing the biofiltration process to maximize cecs removal the contribution of biodegradation to cecs removal in the biofilters varied significantly from compound to compound atrazine carbamazepine and tcep were recalcitrant to biodegradation in the pilot scale biofilters mean removal efficiencies 10 these findings are consistent with previous reports in the literature snyder et al 2007 hallé et al 2015 zearley and summers 2012 the consistency of observations between several studies suggests that these three cecs are not treatable using conventional biofiltration regardless of filter design and influent water quality the k bio value of fluoxetine was significantly greater than zero throughout the experiment suggesting conventional biofilters can be an effective method to remove fluoxetine in drinking water treatment other selected cecs had k bio values that were not significantly greater than zero p 0 076 to 0 495 at low temperature 3 10 c suggesting conventional biofiltration could be less effective in removing cecs from cold water even for some relatively biodegradable compounds i e metolachlor and atenolol our k bio values at high temperature 20 28 c were similar to those reported by zearley and summers 2012 but there were some differences for individual cec for example the mean k bio for metolachlor of 0 29 0 06 min 1 20 28 c was about 32 times greater than the previously reported value 0 009 min 1 at 20 c this difference in biodegradation rate is possibly due to differences in the amount of active biomass in the biofilters and feed water quality between the two studies the large difference in biodegradation rate also suggests that k bio values are system specific and methods to standardize biodegradation rate constant in biofilters need to be developed other than temperature ph ozonation and superficial velocity can also significantly affect cecs removal by biofiltration reungoat et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 carpenter and helbling 2017 understanding cecs biodegradation pathways is critical for estimating potential reductions in overall toxicity and may help drinking water treatment facilities optimize biofilter performance microbial hydrolysis of the amide bond on atenolol was observed in drinking water biofilters and wastewater bioreactors radjenović et al 2008 carpenter and helbling 2017 metolachlor is normally considered persistent in natural waters but microbial dechlorination has been observed in soil liu et al 1995 aga and thurman 2001 biodegradation of fluoxetine was observed in an activated sludge bioreactor likely due to oxidation or hydroxylation followed by dealkylation velázquez and nacheva 2017 the results of biodegradation product identification in the present study were inconclusive likely because of the low concentrations of cecs in the feed and high background nom concentrations which may interfere with product detection additional research is needed to identify the dominant cecs biodegradation products and elucidate the relevant pathways in drinking water biofilters the relative roles of sorption and biodegradation in the gac sand biofilters were estimated by comparing the cecs removal results for the gac sand filters with those in the anthracite sand biofilters this study is unique in that other investigations concerning cecs removal from drinking water supplies involved non sorptive media such as sand or anthracite snyder et al 2007 zearley and summers 2012 kennedy et al 2015 hallé et al 2015 or spent gac zhang et al 2017 it can be argued that the validity of this approach to determining the relative roles of sorption and biodegradation requires that the microbial activity levels and compositions of the communities in the gac sand biofilters and anthracite sand biofilters are similar which may not always be the case vignola et al 2018 an investigation of the microbial communities in the media from the biofilter columns in the present study is the subject of ongoing research for all selected cecs except fluoxetine gac sand biofilters provided at least double the removal in the anthracite sand biofilters fig 2 and fig s2 assuming that the rate of biodegradation was the same in both types of filters this result suggests that adsorption was the dominant cecs removal mechanism in gac sand biofilters over the first 15 months of operation with initially virgin gac the assumption of similar biodegradation rates seems reasonable because atp concentrations on the filter media were similar for the gac sand and anthracite sand biofilters fig s1 the abundance and activity of specific cec degrading bacteria would be needed to confirm the validity of this assumption but this would be challenging to determine and was beyond the scope of this study the observed effects of hydraulic loading rate on gac sand biofilter performance were expected because low loading rate provides greater contact time for both adsorption and biodegradation similar results also were found in other studies at a smaller scale involving rapid small scale column tests rssct or bench scale gac filters ternes et al 2002 corwin and summers 2010 summers et al 2014 the difference between the fraction of occupied gac sorption site q c q e values for biodegradable and non biodegradable cecs suggests that biodegradation can extend filter bed life either by reducing the initial amount of sorption or by enhancing desorption and regeneration of occupied sorption sites which is consistent with observations of geosmin removal in gac biofilters scharf et al 2010 the effect of throughput on cecs removal is explained by considering the usage of sorption sites for non biodegradable cecs a greater decrease in removal efficiency was observed for cecs with higher q c q e for example tcep vs carbamazepine biodegradable cecs such as fluoxetine and atenolol were less impacted by throughput because less sorption sites were occupied over time due to the significant role of biodegradation in removal the lack of an effect of throughput at high influent cecs concentrations 1000 3000 ng l is explained by the increase in driving force for sorption when the influent is suddenly switched from low to high concentration so that carbon saturated at the lower concentration is able to sorb more cecs a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate factors that significantly affected cecs removal in the gac sand biofilters unlike some previous studies magnuson and speth 2005 kennedy et al 2015 the dow of the compounds was not a significant factor in determining cecs removal it is important to note that many of the cecs in this study have polar and or charged functional groups which may also affect cecs sorption onto gac quinlivan et al 2005 ridder et al 2011 our results suggested that positively charged cecs were more sorptive than neutral or negatively charged compounds typical point of zero charge ph values ph pzc for activated carbon are between 3 4 and 7 newcombe et al 1993 bjelopavlic et al 1999 fairey et al 2006 thus the virgin gac media surface is expected to be negatively charged at ph 8 5 i e the influent water ph the enhanced adsorption of positively charged cecs was likely due to electrostatic attraction ridder et al 2011 anumol et al 2015 one unexpected result from the linear regression analysis was the negative coefficient for the doc term suggesting that increasing doc concentration was beneficial for cecs removal doc in influent water is often associated with a reduction in contaminant removal efficiency and earlier breakthrough due to competition for adsorption sites and pore blocking westerhoff et al 2005 kennedy and summers 2015 considering doc is mostly negatively charged in natural water increasing influent doc concentration may lead to a stronger electrostatic attraction for some compounds once doc absorbs to the gac for example ridder et al 2011 reported stronger electrostatic attraction of pharmaceuticals on gac preloaded with nom compared to fresh gac in addition as co metabolism is the likely biodegradation mechanism given the low concentrations of these compounds higher doc levels also should provide more labile carbon for increasing biomass and bioactivity levels in the filter media developing models for predicting cec removal in gac sand biofilters is challenging given the complexity of the process first the possible removal mechanisms include sorption biodegradation and chemical degradation e g hydrolysis second the performance is expected to be highly dynamic with short term variation in biodegradation rates due to the effects of backwashing on attached biomass levels emelko et al 2006 as well as moderate to longer term changes in sorption effectiveness due to accumulation of cecs and nom on the carbon surface and within the pores corwin and summers 2010 kennedy et al 2015 further the use of gac as a filter media means that particles and flocs can accumulate on the carbon and possibly block pores niquette et al 2000 or even provide more sites for sorption of cecs vieno et al 2007 khunjar et al 2011 we explored the use of addesigns for predicting the cecs removal performance of the gac sand biofilters in this investigation the addesigns program incorporates adsorption capacity adsorption kinetics and nom fouling but does not account for biodegradation and water quality variations i e influent doc concentration the agreement between the model predictions and experimental data was poor in some cases especially for compounds that were biodegradable scharf et al 2010 therefore an empirical relationship was developed via multiple linear regression that incorporated all potential factors that may affect cecs removal in gac sand biofilters including biodegradation rate adsorption capacity throughput ebct water quality variation influent doc concentration and cec chemical properties charge unfortunately the problem with such empirical relationships is that they tend to be site specific additional research is needed to determine how well the empirical relationship developed in this study applies to other systems 5 conclusions in conventional anthracite sand biofilters effective cecs removal was only achieved for highly biodegradable cecs like fluoxetine and primarily at high temperatures 20 c thus compound biodegradability and seasonal temperature changes must be considered if conventional anthracite sand biofilters are used for cecs removal gac sand biofilters can provide moderate to effective cecs removal over a wide range of operational conditions due to the dual function of adsorption and biodegradation for most selected cecs adsorption was the dominant removal mechanism in gac sand biofilters biodegradation can extend gac bed life by reducing contaminant loading to sorption sites and regenerating occupied sites operational conditions hydraulic loading rate temperature and throughput water qualities influent cecs and doc concentration and cecs properties biodegradability and charge can significantly impact cecs removal and should be considered to predict and maximize biofilter performance a multiple linear regression based empirical relationship was more effective at fitting cecs removal data from gac sand biofilters than the psdm model caution must be exercised in applying such empirical models because they tend to be site specific acknowledgments financial support for this work was provided by the city of minneapolis

19269,fish manipulation has been used to restore lakes in the temperate zone often strong short term cascading effects have been obtained but the long term perspectives are less clear fish manipulation methods are far less advanced for warm lakes and it is debatable whether it is in fact possible to create a trophic cascade in warm lakes due to the dominance and high densities of fast reproducing omnivorous fish however removal of benthic feeding fish also reduce disturbance of the sediment which not only affects the nutrient level but also the concentration of suspended organic and inorganic matter with enhanced water clarity and potentially better growth conditions for submerged macrophytes we conducted a biomanipulation experiment in one of the basins in chinese huizhou west lake that have remained highly turbid after extensive nutrient loading reduction another basin was used as control control treatment pairing design removal of a substantial amount of plankti benthivorous fish was followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish we found strong and relatively long lasting effects of the restoration initiative in the form of substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in nutrient concentrations particularly total phosphorus phytoplankton and turbidity while only minor effects were detected for crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low densities before as well as after the restoration our results add importantly to the existing knowledge of restoration of warm lakes and are strongly relevant not least in asia where natural lakes frequently are used extensively for fish production often involving massive stocking of benthivorous fish with a growing economy and development of more efficient fish production systems the interest in restoring lakes is increasing world wide we found convincing evidence that fish removal and piscivores stocking combined with transplantation of submerged macrophytes may have significant effects on water clarity in warm shallow lakes even if the zooplankton grazing potential remains low the latter most likely as a result of high predation on the zooplankton graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake restoration biomanipulation implantation of macrophytes tropical lake 1 introduction for 50 100 years eutrophication has posed a serious threat to lakes world wide high nutrient loading has resulted in turbid water excessive blooms of nuisance algae dominance of planktivorous and benthivorous fish and loss of biodiversity while countries in the developing world face an alarming increase in eutrophication of lakes as a result of the rapid economic development large efforts have been devoted to combat eutrophication by reducing the external loading of especially phosphorus p not least in western europe and north america sas 1989 jeppesen et al 2005a schindler 2009 in consequence the p loading from sewage and industrial sources has declined significantly since the 1970s overviews in sas 1989 jeppesen et al 2005b this has led to a reduced phytoplankton abundance lower cyanobacteria dominance and often a shift in fish community structure towards lower abundance and proportions of planktivorous and benthivorous fish with a resulting reduced predation on zooplankton however many lakes have responded slowly to nutrient loading reduction marsden 1989 sas 1989 jeppesen et al 2005a b partly due to internal p loading release from the stored p pool in the sediment søndergaard et al 2013 and to biological resistance jeppesen and sammalkorpi 2002 the latter reflects that fish after an external nutrient loading reduction may exert a continuous predation pressure on large bodied grazers e g daphnia and thereby maintain the grazing pressure on phytoplankton at a low level diminishing also the number of benthic animals that stabilize and oxidize the sediment furthermore persistence of benthivores e g carp cyprinus carpio bream abramis brama that stir up the sediment while feeding and translocate nutrients from the sediment to the water meijer et al 1994 breukelaar et al 1994 contributes to maintain high internal p loading and high inorganic turbidity moreover grazing by herbivorous waterfowl such as coot fulica atra and mute swan cygnus olor may hamper recovery by delaying the recolonization of submerged plants perrow et al 1997 mitchell and perrow 1998 to re enforce recovery several physico chemical and biological methods have been used for an overview see cooke et al 2005 the typical measure applied to overcome biological resistance is removal of plankti benthivorous fish this method has been extensively used in north temperate lakes particularly in europe removal of approx 75 of the plankti benthivorous fish stock over a 1 2 year period has been recommended to avoid regrowth and to stimulate the growth of potentially piscivorous fish hansson et al 1998 jeppesen and sammalkorpi 2002 mehner et al 2002 gulati et al 2008 an alternative or supplementary method to fish removal is stocking of piscivores for a review see drenner and hambright 1999 to reinforce recovery of submerged macrophytes active planting entire plants turions plant fragments or seeds has been used jeppesen et al 2012 in some cases also by constructing plant exclosures to protect the macrophytes against grazing by waterfowl and fish søndergaard et al 1996 in the exclosures the macrophytes can grow in a grazing free environment from where they may spread seeds turions or plant fragments to the entire lake thereby augmenting the chances of successful colonization søndergaard et al 1996 mitchell and perrow 1998 lauridsen et al 2003 in north temperate lakes efficient fish reduction in eutrophic lakes has generally often led to major cascading effects in the form of reduced phytoplankton biomass dominance by large sized zooplankton and improved transparency carpenter and kitchell 1993 hansson et al 1998 søndergaard et al 2008 bernes et al 2015 although there are also examples of little or no cascading effects for various reasons horppila et al 1998 jeppesen and sammelkorpi 2002 søndergaard et al 2008 the effects of fish manipulation may cascade to the nutrient level as well a reduction ranging from 30 to 50 in lake concentrations of tp has been recorded in the relatively successful fish manipulation experiments conducted in shallow and stratified eutrophic lakes søndergaard et al 2008 a significant contributory factor is increased growth of microbenthic algae owing to improved light conditions at the sediment surface hansson 1990 genkai kato et al 2012 more benthic algae and less sedimentation of phytoplankton due to intensified grazing and more benthic animals due to reduced fish predation may all result in a higher redox potential in the surface sediment potentially reducing the p release søndergaard et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 2017 so far the long term perspectives of fish removal are less promising a gradual return to the turbid state and higher abundance of zooplanktivorous fish after 5 10 years have been reported in many case studies søndergaard et al 2008 moreover stocking of piscivorous fish has often been less successful than fish removal drenner and hambright 1999 experience with lake recovery is far less advanced for warm than for temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2005b 2012 studies conducted in sub tropical and mediterranean lakes have shown that nutrient loading reduction may improve the ecological state via a declining algal biomass and increased water transparency jeppesen et al 2005a coveney et al 2005 romo et al 2005 beklioğlu and tan 2008 however it is debatable whether the fish manipulation approach used in cold temperate lakes to re enforce recovery can be used with success in warm lakes as well jeppesen et al 2005b 2012 the high species richness and high densities of plankti benthivorous fish with dominance of omnivores a few efficient predators and several cohorts lead to higher predation on zooplankton in warm lakes than in temperate lakes lazzaro 1997 meerhoff et al 2003 2007 teixeira de mello et al 2009 it is therefore likely that a removal induced reduction of the biomass of planktivorous fish will be compensated by fast adjustment of the remaining population and the impact will consequently be of short duration jeppesen et al 2012 hence it may be more difficult to provoke and maintain a pelagic trophic cascade effect in subtropical and tropical lakes than in temperate lakes however an important effect of removal of benthic feeding fish such as carp and bream is reduced stirring of the sediment which not only affects lake nutrient levels but also the concentration of suspended organic and inorganic matter breukelaar et al 1994 horppila et al 1998 not least in systems with high dominance of carp either naturally or stocked as is the case for many chinese lakes jia et al 2013 carp removal may potentially lead to substantial improvement of lake water quality due to a reduced disturbance in the present study we conducted a biomanipulation experiment in a basin of chinese huizhou west lake that has remained highly turbid after an extensive nutrient loading reduction li et al 2007 removal of plankti benthivorous fish was followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish our working hypothesis was that albeit a major trophic cascade mediated by enhanced zooplankton grazing due to the high density of small fish in warm freshwaters could not be expected plankti benthivorous fish reduction through direct removal and stocking of piscivorous fish would lead to clear water conditions and low nutrient levels due to reduced disturbance of the sediment and water clarity would be maintained via introduction of submerged macrophytes 2 material and methods 2 1 study site huizhou west lake is a tropical shallow lake located in the city of huizhou 23 06 24 23 04 43 n 114 22 44 114 24 03 e in the guangdong province southern china fig 1 which is characterized by a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate the multiannual mean air temperature is 21 7 c the lowest monthly mean is 13 1 c in january and the highest monthly mean 28 3 c in july the multi annual mean precipitation is 1649 mm of which about 80 falls during april to august the lake has a total surface area of about 1 5 km2 and a mean depth of 1 6 m the lake is divided into several basins connected through waterways under bridges the water temperature ranges from 12 to 35 c the hydraulic retention time is about three months li et al 2007 due to its city location the lake has long been a valuable part of are creational garden that is extensively used by the local population however the lake has become eutrophic due to input of wastewater from huizhou city to restore the lake several measures have been implemented since the 1990s including wastewater treatment effluent diversion and sediment removal li et al 2007 but with no substantial effect the lake has remained eutrophic and turbid total phosphorus typically ranges between 100 and 200 μg l 1 total nitrogen between 1 0 and 2 5 mg l 1 chlorophyll a between 30 and 70 μg l and total suspended solids between 20 and 90 mgl 1 secchi depth is as low as 30 40 cm the fish communities are dominated by omnivorous and plankti benthivorous fish including tilapia oreochromis niloticus common carp cyprinus carpio crucian carp carassius carassiu mud carp cirrhina molitorella silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix bighead carp aristichthys nobilis and long tailed anchovy coilia grayii gao et al 2014 common zooplankton include small sized cladocerans such as chydorus sp alona spp bosmina spp diaphanosoma spp and moina micrura and the dominant copepods are mesocyclops thermocyclopoides allodiaptomus specillodactylus neodiaptomus schmackeri and phyllodiaptomu stunguidus there are no submerged macrophytes and the phytoplankton is dominated by gleobacterviolaceus pseudoanabaena merismopedia and dactylococcopsis 2 2 biomanipulation to improve water quality and especially the clarity of the lake large scale ecological restoration biomanipulation experiments were conducted in a basins with a surface water area of 12 ha rlake in 2007 fig 1 rlake was connected with the rest of the lake by waterways under bridges before restorations in rlake the biomanipulation included removal of plankti benthivorous fish stocking of piscivorous fish and transplantation of submerged macrophytes the lake basin was isolated from the rest of the lake by building a small soil dam under the bridge in may 2007 after lowering the water level by 50 cm a total of 29 7t 2 5 t ha 1 fish were removed by seine fishing encompassing 65 tilapia 16 silver carp and bighead carp 12 common carp and 1 6 anchovy after fish removal transplantation of the submerged macrophytes hydrilla verticillata and vallisneria denseserrulata was conducted vallisneria ramets were planted in the sediment at a density of about 10 15 plants per m 2 and apical sections of young h verticillata shoots were planted at a density of 20 30 plants m 2 juveniles of piscivorous fish 18 000 snakehead channa argus and 16 000 mandarin fish siniperca chuatsi 1500 and 1333 ha 1 respectively were stocked in rlake maintenance fishing was conducted after restoration to minimize the effects of fish recruitment using fish traps fish removed were mainly benthivorous tilapia and crucian carp ca 450 kg ha 1 year 1 meanwhile commercial fishing in the control lake basin clake was also conducted and the catches were about 500 kg ha 1 year 1 consisting mainly silver carp gao et al 2014 fish investigations conducted bimonthly from may 2010 march 2011 6 and 3 years after the first and second biomanipulation using multi mesh sized gill nets revealed that crucian carp common carp and snakehead dominated the catches in terms of biomass in the restored basin while planktivores silver carp long tailed anchovy white semiknife carp hemiculter leucisculus and crucian carp dominated in the unrestored basin no among site difference was recorded in total fish catches in terms of biomass gao et al 2014 2 3 sampling and analyses another basin pinghu clake which has an area of 57 ha and mean depth of 2 1 m fig 1 was used as a non restored reference lake and have been sampled monthly since 2005 excepting two samplings in august and october 2004 respectively in rlake sampling was undertaken 3 4 times per year before may 2007 when restoration was initiated weekly sampling was carried out during the early period of restoration but since august 2007 only monthly samplings had been conducted water temperature and secchi depth sd were recorded at each sampling event integrated water samples by mixing 5 l water samples collected from surface and at the depth of 0 5 m using a modified van dorn water sampler were used for under taking analyses of chemical variables including total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp soluble reactive phosphorus srp total suspended solids tss and inorganic suspended solids iss srp was determined spectrophotometrically according to the molybdenum blue method apha 1998 nh4 nconcentrationswere measured by the indophenol blue method and no3 n and no2 n concentrations were analysed by the cadmium reduction method apha 1998 tp tdp tn and tdn concentrations were determined after thawing of the frozen samples using persulfate digestion ebina et al 1983 followed by spectrophotometric analysis similar to the analyses for srp and nitrate tss were determined as matter retained on gf c filters after drying at 105 c for 24 h and iss at 550 c for 2 h chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in 90 hot ethanol pápista et al 2002 zooplankton were concentrated by filtering 20 l integrated lake water samples collected from the surface and at the depth of 0 5 musing a modified van dorn water sampler through a 20 μm mesh size and fixed in 5 formalin cladocerans and copepods were identified according to shen 1979 chiang and du 1979 and guo 1999 and counted under a dissection microscope dry weight of zooplankton was estimated according to length weight relationships huang 1999 zooplankton to phytoplankton ratio was calculated as zooplankton biomass chl a concentration 66 jeppesen et al 2005a during may 2010 to november 2011 submerged macrophytes were collected from 12 randomly selected locations in rlake using a quantitative iron clamp with an area of 0 06 m2 the collected submerged macrophytes were subsequently sorted dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighed to determine biomass dry weight 2 4 data analysis the boxplots were used to show the magnitude and direction of changes in different variables on an annual basis in order to statistically assess the changes occurring in two basins one restored and another one unrestored we compared time series data before and after restoration by particularly submerged macrophyte transplantation and piscivorous fish stocking and to account for problems connected with natural seasonal change we paired measurements from the restored basin with those from the unrestored basin control using the control treatment pairing design or bacip as described by stewart oaten et al 1986 the statistical model can be expressed as d i k x i c j x i r k μ η i ε i k where x stands for the parameter measured i denotes before or after c j denotes control site r k denotes restored site k denotes sampling time μ is the mean difference between control and restored η i is the change in difference from before to after and ε ik is the error associated with the difference measurements made for the period during the restoration in rlake from june 7 to september 6 2007 were excluded from the statistical analyses due to initial manipulation induced disturbances differences d ik between the before and after periods were compared using a two sample test if no impact from the restoration was registered the differences in the before period were assumed to be similar to those in the after period testing for a significant change in the restored basins was performed as a standard t test snedecor and cochran 1989 homogeneity of variances was tested by the folded f steel and torrie 1980 method to estimate unequal variances in the two groups of data welch satterthwaite approximation was used in the t test welch 1947 when testing for differences in abundance between different groups of zooplankton square root transformation was conducted before calculating differences the statistical software sas was applied for formal testing sas institute inc 2002 the difference was set to be significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 the water quality in rlake tp varied from 48 to 228 μg l 1 and averaged 126 μg l 1 before restoration after restoration tp dropped markedly in the restored site frequently reaching

cladocerans are chydorus sp alona spp diaphanosoma spp and m micrura albeit in low densities the highest number of cladocerans was recorded in august 2007 in the restoration period in rlake due to the occurrence of high numbers of moina micrura 120 ind l 1 after restoration the densities of cladocerans remained low most often 1 ind l 1 the dominant copepods were m thermocyclopoides t taihokuensis n schmackeri and p tunguidu the bacip analysis revealed no significant differences in total biomass between the restored cite and clake p 0 26 and for size of copepods p 0 41 fig 4 for the zooplankton

were observed in clake 4 discussion we found strong effects of the biomanipulation initiative encompassing removal of plankti benthivorous fish macrophyte transplantation and stocking of piscivorous fish this include substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in the concentrations of nutrients particularly tp phytoplankton chl a and turbidity tss while only minor changes were detected for the crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low biomasses and having small sizes before as well as after biomanipulation moreover apart from some few peaks in the zooplankton phytoplankton ratio the ratio was generally low indicating overall low grazing pressure by zooplankton on phytoplankton thus we found evidence for strong bottom up effects while top down effects apparently played a minor role in the improvement of the ecological status of the lake we observed a particularly strong decline in tss and iss which may reflect both a reduction in fish disturbance of the sediment due to the removal of benthivorous fish during and after restoration and more importantly a reduced risk of resuspension following the development of submerged macrophytes the dominant benthivorous fish were common carp and crucian carp that feed mainly on benthos richardson et al 1995 garcía berthou 2001 by sucking up sediments from where they pick up edible items and release the sediment to the water scott and crossman 1973 such feeding behaviour can cause high sediment resuspension both common carp breukelaar et al 1994 zambrano et al 2001 wahl et al 2011 and crucian carp richardson et al 1995 have been shown to cause high sediment resuspension in temperate lakes and resuspension may be even higher in warm lakes where the fish forage more actively due to the higher temperatures lankford and targett 1994 he et al 2017 tilapia can also suspend sediment and increase turbidity in shallow systems jiménez montealegre et al 2002 furthermore fish biomass values were high nearly 2500 kg ha 1 compared to most temperate lakes jeppesen and sammalkorpi 2002 re establishment of submerged macrophytes may further stabilize the sediment and it reduces sediment resuspension hamilton and mitchell 1996 several biomanipulation studies conducted world wide have observed effects on tss after removal of benthivorous fish meijer et al 1994 1999 jeppesen et al 2007 ibelings et al 2007 yu et al 2016a fish removal in temperate lakes has also resulted in major reductions in tn and tp jeppesen et al 2007 ibelings et al 2007 søndergaard et al 2008 in our study the most clear response emerged for tp which on average declined by 70 compared to both the level before restoration and the level in the reference lake fish feed on benthos and excrete nutrients in the water column and thus fish removal may reduce the translocation of nutrients from benthic habitats to water column glaholt and vanni 2005 vanni et al 2013 submerged macrophytes oxidize the sediment and increase its capacity of binding inorganic p there by reducing p release to the water column carpenter and lodge 1986 in our study the dominant species after plant introduction vallisnaria has relatively well developed root systems xie et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 and thus a high potential of oxidizing the sediment thereby reducing the p release jessen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 moreover high water clarity and improved light conditions may allow development of benthic algae and consequently cause a reduction in the sediment p release hansson 1990 genkai kato et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 in shallow lakes such as huizhou west lake in north temperate lakes appearance of large sized zooplankton has been shown to be of key importance for enhancing water clarity after biomanipulation the large sized zooplankton increase the grazing pressure on phytoplankton as has been evidenced in several studies by a major increase in the zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio and a larger body size of cladocerans hansson et al 1998 jeppesen et al 2004 2012 søndergaard et al 2008 higher water clarity in turn promotes growth of submerged macrophytes further stabilizing the lake ecosystem through a number of positive feedback mechanisms moss 1990 scheffer et al 1993 jeppesen et al 1998 in our study the phytoplankton biomass chl a also decreased substantially after biomanipulation however top down effects appeared to be of minor importance the evidence being that we found 1 no clear change in the zooplankton community the abundance of cladocerans remained low and small species such as chydorus sp alona spp and m micrura continued to dominate 2 no change in size of cladocerans or copepods and sizes was small and 3 the zooplankton phytoplankton ratio although increasing after restoration was low compared similar studied from north temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2007 this lack of response by the zooplankton may be attributed to continuously high fish predation although fishing continued even after restoration gao et al 2014 showed that fish biomass and densities remained unchanged in rlake comparing with that in unrestored control clake many of the fish species present in the study lakes spawn several times per year including crucian carp and tilapia pan et al 1991 gao et al 2014 and young of the year fish are thus abundant all year around to prey on the large bodied zooplankton as seen in other warm lakes havens and beaver 2011 meerhoff et al 2007 2012 gao et al 2014 it has been suggested that dominance of small bodied zooplankton maybe attributed to the higher temperatures which may render small sized forms superior competitors for physiological reasons moore et al 1996 but a recent study clearly indicates that large bodied zooplankton may become dominant even in warm lakes if fish predation is absent iglesias et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 consequently we attribute the low abundance and dominance of small sized zooplankton to continuously high fish predation after restoration submerged macrophytes can reduce phytoplankton through bottom up effects and consequently promote clear water due to both direct and indirect suppression jeppesen et al 1998 yu et al 2016a as the fish biomass and densities remained unchanged in rlake and similar to those in unrestored control clake gao et al 2014 submerged macrophytes likely played a key role in maintaining the clear water state in rlake after restoration macrophytes and associated periphyton may compete with phytoplankton for nutrients sand jensen and borum 1991 reduce phosphorus availability for phytoplankton through diminished nutrient release from the sediment or produce allelopathic substances against phytoplankton gross et al 2007 the unchanged chl a to tp ratio indicates however that allelopathic effects did not play an important role in controlling phytoplankton biomass in our restored basin following the restoration the tn tp ratio rose in both basins relative to the unrestored site significantly in only one of the basins which might indicate less limitation of phytoplankton by nitrogen nitrate nitrogen was also lower not least in the winter season however as no change occurred in chl a tp with decreasing chl a tn and as the tn tp ratio increased after restoration we suggest that bottom up effects through reduced phosphorus availability are the likely main mechanisms behind the phytoplankton reduction after restoration in huizhou west lake due to lack of efficient grazers improved light conditions mediated by a reduction in the concentrations of suspended solids due to the reduction in benthivorous fish stock may potentially favour phytoplankton growth if natural colonization of macrophytes is delayed speeding up the re establishment of submerged macrophytes via transplantation may therefore be a useful tool in restoring and maintaining the clear state in warm lakes the re establishment of the restored clear state in huizhou west lake may in part be due to the high coverage and dominance of vallisneria vallisneria is well rooted and is a meadow forming species with a high capacity of reducing sediment resuspension from fish tilapia and common carp graze submerged macrophytes to a certain degree petr 2000 miller and provenza 2007 rao et al 2015 yu et al 2016b but vallisneria is less vulnerable to grazing than hydrilla van et al 1998 another factor may be the maintenance fishing of mainly tilapia and crucian carp ca 450 kg ha 1 year 1 in the restored sites following the restoration gao et al 2014 our results have important implications for lake restoration not least in asia where natural lakes so far have been used extensively for fish production with often massive stocking of benthivorous fish with a growing economy and the development of more efficient fish production systems the interest in restoring lakes is increasing scientists not least in china have argued for massive stocking of silver carp and bighead carp to control phytoplankton growth and not least nuisance cyanobacteria this suggestion is supported by analyses using minimal models with all their limitations attayde et al 2010 whereas the results of field experiments are ambiguous and mostly negative wang et al 2008 our results together with those of later biomanipulation experiments in chinese lakes and mesocosm studies yu et al 2016a he et al 2018 provide strong evidence that fish removal combined with transplantation of submerged macrophytes may have strong effects on the water clarity in warm shallow lakes despite a low zooplankton grazing potential which is probably due to high fish predation on the zooplankton 5 conclusions biomanipulation via removal of a substantial amount of plankti benthivorous fish followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish was conducted to restore a shallow eutrophic lake in tropical china we found strong effects of the restoration initiative in the form of substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in nutrient concentrations particularly total phosphorus phytoplankton and turbidity no effects were detected for crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low densities before as well as after the restoration our results suggest that the success of the restoration resulted from the increased bottom up effects through reduced sediment resuspension and nutrient release rather than increased top down effects observed in temperate lakes our results add to the existing knowledge of restoration of warm lakes and are strongly relevant not least in asia where natural lakes frequently are used extensively for fish production often involving massive stocking of benthivorous fish acknowledgements the authors thank a m

19269,fish manipulation has been used to restore lakes in the temperate zone often strong short term cascading effects have been obtained but the long term perspectives are less clear fish manipulation methods are far less advanced for warm lakes and it is debatable whether it is in fact possible to create a trophic cascade in warm lakes due to the dominance and high densities of fast reproducing omnivorous fish however removal of benthic feeding fish also reduce disturbance of the sediment which not only affects the nutrient level but also the concentration of suspended organic and inorganic matter with enhanced water clarity and potentially better growth conditions for submerged macrophytes we conducted a biomanipulation experiment in one of the basins in chinese huizhou west lake that have remained highly turbid after extensive nutrient loading reduction another basin was used as control control treatment pairing design removal of a substantial amount of plankti benthivorous fish was followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish we found strong and relatively long lasting effects of the restoration initiative in the form of substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in nutrient concentrations particularly total phosphorus phytoplankton and turbidity while only minor effects were detected for crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low densities before as well as after the restoration our results add importantly to the existing knowledge of restoration of warm lakes and are strongly relevant not least in asia where natural lakes frequently are used extensively for fish production often involving massive stocking of benthivorous fish with a growing economy and development of more efficient fish production systems the interest in restoring lakes is increasing world wide we found convincing evidence that fish removal and piscivores stocking combined with transplantation of submerged macrophytes may have significant effects on water clarity in warm shallow lakes even if the zooplankton grazing potential remains low the latter most likely as a result of high predation on the zooplankton graphical abstract image 1 keywords lake restoration biomanipulation implantation of macrophytes tropical lake 1 introduction for 50 100 years eutrophication has posed a serious threat to lakes world wide high nutrient loading has resulted in turbid water excessive blooms of nuisance algae dominance of planktivorous and benthivorous fish and loss of biodiversity while countries in the developing world face an alarming increase in eutrophication of lakes as a result of the rapid economic development large efforts have been devoted to combat eutrophication by reducing the external loading of especially phosphorus p not least in western europe and north america sas 1989 jeppesen et al 2005a schindler 2009 in consequence the p loading from sewage and industrial sources has declined significantly since the 1970s overviews in sas 1989 jeppesen et al 2005b this has led to a reduced phytoplankton abundance lower cyanobacteria dominance and often a shift in fish community structure towards lower abundance and proportions of planktivorous and benthivorous fish with a resulting reduced predation on zooplankton however many lakes have responded slowly to nutrient loading reduction marsden 1989 sas 1989 jeppesen et al 2005a b partly due to internal p loading release from the stored p pool in the sediment søndergaard et al 2013 and to biological resistance jeppesen and sammalkorpi 2002 the latter reflects that fish after an external nutrient loading reduction may exert a continuous predation pressure on large bodied grazers e g daphnia and thereby maintain the grazing pressure on phytoplankton at a low level diminishing also the number of benthic animals that stabilize and oxidize the sediment furthermore persistence of benthivores e g carp cyprinus carpio bream abramis brama that stir up the sediment while feeding and translocate nutrients from the sediment to the water meijer et al 1994 breukelaar et al 1994 contributes to maintain high internal p loading and high inorganic turbidity moreover grazing by herbivorous waterfowl such as coot fulica atra and mute swan cygnus olor may hamper recovery by delaying the recolonization of submerged plants perrow et al 1997 mitchell and perrow 1998 to re enforce recovery several physico chemical and biological methods have been used for an overview see cooke et al 2005 the typical measure applied to overcome biological resistance is removal of plankti benthivorous fish this method has been extensively used in north temperate lakes particularly in europe removal of approx 75 of the plankti benthivorous fish stock over a 1 2 year period has been recommended to avoid regrowth and to stimulate the growth of potentially piscivorous fish hansson et al 1998 jeppesen and sammalkorpi 2002 mehner et al 2002 gulati et al 2008 an alternative or supplementary method to fish removal is stocking of piscivores for a review see drenner and hambright 1999 to reinforce recovery of submerged macrophytes active planting entire plants turions plant fragments or seeds has been used jeppesen et al 2012 in some cases also by constructing plant exclosures to protect the macrophytes against grazing by waterfowl and fish søndergaard et al 1996 in the exclosures the macrophytes can grow in a grazing free environment from where they may spread seeds turions or plant fragments to the entire lake thereby augmenting the chances of successful colonization søndergaard et al 1996 mitchell and perrow 1998 lauridsen et al 2003 in north temperate lakes efficient fish reduction in eutrophic lakes has generally often led to major cascading effects in the form of reduced phytoplankton biomass dominance by large sized zooplankton and improved transparency carpenter and kitchell 1993 hansson et al 1998 søndergaard et al 2008 bernes et al 2015 although there are also examples of little or no cascading effects for various reasons horppila et al 1998 jeppesen and sammelkorpi 2002 søndergaard et al 2008 the effects of fish manipulation may cascade to the nutrient level as well a reduction ranging from 30 to 50 in lake concentrations of tp has been recorded in the relatively successful fish manipulation experiments conducted in shallow and stratified eutrophic lakes søndergaard et al 2008 a significant contributory factor is increased growth of microbenthic algae owing to improved light conditions at the sediment surface hansson 1990 genkai kato et al 2012 more benthic algae and less sedimentation of phytoplankton due to intensified grazing and more benthic animals due to reduced fish predation may all result in a higher redox potential in the surface sediment potentially reducing the p release søndergaard et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 2017 so far the long term perspectives of fish removal are less promising a gradual return to the turbid state and higher abundance of zooplanktivorous fish after 5 10 years have been reported in many case studies søndergaard et al 2008 moreover stocking of piscivorous fish has often been less successful than fish removal drenner and hambright 1999 experience with lake recovery is far less advanced for warm than for temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2005b 2012 studies conducted in sub tropical and mediterranean lakes have shown that nutrient loading reduction may improve the ecological state via a declining algal biomass and increased water transparency jeppesen et al 2005a coveney et al 2005 romo et al 2005 beklioğlu and tan 2008 however it is debatable whether the fish manipulation approach used in cold temperate lakes to re enforce recovery can be used with success in warm lakes as well jeppesen et al 2005b 2012 the high species richness and high densities of plankti benthivorous fish with dominance of omnivores a few efficient predators and several cohorts lead to higher predation on zooplankton in warm lakes than in temperate lakes lazzaro 1997 meerhoff et al 2003 2007 teixeira de mello et al 2009 it is therefore likely that a removal induced reduction of the biomass of planktivorous fish will be compensated by fast adjustment of the remaining population and the impact will consequently be of short duration jeppesen et al 2012 hence it may be more difficult to provoke and maintain a pelagic trophic cascade effect in subtropical and tropical lakes than in temperate lakes however an important effect of removal of benthic feeding fish such as carp and bream is reduced stirring of the sediment which not only affects lake nutrient levels but also the concentration of suspended organic and inorganic matter breukelaar et al 1994 horppila et al 1998 not least in systems with high dominance of carp either naturally or stocked as is the case for many chinese lakes jia et al 2013 carp removal may potentially lead to substantial improvement of lake water quality due to a reduced disturbance in the present study we conducted a biomanipulation experiment in a basin of chinese huizhou west lake that has remained highly turbid after an extensive nutrient loading reduction li et al 2007 removal of plankti benthivorous fish was followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish our working hypothesis was that albeit a major trophic cascade mediated by enhanced zooplankton grazing due to the high density of small fish in warm freshwaters could not be expected plankti benthivorous fish reduction through direct removal and stocking of piscivorous fish would lead to clear water conditions and low nutrient levels due to reduced disturbance of the sediment and water clarity would be maintained via introduction of submerged macrophytes 2 material and methods 2 1 study site huizhou west lake is a tropical shallow lake located in the city of huizhou 23 06 24 23 04 43 n 114 22 44 114 24 03 e in the guangdong province southern china fig 1 which is characterized by a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate the multiannual mean air temperature is 21 7 c the lowest monthly mean is 13 1 c in january and the highest monthly mean 28 3 c in july the multi annual mean precipitation is 1649 mm of which about 80 falls during april to august the lake has a total surface area of about 1 5 km2 and a mean depth of 1 6 m the lake is divided into several basins connected through waterways under bridges the water temperature ranges from 12 to 35 c the hydraulic retention time is about three months li et al 2007 due to its city location the lake has long been a valuable part of are creational garden that is extensively used by the local population however the lake has become eutrophic due to input of wastewater from huizhou city to restore the lake several measures have been implemented since the 1990s including wastewater treatment effluent diversion and sediment removal li et al 2007 but with no substantial effect the lake has remained eutrophic and turbid total phosphorus typically ranges between 100 and 200 μg l 1 total nitrogen between 1 0 and 2 5 mg l 1 chlorophyll a between 30 and 70 μg l and total suspended solids between 20 and 90 mgl 1 secchi depth is as low as 30 40 cm the fish communities are dominated by omnivorous and plankti benthivorous fish including tilapia oreochromis niloticus common carp cyprinus carpio crucian carp carassius carassiu mud carp cirrhina molitorella silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix bighead carp aristichthys nobilis and long tailed anchovy coilia grayii gao et al 2014 common zooplankton include small sized cladocerans such as chydorus sp alona spp bosmina spp diaphanosoma spp and moina micrura and the dominant copepods are mesocyclops thermocyclopoides allodiaptomus specillodactylus neodiaptomus schmackeri and phyllodiaptomu stunguidus there are no submerged macrophytes and the phytoplankton is dominated by gleobacterviolaceus pseudoanabaena merismopedia and dactylococcopsis 2 2 biomanipulation to improve water quality and especially the clarity of the lake large scale ecological restoration biomanipulation experiments were conducted in a basins with a surface water area of 12 ha rlake in 2007 fig 1 rlake was connected with the rest of the lake by waterways under bridges before restorations in rlake the biomanipulation included removal of plankti benthivorous fish stocking of piscivorous fish and transplantation of submerged macrophytes the lake basin was isolated from the rest of the lake by building a small soil dam under the bridge in may 2007 after lowering the water level by 50 cm a total of 29 7t 2 5 t ha 1 fish were removed by seine fishing encompassing 65 tilapia 16 silver carp and bighead carp 12 common carp and 1 6 anchovy after fish removal transplantation of the submerged macrophytes hydrilla verticillata and vallisneria denseserrulata was conducted vallisneria ramets were planted in the sediment at a density of about 10 15 plants per m 2 and apical sections of young h verticillata shoots were planted at a density of 20 30 plants m 2 juveniles of piscivorous fish 18 000 snakehead channa argus and 16 000 mandarin fish siniperca chuatsi 1500 and 1333 ha 1 respectively were stocked in rlake maintenance fishing was conducted after restoration to minimize the effects of fish recruitment using fish traps fish removed were mainly benthivorous tilapia and crucian carp ca 450 kg ha 1 year 1 meanwhile commercial fishing in the control lake basin clake was also conducted and the catches were about 500 kg ha 1 year 1 consisting mainly silver carp gao et al 2014 fish investigations conducted bimonthly from may 2010 march 2011 6 and 3 years after the first and second biomanipulation using multi mesh sized gill nets revealed that crucian carp common carp and snakehead dominated the catches in terms of biomass in the restored basin while planktivores silver carp long tailed anchovy white semiknife carp hemiculter leucisculus and crucian carp dominated in the unrestored basin no among site difference was recorded in total fish catches in terms of biomass gao et al 2014 2 3 sampling and analyses another basin pinghu clake which has an area of 57 ha and mean depth of 2 1 m fig 1 was used as a non restored reference lake and have been sampled monthly since 2005 excepting two samplings in august and october 2004 respectively in rlake sampling was undertaken 3 4 times per year before may 2007 when restoration was initiated weekly sampling was carried out during the early period of restoration but since august 2007 only monthly samplings had been conducted water temperature and secchi depth sd were recorded at each sampling event integrated water samples by mixing 5 l water samples collected from surface and at the depth of 0 5 m using a modified van dorn water sampler were used for under taking analyses of chemical variables including total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp soluble reactive phosphorus srp total suspended solids tss and inorganic suspended solids iss srp was determined spectrophotometrically according to the molybdenum blue method apha 1998 nh4 nconcentrationswere measured by the indophenol blue method and no3 n and no2 n concentrations were analysed by the cadmium reduction method apha 1998 tp tdp tn and tdn concentrations were determined after thawing of the frozen samples using persulfate digestion ebina et al 1983 followed by spectrophotometric analysis similar to the analyses for srp and nitrate tss were determined as matter retained on gf c filters after drying at 105 c for 24 h and iss at 550 c for 2 h chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in 90 hot ethanol pápista et al 2002 zooplankton were concentrated by filtering 20 l integrated lake water samples collected from the surface and at the depth of 0 5 musing a modified van dorn water sampler through a 20 μm mesh size and fixed in 5 formalin cladocerans and copepods were identified according to shen 1979 chiang and du 1979 and guo 1999 and counted under a dissection microscope dry weight of zooplankton was estimated according to length weight relationships huang 1999 zooplankton to phytoplankton ratio was calculated as zooplankton biomass chl a concentration 66 jeppesen et al 2005a during may 2010 to november 2011 submerged macrophytes were collected from 12 randomly selected locations in rlake using a quantitative iron clamp with an area of 0 06 m2 the collected submerged macrophytes were subsequently sorted dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighed to determine biomass dry weight 2 4 data analysis the boxplots were used to show the magnitude and direction of changes in different variables on an annual basis in order to statistically assess the changes occurring in two basins one restored and another one unrestored we compared time series data before and after restoration by particularly submerged macrophyte transplantation and piscivorous fish stocking and to account for problems connected with natural seasonal change we paired measurements from the restored basin with those from the unrestored basin control using the control treatment pairing design or bacip as described by stewart oaten et al 1986 the statistical model can be expressed as d i k x i c j x i r k μ η i ε i k where x stands for the parameter measured i denotes before or after c j denotes control site r k denotes restored site k denotes sampling time μ is the mean difference between control and restored η i is the change in difference from before to after and ε ik is the error associated with the difference measurements made for the period during the restoration in rlake from june 7 to september 6 2007 were excluded from the statistical analyses due to initial manipulation induced disturbances differences d ik between the before and after periods were compared using a two sample test if no impact from the restoration was registered the differences in the before period were assumed to be similar to those in the after period testing for a significant change in the restored basins was performed as a standard t test snedecor and cochran 1989 homogeneity of variances was tested by the folded f steel and torrie 1980 method to estimate unequal variances in the two groups of data welch satterthwaite approximation was used in the t test welch 1947 when testing for differences in abundance between different groups of zooplankton square root transformation was conducted before calculating differences the statistical software sas was applied for formal testing sas institute inc 2002 the difference was set to be significant when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 the water quality in rlake tp varied from 48 to 228 μg l 1 and averaged 126 μg l 1 before restoration after restoration tp dropped markedly in the restored site frequently reaching values lower than 50 μg l 1 while the concentrations in clake remained within the range of 52 340 μg l 1 accordingly the bacip analysis revealed a significant drop in tp in the restored site t 4 24 df

cladocerans are chydorus sp alona spp diaphanosoma spp and m micrura albeit in low densities the highest number of cladocerans was recorded in august 2007 in the restoration period in rlake due to the occurrence of high numbers of moina micrura 120 ind l 1 after restoration the densities of cladocerans remained low most often 1 ind l 1 the dominant copepods were m thermocyclopoides t taihokuensis n schmackeri and p tunguidu the bacip analysis revealed no significant differences in total biomass between the restored cite and clake p 0 26 and for size of copepods p 0 41 fig 4 for the zooplankton

were observed in clake 4 discussion we found strong effects of the biomanipulation initiative encompassing removal of plankti benthivorous fish macrophyte transplantation and stocking of piscivorous fish this include substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in the concentrations of nutrients particularly tp phytoplankton chl a and turbidity tss while only minor changes were detected for the crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low biomasses and having small sizes before as well as after biomanipulation moreover apart from some few peaks in the zooplankton phytoplankton ratio the ratio was generally low indicating overall low grazing pressure by zooplankton on phytoplankton thus we found evidence for strong bottom up effects while top down effects apparently played a minor role in the improvement of the ecological status of the lake we observed a particularly strong decline in tss and iss which may reflect both a reduction in fish disturbance of the sediment due to the removal of benthivorous fish during and after restoration and more importantly a reduced risk of resuspension following the development of submerged macrophytes the dominant benthivorous fish were common carp and crucian carp that feed mainly on benthos richardson et al 1995 garcía berthou 2001 by sucking up sediments from where they pick up edible items and release the sediment to the water scott and crossman 1973 such feeding behaviour can cause high sediment resuspension both common carp breukelaar et al 1994 zambrano et al 2001 wahl et al 2011 and crucian carp richardson et al 1995 have been shown to cause high sediment resuspension in temperate lakes and resuspension may be even higher in warm lakes where the fish forage more actively due to the higher temperatures lankford and targett 1994 he et al 2017 tilapia can also suspend sediment and increase turbidity in shallow systems jiménez montealegre et al 2002 furthermore fish biomass values were high nearly 2500 kg ha 1 compared to most temperate lakes jeppesen and sammalkorpi 2002 re establishment of submerged macrophytes may further stabilize the sediment and it reduces sediment resuspension hamilton and mitchell 1996 several biomanipulation studies conducted world wide have observed effects on tss after removal of benthivorous fish meijer et al 1994 1999 jeppesen et al 2007 ibelings et al 2007 yu et al 2016a fish removal in temperate lakes has also resulted in major reductions in tn and tp jeppesen et al 2007 ibelings et al 2007 søndergaard et al 2008 in our study the most clear response emerged for tp which on average declined by 70 compared to both the level before restoration and the level in the reference lake fish feed on benthos and excrete nutrients in the water column and thus fish removal may reduce the translocation of nutrients from benthic habitats to water column glaholt and vanni 2005 vanni et al 2013 submerged macrophytes oxidize the sediment and increase its capacity of binding inorganic p there by reducing p release to the water column carpenter and lodge 1986 in our study the dominant species after plant introduction vallisnaria has relatively well developed root systems xie et al 2005 zhang et al 2010 and thus a high potential of oxidizing the sediment thereby reducing the p release jessen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 moreover high water clarity and improved light conditions may allow development of benthic algae and consequently cause a reduction in the sediment p release hansson 1990 genkai kato et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 in shallow lakes such as huizhou west lake in north temperate lakes appearance of large sized zooplankton has been shown to be of key importance for enhancing water clarity after biomanipulation the large sized zooplankton increase the grazing pressure on phytoplankton as has been evidenced in several studies by a major increase in the zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio and a larger body size of cladocerans hansson et al 1998 jeppesen et al 2004 2012 søndergaard et al 2008 higher water clarity in turn promotes growth of submerged macrophytes further stabilizing the lake ecosystem through a number of positive feedback mechanisms moss 1990 scheffer et al 1993 jeppesen et al 1998 in our study the phytoplankton biomass chl a also decreased substantially after biomanipulation however top down effects appeared to be of minor importance the evidence being that we found 1 no clear change in the zooplankton community the abundance of cladocerans remained low and small species such as chydorus sp alona spp and m micrura continued to dominate 2 no change in size of cladocerans or copepods and sizes was small and 3 the zooplankton phytoplankton ratio although increasing after restoration was low compared similar studied from north temperate lakes jeppesen et al 2007 this lack of response by the zooplankton may be attributed to continuously high fish predation although fishing continued even after restoration gao et al 2014 showed that fish biomass and densities remained unchanged in rlake comparing with that in unrestored control clake many of the fish species present in the study lakes spawn several times per year including crucian carp and tilapia pan et al 1991 gao et al 2014 and young of the year fish are thus abundant all year around to prey on the large bodied zooplankton as seen in other warm lakes havens and beaver 2011 meerhoff et al 2007 2012 gao et al 2014 it has been suggested that dominance of small bodied zooplankton maybe attributed to the higher temperatures which may render small sized forms superior competitors for physiological reasons moore et al 1996 but a recent study clearly indicates that large bodied zooplankton may become dominant even in warm lakes if fish predation is absent iglesias et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 consequently we attribute the low abundance and dominance of small sized zooplankton to continuously high fish predation after restoration submerged macrophytes can reduce phytoplankton through bottom up effects and consequently promote clear water due to both direct and indirect suppression jeppesen et al 1998 yu et al 2016a as the fish biomass and densities remained unchanged in rlake and similar to those in unrestored control clake gao et al 2014 submerged macrophytes likely played a key role in maintaining the clear water state in rlake after restoration macrophytes and associated periphyton may compete with phytoplankton for nutrients sand jensen and borum 1991 reduce phosphorus availability for phytoplankton through diminished nutrient release from the sediment or produce allelopathic substances against phytoplankton gross et al 2007 the unchanged chl a to tp ratio indicates however that allelopathic effects did not play an important role in controlling phytoplankton biomass in our restored basin following the restoration the tn tp ratio rose in both basins relative to the unrestored site significantly in only one of the basins which might indicate less limitation of phytoplankton by nitrogen nitrate nitrogen was also lower not least in the winter season however as no change occurred in chl a tp with decreasing chl a tn and as the tn tp ratio increased after restoration we suggest that bottom up effects through reduced phosphorus availability are the likely main mechanisms behind the phytoplankton reduction after restoration in huizhou west lake due to lack of efficient grazers improved light conditions mediated by a reduction in the concentrations of suspended solids due to the reduction in benthivorous fish stock may potentially favour phytoplankton growth if natural colonization of macrophytes is delayed speeding up the re establishment of submerged macrophytes via transplantation may therefore be a useful tool in restoring and maintaining the clear state in warm lakes the re establishment of the restored clear state in huizhou west lake may in part be due to the high coverage and dominance of vallisneria vallisneria is well rooted and is a meadow forming species with a high capacity of reducing sediment resuspension from fish tilapia and common carp graze submerged macrophytes to a certain degree petr 2000 miller and provenza 2007 rao et al 2015 yu et al 2016b but vallisneria is less vulnerable to grazing than hydrilla van et al 1998 another factor may be the maintenance fishing of mainly tilapia and crucian carp ca 450 kg ha 1 year 1 in the restored sites following the restoration gao et al 2014 our results have important implications for lake restoration not least in asia where natural lakes so far have been used extensively for fish production with often massive stocking of benthivorous fish with a growing economy and the development of more efficient fish production systems the interest in restoring lakes is increasing scientists not least in china have argued for massive stocking of silver carp and bighead carp to control phytoplankton growth and not least nuisance cyanobacteria this suggestion is supported by analyses using minimal models with all their limitations attayde et al 2010 whereas the results of field experiments are ambiguous and mostly negative wang et al 2008 our results together with those of later biomanipulation experiments in chinese lakes and mesocosm studies yu et al 2016a he et al 2018 provide strong evidence that fish removal combined with transplantation of submerged macrophytes may have strong effects on the water clarity in warm shallow lakes despite a low zooplankton grazing potential which is probably due to high fish predation on the zooplankton 5 conclusions biomanipulation via removal of a substantial amount of plankti benthivorous fish followed by planting of submerged macrophytes and stocking of piscivorous fish was conducted to restore a shallow eutrophic lake in tropical china we found strong effects of the restoration initiative in the form of substantial improvements in water clarity and major reductions in nutrient concentrations particularly total phosphorus phytoplankton and turbidity no effects were detected for crustacean zooplankton grazers occurring in low densities before as well as after the restoration our results suggest that the success of the restoration resulted from the increased bottom up effects through reduced sediment resuspension and nutrient release rather than increased top down effects observed in temperate lakes our results add to the existing knowledge of restoration of warm lakes and are strongly relevant not least in asia where natural lakes frequently are used extensively for fish production often involving massive stocking of benthivorous fish acknowledgements the authors thank a m
