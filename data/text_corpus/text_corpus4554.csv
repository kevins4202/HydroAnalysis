22770,the cloaking phenomenon in arrays of truncated surface piercing cylinders under different wave directions is investigated by numerical and experimental methods two arrangements consisting of an inner cylinder surrounded by either four or eight outer cylinders are considered to confirm this cloaking phenomenon and to find the effect of the wave direction the cloaking configurations of the cylinders for a certain wave frequency and a certain wave direction are determined via a real coded genetic algorithm to minimize the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array experiments in a wave basin are designed to measure the free surface elevation at multiple locations in the vicinity of the inner cylinder and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at various wavenumbers under different wave directions both the wave drift force and the wave elevation show good agreement between the numerical and experimental results it is found that the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder in a cloaking configuration is due to the improvement of the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder furthermore the effect of the wave direction on the cloaking phenomenon is significant for the configuration with four outer cylinders but it is negligible for eight outer cylinders keywords truncated cylinders cloaking wave drift force free surface elevation wave direction effect 1 introduction recently the hydrodynamic interactions among column based structures such as semisubmersible platforms have attracted the attention of many researchers the positioning problem for a floating structure in waves faced with wave drift forces and rotational moments is a challenging problem in offshore engineering to reduce the mooring load reducing the wave drift force is critical and this can be achieved via a novel phenomenon called cloaking in a water wave field the term cloaking means that no wave is scattered outside in the form of radial outgoing waves among other issues the wave elevation in the vicinity of the structure is of particular interest in a cloaking scenario the cloaking phenomenon was first derived by pendry et al 2006 for an electromagnetic field and was later experimentally certified by schurig et alschurig et al 2006 this concept was subsequently introduced into other types of wave fields such as acoustic cummer and schurig 2007 chen and chan 2007 optic leonhardt 2006 cai et al 2007 elastic farhat et al 2009 milton et al 2010 and seismic brûlé et al 2014 wave fields the first study in a water wave field was carried out by farhat et al farhat et al 2008 in which an array of vertical rigid inclusions piercing the free surface was used to realize circular cloaking since then some other ideas have been put forward for controlling the propagation of surface gravity waves alam alam 2012 considered transforming surface gravity waves into internal waves by installing ripples on the bottom of floating body containing areas porter and newman 2014 cloaked a bottomed mounted cylinder by varying the bathymetry in an annular region outside the cylinder dupont et al 2015 numerically and experimentally studied an invisibility carpet in a wave tank for linear waves and dupont et al 2016 later investigated the cloaking phenomenon for a vertical cylinder surrounded by an annular structure via homogenization in the mild slope equation zareei and alam 2015 realized cloaking with a nonlinear medium transformation by changing the depth in shallow waters iida and kashiwagi 2016 2017 considered utilizing either an anisotropic fluid or a small channel network to achieve cloaking in shallow water all in all various methods have been proposed to achieve the cloaking phenomenon in a water wave field among these methods inspired by farhat et al 2008 newman 2014 introduced additional floating bodies surrounding a truncated surface piercing cylinder to achieve cloaking in deep water and showed that almost no scattered waves radiated outside the floating cylinder array although mciver 2014 theoretically proved that perfect cloaking is not possible for the circular array configurations investigated by newman 2014 a practical reduction in the scattered wave energy can be realized by optimizing the geometry of the outer cylinders based on the configuration proposed by newman 2014 iida et al 2014 numerically confirmed that not only the wave drift force acting on the entire cylinder array but also that acting on the inner cylinder can be significantly reduced to almost zero via this phenomenon subsequently zhang et al 2017 found a periodic quasi cloaking phenomenon with varying distance between the inner and outer cylinders some experiments on the cloaking phenomenon for multiple bodies have also been carried out iida et al 2015 conducted an experiment to certify the numerical accuracy of the wave elevation in a cloaking configuration with eight outer cylinders and confirmed the conclusion obtained in iida et al 2014 read et al 2016 performed a further experimental investigation of the cloaking phenomenon for a circular cylinder surrounded by a circumferential array of eight cylinders in read et al 2016 the wave elevation outside the model and the wave drift forces on both the cloaked structure and the uncloaked structure were measured in addition potential interferences that may have compromised the measurements were discussed however in both iida et al 2015 and read et al 2016 the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder was not measured the relationship between the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder and the corresponding wave pattern was also not clear moreover the wave elevation was measured under only one wave condition although the cloaking phenomenon for a truncated surface piercing cylinder surrounded by other geometry optimized cylinders has been studied by some scholars many issues still require further study first in the previous studies the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder and the wave elevation were independently investigated by both numerical and experimental methods the relationship between these two factors is still not clearly understood second the cloaking phenomenon was achieved only for a certain wave direction however the question of whether this phenomenon will occur under other wave headings has not been studied third the investigation of the wave elevation for the cloaking configuration studied in the previous experiments was limited to a certain wavenumber for the condition with eight outer cylinders the wave elevations at various wavenumbers with different numbers of outer cylinders have not been investigated moreover the effect of the wave direction on the cloaking phenomenon in cases with different numbers of outer cylinders has also not been studied therefore in this paper the optimized geometries for cloaking configurations with four and eight outer cylinders are investigated based on the combination of a real coded genetic algorithm developed in zhang et al 2018 and wave interaction theory to minimize the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array then the relationship between the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder and the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder in each cloaking configuration is numerically studied in order to figure out how many outer cylinders is enough for the cloaking phenomenon when taking the wave direction effects into account the wave direction effects on the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder are investigated finally an experiment in a wave basin is conducted to confirm this phenomenon and to validate the wave direction effects by comparing the measured wave elevation and the measured wave drift force on the inner cylinder with the corresponding numerical results 2 theory 2 1 arrangements two configurations in which a fixed truncated cylinder is regularly surrounded by four n 4 or eight n 8 outer cylinders that are placed in a circle are considered both the diameter and draft of the inner cylinder are normalized to unity 2r 0 1 0 and d 0 1 0 the radius r out and the draft d out of the outer cylinders and the distance r between the inner and outer cylinders as shown in fig 1 are set as variables to be optimized to minimize the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array by a genetic algorithm all geometric dimensions of the outer floating bodies are normalized with respect to the draft of the inner cylinder 2 2 real coded genetic algorithm genetic algorithm is a heuristic search which mimics the process of natural selection the algorithm includes several parts such as initial population selection crossover and mutation operators elitism termination et al in this study three parameters r out d out and r are chosen as the variables while the scattered wave energy of the cylinders array is chosen as the objective function more detailed information of this optimization algorithm and it s validation can be found in zhang et al 2018 2 3 wave drift force to accurately simulate these complicated multi body problems two coordinate systems are introduced as shown in fig 2 one is the global coordinate system o xyz with respect to the center cylinder and the other is the local coordinate system o n x n y n z n fixed at the center of the n th cylinder in addition to cartesian coordinate systems of the form o xyz cylindrical coordinate systems of the form o rθz are used where x r cosθ and y r sinθ the positive direction of the z axis is in the downward vertical direction and the origin of each coordinate system z 0 is placed on an undisturbed free surface under the assumption of an incompressible and inviscid flow with irrotational motion a velocity potential φ x y z t can be introduced laplace s equation is taken as the governing equation of the flow field to establish this boundary value problem with linearized boundary conditions based on the principle of linear superposition the velocity potential can be expressed as follows 1 φ x y z t re g η 0 i ω φ p e i ω t where 2 φ p φ i p ψ p here re in eq 1 indicates that the real part of the quantity in square brackets is to be taken η 0 and ω denote the amplitude and circular frequency respectively of the incident waves g is the gravitational acceleration p r θ z is a field point in the flow and φ p is the sum of the incident wave potential φ i p and the disturbance potential ψ p the incident wave potential φ i p can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates as follows 3 φ i p cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x cos β y sin β m α m z 0 z j m k 0 r e i m θ where 4 α m e i m β π 2 z 0 z cosh k 0 z h cos k 0 h 5 k ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h here β is the angle of the incident wave relative to the x axis and h denotes the water depth which is assumed to be finite the bessel function of the first kind of order m is denoted by j m k 0 r ψ p represents the disturbance diffraction potential due to the presence of multiple floating bodies in the incident waves only the diffraction problem is taken into account the cylinders are assumed to be fixed more details can be found in kagemoto and yue 1986 according to kagemoto and yue 1986 the hydrodynamic interactions among all bodies should be taken into account due to the existence of n cylinders around the inner cylinder the total disturbance potential ψ p has the following form 6 ψ p n 1 n 1 ψ n p n 1 n 1 l a l n z 0 z h l 2 k 0 r n e i l θ n here a l n denotes the complex amplitude of the scattered progressive waves around the n th cylinder a l n can be solved using a higher order boundary element method hobem as reported by kashiwagi 1995 the hankel function of the second kind of order l is denoted by h l 2 k 0 r n by rewriting the disturbance potential induced by the n th cylinder in the global cylindrical coordinate system o rθz the disturbance potential ψ p can be expressed in the following form 7 ψ p m a m z 0 z h m 2 k 0 r e i m θ where 8 a m n 1 n 1 l a l n j l m k 0 l n o e i l m α n o with the introduction of the velocity potential φ p as the sum of the incident wave potential and the disturbance wave potential an asymptotic expression for the entire velocity potential established in the far field outside of a fictitious vertical circular cylinder encompassing all bodies can be given in the following form 9 φ p φ i p ψ p m α m j m k 0 r a m h m 2 k 0 r z 0 z e i m θ furthermore to obtain the wave drift force acting on each body separately e g on the n th cylinder by means of the far field method a control surface encompassing only the n th cylinder should be considered in this case the disturbance potential must be described in the n th local coordinate system the incident wave potential of the n th cylinder consists of not only the wave potential coming from the outside but also the disturbance wave potential due to the other cylinders therefore the velocity potential around the n th cylinder can be expressed as follows 10 ϕ n p ψ i n p ψ n p ϕ i n p k 1 k n n 1 ψ k n p ψ n p m α m n k 1 k n n 1 a m k n j m k 0 r n a m n h m 2 k 0 r n z 0 z e i m θ n where 11 a m k n l a l k h l m 2 k 0 l k n e i l m α k n 12 α m n α m e i k 0 x o n cos β y o n sin β then the wave drift force can be computed from quadratic products of the velocity potential at a surface surrounding the cylinder of interest this approach is known as the far field method and was first proposed by maruo 1960 based on the velocity potential expressed in the cylindrical coordinate system as in eq 10 the integrals with respect to z and θ appearing in the formula can be performed at an appropriate distance r the wave drift force has been provided by kashiwagi and yoshida 2001 for their analyses these authors adopted the wronskian relations for bessel functions using eq 10 the wave drift force acting on the n th cylinder can be written as follows 13 f x n i f y n ρ g η 0 2 d 0 1 2 i c 0 k d 0 m 2 a m n a m 1 n α m 1 n k 1 k n n 1 a m 1 k n a m n α m n k 1 k n n 1 a m k n a m 1 n 14 f 0 f x n 2 f y n

parameters of the problem the asterisk in the superscript denotes the complex conjugate in this paper only the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder is considered therefore f 0 represents the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder in the following sections 2 4 scattered wave energy the total scattered wave energy can be obtained using the energy conservation principle with the same procedure as that applied to compute the wave drift force the result can be expressed as follows 16 e s p g η 0 2 ω k 0 1 k c 0 m a m 2 2 5 wave elevation the wave elevation can be obtained by the velocity potential based on the boundary element method the velocity potential can be expressed as following equation 17 φ re g η 0 i ω φ e i ω t based on the dynamic condition the wave amplitude η can be obtained as 18 η re η 0 φ e i ω t by dividing the velocity potential into two parts real part and imaginary part the velocity potential can be written in the form φ φ c φ s and the wave amplitude can be expressed as follows 19 η η 0 re φ c i φ s e i ω t φ c 2 φ s 2 cos ω t arctan φ s φ c here φ c 2 φ s 2 denotes the non dimensional wave amplitude 3 numerical results and discussion to obtain the optimized geometries of the outer cylinders for the considered cloaking configurations a real coded genetic algorithm developed in zhang et al 2018 was adopted to minimize the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array the cloaking configuration with n 8 at k kd 0 1 0 for a wave heading of β 0 as shown in fig 3 was obtained by optimizing r out d out and r in the following experiment to consider the reuse of the outer cylinders only d out and r were optimized to obtain the cloaking configuration with n 4 at k kd 0 1 0 for a wave heading of β 0 the optimized geometries for the cloaking configurations with n 4 and n 8 are shown in table 1 then the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder were calculated next the wave direction effects on the scattered wave energy and the wave drift force were investigated finally the wave elevations in the two cloaking configurations were studied to intuitively illustrate the cloaking phenomenon 3 1 scattered wave energy and wave drift force for a wave direction of β 0 the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force f 0 were calculated at various wavenumbers as shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively at k 1 0 both the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force f 0 can be practically reduced in both cloaking configurations although the reduction is more significant for the arrangement with eight outer cylinders n 8 3 2 effect of the wave direction to investigate the effects of the wave direction on the cloaking phenomenon the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force f 0 were calculated for various wave headings β from 0 to 360 at k 1 0 for n 4 and n 8 as shown in figs 6 and 7 due to the structural symmetry we can focus only on the wave headings from 0 to 45 for n 4 and on the wave headings from 0 to 22 5 for n 8 it can be seen from fig 6 that for n 4 the scattered wave energy e s apparently increases from 0 0215 to 0 0717 with the variation of the wave heading while for n 8 it remains almost unchanged fig 7 shows the same type of variation for the wave direction effect on the wave drift force f 0 the minimal and maximal attenuation ratios for es and f 0 with the variation of the wave heading are shown in table 2 e s and f 0 respectively represent the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder while e 0 0 0726 and f 0 0 0 1192 denote the corresponding results for a lone cylinder r 0 0 5 and d 0 1 0 for the case of n 4 the attenuation ratios for e s and f 0 at β 45 are both almost 1 0 which implies that the cloaking phenomenon disappears however for the case of n 8 the wave direction effects are insignificant indicating that the cloaking configuration obtained based on β 0 is also suitable for other wave headings it can be concluded that the wave direction effects are related to the number of outer cylinders 3 3 wave elevation to intuitively illustrate the cloaking phenomenon and further investigate the reason for the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder the wave elevation in the vicinity of the cylinder array at k 1 0 was studied to consider the effect of the wave direction in addition to the wave heading of β 0 two other typical wave headings β 45 for n 4 and β 22 5 for n 8 were also adopted first the scattered wave elevations in the vicinity of the cylinder array for five arrangements n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 at k 1 0 were calculated here the cylinder arrays were rotated in the horizontal plane instead of changing the incident wave directions to consider the different wave headings the incident waves were assumed to be arriving from the negative x axis fig 8 a shows the scattered wave for a single cylinder significant scattered waves especially on the weather side of the cylinder are evident as fig 8 b and c show the scattered waves outside the cloaking configurations with n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 are weaker than those outside of the single cylinder for n 8 β 0 in particular almost no scattered waves exist outside the cylinder array when the wave heading changes from β 0 to β 45 for n 4 as shown in fig 8 c more scattered waves are radiated outside the cylinder array which implies that the cloaking configuration loses efficacy by contrast the cloaking configuration with n 8 remains efficacious even when the wave heading changes from 0 to 22 5 then the free surface elevation was investigated for the same five arrangements with the results shown in fig 9 in fig 9 a the wave elevation on the weather side of the single cylinder is significantly higher than that on the lee side as fig 9 b and d show the wave elevation inside the cylinders array symmetrically distributes about y axis therefore the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder in either cloaking configuration especially the configuration with n 8 β 0 is evidently improved which contributes to the reduction of the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder a wave direction effect with a trend similar to that of the effect on the free surface elevation shown in fig 8 can also be observed in fig 9 when the wave direction β changes from 0 to 45 for n 4 as shown in fig 9 c the wave elevation on the weather side of the inner cylinder becomes large however the effect of the wave direction on the wave elevation for n 8 is insignificant consequently for n 4 the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at β 45 is obviously increased compared to that at β 0 while for n 8 the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at β 22 5 is almost unchanged compared to that at β 0 4 experiment 4 1 description a series of experiments were conducted in the three dimensional wave basin at dalian university of technology to validate the numerical results including the wave drift force on the inner cylinder the wave elevation inside the cylinder array and the wave direction effects this three dimensional wave basin has a plan area of 40 m 24 m and can operate with a depth of up to 1 2 m the working depth in these experiments was 0 7 m as shown in fig 10 the piton type wavemaker at the basin s upstream end has 70 individual paddles and able to generate both regular waves and irregular waves the downstream end of the basin is an artificial beach that absorbs wave energy to avoid significant wave reflection five arrangements with n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 were considered in the experiments during the experiments different wave headings were realized by rotating the models in the horizontal plane the cylinder models were fabricated using organic glass and their physical dimensions which are shown in table 3 were selected based on the optimized geometries described in table 1 the diameter 2r 0 and the draft d 0 of the inner cylinder were both set to 22 34 cm the cylinders were supported by a stiff frame and a plate as shown in fig 11 a fixed bridge provided access to the deck of the model and the wave gauge the model was placed in the center of the wave basin the positive z axis was considered to point in the downward direction with z 0 located at the undisturbed free surface the x axis was defined to point in the direction of incident wave propagation while the y axis lay parallel to the wave crest a single axis load cell installed on the top of the inner cylinder with a rated load spread of up to 20 n was used to measure the surge forces capacitance type wave gauges were installed at various locations to measure the free surface elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder to investigate its relationship with the wave drift force on the inner cylinder several wave gauges were located on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder and three wave gauges were placed near the surface of the inner cylinder fig 12 shows top views of the wave gauge locations for the five arrangements there were five wave gauges located on the weather side of the inner cylinder for the n 0 n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 configurations however only three wave gauges were placed on the weather side of the inner cylinder for the n 4 β 45 and n 8 β 22 5 configurations due to space limitations eight wavenumbers including the cloaking wavenumber k kd 0 1 0 were selected for testing before model installation a series of precalibration regular wave tests were performed the target amplitude of the incident waves was determined such that the wave steepness would be essentially equal to 0 03 table 4 shows the target waves input to the wave generating equipment and the measured waves in the precalibration experiment h 0 denotes the wave height input to the paddles while h 0 denotes the measured incident wave height it is apparent from table 4 that the observed waves were reasonably close to the target steepness it should be noted that the measured amplitude instead of the target amplitude was taken as the amplitude of the linear component of the incident waves to properly nondimensionalize the data the experimental tests were subsequently performed in the following order n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 different wave headings were realized by rotating the supporting plate of each model 4 2 data analysis the unprocessed data for both the force and the wave elevation were recorded from regular waves propagating from the center of each model and ending after approximately 41 s the sampling frequency was set to 50 hz considering the instability of the data at the initial moment and the potential interference near the end of acquisition each sample was truncated to the range from 5 s to 25 s fig 13 shows a full signal and the corresponding extracted signal for the recorded force data to the extracted signal an fft low pass filter was applied to remove the double frequency and higher frequency components subsequently a sinusoidal least squares fit was applied to calculate the first harmonic and the offset for comparison with the numerical results fig 14 shows a plot of the surge force recorded by the load cell the extracted sample is shown as a solid line the filtered data and the fitted results for the first harmonic and the mean signal value are plotted as a dotted line a dash dotted line and a dash double dotted line respectively the same analysis procedure was applied to the recorded wave elevation data 4 3 experimental results as predicted by the numerical results the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder can be greatly reduced at k 1 0 in an optimized configuration the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder can also be improved in such a cloaking configuration however there are evident wave direction effects at the cloaking wavenumber for the configuration with n 4 while these effects are insignificant for n 8 these predictions are confirmed by the experimental data as presented above in addition good agreement is shown between the numerical and experimental results for the wave drift force on the inner cylinder and the wave elevation at other wavenumbers first the experimental and numerical results for the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder for the five arrangements n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 at various wavenumbers are compared in fig 15 as fig 15 shows good agreement can be observed between the measured and numerical results for the wave drift forces at various wavenumbers as displayed in fig 15 b and d the wave drift forces at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 are significantly reduced in both cloaking configurations compared with the case of a single cylinder n 0 although the experimental results are slightly larger than expected the reduction of the wave drift force by the configuration with n 8 β 0 is more significant than that of the configuration with n 4 β 0 moreover for n 4 the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder at k 1 0 for β 45 is increased compared with that for β 0 as shown in fig 15 c indicating that the cloaking configuration with n 4 that is optimized for β 0 loses efficacy for β 45 by contrast fig 15 e shows that the cloaking configuration with n 8 that is optimized for β 0 can also work for β 22 5 at the cloaking wavenumber which implies that the wave direction has very little impact on the cloaking condition with eight outer cylinders second the wave elevations at various locations in the vicinity of the inner cylinder as shown in fig 12 are investigated fig 16 presents the nondimensional wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 for the five investigated arrangements good agreements are found between the experimental and numerical results which certify that the viscous effects are very small in fig 16 a the wave elevation on the weather side is obviously larger than that on the lee side however as shown in fig 16 b and d the differences in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side in the cloaking configurations especially the configuration with n 8 β 0 are improved by the cloaking phenomenon which contributes to the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder it should be noted that the wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side for n 8 and β 0 are almost symmetric about the inner cylinder in addition a significant difference in wave elevation caused by the wave direction can be seen in fig 16 b and c for the condition of four outer cylinders n 4 however as in the case of the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder as shown in fig 16 d and e the wave direction effect on the wave elevation is negligible for the condition of eight outer cylinders n 8 the wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side for n 8 and β 22 5 are also almost symmetric about the inner cylinder third the wave elevation near the surface of the inner cylinder at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 is explored for each of the five arrangements as shown in fig 17 in fig 17 the solid lines denote the numerical results while the ball symbols represent the experimental results in each subgraph the projections of the data onto the three coordinate planes are also presented a trend similar to that in fig 16 can be found in fig 17 the significant difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side can be practically improved by both cloaking configurations thereby contributing to the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder at k 1 0 the effect of the wave direction on the wave elevation for the configuration with four outer cylinders n 4 is significant while no such effect is apparent for the configuration with eight outer cylinders the wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder for these five arrangements were also measured at other wavenumbers as shown in table 4 and compared against the corresponding numerical results as shown in fig 18 good agreement can be observed between the measured and numerical results moreover for each arrangement the wave elevation on the weather side is larger than that on the lee side at larger wavenumbers for shorter waves this phenomenon contributes to the larger wave drift force observed for shorter waves as shown in fig 15 in the range of 0 75 k 1 4 therefore the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder is closely related to the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder caused by the cloaking phenomenon is attributed to the improvement in the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder 5 conclusions two cylinder configurations consisting of a truncated surface piercing inner cylinder surrounded by four n 4 or eight n 8 cylinders were considered in this paper the cloaking configurations at a certain wavenumber of k 1 0 and a certain wave heading of β 0 were obtained by applying a real coded genetic algorithm to optimize r out d out and r to minimize the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array in each case based on these optimized configurations numerical studies and a series of experiments were performed to confirm the cloaking phenomenon and to investigate the effect of the wave direction the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array and the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder were investigated by means of linear theory for n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 reductions in the scattered wave energy and wave drift force caused by the cloaking configurations were observed at the cloaking wavenumber of k 1 0 2 the effects of the wave direction on the scattered wave energy and the wave drift force were studied significant wave direction effects were found for the configuration with four outer cylinders n 4 at the cloaking wavenumber while the wave direction effects on the configuration with eight outer cylinders n 8 are negligible 3 two other arrangements n 4 β 45 and n 8 β 22 5 were also considered to investigate the wave direction effects five arrangements in total with n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 were considered to investigate the scattered wave elevation and the free surface elevation in the vicinity of each structure at k 1 0 fewer scattered waves were found to exist outside the structures with the n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 cloaking configurations compared to the waves scattered by a single cylinder the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder is also reduced in both cloaking configurations which contributes to the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder 4 during the experiments the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder were investigated at eight wavenumbers k 0 75 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 for the same five arrangements with n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 good agreement was observed between the experimental and numerical results for the wave drift forces at various wavenumbers the reductions in the wave drift forces caused by the n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 cloaking configurations at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 were also confirmed significant wave direction effects on the wave drift force at k 1 0 were verified for the n 4 configuration by comparing the results for the two wave headings β 0 and β 45 while these effects were found to be negligible for the n 8 configuration at the cloaking wavenumber 5 the wave elevations at various locations on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder and near the surface of the inner cylinder were measured for the five arrangements at various wavenumbers through a comparison of the experimental and numerical results the validity of the numerical method for predicting the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder was confirmed by analyzing the wave elevation at k 1 0 it was confirmed that the reduction in the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder is related to the improvement in the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder the conclusions obtained from the numerical results regarding the effect of the wave direction on the wave elevation were also confirmed by the experiments acknowledgments this work

wave drift force is critical and this can be achieved via a novel phenomenon called cloaking in a water wave field the term cloaking means that no wave is scattered outside in the form of radial outgoing waves among other issues the wave elevation in the vicinity of the structure is of particular interest in a cloaking scenario the cloaking phenomenon was first derived by pendry et al 2006 for an electromagnetic field and was later experimentally certified by schurig et alschurig et al 2006 this concept was subsequently introduced into other types of wave fields such as acoustic cummer and schurig 2007 chen and chan 2007 optic leonhardt 2006 cai et al 2007 elastic farhat et al 2009 milton et al 2010 and seismic brûlé et al 2014 wave fields the first study in a water wave field was carried out by farhat et al farhat et al 2008 in which an array of vertical rigid inclusions piercing the free surface was used to realize circular cloaking since then some other ideas have been put forward for controlling the propagation of surface gravity waves alam alam 2012 considered transforming surface gravity waves into internal waves by installing ripples on the bottom of floating body containing areas porter and newman 2014 cloaked a bottomed mounted cylinder by varying the bathymetry in an annular region outside the cylinder dupont et al 2015 numerically and experimentally studied an invisibility carpet in a wave tank for linear waves and dupont et al 2016 later investigated the cloaking phenomenon for a vertical cylinder surrounded by an annular structure via homogenization in the mild slope equation zareei and alam 2015 realized cloaking with a nonlinear medium transformation by changing the depth in shallow waters iida and kashiwagi 2016 2017 considered utilizing either an anisotropic fluid or a small channel network to achieve cloaking in shallow water all in all various methods have been proposed to achieve the cloaking phenomenon in a water wave field among these methods inspired by farhat et al 2008 newman 2014 introduced additional floating bodies surrounding a truncated surface piercing cylinder to achieve cloaking in deep water and showed that almost no scattered waves radiated outside the floating cylinder array although mciver 2014 theoretically proved that perfect cloaking is not possible for the circular array configurations investigated by newman 2014 a practical reduction in the scattered wave energy can be realized by optimizing the geometry of the outer cylinders based on the configuration proposed by newman 2014 iida et al 2014 numerically confirmed that not only the wave drift force acting on the entire cylinder array but also that acting on the inner cylinder can be significantly reduced to almost zero via this phenomenon subsequently zhang et al 2017 found a periodic quasi cloaking phenomenon with varying distance between the inner and outer cylinders some experiments on the cloaking phenomenon for multiple bodies have also been carried out iida et al 2015 conducted an experiment to certify the numerical accuracy of the wave elevation in a cloaking configuration with eight outer cylinders and confirmed the conclusion obtained in iida et al 2014 read et al 2016 performed a further experimental investigation of the cloaking phenomenon for a circular cylinder surrounded by a circumferential array of eight cylinders in read et al 2016 the wave elevation outside the model and the wave drift forces on both the cloaked structure and the uncloaked structure were measured in addition potential interferences that may have compromised the measurements were discussed however in both iida et al 2015 and read et al 2016 the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder was not measured the relationship between the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder and the corresponding wave pattern was also not clear moreover the wave elevation was measured under only one wave condition although the cloaking phenomenon for a truncated surface piercing cylinder surrounded by other geometry optimized cylinders has been studied by some scholars many issues still require further study first in the previous studies the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder and the wave elevation were independently investigated by both numerical and experimental methods the relationship between these two factors is still not clearly understood second the cloaking phenomenon was achieved only for a certain wave direction however the question of whether this phenomenon will occur under other wave headings has not been studied third the investigation of the wave elevation for the cloaking configuration studied in the previous experiments was limited to a certain wavenumber for the condition with eight outer cylinders the wave elevations at various wavenumbers with different numbers of outer cylinders have not been investigated moreover the effect of the wave direction on the cloaking phenomenon in cases with different numbers of outer cylinders has also not been studied therefore in this paper the optimized geometries for cloaking configurations with four and eight outer cylinders are investigated based on the combination of a real coded genetic algorithm developed in zhang et al 2018 and wave interaction theory to minimize the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array then the relationship between the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder and the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder in each cloaking configuration is numerically studied in order to figure out how many outer cylinders is enough for the cloaking phenomenon when taking the wave direction effects into account the wave direction effects on the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder are investigated finally an experiment in a wave basin is conducted to confirm this phenomenon and to validate the wave direction effects by comparing the measured wave elevation and the measured wave drift force on the inner cylinder with the corresponding numerical results 2 theory 2 1 arrangements two configurations in which a fixed truncated cylinder is regularly surrounded by four n 4 or eight n 8 outer cylinders that are placed in a circle are considered both the diameter and draft of the inner cylinder are normalized to unity 2r 0 1 0 and d 0 1 0 the radius r out and the draft d out of the outer cylinders and the distance r between the inner and outer cylinders as shown in fig 1 are set as variables to be optimized to minimize the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array by a genetic algorithm all geometric dimensions of the outer floating bodies are normalized with respect to the draft of the inner cylinder 2 2 real coded genetic algorithm genetic algorithm is a heuristic search which mimics the process of natural selection the algorithm includes several parts such as initial population selection crossover and mutation operators elitism termination et al in this study three parameters r out d out and r are chosen as the variables while the scattered wave energy of the cylinders array is chosen as the objective function more detailed information of this optimization algorithm and it s validation can be found in zhang et al 2018 2 3 wave drift force to accurately simulate these complicated multi body problems two coordinate systems are introduced as shown in fig 2 one is the global coordinate system o xyz with respect to the center cylinder and the other is the local coordinate system o n x n y n z n fixed at the center of the n th cylinder in addition to cartesian coordinate systems of the form o xyz cylindrical coordinate systems of the form o rθz are used where x r cosθ and y r sinθ the positive direction of the z axis is in the downward vertical direction and the origin of each coordinate system z 0 is placed on an undisturbed free surface under the assumption of an incompressible and inviscid flow with irrotational motion a velocity potential φ x y z t can be introduced laplace s equation is taken as the governing equation of the flow field to establish this boundary value problem with linearized boundary conditions based on the principle of linear superposition the velocity potential can be expressed as follows 1 φ x y z t re g η 0 i ω φ p e i ω t where 2 φ p φ i p ψ p here re in eq 1 indicates that the real part of the quantity in square brackets is to be taken η 0 and ω denote the amplitude and circular frequency respectively of the incident waves g is the gravitational acceleration p r θ z is a field point in the flow and φ p is the sum of the incident wave potential φ i p and the disturbance potential ψ p the incident wave potential φ i p can be expressed in cylindrical coordinates as follows 3 φ i p cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x cos β y sin β m α m z 0 z j m k 0 r e i m θ where 4 α m e i m β π 2 z 0 z cosh k 0 z h cos k 0 h 5 k ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h here β is the angle of the incident wave relative to the x axis and h denotes the water depth which is assumed to be finite the bessel function of the first kind of order m is denoted by j m k 0 r ψ p represents the disturbance diffraction potential due to the presence of multiple floating bodies in the incident waves only the diffraction problem is taken into account the cylinders are assumed to be fixed more details can be found in kagemoto and yue 1986 according to kagemoto and yue 1986 the hydrodynamic interactions among all bodies should be taken into account due to the existence of n cylinders around the inner cylinder the total disturbance potential ψ p has the following form 6 ψ p n 1 n 1 ψ n p n 1 n 1 l a l n z 0 z h l 2 k 0 r n e i l θ n here a l n denotes the complex amplitude of the scattered progressive waves around the n th cylinder a l n can be solved using a higher order boundary element method hobem as reported by kashiwagi 1995 the hankel function of the second kind of order l is denoted by h l 2 k 0 r n by rewriting the disturbance potential induced by the n th cylinder in the global cylindrical coordinate system o rθz the disturbance potential ψ p can be expressed in the following form 7 ψ p m a m z 0 z h m 2 k 0 r e i m θ where 8 a m n 1 n 1 l a l n j l m k 0 l n o e i l m α n o with the introduction of the velocity potential φ p as the sum of the incident wave potential and the disturbance wave potential an asymptotic expression for the entire velocity potential established in the far field outside of a fictitious vertical circular cylinder encompassing all bodies can be given in the following form 9 φ p φ i p ψ p m α m j m k 0 r a m h m 2 k 0 r z 0 z e i m θ furthermore to obtain the wave drift force acting on each body separately e g on the n th cylinder by means of the far field method a control surface encompassing only the n th cylinder should be considered in this case the disturbance potential must be described in the n th local coordinate system the incident wave potential of the n th cylinder consists of not only the wave potential coming from the outside but also the disturbance wave potential due to the other cylinders therefore the velocity potential around the n th cylinder can be expressed as follows 10 ϕ n p ψ i n p ψ n p ϕ i n p k 1 k n n 1 ψ k n p ψ n p m α m n k 1 k n n 1 a m k n j m k 0 r n a m n h m 2 k 0 r n z 0 z e i m θ n where 11 a m k n l a l k h l m 2 k 0 l k n e i l m α k n 12 α m n α m e i k 0 x o n cos β y o n sin β then the wave drift force can be computed from quadratic products of the velocity potential at a surface surrounding the cylinder of interest this approach is known as the far field method and was first proposed by maruo 1960 based on the velocity potential expressed in the cylindrical coordinate system as in eq 10 the integrals with respect to z and θ appearing in the formula can be performed at an appropriate distance r the wave drift force has been provided by kashiwagi and yoshida 2001 for their analyses these authors adopted the wronskian relations for bessel functions using eq 10 the wave drift force acting on the n th cylinder can be written as follows 13 f x n i f y n ρ g η 0 2 d 0 1 2 i c 0 k d 0 m 2 a m n a m 1 n α m 1 n k 1 k n n 1 a m 1 k n a m n α m n k 1 k n n 1 a m k n a m 1 n 14 f 0 f x n 2 f y n

parameters of the problem the asterisk in the superscript denotes the complex conjugate in this paper only the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder is considered therefore f 0 represents the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder in the following sections 2 4 scattered wave energy the total scattered wave energy can be obtained using the energy conservation principle with the same procedure as that applied to compute the wave drift force the result can be expressed as follows 16 e s p g η 0 2 ω k 0 1 k c 0 m a m 2 2 5 wave elevation the wave elevation can be obtained by the velocity potential based on the boundary element method the velocity potential can be expressed as following equation 17 φ re g η 0 i ω φ e i ω t based on the dynamic condition the wave amplitude η can be obtained as 18 η re η 0 φ e i ω t by dividing the velocity potential into two parts real part and imaginary part the velocity potential can be written in the form φ φ c φ s and the wave amplitude can be expressed as follows 19 η η 0 re φ c i φ s e i ω t φ c 2 φ s 2 cos ω t arctan φ s φ c here φ c 2 φ s 2 denotes the non dimensional wave amplitude 3 numerical results and discussion to obtain the optimized geometries of the outer cylinders for the considered cloaking configurations a real coded genetic algorithm developed in zhang et al 2018 was adopted to minimize the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array the cloaking configuration with n 8 at k kd 0 1 0 for a wave heading of β 0 as shown in fig 3 was obtained by optimizing r out d out and r in the following experiment to consider the reuse of the outer cylinders only d out and r were optimized to obtain the cloaking configuration with n 4 at k kd 0 1 0 for a wave heading of β 0 the optimized geometries for the cloaking configurations with n 4 and n 8 are shown in table 1 then the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder were calculated next the wave direction effects on the scattered wave energy and the wave drift force were investigated finally the wave elevations in the two cloaking configurations were studied to intuitively illustrate the cloaking phenomenon 3 1 scattered wave energy and wave drift force for a wave direction of β 0 the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force f 0 were calculated at various wavenumbers as shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively at k 1 0 both the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force f 0 can be practically reduced in both cloaking configurations although the reduction is more significant for the arrangement with eight outer cylinders n 8 3 2 effect of the wave direction to investigate the effects of the wave direction on the cloaking phenomenon the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force f 0 were calculated for various wave headings β from 0 to 360 at k 1 0 for n 4 and n 8 as shown in figs 6 and 7 due to the structural symmetry we can focus only on the wave headings from 0 to 45 for n 4 and on the wave headings from 0 to 22 5 for n 8 it can be seen from fig 6 that for n 4 the scattered wave energy e s apparently increases from 0 0215 to 0 0717 with the variation of the wave heading while for n 8 it remains almost unchanged fig 7 shows the same type of variation for the wave direction effect on the wave drift force f 0 the minimal and maximal attenuation ratios for es and f 0 with the variation of the wave heading are shown in table 2 e s and f 0 respectively represent the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinder array and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder while e 0 0 0726 and f 0 0 0 1192 denote the corresponding results for a lone cylinder r 0 0 5 and d 0 1 0 for the case of n 4 the attenuation ratios for e s and f 0 at β 45 are both almost 1 0 which implies that the cloaking phenomenon disappears however for the case of n 8 the wave direction effects are insignificant indicating that the cloaking configuration obtained based on β 0 is also suitable for other wave headings it can be concluded that the wave direction effects are related to the number of outer cylinders 3 3 wave elevation to intuitively illustrate the cloaking phenomenon and further investigate the reason for the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder the wave elevation in the vicinity of the cylinder array at k 1 0 was studied to consider the effect of the wave direction in addition to the wave heading of β 0 two other typical wave headings β 45 for n 4 and β 22 5 for n 8 were also adopted first the scattered wave elevations in the vicinity of the cylinder array for five arrangements n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 at k 1 0 were calculated here the cylinder arrays were rotated in the horizontal plane instead of changing the incident wave directions to consider the different wave headings the incident waves were assumed to be arriving from the negative x axis fig 8 a shows the scattered wave for a single cylinder significant scattered waves especially on the weather side of the cylinder are evident as fig 8 b and c show the scattered waves outside the cloaking configurations with n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 are weaker than those outside of the single cylinder for n 8 β 0 in particular almost no scattered waves exist outside the cylinder array when the wave heading changes from β 0 to β 45 for n 4 as shown in fig 8 c more scattered waves are radiated outside the cylinder array which implies that the cloaking configuration loses efficacy by contrast the cloaking configuration with n 8 remains efficacious even when the wave heading changes from 0 to 22 5 then the free surface elevation was investigated for the same five arrangements with the results shown in fig 9 in fig 9 a the wave elevation on the weather side of the single cylinder is significantly higher than that on the lee side as fig 9 b and d show the wave elevation inside the cylinders array symmetrically distributes about y axis therefore the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder in either cloaking configuration especially the configuration with n 8 β 0 is evidently improved which contributes to the reduction of the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder a wave direction effect with a trend similar to that of the effect on the free surface elevation shown in fig 8 can also be observed in fig 9 when the wave direction β changes from 0 to 45 for n 4 as shown in fig 9 c the wave elevation on the weather side of the inner cylinder becomes large however the effect of the wave direction on the wave elevation for n 8 is insignificant consequently for n 4 the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at β 45 is obviously increased compared to that at β 0 while for n 8 the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at β 22 5 is almost unchanged compared to that at β 0 4 experiment 4 1 description a series of experiments were conducted in the three dimensional wave basin at dalian university of technology to validate the numerical results including the wave drift force on the inner cylinder the wave elevation inside the cylinder array and the wave direction effects this three dimensional wave basin has a plan area of 40 m 24 m and can operate with a depth of up to 1 2 m the working depth in these experiments was 0 7 m as shown in fig 10 the piton type wavemaker at the basin s upstream end has 70 individual paddles and able to generate both regular waves and irregular waves the downstream end of the basin is an artificial beach that absorbs wave energy to avoid significant wave reflection five arrangements with n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 were considered in the experiments during the experiments different wave headings were realized by rotating the models in the horizontal plane the cylinder models were fabricated using organic glass and their physical dimensions which are shown in table 3 were selected based on the optimized geometries described in table 1 the diameter 2r 0 and the draft d 0 of the inner cylinder were both set to 22 34 cm the cylinders were supported by a stiff frame and a plate as shown in fig 11 a fixed bridge provided access to the deck of the model and the wave gauge the model was placed in the center of the wave basin the positive z axis was considered to point in the downward direction with z 0 located at the undisturbed free surface the x axis was defined to point in the direction of incident wave propagation while the y axis lay parallel to the wave crest a single axis load cell installed on the top of the inner cylinder with a rated load spread of up to 20 n was used to measure the surge forces capacitance type wave gauges were installed at various locations to measure the free surface elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder to investigate its relationship with the wave drift force on the inner cylinder several wave gauges were located on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder and three wave gauges were placed near the surface of the inner cylinder fig 12 shows top views of the wave gauge locations for the five arrangements there were five wave gauges located on the weather side of the inner cylinder for the n 0 n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 configurations however only three wave gauges were placed on the weather side of the inner cylinder for the n 4 β 45 and n 8 β 22 5 configurations due to space limitations eight wavenumbers including the cloaking wavenumber k kd 0 1 0 were selected for testing before model installation a series of precalibration regular wave tests were performed the target amplitude of the incident waves was determined such that the wave steepness would be essentially equal to 0 03 table 4 shows the target waves input to the wave generating equipment and the measured waves in the precalibration experiment h 0 denotes the wave height input to the paddles while h 0 denotes the measured incident wave height it is apparent from table 4 that the observed waves were reasonably close to the target steepness it should be noted that the measured amplitude instead of the target amplitude was taken as the amplitude of the linear component of the incident waves to properly nondimensionalize the data the experimental tests were subsequently performed in the following order n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 different wave headings were realized by rotating the supporting plate of each model 4 2 data analysis the unprocessed data for both the force and the wave elevation were recorded from regular waves propagating from the center of each model and ending after approximately 41 s the sampling frequency was set to 50 hz considering the instability of the data at the initial moment and the potential interference near the end of acquisition each sample was truncated to the range from 5 s to 25 s fig 13 shows a full signal and the corresponding extracted signal for the recorded force data to the extracted signal an fft low pass filter was applied to remove the double frequency and higher frequency components subsequently a sinusoidal least squares fit was applied to calculate the first harmonic and the offset for comparison with the numerical results fig 14 shows a plot of the surge force recorded by the load cell the extracted sample is shown as a solid line the filtered data and the fitted results for the first harmonic and the mean signal value are plotted as a dotted line a dash dotted line and a dash double dotted line respectively the same analysis procedure was applied to the recorded wave elevation data 4 3 experimental results as predicted by the numerical results the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder can be greatly reduced at k 1 0 in an optimized configuration the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder can also be improved in such a cloaking configuration however there are evident wave direction effects at the cloaking wavenumber for the configuration with n 4 while these effects are insignificant for n 8 these predictions are confirmed by the experimental data as presented above in addition good agreement is shown between the numerical and experimental results for the wave drift force on the inner cylinder and the wave elevation at other wavenumbers first the experimental and numerical results for the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder for the five arrangements n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 at various wavenumbers are compared in fig 15 as fig 15 shows good agreement can be observed between the measured and numerical results for the wave drift forces at various wavenumbers as displayed in fig 15 b and d the wave drift forces at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 are significantly reduced in both cloaking configurations compared with the case of a single cylinder n 0 although the experimental results are slightly larger than expected the reduction of the wave drift force by the configuration with n 8 β 0 is more significant than that of the configuration with n 4 β 0 moreover for n 4 the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder at k 1 0 for β 45 is increased compared with that for β 0 as shown in fig 15 c indicating that the cloaking configuration with n 4 that is optimized for β 0 loses efficacy for β 45 by contrast fig 15 e shows that the cloaking configuration with n 8 that is optimized for β 0 can also work for β 22 5 at the cloaking wavenumber which implies that the wave direction has very little impact on the cloaking condition with eight outer cylinders second the wave elevations at various locations in the vicinity of the inner cylinder as shown in fig 12 are investigated fig 16 presents the nondimensional wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 for the five investigated arrangements good agreements are found between the experimental and numerical results which certify that the viscous effects are very small in fig 16 a the wave elevation on the weather side is obviously larger than that on the lee side however as shown in fig 16 b and d the differences in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side in the cloaking configurations especially the configuration with n 8 β 0 are improved by the cloaking phenomenon which contributes to the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder it should be noted that the wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side for n 8 and β 0 are almost symmetric about the inner cylinder in addition a significant difference in wave elevation caused by the wave direction can be seen in fig 16 b and c for the condition of four outer cylinders n 4 however as in the case of the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder as shown in fig 16 d and e the wave direction effect on the wave elevation is negligible for the condition of eight outer cylinders n 8 the wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side for n 8 and β 22 5 are also almost symmetric about the inner cylinder third the wave elevation near the surface of the inner cylinder at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 is explored for each of the five arrangements as shown in fig 17 in fig 17 the solid lines denote the numerical results while the ball symbols represent the experimental results in each subgraph the projections of the data onto the three coordinate planes are also presented a trend similar to that in fig 16 can be found in fig 17 the significant difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side can be practically improved by both cloaking configurations thereby contributing to the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder at k 1 0 the effect of the wave direction on the wave elevation for the configuration with four outer cylinders n 4 is significant while no such effect is apparent for the configuration with eight outer cylinders the wave elevations on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder for these five arrangements were also measured at other wavenumbers as shown in table 4 and compared against the corresponding numerical results as shown in fig 18 good agreement can be observed between the measured and numerical results moreover for each arrangement the wave elevation on the weather side is larger than that on the lee side at larger wavenumbers for shorter waves this phenomenon contributes to the larger wave drift force observed for shorter waves as shown in fig 15 in the range of 0 75 k 1 4 therefore the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder is closely related to the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder caused by the cloaking phenomenon is attributed to the improvement in the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder 5 conclusions two cylinder configurations consisting of a truncated surface piercing inner cylinder surrounded by four n 4 or eight n 8 cylinders were considered in this paper the cloaking configurations at a certain wavenumber of k 1 0 and a certain wave heading of β 0 were obtained by applying a real coded genetic algorithm to optimize r out d out and r to minimize the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array in each case based on these optimized configurations numerical studies and a series of experiments were performed to confirm the cloaking phenomenon and to investigate the effect of the wave direction the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the scattered wave energy of the cylinder array and the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder were investigated by means of linear theory for n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 reductions in the scattered wave energy and wave drift force caused by the cloaking configurations were observed at the cloaking wavenumber of k 1 0 2 the effects of the wave direction on the scattered wave energy and the wave drift force were studied significant wave direction effects were found for the configuration with four outer cylinders n 4 at the cloaking wavenumber while the wave direction effects on the configuration with eight outer cylinders n 8 are negligible 3 two other arrangements n 4 β 45 and n 8 β 22 5 were also considered to investigate the wave direction effects five arrangements in total with n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 were considered to investigate the scattered wave elevation and the free surface elevation in the vicinity of each structure at k 1 0 fewer scattered waves were found to exist outside the structures with the n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 cloaking configurations compared to the waves scattered by a single cylinder the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder is also reduced in both cloaking configurations which contributes to the reduction in the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder 4 during the experiments the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder were investigated at eight wavenumbers k 0 75 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 for the same five arrangements with n 0 n 4 β 0 n 4 β 45 n 8 β 0 and n 8 β 22 5 good agreement was observed between the experimental and numerical results for the wave drift forces at various wavenumbers the reductions in the wave drift forces caused by the n 4 β 0 and n 8 β 0 cloaking configurations at the cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 were also confirmed significant wave direction effects on the wave drift force at k 1 0 were verified for the n 4 configuration by comparing the results for the two wave headings β 0 and β 45 while these effects were found to be negligible for the n 8 configuration at the cloaking wavenumber 5 the wave elevations at various locations on the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder and near the surface of the inner cylinder were measured for the five arrangements at various wavenumbers through a comparison of the experimental and numerical results the validity of the numerical method for predicting the wave elevation in the vicinity of the inner cylinder was confirmed by analyzing the wave elevation at k 1 0 it was confirmed that the reduction in the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder is related to the improvement in the difference in wave elevation between the weather side and the lee side of the inner cylinder the conclusions obtained from the numerical results regarding the effect of the wave direction on the wave elevation were also confirmed by the experiments acknowledgments this work

22771,a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions was established and the model was solved by finite element method in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with similar researches the influences of evacuation and current speeds the desired track of the drilling platform the weight of lower marine riser package lmrp and the length of the hang off drilling riser on drilling riser deformation and bending moment were analyzed results indicate that the most fragile part of riser is the upper joint on the top end and the platform speed and track direction are key operable parameters during the emergency evacuation keeping the platform moving a little faster than the surface current speed especially with a heavy lmrp is favorable for reducing the deformation of the riser the desired track of drilling platform is along the ocean current recycling the riser helps reduce the deformation but harms the upper joint of the riser these results can provide a basis for making evacuation plans of the platform provide a theoretical guarantee for the safety of the hard hang off riser and serve as a reference for the production and installation of the riser keywords drilling riser deep water hard hang off dynamic analysis 1 introduction a drilling riser is an important device for offshore drilling this device is mainly connected to a drilling platform and a subsea wellhead and it separates the sea water from the drilling annulus the platform is relatively stable and fixed at a specific position during normal operation and the connected riser system is at a closed state however in the event of severe weather such as typhoons during which the riser and subsea wellhead will be forced to separate the drilling platform needs to be evacuated with the hang off riser to ensure the safety of equipment and people on the platform one hang off mode is called hard hang off which usually compresses expansion joints and locks the inner tubes of expansion joints into the outer tubes in hard hang off the tensioner system is disconnected and the diverter upper flex joint and telescopic joint are demounted the top of the riser is directly suspended from the drill floor at the gimbal spider the lmrp at the bottom of the riser is separated from the subsea blowout preventer bop the stress of a hard hang off riser is complicated that is the load of the ocean environment changes with the platform speed and the evacuation direction the riser is connected to the platform by its top end and will be towed to move when the platform moves and the riser bears the self weight and inertia and it is constantly bent and oscillated under the combined action of the aforementioned factors this condition changes the distribution of marine environmental loads if the bending and deformation of risers exceed the ultimate strength of materials then these risers will be damaged and could ultimately result in accidents therefore the dynamic analysis of risers in hard hang off mode during emergency evacuation is important to ensure the safety of risers and platforms scholars have conducted many theoretical studies on the mechanical behavior of risers burke 1973 performed a static analysis on a marine riser model using a beam model and found that the vessel response induced by waves could be a key design factor of the dynamic behavior of the riser gardner and kotch 1976 used a finite element method fem to carry out a dynamic analysis on a riser and reported that the bending stress of riser decreases with an increase in top tension patel et al 1984 investigated the mechanical behavior of a riser by using the time domain method and compared this behavior with that observed through the frequency domain method to determine the lateral displacement and lateral stress of marine risers atadan et al 1997 considered and analyzed a riser system and drilling platforms as an entire system by using a cantilever model the results demonstrated that platform mass affects the first resonance of the riser system wang et al 2013 presented a direct algorithm using the runge kutta method as a steady state solution for long slender cylindrical structures and compared it with the time iteration calculation the direct algorithm spends less time than the time iteration scheme does mao et al 2016 established an analysis model for the mechanical behavior of a deep water drilling riser that considers the actual string configuration of the riser the authors also discussed the effects of the top tension drilling platform drift distance surface current speed wave height wave period wave length wind speed and damping coefficient on the lateral displacement bending moment and deflection of risers based on existing research on risers under normal drilling conditions many studies have focused on the mechanical behavior of risers under emergency evacuation conditions arising from a harsh environment ambrose et al 2001 examined the stress and load performance of riser systems with soft and hard suspension under different environmental conditions fig 1 as shown in the figure the riser is connected to the platform by a rotatable joint and can thus rotate around the top end under soft suspension conditions while the riser is fixed to the platform can rotate at the top end under hard suspension conditions they found that a riser system with hard suspension is more sensitive to sea conditions and dry wet weight ratios than a riser system with soft suspension is brekke et al 2004 presented an overview of the riser management and indicated that hard hang off is considered only when the riser runs away or is pulled and supported by a hook or spider and when the top of the riser moves up and down with the vessel which could cause considerable hook load variations in the riser itoh 2006 conducted a model experiment on a hang off riser in a deep sea basin and simulated the translational and rotational motions of the upper floating structure by using a forced oscillation device the motion of the riser was measured using a 3d video tracking system and a numerical analysis program was developed to simulate riser behavior sun et al 2009 investigated the axial dynamic characteristics of ultra deep water risers in hard hang off configurations and discussed the typhoon avoidance management strategy of risers dai et al 2009 calculated the rotation angle and stress of a riser under operable hang off modes to determine the operability envelop during emergencies the results demonstrated that the operability envelop is relatively small under harsh conditions and that the number of buoyancy modules is slightly large williams 2010 outlined the key issues associated with modeling and analysis techniques for drilling riser systems intended for deep water and harsh environment locations identified several conservatisms in current practice and outlined optimizations the authors used fems to verify the operability of drilling riser systems in harsh environments ju 2012 presented a method to analyze the operating windows of risers under hard hang off modes the authors established a finite element model for the axial dynamic analysis and examined riser hang off windows under different oceanic conditions based on restraint criteria for riser hang off operations gao et al 2014 simulated a marine drilling riser system through fem with orcaflex software on a semisubmersible platform and studied the axial dynamic characteristics of a hard hang off riser at different water depths wu et al 2014 built a dynamical model to simulate the dynamic response of a riser in a hard hang off state with consideration of the wave and current effects platform motion and large deformation of the drilling riser the authors also investigated the dynamic response of the riser to evacuate with hysy 981 drilling platform under the ocean condition caused by a once in a year typhoon in the south china sea wang et al 2014 established a static analysis model and an equation to analyze the stress and deformation of a riser in its installation the results demonstrated the maximum movement speed of the floating drilling platform during the installation of the riser qi 2015 applied fem with the orcaflex software to simulate dynamic responses of a hard hang off drilling riser system with different suspended lengths current speeds and driving directions and analyzed the feasibility of riser evacuation under hard hang off mode in case of a typhoon the authors also used shear7 to investigate the vortex induced vibration characteristics of drilling risers under hard hang off mode when evacuated to avoid typhoons sheng et al 2016 analyzed the hard hang off mode of an ultra deep water well riser and demonstrated that the safety performance of the hard hang off riser is limited by the riser stress and the angle of upper flexible joint fan et al 2017 constructed a dynamic hang off riser model based on the euler bernoulli theory which considers the vessel motion and the combined excitation of ocean currents surface waves and isws the results indicated that isw can significantly increase the envelops of the riser in the upper seawater layer and dramatically expand the horizontal deviation of a hang off riser at the bottom as isw spreads liu et al 2017 presented a dynamic analysis model and a method for a riser system under different operation modes to calculate the weak points and safe operation window of the riser system in typhoons the results showed that the weak points of a hard hang off riser include the stress displacement near the moonpool top angle and large and small safe operation windows in the downstream and upstream directions respectively liu et al 2018 developed a model to investigate the dynamic behavior of a deep water drilling platform riser system under emergency evacuation conditions and analyzed the influences of the platform motion riser suspension length ocean load and platform evacuation speed on the dynamic behavior of the riser in previous research various authors introduced solution methods and assistant software to study the dynamic characteristics of risers many researchers also presented numerical models to analyze hang off risers however it is difficult to obtain the stable dynamic characteristics of risers such as deformation and bending moment and there is room to improve the numerical procedures moreover the comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence the safety of hard hang off risers is scarce the present study focuses on the dynamic mechanical behavior of drilling risers under hard hang off emergency evacuation conditions and provides operational recommendations a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions was established and the model was solved by fem in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with those in similar research the influences of the evacuation and current speeds desired track of the drilling platform lmrp weight and length of the hang off drilling riser on the deformation and bending moment of the drilling riser were discussed the operation strategies that will best protect the riser were also analyzed 2 riser model and calculation equations fig 2 displays the riser model in hard hang off mode the drilling riser with the lmrp is disconnected from the bop and the top end of the riser is suspended to the platform and moves as the platform moves thus the mechanical model of a hard hang off riser can be regarded as a cantilever beam that is fixed at the top end and free at the bottom end the desired track of a drilling platform may be different from the direction of the ocean environment the schematic of the evacuation for the drilling platform is shown in fig 3 the thickness and diameter of the riser are assumed to be constant along the z axis and the material is presumed homogeneous and isotropic the moving speed of the platform is assumed to be constant the variation in the string configuration along the longitudinal direction is ignored the loads of the internal fluid slightly affect the movement of the riser under hang off conditions thus in this work the internal solidary waves are ignored in the analysis model the lateral displacement of a riser is much greater than its diameter during evacuation and the length of the riser is also considerably greater than its diameter hence in this work the riser is considered as an entity of a slender cylinder beam and the bending on the joint connecting two single entities is neglected considering the bending deformation and the longitudinal stretching under the lateral loads the force analysis of the riser and micro body is shown in fig 4 where the riser deforms in the x z plane when the micro body dz deforms under the lateral force the bending moment m shear deformation q and axial force t change in the first order wilson 2003 1 m d m m m z d z q d q q q z d z f d f f f z d z according to the newton s second law the horizontal force of the micro body can be expressed as 2 f x m r d z 2 x t 2 where m r is the mass of the riser per unit length kg m then 3 t x z t d t x z 2 x z 2 d z q q d q f d z c x t d z m r d z x t where c is the damping coefficient of the riser t is the axial tension force of the riser n and f is the lateral ocean environment force n combining the equations 1 and 3 and neglecting the high order items such as dx 2 dx 3 etc wilson 2003 4 q z z t x z f c x t m r 2 x t 2 according to mechanics of materials gere and timoshenko 1984 the shear force and bending moment can be written as 5 q m z 6 m e i 2 x z 2 where ei is the bending stiffness of the riser n m 2 e i e π d o 4 d i 4 64 e is the elastic modulus of the riser pa d o is the outer diameter of the riser m and d i is the inner diameter of the riser m taking equation 6 to the derivative form of equation 5 7 q z 2 m z 2 2 z 2 e i 2 x z 2 e i 4 x z 4 combining the equations 3 and 7 the forth order partial differential equation considering the effective axial force damping force and combined hydraulic loads of the hard hang off riser is obtained 8 e i 4 x z 4 m r 2 x t 2 c x t t z 2 x z 2 f z t where t t z is the riser tension force distribution along the z axis n and f f z t is the distribution of lateral ocean environment force along the z axis n in the axial direction the upper part of the riser is subjected to the weight of the lower part under hard hang off conditions and bears the huge weight of lmrp at the bottom at the same time the riser is subject to the buoyancy of the water as it is in the sea fig 5 shows the schematic of the riser axial tension force thus the distribution of riser tension force along the z axis can be calculated by 9 t z g m lmrp g m r ρ w π 4 d o 2 d i 2 l z where g is the gravity acceleration n kg m lmrp is the quality of the lower marine riser package kg ρ w is the seawater density kg m 3 and l is the total riser length m the top end of the riser is fixed to the platform hence the speed of the riser at the top end in the x axis is equal to that of the platform however the bottom end is free from any constraints therefore the boundary conditions arising from the actual constraints of the hard hang off riser can be expressed as follows 10 u 0 t u p v 0 t 0 0 t 0 u l 0 0 e i 2 x l t z 2 0 where u is the speed of riser in the x axis m l is the length of the drilling riser m and u p is the drift speed of the drilling platform m 3 ocean environmental loads of the riser model the forces applied to the riser comprise the ocean environmental loads riser weight and lmrp weight the ocean environmental loads mainly include the loads of wave and current the wave is mainly concentrated on the microscopic motion law of water particle while ocean current mainly focuses on the macroscopic speed distribution of seawater along the water depth since the wave parameters barely affect the deformation of the riser mao et al 2016 the loads caused by the ocean current and the movement of the platform are mainly concerned in this study the riser is regarded as a slender cylinder and it moves with the current loads and the displacement of the platform thus the main ocean environmental loads on a riser can be simulated by the morison equation morison et al 1950 han and benaroya 2000 11 f w 1 2 c d ρ w d o u w d x d t u w d x d t c m ρ w π d o 2 4 d u w d t c m ρ w π d o 2 4 d u w d t d 2 x d t 2 where c d is the drag force coefficient which is a dimensionless quantity ρ w is the seawater density kg m3 d o is the outer diameter of the drilling riser m u w is the horizontal speed of the water m s for ocean current the way to obtain the u w mainly includes measuring the actual distribution of the water speed or deducing the speed profile by the recurrence period of ocean current in a specific sea area x is the horizontal displacement of the riser m d x d t is the horizontal speed of the riser c m is the added mass coefficient which is a dimensionless quantity and c m is the inertia force coefficient which is also a dimensionless quantity and can be calculated by c m 1 zhang and cui 2015 in equation 11 the first item is the drag force which is determined by the speeds of both water and riser the second item is the inertial force which is determined by the absolute speed of the water and the third item is the added mass force caused by the fluid particles that are displaced by the motion of the cylinder han and benaroya 2000 also equation 11 indicates that the ocean environmental loads are apparently conditioned by the speeds of the ocean current and the platform in an actual evacuation the speed of ocean current changes with the variation in water depth and time thus ocean environmental loads are the dynamic forces applied to the riser and the main factor that affects the movement of the riser 4 numerical solution of the riser model the finite element method fem is used to discretize the hard hang off riser model the entire riser is discretized into finite elements d z calculation time is divided into finite time periods δ t and the grid nodes of the calculated riser are shown in fig 6 the movement of each element subjected to forces from the x and z axes can be described by the lateral speed u r in the x axis the longitudinal speed v r in the z axis and the deflection θ r the dynamic response of the riser per element and time period can be obtained based on the iterating time to solve equation 8 by the newmark β method an available method for solving the mechanical dynamics problem this method can realize an unconditionally stable integration and the selection of time step will not affect the stability of the solution as long as the integral precision is satisfied then a large time step can be used in the calculation to shorten the calculation time the typical structural dynamic motion equation equation 8 wilson 2003 is expressed as 12 m u c u k u f t where k is the object stiffness array for the general static force analysis c is the object damping array m is the object weight array u is the nodal displacement u is the displacement speed u is the acceleration vector of the object and f t is the load vectors of the node these parameters are functions of time t the model should be discretized before being solved the model is a simply supported beam and the piecewise cubic hermite interpolation can be used to discretize equation 12 the shape function chopra 1995 is shown as follows 13 n 1 1 3 z 2 l 2 2 z 3 l 3 n 2 z 2 z 2 l z 3 l 2 n 3 3 z 2 l 2 2 z 3 l 3 n 4 z 2 l z 3 l 2 where l is the riser length m thus the element mass matrix m e can be described as 14 m i j e 0 l n i m r n j d z the element damping matrix c e can be expressed as 15 c i j e 0 l n i c n j d z the element stiffness matrix is composed of the bending and geometric stiffness matrices which are caused by the tension along the riser thus the element stiffness matrix can be determined as 16 k e k e 1 k e 2 k e 3 where 17 k e 1

analyze the dynamic mechanical behavior of the hard hang off riser 5 verification of the riser model the model was compared with orcaflex and ansys simulation software qi 2015 and the simulation program was coded by wu wu et al 2014 to verify the correctness of the numerical simulation results the maximum dynamic tensions of the riser were compared by four methods and the basic parameters were selected from the literature qi 2015 the comparison results fig 8 a show that the distributions of maximum effective tension of the riser calculated by the four methods are nearly the same the effective tension decreases with the increase in water depth and it reaches the maximum at the top of the hard hang off riser and the minimum at the lower end of the hard hang off riser the knuckle points appear near 45 and 780 m because the effective tension is related to the weight of riser the slope of the curve changes with the weight of the riser in different places the model was also compared with the lateral deformation of ansys simulated by sun 2009 the riser length is 1829 m and is converted to relative position 0 to 1 0 refers to the bottom end and 1 refers to the top end the speed of the surface current is 0 34 m s and the platform speed is 0 6 m s fig 8b shows the comparison results the deformation trends obtained by two methods are consistent the deformation increases rapidly near the upper end increases slowly near the top end and finally reaches the maximum at the bottom end these results prove the correctness of the numerical simulation model 6 case study and result discussion 6 1 analysis of basic parameters and results a deep water drilling well in south china sea was selected to analyze the dynamic characteristics of a riser under hard hang off conditions the basic parameters of the riser are shown in table 1 the hydraulic parameters in south china sea are shown in table 2 mao et al 2016 and the distribution with the surface current speed at 1 1 m s is shown in fig 9 in this case the riser was divided into 50 parts and the time was divided into 100 000 steps calculation time is 80s as shown in table 2 it is assumed that the top end of the riser is equal to the water surface and the speed of the platform is constant and the accelerating phases of the platform are ignored the simulation results are shown in fig 10 fig 10a intuitionally shows the distribution of the lateral riser deformation from 0 s to 80 s the deformation of the entire riser increases as the time progresses and always reaches the peak at the bottom end at certain time the relative deformation of the bottom end compared with that of the platform is shown in fig 10e the lmrp at the bottom end accelerates slowly first and then decelerates with the greatest deformation of 37 m the deformation of the entire riser and the movement of the bottom end conform to the regular deformation of a cantilever beam clough et al 1977 fig 10b shows the distribution of the lateral displacement of the riser at 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 s the top of the riser moves with the platform at the speed of 1 34 m s whereas the lower part of the riser moves apparently slower than the platform does the slowest position is the lmrp at the bottom end of the riser meanwhile the shape of riser displacement gradually transforms from a straight line to a curve the riser fluctuates at approximately 25 s and becomes stabilized again at approximately 45 s the distribution of current speed is shown in fig 9 notably the speed of surface current is less than that of the platform thus the environmental load applied to the riser restrains its movement as a result the riser gradually deforms as time progresses the fluctuating phases are caused by the coefficient effect of load and gravity load is directly related to the speed and gravity is directly related to the dip angle of the riser thus when the load and gravity reach a similar value the shape of the riser displacement becomes stable as shown in the later period of fig 10c wu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 fig 10c and e show that the platform moves to 107 m and that the lmrp moves to 71 6 m at 80 s the deformation rapidly increases near the water surface gradually slows down along the water depth and stops increasing near the bottom end the movement of the lmrp during evacuation is shown in fig 10e the lmrp accelerates first then decelerates later accelerates again and finally reaches 71 6 m the top of the hard hang off riser is fixed to the platform and the deformation in this region complies with the regular deformation of a cantilever beam clough et al 1977 the distribution of deformation near the bottom end is mainly affected by the weight of the lmrp which always pulls the sliding riser to be vertical thus the deformation curve of the riser bends inward fig 10c the curves of the lateral displacement of the lmrp fig 10e and the lateral deformation of the bottom end fig 10f are complementary and the variation in speed of the lmrp is caused by the dynamic deformation of the riser as it is dragged by the platform fig 10d shows the distribution of bending moment along the entire riser at 80 s the bending moment reaches the maximum of 271 5 kn m at the top end rapidly slows down to a tiny opposite value gradually increases within a small range along the water depth sharply decreases near the lmrp and reaches zero in the end the value of bending moment mainly reflects the effect of the bending degree of the riser on its deformation and the positive or negative sign of the value mainly reflects the bending direction of the riser fig 11 shows the schematic of the curvature radius when the riser is deformed the curvature radius reflects the extent to which the object is bent the smaller the curvature radius is the more severe the curvature is warburton 1976 at the upper section of the riser the riser is bent in the x axis direction and displays a small curvature radius r1 thus the bending moment is negative and the absolute value is relatively large indicating that the riser is highly curved in this section in the middle part of the riser the bending direction is along the positive direction of the x axis and the curvature radius is large r2 r3 the bending moment is small and changes from a negative value to a positive value indicating that the riser is less curved in this section the riser bending direction is along the positive direction of the x axis from the middle to the bottom end and the bending moment is a positive value the largest bending moment occurs at the top end of the riser because the top end of the riser is fixed to the platform and the bending is evident in this period this condition is similar to that of a cantilever beam the bending moment at the bottom end reaches zero which is because the bottom end of the riser is connected to the lmrp by a flexible joint and the riser near this end is relatively straight in summary the distributions of the deformation and bending moment of the riser under hard hang off conditions comply with the regular mechanics of a cantilever beam the greatest deformation occurs at the bottom of the riser and the largest bending moment occurs at the upper joint of the riser moreover the distributions of the deformation and bending moment of the riser show special regularity under the effect of dynamic load the riser bends toward the back direction of the platform at first and then presents a drooping shape along the water depth under the action of the lmrp and the bending moment changes from a large negative value into a small positive value therefore when a riser evacuates under hard hang off conditions the most vulnerable part is the upper joint at the top end of the riser thus this part should be protected in the first place 6 2 influence of the platform speed on the mechanical behavior of the riser in this section the influence of the platform speed on the dynamic mechanical behavior of the riser is investigated the platform speed changes from 2 2 knots 1 13 m s to 2 4 knots 1 34 m s and it is greater than the surface current speed of 1 1 m s the evacuation direction is along the current evidently the displacement distance of the riser considerably increases with the platform speed fig 12 a c meanwhile the relative deformation and bending moment increase with the platform speed fig 12b g the bending moment reaches the maximum of 270 kn m when the evacuation speed is 2 4 knots and exceeds 220 kn m when the evacuation speed is 2 2 knots given that the platform speed is greater than the current speed the load caused by water restrains movement of the riser therefore high platform speed indicates large deformation and bending moment accordingly the platform should be evacuated at a speed that does not exceed that of the surface current in this case chen et al 2012 qi 2015 liu et al 2018 consequently the platform speed is an operable key parameter during emergency evacuation and should be designed elaborately in combination with other parameters 6 3 influence of the surface current speed on the mechanical behavior of the riser fig 13 a and c shows that the displacement distance of the riser increases with the surface current speed fig 13b g shows that the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser decrease with the increase in surface current speed the current speed profile increases with the surface current speed according to ekman drift current theory zhu 1991 mao et al 2016 the platform speed is higher than the current speed and the evacuation direction is along the ocean current the speed difference between the platform and the current decreases and the flow resistance applied to the riser decreases with the gradual increase in the current speed then the relative displacement between the riser and the ocean current declines and the bending moment decreases accordingly wang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 therefore the surface current speed is an important parameter that guides the evacuation indicating that the platform speed corresponds to the surface current speed the closer the platform evacuation speed is to the surface current speed the smaller the deformation bending moment of the riser is this phenomenon enhances the safety of the riser when the surface current is large the platform evacuation speed can be increased correspondingly 6 4 influence of the desired track of drilling platform on the mechanical behavior of the riser the influence of the desired track of drilling platform on the mechanical behavior of the riser is investigated by altering the angle between the track of the drilling platform and the ocean current from 0 to 10 the results are shown in fig 14 the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser increase and the moving distance of the lmrp decreases with the increase of the angle when the angle changes from 0 to 10 the increase in the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser is minimal when the angle changes from 10 to 20 the increase in the lateral deformation and bending moment especially the bending moment at the upper joint of the riser becomes evident therefore the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser are small when the platform is evacuated along the current the changes in relative speed between the platform and the ocean current in the tracing direction of the platform caused by altering the angle are shown in fig 15 an increase in the angle exerts the same effect as a decrease in current speed does when the angle is large the relative speed increases evidently chen et al 2012 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the deformation and bending moment of the riser increase with the relative speed as explained in the previous section consequently a large angle between the track of the drilling platform and the ocean current will greatly increase the risk at the upper joint the desired track of the drilling platform is along the ocean current 6 5 influence of the weight of lmrp on the mechanical behavior of the riser fig 16 presents the variations in the dynamic mechanical behavior of the riser with the weight of the lmrp changing from 120 tons to 140 tons the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser slightly decrease and the moving distance of the bottom end slightly increases with the weight of lmrp the reason is that the riser is connected to the lmrp by a flexible joint the gravity of the lmrp is vertically downward and this vertical force always tends to pull the sliding riser to be vertical which can effectively restrain the lateral deformation of the riser meanwhile the axial tension force of the riser increases with the weight of the lmrp thereby reducing the deformation of the riser however according to equation 9 with a heavy lmrp the tension at the cross section of the riser will be large if the tension on the unit section is excessive then it may put the riser joint at risk wang et al 2014 mao et al 2016 therefore a riser with a heavy lmrp has small deformation and bending moment and can thus bear large environmental loads and be evacuated at a high speed however it is not a parameter that can be changed during the evacuation it can only be a reference for the selection of other parameters such as platform speed and evacuation track moreover attention should be paid to the axial bearing force of the riser 6 6 influence of the suspension length on the mechanical behavior of the riser fig 17 a and c shows that the displacement distance and bending moment of the riser decrease with the suspension length fig 17b g shows that the lateral deformation of the riser increases with the suspension length therefore the deformation in the part of the lmrp increases with the suspension length however fig 17a shows that the deformation of the riser from 0 m to 900 m conversely decreases with the increase in suspension length the main reason is that a short riser can bear a small amount of environmental load from the bottom end accordingly the deformation at the bottom end is small however the center of gravity of a short riser is higher than that of a long riser and the current speed increases as it moves toward the water surface moreover a short riser can bear a large amount of environmental load at its upper part thereby increasing the deformation in the upper part and the bending moment in the upper joint when the suspension length decreases chen et al 2012 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 therefore tacking back part of the riser can shorten its suspension length in engineering practice and thereby reduce the maximal deformation of the riser however the upper joint of the riser needs to be monitored closely 7 conclusion this research investigated the dynamic mechanical behavior of deep water drilling riser under hard hang off evacuation conditions the influences of the evacuation and current speeds desired track of the drilling platform weight of lmrp and length of the hang off drilling riser on the deformation and bending moment of the drilling riser were analyzed according to this work the major new findings concerning the dynamic mechanical behavior of deep water drilling riser under hard hang off evacuation conditions are 1 a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions was established and the model was solved by finite element method in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with those of other similar researches 2 the greatest deformation occurs at the bottom of riser and the largest bending moment is found at the upper joint when the riser is evacuated under the hard hang off condition therefore the most fragile part of riser is the upper joint at the top end of the riser and this part should be protected in the first place 3 the speeds of the platform and the current directly affect the deformation and bending moment of the riser keeping the platform moving a little faster than the surface current speed can better reduce the deformation and bending moment of the riser however the current speed profile is not uniform when the speed of the platform changes coupling other parameters the change in the mechanical behavior of the of the riser would be complicated therefore the speed of platform is an operable key parameter and should be designed elaborately in combination with other parameters during the emergency evacuation 4 the desired track of the drilling platform is along the ocean current a large angle will significantly increase the risk of upper joint and the evacuation can be faster when the angle is small if it is difficult to safely drive the platform back to the base on land evacuating to a relatively safe sea area in the direction along the current with a small angle is an appropriate scheme 5 increasing the weight of lmrp can reduce the deformation and bending moment of the riser but it will obviously increase the platform power cost and the weight of lmrp is not a parameter that can be changed during the evacuation therefore the riser with a heavy lmrp is subject to smaller deformation and bending moment and can consequently bear larger environment load and be evacuated at a higher speed meaning that the weight of lmrp can be a reference for choosing other parameters 6 a short riser is beneficial to reducing the deformation of the entire riser but is harmful to the upper joint and tacking back parts of the riser will not significantly contribute to the safety of the hard hang off riser in addition the riser recycling is a time consuming task which may result in missing the optimal evacuation opportunities when the

22771,a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions was established and the model was solved by finite element method in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with similar researches the influences of evacuation and current speeds the desired track of the drilling platform the weight of lower marine riser package lmrp and the length of the hang off drilling riser on drilling riser deformation and bending moment were analyzed results indicate that the most fragile part of riser is the upper joint on the top end and the platform speed and track direction are key operable parameters during the emergency evacuation keeping the platform moving a little faster than the surface current speed especially with a heavy lmrp is favorable for reducing the deformation of the riser the desired track of drilling platform is along the ocean current recycling the riser helps reduce the deformation but harms the upper joint of the riser these results can provide a basis for making evacuation plans of the platform provide a theoretical guarantee for the safety of the hard hang off riser and serve as a reference for the production and installation of the riser keywords drilling riser deep water hard hang off dynamic analysis 1 introduction a drilling riser is an important device for offshore drilling this device is mainly connected to a drilling platform and a subsea wellhead and it separates the sea water from the drilling annulus the platform is relatively stable and fixed at a specific position during normal operation and the connected riser system is at a closed state however in the event of severe weather such as typhoons during which the riser and subsea wellhead will be forced to separate the drilling platform needs to be evacuated with the hang off riser to ensure the safety of equipment and people on the platform one hang off mode is called hard hang off which usually compresses expansion joints and locks the inner tubes of expansion joints into the outer tubes in hard hang off the tensioner system is disconnected and the diverter upper flex joint and telescopic joint are demounted the top of the riser is directly suspended from the drill floor at the gimbal spider the lmrp at the bottom of the riser is separated from the subsea blowout preventer bop the stress of a hard hang off riser is complicated that is the load of the ocean environment changes with the platform speed and the evacuation direction the riser is connected to the platform by its top end and will be towed to move when the platform moves and the riser bears the self weight and inertia and it is constantly bent and oscillated under the combined action of the aforementioned factors this condition changes the distribution of marine environmental loads if the bending and deformation of risers exceed the ultimate strength of materials then these risers will be damaged and could ultimately result in accidents therefore the dynamic analysis of risers in hard hang off mode during emergency evacuation is important to ensure the safety of risers and platforms scholars have conducted many theoretical studies on the mechanical behavior of risers burke 1973 performed a static analysis on a marine riser model using a beam model and found that the vessel response induced by waves could be a key design factor of the dynamic behavior of the riser gardner and kotch 1976 used a finite element method fem to carry out a dynamic analysis on a riser and reported that the bending stress of riser decreases with an increase in top tension patel et al 1984 investigated the mechanical behavior of a riser by using the time domain method and compared this behavior with that observed through the frequency domain method to determine the lateral displacement and lateral stress of marine risers atadan et al 1997 considered and analyzed a riser system and drilling platforms as an entire system by using a cantilever model the results demonstrated that platform mass affects the first resonance of the riser system wang et al 2013 presented a direct algorithm using the runge kutta method as a steady state solution for long slender cylindrical structures and compared it with the time iteration calculation the direct algorithm spends less time than the time iteration scheme does mao et al 2016 established an analysis model for the mechanical behavior of a deep water drilling riser that considers the actual string configuration of the riser the authors also discussed the effects of the top tension drilling platform drift distance surface current speed wave height wave period wave length wind speed and damping coefficient on the lateral displacement bending moment and deflection of risers based on existing research on risers under normal drilling conditions many studies have focused on the mechanical behavior of risers under emergency evacuation conditions arising from a harsh environment ambrose et al 2001 examined the stress and load performance of riser systems with soft and hard suspension under different environmental conditions fig 1 as shown in the figure the riser is connected to the platform by a rotatable joint and can thus rotate around the top end under soft suspension conditions while the riser is fixed to the platform can rotate at the top end under hard suspension conditions they found that a riser system with hard suspension is more sensitive to sea conditions and dry wet weight ratios than a riser system with soft suspension is brekke et al 2004 presented an overview of the riser management and indicated that hard hang off is considered only when the riser runs away or is pulled and supported by a hook or spider and when the top of the riser moves up and down with the vessel which could cause considerable hook load variations in the riser itoh 2006 conducted a model experiment on a hang off riser in a deep sea basin and simulated the translational and rotational motions of the upper floating structure by using a forced oscillation device the motion of the riser was measured using a 3d video tracking system and a numerical analysis program was developed to simulate riser behavior sun et al 2009 investigated the axial dynamic characteristics of ultra deep water risers in hard hang off configurations and discussed the typhoon avoidance management strategy of risers dai et al 2009 calculated the rotation angle and stress of a riser under operable hang off modes to determine the operability envelop during emergencies the results demonstrated that the operability envelop is relatively small under harsh conditions and that the number of buoyancy modules is slightly large williams 2010 outlined the key issues associated with modeling and analysis techniques for drilling riser systems intended for deep water and harsh environment locations identified several conservatisms in current practice and outlined optimizations the authors used fems to verify the operability of drilling riser systems in harsh environments ju 2012 presented a method to analyze the operating windows of risers under hard hang off modes the authors established a finite element model for the axial dynamic analysis and examined riser hang off windows under different oceanic conditions based on restraint criteria for riser hang off operations gao et al 2014 simulated a marine drilling riser system through fem with orcaflex software on a semisubmersible platform and studied the axial dynamic characteristics of a hard hang off riser at different water depths wu et al 2014 built a dynamical model to simulate the dynamic response of a riser in a hard hang off state with consideration of the wave and current effects platform motion and large deformation of the drilling riser the authors also investigated the dynamic response of the riser to evacuate with hysy 981 drilling platform under the ocean condition caused by a once in a year typhoon in the south china sea wang et al 2014 established a static analysis model and an equation to analyze the stress and deformation of a riser in its installation the results demonstrated the maximum movement speed of the floating drilling platform during the installation of the riser qi 2015 applied fem with the orcaflex software to simulate dynamic responses of a hard hang off drilling riser system with different suspended lengths current speeds and driving directions and analyzed the feasibility of riser evacuation under hard hang off mode in case of a typhoon the authors also used shear7 to investigate the vortex induced vibration characteristics of drilling risers under hard hang off mode when evacuated to avoid typhoons sheng et al 2016 analyzed the hard hang off mode of an ultra deep water well riser and demonstrated that the safety performance of the hard hang off riser is limited by the riser stress and the angle of upper flexible joint fan et al 2017 constructed a dynamic hang off riser model based on the euler bernoulli theory which considers the vessel motion and the combined excitation of ocean currents surface waves and isws the results indicated that isw can significantly increase the envelops of the riser in the upper seawater layer and dramatically expand the horizontal deviation of a hang off riser at the bottom as isw spreads liu et al 2017 presented a dynamic analysis model and a method for a riser system under different operation modes to calculate the weak points and safe operation window of the riser system in typhoons the results showed that the weak points of a hard hang off riser include the stress displacement near the moonpool top angle and large and small safe operation windows in the downstream and upstream directions respectively liu et al 2018 developed a model to investigate the dynamic behavior of a deep water drilling platform riser system under emergency evacuation conditions and analyzed the influences of the platform motion riser suspension length ocean load and platform evacuation speed on the dynamic behavior of the riser in previous research various authors introduced solution methods and assistant software to study the dynamic characteristics of risers many researchers also presented numerical models to analyze hang off risers however it is difficult to obtain the stable dynamic characteristics of risers such as deformation and bending moment and there is room to improve the numerical procedures moreover the comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence the safety of hard hang off risers is scarce the present study focuses on the dynamic mechanical behavior of drilling risers under hard hang off emergency evacuation conditions and provides operational recommendations a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions was established and the model was solved by fem in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with those in similar research the influences of the evacuation and current speeds desired track of the drilling platform lmrp weight and length of the hang off drilling riser on the deformation and bending moment of the drilling riser were discussed the operation strategies that will best protect the riser were also analyzed 2 riser model and calculation equations fig 2 displays the riser model in hard hang off mode the drilling riser with the lmrp is disconnected from the bop and the top end of the riser is suspended to the platform and moves as the platform moves thus the mechanical model of a hard hang off riser can be regarded as a cantilever beam that is fixed at the top end and free at the bottom end the desired track of a drilling platform may be different from the direction of the ocean environment the schematic of the evacuation for the drilling platform is shown in fig 3 the thickness and diameter of the riser are assumed to be constant along the z axis and the material is presumed homogeneous and isotropic the moving speed of the platform is assumed to be constant the variation in the string configuration along the longitudinal direction is ignored the loads of the internal fluid slightly affect the movement of the riser under hang off conditions thus in this work the internal solidary waves are ignored in the analysis model the lateral displacement of a riser is much greater than its diameter during evacuation and the length of the riser is also considerably greater than its diameter hence in this work the riser is considered as an entity of a slender cylinder beam and the bending on the joint connecting two single entities is neglected considering the bending deformation and the longitudinal stretching under the lateral loads the force analysis of the riser and micro body is shown in fig 4 where the riser deforms in the x z plane when the micro body dz deforms under the lateral force the bending moment m shear deformation q and axial force t change in the first order wilson 2003 1 m d m m m z d z q d q q q z d z f d f f f z d z according to the newton s second law the horizontal force of the micro body can be expressed as 2 f x m r d z 2 x t 2 where m r is the mass of the riser per unit length kg m then 3 t x z t d t x z 2 x z 2 d z q q d q f d z c x t d z m r d z x t where c is the damping coefficient of the riser t is the axial tension force of the riser n and f is the lateral ocean environment force n combining the equations 1 and 3 and neglecting the high order items such as dx 2 dx 3 etc wilson 2003 4 q z z t x z f c x t m r 2 x t 2 according to mechanics of materials gere and timoshenko 1984 the shear force and bending moment can be written as 5 q m z 6 m e i 2 x z 2 where ei is the bending stiffness of the riser n m 2 e i e π d o 4 d i 4 64 e is the elastic modulus of the riser pa d o is the outer diameter of the riser m and d i is the inner diameter of the riser m taking equation 6 to the derivative form of equation 5 7 q z 2 m z 2 2 z 2 e i 2 x z 2 e i 4 x z 4 combining the equations 3 and 7 the forth order partial differential equation considering the effective axial force damping force and combined hydraulic loads of the hard hang off riser is obtained 8 e i 4 x z 4 m r 2 x t 2 c x t t z 2 x z 2 f z t where t t z is the riser tension force distribution along the z axis n and f f z t is the distribution of lateral ocean environment force along the z axis n in the axial direction the upper part of the riser is subjected to the weight of the lower part under hard hang off conditions and bears the huge weight of lmrp at the bottom at the same time the riser is subject to the buoyancy of the water as it is in the sea fig 5 shows the schematic of the riser axial tension force thus the distribution of riser tension force along the z axis can be calculated by 9 t z g m lmrp g m r ρ w π 4 d o 2 d i 2 l z where g is the gravity acceleration n kg m lmrp is the quality of the lower marine riser package kg ρ w is the seawater density kg m 3 and l is the total riser length m the top end of the riser is fixed to the platform hence the speed of the riser at the top end in the x axis is equal to that of the platform however the bottom end is free from any constraints therefore the boundary conditions arising from the actual constraints of the hard hang off riser can be expressed as follows 10 u 0 t u p v 0 t 0 0 t 0 u l 0 0 e i 2 x l t z 2 0 where u is the speed of riser in the x axis m l is the length of the drilling riser m and u p is the drift speed of the drilling platform m 3 ocean environmental loads of the riser model the forces applied to the riser comprise the ocean environmental loads riser weight and lmrp weight the ocean environmental loads mainly include the loads of wave and current the wave is mainly concentrated on the microscopic motion law of water particle while ocean current mainly focuses on the macroscopic speed distribution of seawater along the water depth since the wave parameters barely affect the deformation of the riser mao et al 2016 the loads caused by the ocean current and the movement of the platform are mainly concerned in this study the riser is regarded as a slender cylinder and it moves with the current loads and the displacement of the platform thus the main ocean environmental loads on a riser can be simulated by the morison equation morison et al 1950 han and benaroya 2000 11 f w 1 2 c d ρ w d o u w d x d t u w d x d t c m ρ w π d o 2 4 d u w d t c m ρ w π d o 2 4 d u w d t d 2 x d t 2 where c d is the drag force coefficient which is a dimensionless quantity ρ w is the seawater density kg m3 d o is the outer diameter of the drilling riser m u w is the horizontal speed of the water m s for ocean current the way to obtain the u w mainly includes measuring the actual distribution of the water speed or deducing the speed profile by the recurrence period of ocean current in a specific sea area x is the horizontal displacement of the riser m d x d t is the horizontal speed of the riser c m is the added mass coefficient which is a dimensionless quantity and c m is the inertia force coefficient which is also a dimensionless quantity and can be calculated by c m 1 zhang and cui 2015 in equation 11 the first item is the drag force which is determined by the speeds of both water and riser the second item is the inertial force which is determined by the absolute speed of the water and the third item is the added mass force caused by the fluid particles that are displaced by the motion of the cylinder han and benaroya 2000 also equation 11 indicates that the ocean environmental loads are apparently conditioned by the speeds of the ocean current and the platform in an actual evacuation the speed of ocean current changes with the variation in water depth and time thus ocean environmental loads are the dynamic forces applied to the riser and the main factor that affects the movement of the riser 4 numerical solution of the riser model the finite element method fem is used to discretize the hard hang off riser model the entire riser is discretized into finite elements d z calculation time is divided into finite time periods δ t and the grid nodes of the calculated riser are shown in fig 6 the movement of each element subjected to forces from the x and z axes can be described by the lateral speed u r in the x axis the longitudinal speed v r in the z axis and the deflection θ r the dynamic response of the riser per element and time period can be obtained based on the iterating time to solve equation 8 by the newmark β method an available method for solving the mechanical dynamics problem this method can realize an unconditionally stable integration and the selection of time step will not affect the stability of the solution as long as the integral precision is satisfied then a large time step can be used in the calculation to shorten the calculation time the typical structural dynamic motion equation equation 8 wilson 2003 is expressed as 12 m u c u k u f t where k is the object stiffness array for the general static force analysis c is the object damping array m is the object weight array u is the nodal displacement u is the displacement speed u is the acceleration vector of the object and f t is the load vectors of the node these parameters are functions of time t the model should be discretized before being solved the model is a simply supported beam and the piecewise cubic hermite interpolation can be used to discretize equation 12 the shape function chopra 1995 is shown as follows 13 n 1 1 3 z 2 l 2 2 z 3 l 3 n 2 z 2 z 2 l z 3 l 2 n 3 3 z 2 l 2 2 z 3 l 3 n 4 z 2 l z 3 l 2 where l is the riser length m thus the element mass matrix m e can be described as 14 m i j e 0 l n i m r n j d z the element damping matrix c e can be expressed as 15 c i j e 0 l n i c n j d z the element stiffness matrix is composed of the bending and geometric stiffness matrices which are caused by the tension along the riser thus the element stiffness matrix can be determined as 16 k e k e 1 k e 2 k e 3 where 17 k e 1

matrix c e should be converted from partial coordinates to global coordinates as k m and c respectively 20 k t t k e t m t t m e t c t t c e t where t is the transformation matrix used to transform a partial coordinate into a global coordinate that is changing the element matrix into a global matrix warburton 1976 t 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 t t 0 t 0 t 0 when the newmark β method is used to solve equation 12 transferred from equation 8 the solution process is as follows warburton 1976 1 the stiffness matrix k mass matrix m and damping matrix c are formatted 2 the initial values of u 0 u 0 and

chosen to shorten the calculation time warburton 1976 4 the effective stiffness matrix is formed as k ˆ k a 0 m a 1 c 5 the effective load for the time t δ t is calculated as follows f ˆ t δ t f t δ t

analyze the dynamic mechanical behavior of the hard hang off riser 5 verification of the riser model the model was compared with orcaflex and ansys simulation software qi 2015 and the simulation program was coded by wu wu et al 2014 to verify the correctness of the numerical simulation results the maximum dynamic tensions of the riser were compared by four methods and the basic parameters were selected from the literature qi 2015 the comparison results fig 8 a show that the distributions of maximum effective tension of the riser calculated by the four methods are nearly the same the effective tension decreases with the increase in water depth and it reaches the maximum at the top of the hard hang off riser and the minimum at the lower end of the hard hang off riser the knuckle points appear near 45 and 780 m because the effective tension is related to the weight of riser the slope of the curve changes with the weight of the riser in different places the model was also compared with the lateral deformation of ansys simulated by sun 2009 the riser length is 1829 m and is converted to relative position 0 to 1 0 refers to the bottom end and 1 refers to the top end the speed of the surface current is 0 34 m s and the platform speed is 0 6 m s fig 8b shows the comparison results the deformation trends obtained by two methods are consistent the deformation increases rapidly near the upper end increases slowly near the top end and finally reaches the maximum at the bottom end these results prove the correctness of the numerical simulation model 6 case study and result discussion 6 1 analysis of basic parameters and results a deep water drilling well in south china sea was selected to analyze the dynamic characteristics of a riser under hard hang off conditions the basic parameters of the riser are shown in table 1 the hydraulic parameters in south china sea are shown in table 2 mao et al 2016 and the distribution with the surface current speed at 1 1 m s is shown in fig 9 in this case the riser was divided into 50 parts and the time was divided into 100 000 steps calculation time is 80s as shown in table 2 it is assumed that the top end of the riser is equal to the water surface and the speed of the platform is constant and the accelerating phases of the platform are ignored the simulation results are shown in fig 10 fig 10a intuitionally shows the distribution of the lateral riser deformation from 0 s to 80 s the deformation of the entire riser increases as the time progresses and always reaches the peak at the bottom end at certain time the relative deformation of the bottom end compared with that of the platform is shown in fig 10e the lmrp at the bottom end accelerates slowly first and then decelerates with the greatest deformation of 37 m the deformation of the entire riser and the movement of the bottom end conform to the regular deformation of a cantilever beam clough et al 1977 fig 10b shows the distribution of the lateral displacement of the riser at 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 s the top of the riser moves with the platform at the speed of 1 34 m s whereas the lower part of the riser moves apparently slower than the platform does the slowest position is the lmrp at the bottom end of the riser meanwhile the shape of riser displacement gradually transforms from a straight line to a curve the riser fluctuates at approximately 25 s and becomes stabilized again at approximately 45 s the distribution of current speed is shown in fig 9 notably the speed of surface current is less than that of the platform thus the environmental load applied to the riser restrains its movement as a result the riser gradually deforms as time progresses the fluctuating phases are caused by the coefficient effect of load and gravity load is directly related to the speed and gravity is directly related to the dip angle of the riser thus when the load and gravity reach a similar value the shape of the riser displacement becomes stable as shown in the later period of fig 10c wu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 fig 10c and e show that the platform moves to 107 m and that the lmrp moves to 71 6 m at 80 s the deformation rapidly increases near the water surface gradually slows down along the water depth and stops increasing near the bottom end the movement of the lmrp during evacuation is shown in fig 10e the lmrp accelerates first then decelerates later accelerates again and finally reaches 71 6 m the top of the hard hang off riser is fixed to the platform and the deformation in this region complies with the regular deformation of a cantilever beam clough et al 1977 the distribution of deformation near the bottom end is mainly affected by the weight of the lmrp which always pulls the sliding riser to be vertical thus the deformation curve of the riser bends inward fig 10c the curves of the lateral displacement of the lmrp fig 10e and the lateral deformation of the bottom end fig 10f are complementary and the variation in speed of the lmrp is caused by the dynamic deformation of the riser as it is dragged by the platform fig 10d shows the distribution of bending moment along the entire riser at 80 s the bending moment reaches the maximum of 271 5 kn m at the top end rapidly slows down to a tiny opposite value gradually increases within a small range along the water depth sharply decreases near the lmrp and reaches zero in the end the value of bending moment mainly reflects the effect of the bending degree of the riser on its deformation and the positive or negative sign of the value mainly reflects the bending direction of the riser fig 11 shows the schematic of the curvature radius when the riser is deformed the curvature radius reflects the extent to which the object is bent the smaller the curvature radius is the more severe the curvature is warburton 1976 at the upper section of the riser the riser is bent in the x axis direction and displays a small curvature radius r1 thus the bending moment is negative and the absolute value is relatively large indicating that the riser is highly curved in this section in the middle part of the riser the bending direction is along the positive direction of the x axis and the curvature radius is large r2 r3 the bending moment is small and changes from a negative value to a positive value indicating that the riser is less curved in this section the riser bending direction is along the positive direction of the x axis from the middle to the bottom end and the bending moment is a positive value the largest bending moment occurs at the top end of the riser because the top end of the riser is fixed to the platform and the bending is evident in this period this condition is similar to that of a cantilever beam the bending moment at the bottom end reaches zero which is because the bottom end of the riser is connected to the lmrp by a flexible joint and the riser near this end is relatively straight in summary the distributions of the deformation and bending moment of the riser under hard hang off conditions comply with the regular mechanics of a cantilever beam the greatest deformation occurs at the bottom of the riser and the largest bending moment occurs at the upper joint of the riser moreover the distributions of the deformation and bending moment of the riser show special regularity under the effect of dynamic load the riser bends toward the back direction of the platform at first and then presents a drooping shape along the water depth under the action of the lmrp and the bending moment changes from a large negative value into a small positive value therefore when a riser evacuates under hard hang off conditions the most vulnerable part is the upper joint at the top end of the riser thus this part should be protected in the first place 6 2 influence of the platform speed on the mechanical behavior of the riser in this section the influence of the platform speed on the dynamic mechanical behavior of the riser is investigated the platform speed changes from 2 2 knots 1 13 m s to 2 4 knots 1 34 m s and it is greater than the surface current speed of 1 1 m s the evacuation direction is along the current evidently the displacement distance of the riser considerably increases with the platform speed fig 12 a c meanwhile the relative deformation and bending moment increase with the platform speed fig 12b g the bending moment reaches the maximum of 270 kn m when the evacuation speed is 2 4 knots and exceeds 220 kn m when the evacuation speed is 2 2 knots given that the platform speed is greater than the current speed the load caused by water restrains movement of the riser therefore high platform speed indicates large deformation and bending moment accordingly the platform should be evacuated at a speed that does not exceed that of the surface current in this case chen et al 2012 qi 2015 liu et al 2018 consequently the platform speed is an operable key parameter during emergency evacuation and should be designed elaborately in combination with other parameters 6 3 influence of the surface current speed on the mechanical behavior of the riser fig 13 a and c shows that the displacement distance of the riser increases with the surface current speed fig 13b g shows that the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser decrease with the increase in surface current speed the current speed profile increases with the surface current speed according to ekman drift current theory zhu 1991 mao et al 2016 the platform speed is higher than the current speed and the evacuation direction is along the ocean current the speed difference between the platform and the current decreases and the flow resistance applied to the riser decreases with the gradual increase in the current speed then the relative displacement between the riser and the ocean current declines and the bending moment decreases accordingly wang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 therefore the surface current speed is an important parameter that guides the evacuation indicating that the platform speed corresponds to the surface current speed the closer the platform evacuation speed is to the surface current speed the smaller the deformation bending moment of the riser is this phenomenon enhances the safety of the riser when the surface current is large the platform evacuation speed can be increased correspondingly 6 4 influence of the desired track of drilling platform on the mechanical behavior of the riser the influence of the desired track of drilling platform on the mechanical behavior of the riser is investigated by altering the angle between the track of the drilling platform and the ocean current from 0 to 10 the results are shown in fig 14 the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser increase and the moving distance of the lmrp decreases with the increase of the angle when the angle changes from 0 to 10 the increase in the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser is minimal when the angle changes from 10 to 20 the increase in the lateral deformation and bending moment especially the bending moment at the upper joint of the riser becomes evident therefore the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser are small when the platform is evacuated along the current the changes in relative speed between the platform and the ocean current in the tracing direction of the platform caused by altering the angle are shown in fig 15 an increase in the angle exerts the same effect as a decrease in current speed does when the angle is large the relative speed increases evidently chen et al 2012 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the deformation and bending moment of the riser increase with the relative speed as explained in the previous section consequently a large angle between the track of the drilling platform and the ocean current will greatly increase the risk at the upper joint the desired track of the drilling platform is along the ocean current 6 5 influence of the weight of lmrp on the mechanical behavior of the riser fig 16 presents the variations in the dynamic mechanical behavior of the riser with the weight of the lmrp changing from 120 tons to 140 tons the lateral deformation and bending moment of the riser slightly decrease and the moving distance of the bottom end slightly increases with the weight of lmrp the reason is that the riser is connected to the lmrp by a flexible joint the gravity of the lmrp is vertically downward and this vertical force always tends to pull the sliding riser to be vertical which can effectively restrain the lateral deformation of the riser meanwhile the axial tension force of the riser increases with the weight of the lmrp thereby reducing the deformation of the riser however according to equation 9 with a heavy lmrp the tension at the cross section of the riser will be large if the tension on the unit section is excessive then it may put the riser joint at risk wang et al 2014 mao et al 2016 therefore a riser with a heavy lmrp has small deformation and bending moment and can thus bear large environmental loads and be evacuated at a high speed however it is not a parameter that can be changed during the evacuation it can only be a reference for the selection of other parameters such as platform speed and evacuation track moreover attention should be paid to the axial bearing force of the riser 6 6 influence of the suspension length on the mechanical behavior of the riser fig 17 a and c shows that the displacement distance and bending moment of the riser decrease with the suspension length fig 17b g shows that the lateral deformation of the riser increases with the suspension length therefore the deformation in the part of the lmrp increases with the suspension length however fig 17a shows that the deformation of the riser from 0 m to 900 m conversely decreases with the increase in suspension length the main reason is that a short riser can bear a small amount of environmental load from the bottom end accordingly the deformation at the bottom end is small however the center of gravity of a short riser is higher than that of a long riser and the current speed increases as it moves toward the water surface moreover a short riser can bear a large amount of environmental load at its upper part thereby increasing the deformation in the upper part and the bending moment in the upper joint when the suspension length decreases chen et al 2012 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 therefore tacking back part of the riser can shorten its suspension length in engineering practice and thereby reduce the maximal deformation of the riser however the upper joint of the riser needs to be monitored closely 7 conclusion this research investigated the dynamic mechanical behavior of deep water drilling riser under hard hang off evacuation conditions the influences of the evacuation and current speeds desired track of the drilling platform weight of lmrp and length of the hang off drilling riser on the deformation and bending moment of the drilling riser were analyzed according to this work the major new findings concerning the dynamic mechanical behavior of deep water drilling riser under hard hang off evacuation conditions are 1 a dynamic analysis model for a drilling riser under hard hang off conditions was established and the model was solved by finite element method in combination with the newmark β method and verified by comparing the results with those of other similar researches 2 the greatest deformation occurs at the bottom of riser and the largest bending moment is found at the upper joint when the riser is evacuated under the hard hang off condition therefore the most fragile part of riser is the upper joint at the top end of the riser and this part should be protected in the first place 3 the speeds of the platform and the current directly affect the deformation and bending moment of the riser keeping the platform moving a little faster than the surface current speed can better reduce the deformation and bending moment of the riser however the current speed profile is not uniform when the speed of the platform changes coupling other parameters the change in the mechanical behavior of the of the riser would be complicated therefore the speed of platform is an operable key parameter and should be designed elaborately in combination with other parameters during the emergency evacuation 4 the desired track of the drilling platform is along the ocean current a large angle will significantly increase the risk of upper joint and the evacuation can be faster when the angle is small if it is difficult to safely drive the platform back to the base on land evacuating to a relatively safe sea area in the direction along the current with a small angle is an appropriate scheme 5 increasing the weight of lmrp can reduce the deformation and bending moment of the riser but it will obviously increase the platform power cost and the weight of lmrp is not a parameter that can be changed during the evacuation therefore the riser with a heavy lmrp is subject to smaller deformation and bending moment and can consequently bear larger environment load and be evacuated at a higher speed meaning that the weight of lmrp can be a reference for choosing other parameters 6 a short riser is beneficial to reducing the deformation of the entire riser but is harmful to the upper joint and tacking back parts of the riser will not significantly contribute to the safety of the hard hang off riser in addition the riser recycling is a time consuming task which may result in missing the optimal evacuation opportunities when the platform is evacuated under the hard hang off mode a special optimization algorithm is required to optimize the recycling length and decision scheme of the riser for further study acknowledgments the

22772,this study presents a fully coupled numerical approach to study wave energy converters interaction with water waves the open source smoothed particle hydrodynamics model gpusph is used to resolve wave dynamics and compute the hydrodynamic force on wave energy converters the dynamics of wave energy converter is computed by the open source physics engine project chrono the capability of the coupled numerical model to handle wave body interaction is validated by considering a floating body in still water the results show that the coupled model correctly predicts the balance between the floating body weight and the buoyancy force furthermore the effectiveness of density diffusion method in reducing acoustic noise in a weakly compressible sph model is also justified in addition the model is validated by laboratory experiment on floating body interaction with nonlinear wave packet the model is then applied to simulate two types of wave energy converters we conduct a thorough

of csi device with waves but also we obtain the mooring force on the device that can facilitate the design of wave energy converters we show that to maximize the energy extraction it is important to design the device to have a natural frequency similar to the wave period of deployment site to maximize the swing motion of the pendulum finally the interaction of csi device under different sea

efficient tool for modeling wave energy conversion devices in directional nonlinear sea states keywords wave energy converter floating body power take off wave body interaction gpusph project chrono 1 introduction renewable ocean energy has received a considerable amount of attention in the past decades and various types of wave energy converters have been developed to harvest ocean energy day et al 2015 when it comes to numerical modeling of wave energy converters one challenge is to resolve the nonlinear dynamics penalba et al 2017a specifically the numerical model has to simulate nonlinear ocean waves in a realistic way furthermore the model should correctly predict the motion of floating body driven by waves and also the nonlinear feedback of body motion on ambient wave field under diverse sea states and different operation modes this work is dedicated to addressing the above challenge by presenting a high fidelity numerical approach that simulates the nonlinear interaction between wave energy converters and different types of sea states the study of wave interaction with floating bodies has been carried out for decades the linear and second order potential theory has been applied to analyze floating or submerged bodies in the presence of ocean waves the boundary element method bem is used to solve for the velocity potential and fluid pressure on the submerged surfaces of floating bodies this method is simple and computationally efficient and it has been adopted to study wave energy converters by several models such as wamit lee and newman 2013 and nemoh penalba et al 2017b however due to the notable assumptions of the potential flow theory i e inviscid incompressible and irrotational flows those low fidelity methods are not suitable to simulate energetic and nonlinear waves interaction with wave energy converters the limitation of potential flow theory in modeling viscous flows and nonlinear waves could be well addressed by solving the navier stokes ns equations the readers are referred to the thorough review work by windt et al 2018 for more details however a few studies were mentioned here to highlight the need of high fidelity models for wave energy converters modeling rafiee and fiévez 2015 applied both linear time domain model derived from the cummins equation cummins 1962 and the fully nonlinear hydrodynamic model to simulate extreme loads on point absorber type of wave energy converters and they showed that the fully nonlinear hydrodynamic model agrees better with the experimental data than the predictions by the linear time domain model palm et al 2016 presented a method for coupled mooring analysis using a two phase navier stokes vof rans model and a high order finite element model of mooring cables their coupled numerical model accurately recreated strongly nonlinear interaction between the wave and the device as observed in the laboratory experiments recently penalba et al 2018 developed a high fidelity wave to wire simulation platform for wave energy converters by coupling a ns based hydrodynamic model with power take off pto models by comparing with low fidelity modeling approaches based on the linear and partially nonlinear bem their study clearly showed that a fully nonlinear hydrodynamic model is essential to resolve the nonlinear interaction between waves and wave energy converters and correspondingly their high fidelity coupled model including both the cfd model and the pto model as a whole is able to accurately simulate the behavior of wave energy converters from ocean waves to the electrical grid the above works among others clearly highlighted that to accurately simulate wave energy converters there is a need to develop advanced models to resolve nonlinear ocean waves the physical processes of wave structure interaction and power generation in addition to the ns based modeling platform the mesh free smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 has gained popularity in simulating nonlinear wave dynamics e g wave breaking and wave structure interaction in the past decade since the first work on sph modeling of wave propagation over a beach by monaghan 1994 the sph method has been quickly applied in various areas in the field of coastal and ocean engineering including wave impact on fixed structures e g aristodemo et al 2017 tsunami inundation e g wei et al 2016 realistic ocean wave generation e g altomare et al 2015 wei et al 2017 and surf zone dynamics e g dalrymple and rogers 2006 makris et al 2016 among many others compared with the significant amount of research of sph modeling of wave interaction with fixed structure there is very little work related to sph modeling of wave energy converters which is the focus of this work henry et al 2013 applied the sph method to simulate wave interaction with oscillating wave surge converter the device is considered as a rigid body and its motion is determined by solving the newton euler equations in their study a similar form of governing equations for rigid body dynamics was used by e g crespo et al 2017 who conducted an sph simulation of offshore oscillating water column converters under waves edge et al 2014 carried out sph modeling of water waves interaction with wave energy conversion devices instead of computing the body motion by the newton euler equations directly in sph models as adopted by the above aforementioned works the motion of floating body was resolved by coupling the sph model with an external physics library open dynamics engine although both approaches for simulating body motion are effective coupling of an external physics engine makes it straightforward to examine multi physics processes such as body body interaction driven by waves within an sph model following the model coupling approach as adopted by edge et al 2014 this study presents a fully coupled numerical model to simulate the interaction of wave energy converters with water waves this physics library coupled in this work is the so called project chrono https projectchrono org and it has been successfully implemented in the sph code dualsphysics specifically brito et al 2016 presented the numerical implementation of dualsphysics chrono coupling and brito et al 2017 2018 further applied the coupled model in studying wave interaction with wave energy device including oscillating wave surge converter which is also examined in this study recently canelas et al 2018 further extended the dualsphysics chrono model to address arbitrary mechanical restrictions between fluid and rigid body interactions this paper is organized as follows section 2 explains the background of the sph model gpusph and the physics engine project chrono and the coupling procedure between two models we validate the coupled model by an analytical solution and laboratory experiment on wave packet impact on floating body in section 3 the model is then applied to explore the capability of modeling wave energy converters in section 4 we applied the coupled model to simulate wave interaction with the oscillating wave surge converter and further examine the device performance under power take off operation and its performance under storm waves in section 5 we present a conceptualized catenary mooring wave energy converter and we simulate the device in real life scale and examine its performance under realistic sea states finally the conclusion is drawn in section 6 2 numerical model this study presents a fully coupled numerical model for wave body interaction the wave dynamics are predicted by the open source smoothed particle hydrodynamics model gpusph www gpusph org and the rigid body dynamics are computed by the open source physics engine project chrono this section explains the fundamentals and also the coupling of two models 2 1 gpusph gpusph was first implemented by hérault et al 2010 and its formulation is based on the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 1 d ρ d t ρ u 2 d u d t p ρ g ν 0 2 u 1 ρ τ where t is the time ρ is the fluid density u is the particle velocity p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration ν 0 is the laminar kinematic viscosity and τ is the turbulence stress tensor which is approximated by the sub particle scale sps model see e g dalrymple and rogers 2006 the sps turbulence formulation uses a physical eddy viscosity which is determined by the instantaneous velocity gradient field specifically 3 τ i j 2 ρ ν t s i j 1 3 δ i j s k k 2 3 ρ c i δ 2 δ i j s 2 where the constant parameter c i 0 0066 δ is the initial particle spacing and δ i j is the kronecker delta the rate of strain tensor is defined by 4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the turbulent viscosity is determined by the smagorinsky turbulent model smagorinsky 1963 5 ν t c s m a g δ 2 s where c s m a g 0 12 and s 2 s i j s i j to close eqs 1 and 2 the pressure needs to be determined the fluid is assumed to be weakly compressible then the pressure can be directly computed by using the equation of state monaghan 1992 as follows 6 p β ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where ρ 0 is the initial density γ is chosen to be 7 and the parameter β is calculated by 7 β ρ 0 c s 2 γ where c s is the speed of sound the real speed of sound leads to a very small time step which is not practical for numerical simulation monaghan 1994 suggested to limit the density fluctuation 1 by setting the ratio of c s u m a x 10 the maximum velocity u m a x in this work is defined as u m a x 2 g h where h is the still water depth it has been well recognized that the weakly compressible sph wcsph method experiences high frequency pressure oscillation to address this issue we used the density diffusion method of molteni and colagrossi 2009 who introduced a proper diffusive term in the wcsph continuity equation to prevent the development of instabilities as well as the presence of high frequencies numerical noise on the pressure field in gpusph the computational domain including rigid body is discretized into a collection of particles with a fixed particle size the governing equations as presented above are discretized by using the quintic wendland 1995 kernel as used in our previous work e g wei et al 2016 the solid boundary is treated by using the dynamic boundary condition presented by dalrymple and knio 2000 this boundary condition establishes several rows of boundary particles which share the same equations of continuity and state as the fluid particles placed inside the domain however their positions and velocities remain unchanged in time successful application of the dynamic boundary condition in gpusph can be found in several works e g wei et al 2015b wei and dalrymple 2016 wei et al 2016 shi et al 2017 2 2 project chrono project chrono https projectchrono org is an open source software developed by researchers at university of wisconsin madison usa and university of parma italy the core strength of project chrono is the handling of the time evolution of systems governed by very large sets of differential algebraic equations ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations tasora et al 2016 highlighted that project chrono could be used to simulate multi physics problems including i the dynamics of large systems of connected bodies governed by differential algebraic equations ii controls and other first order dynamic systems governed by ordinary differential equations iii fluid solid interaction problems governed in part by the navier stokes equations and iv the dynamics of deformable bodies governed by partial differential equations the present study makes use of the capability of project chrono in simulating rigid body dynamics the implementation of project chrono utilizes the latest high performance computing techniques including both cpu parallelism and gpu parallelism project chrono is almost entirely written in c it is compiled into a library subsequently used by third party applications tasora et al 2016 this feature makes the coupling of project chrono with other numerical models straightforward 2 3 gpusph and project chrono coupling the motion of rigid body is computed by coupling gpusph with project chrono gpusph invokes the newton euler equations implemented in project chrono via an application programming interface api to predict rigid body dynamics driven by hydrodynamic force the coupling procedure is illustrated in fig 1 by considering the advance of one computation time step δ t from t t 0 to t 1 t 0 δ t at time t t 0 gpusph calculates the rigid body kinematics including linear and angular velocities center of gravity and rotation with respect to the problem coordinate system associated with a floating structure which is discretized into a set of sph particles x i y i z i in gpusph for a computation time step δ t gpusph first computes the motion of fluid particle by solving eqs 1 2 and 6 then gpusph calculates the fluid force and torque on the rigid body next gpusph passes the rigid body kinematics at t t 0 and external force on body exerted by fluid to project chrono at t 1 t 0 δ t the physics engine project chrono then solves the newton euler equations of motion with the rigid body kinematics and external force provided by gpusph to obtain the rigid body kinematics at t 1 t 0 δ t following that the updated rigid body kinematics is sent back to gpusph by project chrono subsequently gpusph computes the rigid body acceleration during the time step δ t by using the rigid body kinematics at t t 0 and the updated rigid body kinematics provided by project chrono gpusph further solves the equations of motion to determine the rigid body location at t 1 t 0 δ t based on the rigid body acceleration in the time step δ t and its location at t t 0 this also marks the completion of gpusph and project chrono coupling in the following sections we validate the capability of the coupled model to simulate wave body interaction and further apply the model to simulate wave energy converters it is worthy pointing out that although it is feasible to compute the motion of rigid body by directly solving the newton euler equations within an sph model see e g henry et al 2013 and crespo et al 2017 rather than a coupling approach as presented in this work the coupling of an sph model e g gpusph with the physics engine project chrono that considers a series of sophisticated physical processes allows us to explore more challenging scenarios such as wave interaction with flexible body and body body collision driven by water waves which will be explored in the future 3 model verification and validation 3 1 floating bodies in still water the model verification examines the performance of gpusph to simulate a floating body in still water this ideal setup allows us to identify possible influence of the weakly compressible assumption i e high frequency pressure oscillation on the floating body motion furthermore it also helps verify the capability of the coupled model to predict some fundamental phenomena e g the balance between the buoyancy force and the weight of the floating body the numerical experimental sketch is shown in fig 2 the dimension of the numerical wave basin is 3 m 3 m 0 6 m l w h and the still water depth is h 0 4 m the size of a floating body is 0 3 m 0 3 m 0 2 m l b w b h b and its horizontal center is initially placed at the center of the basin i e x c 1 5 m y c 1 5 m the density of the floating body is assumed to be half of the water density ρ b 0 5 ρ w the center of gravity of the floating body is placed at the still water level as indicated in fig 2 since the density of the floating body is half of the water this setup indicates that the buoyancy force and the body weight are initially balanced in terms of numerical setup the floating body is considered as a project chrono rigid body and its motion is determined by the model coupling procedure as mentioned above the computation domain was discretized by using a fixed sph particle size δ p 0 01 m resulting in 4 2 million particles the simulation was run on 1 nvidia tesla k80 gpus and it took about 2 h of computation to simulate the physical time of 10 s fig 3 presents several snapshots of the position of a floating body that has its initial center of gravity at the still water level since there is no motion of floating body in the transverse direction we only show the floating body position and the ambient velocity field in the x z plane the time t is renormalized by g h where g is the gravity acceleration and h is the still water depth the initial position of the floating body is indicated as a black dashed line rectangle and the simulated position of the floating body is indicated as a red solid line rectangle fig 3 a shows the floating body profile at t 0 1 s or t g h 0 495 the symmetric ambient velocity field indicates that there is an upward body movement however the floating body position profile the red solid line rectangle is almost the same as its initial position the black dashed line rectangle fig 3 b shows the floating body profile at t 0 5 s or t g h 2 476 the ambient velocity field shows that there is a relatively random motion of fluid particles even without any external driving force furthermore the simulated body position has a bigger discrepancy when comparing with its initial position this phenomenon is caused by the weakly compressible sph formulation used in this work as mentioned above the density diffusion method of molteni and colagrossi 2009 was implemented to address this issue and its effectiveness could be observed in fig 3 c at t 8 0 s or t g h 39 618 the first important observation is that the ambient velocity field shows that there is almost no fluid motion in the water body a state corresponding to an ideal still water setup furthermore the position of rigid body also returns to the initial body position overall this numerical experiment shows that even with the aid of density diffusion method it is important to have a short numerical model spin up time to minimize acoustic velocity motion in the water body before production runs this is consistent to the observation in our previous work wei et al 2018 for the rest of numerical experiments we generate the wave in the simulation only after one wave period of numerical model spin up time we further examine the hydrodynamic force on the floating body in fig 4 the force is renormalized by the floating body weight w m b g where m b is the floating body mass ideally the floating body is in a balanced state and there is no body motion at all however due to the weakly compressible sph formulation we have observed particle random motion indicated by the random velocity vectors in fig 3 similarly the force profile in fig 4 also shows random fluctuations around zero particularly as seen in the horizontal components forces f x and f y we can further observe minor vertical motion of the floating body in the f z profile in fig 4 before the force balanced is reached after a short period of model spin up time it should be pointed out that although there is a force fluctuation predicted by the numerical model the force magnitude is in the order of 10 3 when comparing with the floating body weight as seen in the horizontal components 3 2 floating body interaction with a wave packet this coupled model is further validated by using the laboratory experiment on a floating body impacted by a wave packet carried out in a small towing tank as reported by hadžić et al 2005 and xing kaeding 2006 fig 5 a shows the sketch of the laboratory experiment in the x z plane the wave flume had a water depth h 0 4 m the floating body was a rectangular prism 0 1 m wide 0 05 m high and 0 29 m long and its material density relative to water is about 0 68 the floating body was located at x 2 11 m away from the flap type wavemaker the time series rotation profile of the wavemaker is showed in fig 5 b and the generated wave packet had a focusing point at the location of the floating body the wave height at focusing point is equal to the floating body height resulting in a nonlinear interaction between the wave packet and the floating body the laboratory measurements included the time series free surface profile at two wave gauges and the time series sway and heave motions of the floating body under wave packet the laboratory experiment has been previously used to validate several sph works on waves and floating body interaction e g bouscasse et al 2013 barreiro et al 2016 in terms of numerical setup in gpusph a 3d computation domain was considered specifically the floating body dimension 0 1 m 0 05 m 0 29 m was fully reproduced in the numerical model to avoid boundary effect from the side wall a flume width of 0 5 m was used in the numerical simulation and the floating body was placed in the middle of the flume along the transverse direction similar to the treatment of floating body in our previous section the body was considered as a project chrono rigid body in the numerical simulation to evaluate the influence of particle resolution on the nonlinear wave generation and the induced floating body motion the computation domain was discretized by using three particle resolutions δ p 0 0125 m 0 01 m and 0 000833 m resulting in 1 1 1 5 and 2 2 million particles respectively the simulation was run on one nvidia tesla k80 gpu and it took about 4 7 h of computation to simulate the physical time of 10 s for three numerical setups fig 6 compares the predicted free surface profiles by gpusph with the laboratory measurement the first wave gauge at x 1 16 m is in front of the floating body and the other wave gauge at x 2 66 m is behind the floating body overall the comparison of sph predictions with three particle sizes at both wave gauges agree well with the laboratory experiment confirming the correct generation and propagation of the nonlinear wave packet by the sph model fig 7 further compares the predicted time series floating body motion driven by the wave packet the coupled model satisfactorily captures the heave motion of the floating body with all three particle sizes the predicted sway profile matches well with the laboratory experiment before the pass of the wave packet it is seen that a finer particle size improves the sph prediction of the sway profile after the pass of the wave but there is still an under prediction when comparing with the laboratory measurement and this discrepancy might be due to the minor loss damping of wave as observed in the free surface profile at x 2 66 m the second panel of fig 6 nevertheless the agreement of floating body motion in this study is comparable to model data comparisons made by barreiro et al 2016 with a similar sph modeling approach in short the model verification and validation presented above showed that the coupled model is suitable for modeling wave interaction with floating body the following sections apply the coupled model to simulate wave interaction with wave energy conversion devices under complex mechanical constraints and nonlinear sea states 4 modeling of oscillating wave surge converter following the model validation presented above the section applies the coupled model to simulate the bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converter which absorbs energy contained in the horizontal motion of water within ocean waves whittaker and folley 2012 the concept of oscillating wave surge converter has been commercialized into the surface piercing oyster device by aquamarine power ltd www aquamarinepower com and the submerged waveroller device by aw energy http aw energy com the present work considers an oyster type oscillating wave surge converter based on the experiment of wei et al 2015a it is noted that the simulation of oscillating wave surge converter has been reported in literature e g brito et al 2016 2017 huang et al 2018 however this present study not only carries out model validation comparison as presented in existing studies it further examines the performance of the device under power production mode and its survivability mode under storm waves 4 1 the oscillating wave surge converter experiment of wei et al 2015a the sketch of the laboratory experiment of wei et al 2015a is shown in fig 8 the wave basin is about 18 m long and 4 6 m wide the flume bottom is a compound slope and the offshore still water depth is h 0 692 m the laboratory work used a 1 25 scale model to represent a simplified oscillating wave surge converter and the device is placed approximately 7 92 m from the wavemaker the device is a 1 04 m 0 48 m 0 12 m box with a hinge height of 0 16 m above the flume bottom fig 8 a the device is placed in the position along the wave basin at y 0 m fig 8 b in terms of numerical setup the flap device and its bottom foundation are represented as project chrono rigid bodies in the simulation the bottom foundation is fixed the flap device is free to move but it is connected with the bottom foundation through a revolute joint defined by the project chrono library it is further possible to apply kinematic constraints to the joint so that the motion of the device can be damped reduced as shown later regular waves with a wave height of h 0 12 m and wave period of t 2 0 s are generated at the left side of the wave flume by a wavemaker at the other end of the flume the waves are absorbed by a numerical sponge layer technique developed by carmigniani and violeau 2018 and the length of the sponge layer is about one wave length the full wave basin is discretized by a constant sph particle size δ p 0 02 m resulting in 7 million particles the simulation was run on 4 nvidia tesla k80 gpus and it took about 2 h of computation to simulate one numerical wave period t 2 s 4 2 wave device interaction and wave gauge comparison fig 9 presents three snapshots showing the interaction between the oscillating wave surge converter with waves predicted by gpusph fig 9 a shows that the device reaches the maximal rotation in the offshore direction when the wave arrives at its offshore side fig 9 b shows that the wave crest arrives at the device and the device is in a nearly vertical position finally fig 9 c shows that the wave passes by the device and the device reaches the maximal rotation in the nearshore direction the comparison of gpusph prediction of time series free surface profiles at three selected wave gauges with the laboratory measurement is shown in fig 10 the first wave gauge is located at x 7 02 m which is in the seaward side of the oscillating wave surge converter and the other two are located at x 8 82 and 12 2 m which measure the free surface profile after the wave passes by the device we compare 15 waves from t 10 40 s since the start of the experiment the comparison at x 7 02 m shows that there is an excellent agreement between gpusph prediction and the laboratory measurement it should be noted that a minor wave peak in the wave troughs occurs since the wave gauge is located about 0 9 m from the device and there is wave reflection from the device as measured at x 7 02 m we can see that this phenomenon is accurately predicted by gpusph the second wave gauge at x 8 82 m is located at the toe of the second slope starting at x 8 52 m thus this wave gauge also measures the wave reflection from the slope the numerical model gpusph again accurately predicts the wave profile as measured in the laboratory the last wave gauge at x 12 2 m measures the wave propagation over the flat area at the end of the wave flume gpusph also satisfactorily predicts the wave profiles as pointed out earlier a numerical sponge layer is applied at the end of the wave flume the good agreement of free surface profile at x 12 2 m confirmed the effectiveness of the sponge layer method of carmigniani and violeau 2018 4 3 the hydrodynamic force and device motion the computed hydrodynamic force on the oscillating wave surge converter and its rotation profile from t 10 40 s are presented in fig 11 due to the fact that the incident wave is periodic with a wave period t 2 s fig 11 a shows that the hydrodynamic force exerted on the device is also periodic with the same oscillation period the comparison of gpusph prediction of oscillating wave surge converter rotation under regular waves with the laboratory measurement is shown in fig 11 b thanks to the excellent wave prediction as shown in fig 10 we obtain very good prediction of the device rotation profile 4 4 numerical experiment on the power take off operation so far we have validated that the coupled gpusph chrono model is effective in simulating oscillating wave surge converter based on our model validation we further carry out numerical experiments to examine the performance of the wave energy converter in two aspects the first one is the introduction of kinematic constraints to mimic the device power take off operation the second numerical experiment is to evaluate the device performance i e survivability under extreme waves the project chrono library provides the capability to introduce different kinematic constraints for rigid body dynamics modeling the kinematic constraint used in the present study considers the damping of the angular velocity of the device and it mimics the mechanical damping similar to the power take off operation the mathematical formulation that describes this process can be defined by 8 i d ω d t τ k d ω where i indicates the moment of inertia ω is the angular velocity τ is the external torque exerted on the device and k d is a damping coefficient which indicates the extent of kinematic constraints on the device fig 12 shows the numerical experiment result based on the validated setup i e wave height h 0 12 m and wave period t 2 0 s which does not involve any mechanical damping labeled as k d 0 in the plot we can see that as we increase the damping coefficient k d the rotation of the device is further reduced it is worthy pointing out that the device rotation reduction does not fit a linear relationship i e the rotation reduction ratio from k d 0 to k d 10 is not equal to the rotation reduction ratio from k d 10 to k d 25 thus the power take off operation on the device is a nonlinear process 4 5 the device performance under extreme wave conditions to evaluate the performance of the oscillating wave surge converter under extreme waves we further carry out numerical experiments to examine the device under storm condition the non storm condition refers to the validated numerical experiment setup and its results were shown in figs 9 11 the storm condition in our numerical setup is determined in two steps 1 we increase the mean water level i e the wave setup due to storm surge by 1 m in the prototype scale in the simulation note that the laboratory scale is 1 25 and 2 we increase the wave height by 60 by considering a stronger wave field under storms fig 13 shows the comparison of the rotation profile of the oscillating wave surge converter under storm condition with non storm condition the non storm profile is the same one as the gpusph prediction presented in fig 11 b we can see that the rotation under storms has the same phase profile as the non storm condition however there is about 32 increase of rotation amplitude from 31 o to 41 o we further note that there is an overtopping over the device under storms as shown in fig 14 fig 14 a shows the instantaneous wave profile and the position of oscillating wave surge converter under the original laboratory setup i e the non storm condition fig 14 b shows the corresponding profile but under storm waves it is seen that the wave is larger resulting in wave overtopping over the wave energy conversion device 5 modeling of large scale wave energy converter under sea states in the previous sections we have validated the model capability for predicting wave force on structures and we further assessed its efficiency in modeling oscillating wave surge converter this section focuses on model application and assesses its capability for modeling real life scale wave energy conversion device developed at coastal studies institute csi in north carolina usa 5 1 csi device a conceptualized wave energy converter the wave energy converter considered in this section is the so called csi device a conceptualized wave energy conversion device the sketch of the csi device is shown in fig 15 fig 15 a shows the zoom in view of the csi device which is made of a floating platform length width height 6 m 6 m 1 m two towers height diameter 7 65 m 1 m a cross bar length diameter 4 m 1 m connecting two towers and a free motion pendulum diameter 1 5 m connecting with the cross bar the density of the platform towers and cross bar is 0 1 ρ w and the material density of the pendulum is 2 ρ w the distance between the center of the pendulum and the cross bar is adjustable and it is 4 5 m for the present setup resulting in a natural frequency of the pendulum t p 4 9 s the four corners of the device are restricted by four mooring lines anchored at the sea bed the horizontal center of csi device is located at x c y c 26 0 m fig 15 b shows the zoom out view of the csi device in particular the mooring line anchoring points at the 25 m deep sea bed at 32 55 25 m 32 55 25 m 78 55 25 m and 78 55 25 m the principle to extract ocean wave energy by csi device is to utilize the forward and backward swing of the pendulum driven by the motion of a floating platform on the water surface we expect that there is a higher potential to extract wave energy if the swing of the pendulum is larger stronger it should be emphasized that since no physical experiments for such a device were available we simulated the conceptualized prototype size of the device compared with the work presented in the previous section there is an additional challenge for this work is that the device motion is restricted by four mooring lines the numerical mooring line setup follows the catenary mooring line method of garza rios et al 1997 the mooring line has one end anchored on the sea bed and the other end connected the floating platform e g csi device in the present work a catenary curved is formed due to its own weight of the mooring line on the other hand the floating device is subject to the tension pulling force from the mooring line garza rios et al 1997 developed analytical expressions to compute the horizontal tension exerted on the floating device their analytical solutions were implemented as a callback function in gpusph to compute the mooring line tension on the csi device in this work in terms of numerical setup the csi device is represented as a set of rigid bodies whose motions are determined by the project chrono library by using the hydrodynamic force simulated by the gpusph model and the mooring force exerted by mooring lines the local water depth is 25 m and we consider a wave train with the incident wave period equal to the natural frequency of the pendulum t n 4 9 s according to the linear dispersion relationship the generated waves are deep water waves the computation domain in the cross shore direction is about three times of the wave length l 37 m and the domain with one wave length nearshore represents the wave absorbing sponge layer by using the sponge layer formulation by carmigniani and violeau 2018 regarding the computation domain in the vertical direction we only simulate the 5 m depth below the mean water level by considering the fact that the propagation of deep water trains is not subject to bottom damping therefore it is not necessary to numerically simulate the full 25 m deep water this strategy allows us to reduce the computation cost significantly 5 2 csi device interaction with regular waves we first investigated the interaction between csi device and regular waves the wave height seaward of the device is about h 1 m and the incident wave period is t 4 9 s which is the same as the natural frequency of a fixed pendulum based on the specific setup in this work the simulated alongshore width of the domain is about 14 m with the device placed at the alongshore center by using a constant sph particle size δ p 0 1 m we obtain 8 2 million particles for the full basin the simulation was run on 4 nvidia tesla k80 gpus and it took about 3 h of computation to simulate one numerical wave period t 4 9 s the interaction of csi device with regular waves is illustrated by three snapshots as presented in fig 16 after about 14 waves have been simulated fig 16 a indicates that the instant when the incoming wave arrives at the seaward side of the device and the pendulum reaches the maximal swing position in the offshore direction fig 16 b shows that the device is riding over the wave crest and both the pendulum and the tower are in the vertical position finally fig 16 c shows the instant when the wave passed by the device and the pendulum reaches the maximal swing position in the nearshore direction fig 17 presents the time series mooring force exerted on the floating platform by the four mooring lines the coordinate e g 32 55 25 indicates the anchoring point of the cable on the sea bed due to the symmetric location of four cables and the considered incident regular wave condition we can see that 1 the mooring force component f x would be the same if two cables anchored at the same x position 2 the mooring force component f y would be the same if two cables anchored at the same y position and 3 the mooring force component f z would be the same if two cables anchored at the same x position however the magnitude of the mooring force f z by the two cables offshore is larger than the mooring force f z exerted by the two cables nearshore next we examine the time series device rotation profile driven by incident regular waves as shown in fig 18 the top panel of fig 18 shows the rotation profile of the pendulum about the vertical axis and the bottom panel of fig 18 shows the rotation profile of the tower we have two important observations one is that the rotation of the pendulum is out of phase with that of the tower in other words when the pendulum reaches the maximal positive rotation amplitude the tower reaches the maximal negative rotation amplitude the other is that the rotation amplitude of the pendulum 65 o is much larger than the rotation amplitude of the tower 13 o we further examined the influence of incident wave period on the pendulum motion as pointed out earlier that the natural frequency of the pendulum used in this work is about t p 4 9 s equal to the incident wave period and we would like to examine two incident wave periods different from the natural frequency specifically we consider three wave periods t 3 9 4 9 and 5 9 s and we obtain their corresponding swing profiles or rotation amplitudes of the csi device as shown in fig 19 it is seen that if the incident wave period is equal to the natural frequency of the device i e 4 9 s we can see that due to resonance the rotation amplitude is about twice of the other two cases with incident wave periods t 3 9 and 5 9 s this observation has an important engineering implication in terms of deploying the csi device in sea waves that is if we know the local wave period of deploying site we should design the pendulum of csi device to have a similar natural frequency to maximize the swing motion 5 3 csi device interaction with directional spectral waves finally we extend the above work to consider the interaction of csi device with directional spectral waves the generation of spectral waves by gpusph was first made by wei et al 2017 the basic idea is to combine a 1d wave energy spectrum with a directional spread function and the interested readers are referred to the appendix of wei et al 2017 for details the present study utilizes the pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 and a cosine squared directional spreading distribution to generate directional sea waves to build a realistic directional spectral wave basin the alongshore width of the basin was extended from 14 m used in the regular wave case to 50 m resulting in 26 5 million sph particles this study presents two cases with the same significant wave period t s 4 9 s but different significant wave heights h s 0 8 m and 2 0 m due to significantly increased computation burden and the limitation of computation resources only a few wave periods were simulated fig 20 presents the numerical prediction of the interaction of csi device with directional spectral sea waves at three time instants the left panel of fig 20 shows the device interaction with waves with a relatively small significant wave height h s 0 8 m generally speaking the device motion is relatively weak the right panel of fig 20 shows the device interaction with waves with a relatively large significant wave height h s 2 0 m which could be storm waves in nature we observed a much stronger device motion under h s 2 0 m by comparing with that under h s 0 8 m we can further examine the mooring force and the device rotation profile under spectral waves predicted by the numerical model as shown in fig 21 we have observed in fig 17 that the mooring force component f z under regular waves would be the same if two cables anchored at the same x position however fig 21 a shows the vertical component of mooring force f z on the csi device under directional spectral waves is very irregular over time furthermore due to the directional spreading of the waves the mooring force component f z exerted by two cables anchored at the same x position is no longer necessary the same as observed under regular waves fig 21 b and c show the time series profile of pendulum rotation and the tower rotation respectively the pendulum rotation is still much larger than the tower rotation indicating that the significant potential of csi device to harvest the ocean wave energy through the pendulum motion furthermore the rotation of the tower is generally out of phase with that of the pendulum consistent with the phenomenon observed under regular waves as shown in fig 18 6 conclusions we have presented a novel numerical approach to simulate wave energy conversion devices under realistic sea states our study utilizes the gpu accelerated mesh free sph model gpusph to simulate sea waves and further takes advantage of the physics engine project chrono to consider rigid body dynamics the computation of wave body interaction was fully coupled by establishing a two way communication between gpusph and chrono the conclusions and major contributions of this study are summarized as follows the coupled model was first validated with analytical solution to examine its capability to simulate a floating body in still water the results showed that gpusph correctly predicts the motion of floating body thus verified the success of the model coupling procedure the validation test further confirmed the effectiveness of density diffusion method in reducing acoustic noise in a weakly compressible sph model furthermore the coupled model was validated by laboratory experiment on floating body interaction with nonlinear wave packet next we conducted a thorough study of gpusph modeling of oyster type oscillating wave surge converter under waves we showed that gpusph accurately predicts both wave gauge measurements and the device rotation as recorded in the laboratory we also carried out numerical experiments to examine the power take off scenario of the oscillating wave surge converter by introducing kinematic constraint into the system through the project chrono library furthermore we examined the device performance under storm condition lastly we presented and simulated a conceptualized catenary mooring wave energy converter device csi device under sea states we examined the interaction of csi device with regular waves and we obtained the mooring forcing that can facilitate the design of wave energy converters we showed that to maximize the energy extraction it is important to design the device to have a natural frequency similar to the wave period of deploying site to maximize the swing motion of the pendulum finally we developed a directional spectral wave basin and examined the interaction of csi device under different sea states with both relatively small and large wave heights overall

the coupled numerical model to handle wave body interaction is validated by considering a floating body in still water the results show that the coupled model correctly predicts the balance between the floating body weight and the buoyancy force furthermore the effectiveness of density diffusion method in reducing acoustic noise in a weakly compressible sph model is also justified in addition the model is validated by laboratory experiment on floating body interaction with nonlinear wave packet the model is then applied to simulate two types of wave energy converters we conduct a thorough

storm condition is further examined we further present and simulate a conceptualized catenary mooring wave energy converter device csi device under real sea states we not only examine the interaction of csi device with waves but also we obtain the mooring force on the device that can facilitate the design of wave energy converters we show that to maximize the energy extraction it is important to design the device to have a natural frequency similar to the wave period of deployment site to maximize the swing motion of the pendulum finally the interaction of csi device under different sea states with both relatively small and large wave heights are evaluated by placing the device in a directional spectral wave basin overall this study shows that the open source model gpusph is an efficient tool for modeling wave energy conversion devices in directional nonlinear sea states keywords wave energy converter floating body power take off wave body interaction gpusph project chrono 1 introduction renewable ocean energy has received a considerable amount of attention in the past decades and various types of wave energy converters have been developed to harvest ocean energy day et al 2015 when it comes to numerical modeling of wave energy converters one challenge is to resolve the nonlinear dynamics penalba et al 2017a specifically the numerical model has to simulate nonlinear ocean waves in a realistic way furthermore the model should correctly predict the motion of floating body driven by waves and also the nonlinear feedback of body motion on ambient wave field under diverse sea states and different operation modes this work is dedicated to addressing the above challenge by presenting a high fidelity numerical approach that simulates the nonlinear interaction between wave energy converters and different types of sea states the study of wave interaction with floating bodies has been carried out for decades the linear and second order potential theory has been applied to analyze floating or submerged bodies in the presence of ocean waves the boundary element method bem is used to solve for the velocity potential and fluid pressure on the submerged surfaces of floating bodies this method is simple and computationally efficient and it has been adopted to study wave energy converters by several models such as wamit lee and newman 2013 and nemoh penalba et al 2017b however due to the notable assumptions of the potential flow theory i e inviscid incompressible and irrotational flows those low fidelity methods are not suitable to simulate energetic and nonlinear waves interaction with wave energy converters the limitation of potential flow theory in modeling viscous flows and nonlinear waves could be well addressed by solving the navier stokes ns equations the readers are referred to the thorough review work by windt et al 2018 for more details however a few studies were mentioned here to highlight the need of high fidelity models for wave energy converters modeling rafiee and fiévez 2015 applied both linear time domain model derived from the cummins equation cummins 1962 and the fully nonlinear hydrodynamic model to simulate extreme loads on point absorber type of wave energy converters and they showed that the fully nonlinear hydrodynamic model agrees better with the experimental data than the predictions by the linear time domain model palm et al 2016 presented a method for coupled mooring analysis using a two phase navier stokes vof rans model and a high order finite element model of mooring cables their coupled numerical model accurately recreated strongly nonlinear interaction between the wave and the device as observed in the laboratory experiments recently penalba et al 2018 developed a high fidelity wave to wire simulation platform for wave energy converters by coupling a ns based hydrodynamic model with power take off pto models by comparing with low fidelity modeling approaches based on the linear and partially nonlinear bem their study clearly showed that a fully nonlinear hydrodynamic model is essential to resolve the nonlinear interaction between waves and wave energy converters and correspondingly their high fidelity coupled model including both the cfd model and the pto model as a whole is able to accurately simulate the behavior of wave energy converters from ocean waves to the electrical grid the above works among others clearly highlighted that to accurately simulate wave energy converters there is a need to develop advanced models to resolve nonlinear ocean waves the physical processes of wave structure interaction and power generation in addition to the ns based modeling platform the mesh free smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 has gained popularity in simulating nonlinear wave dynamics e g wave breaking and wave structure interaction in the past decade since the first work on sph modeling of wave propagation over a beach by monaghan 1994 the sph method has been quickly applied in various areas in the field of coastal and ocean engineering including wave impact on fixed structures e g aristodemo et al 2017 tsunami inundation e g wei et al 2016 realistic ocean wave generation e g altomare et al 2015 wei et al 2017 and surf zone dynamics e g dalrymple and rogers 2006 makris et al 2016 among many others compared with the significant amount of research of sph modeling of wave interaction with fixed structure there is very little work related to sph modeling of wave energy converters which is the focus of this work henry et al 2013 applied the sph method to simulate wave interaction with oscillating wave surge converter the device is considered as a rigid body and its motion is determined by solving the newton euler equations in their study a similar form of governing equations for rigid body dynamics was used by e g crespo et al 2017 who conducted an sph simulation of offshore oscillating water column converters under waves edge et al 2014 carried out sph modeling of water waves interaction with wave energy conversion devices instead of computing the body motion by the newton euler equations directly in sph models as adopted by the above aforementioned works the motion of floating body was resolved by coupling the sph model with an external physics library open dynamics engine although both approaches for simulating body motion are effective coupling of an external physics engine makes it straightforward to examine multi physics processes such as body body interaction driven by waves within an sph model following the model coupling approach as adopted by edge et al 2014 this study presents a fully coupled numerical model to simulate the interaction of wave energy converters with water waves this physics library coupled in this work is the so called project chrono https projectchrono org and it has been successfully implemented in the sph code dualsphysics specifically brito et al 2016 presented the numerical implementation of dualsphysics chrono coupling and brito et al 2017 2018 further applied the coupled model in studying wave interaction with wave energy device including oscillating wave surge converter which is also examined in this study recently canelas et al 2018 further extended the dualsphysics chrono model to address arbitrary mechanical restrictions between fluid and rigid body interactions this paper is organized as follows section 2 explains the background of the sph model gpusph and the physics engine project chrono and the coupling procedure between two models we validate the coupled model by an analytical solution and laboratory experiment on wave packet impact on floating body in section 3 the model is then applied to explore the capability of modeling wave energy converters in section 4 we applied the coupled model to simulate wave interaction with the oscillating wave surge converter and further examine the device performance under power take off operation and its performance under storm waves in section 5 we present a conceptualized catenary mooring wave energy converter and we simulate the device in real life scale and examine its performance under realistic sea states finally the conclusion is drawn in section 6 2 numerical model this study presents a fully coupled numerical model for wave body interaction the wave dynamics are predicted by the open source smoothed particle hydrodynamics model gpusph www gpusph org and the rigid body dynamics are computed by the open source physics engine project chrono this section explains the fundamentals and also the coupling of two models 2 1 gpusph gpusph was first implemented by hérault et al 2010 and its formulation is based on the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 1 d ρ d t ρ u 2 d u d t p ρ g ν 0 2 u 1 ρ τ where t is the time ρ is the fluid density u is the particle velocity p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration ν 0 is the laminar kinematic viscosity and τ is the turbulence stress tensor which is approximated by the sub particle scale sps model see e g dalrymple and rogers 2006 the sps turbulence formulation uses a physical eddy viscosity which is determined by the instantaneous velocity gradient field specifically 3 τ i j 2 ρ ν t s i j 1 3 δ i j s k k 2 3 ρ c i δ 2 δ i j s 2 where the constant parameter c i 0 0066 δ is the initial particle spacing and δ i j is the kronecker delta the rate of strain tensor is defined by 4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the turbulent viscosity is determined by the smagorinsky turbulent model smagorinsky 1963 5 ν t c s m a g δ 2 s where c s m a g 0 12 and s 2 s i j s i j to close eqs 1 and 2 the pressure needs to be determined the fluid is assumed to be weakly compressible then the pressure can be directly computed by using the equation of state monaghan 1992 as follows 6 p β ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where ρ 0 is the initial density γ is chosen to be 7 and the parameter β is calculated by 7 β ρ 0 c s 2 γ where c s is the speed of sound the real speed of sound leads to a very small time step which is not practical for numerical simulation monaghan 1994 suggested to limit the density fluctuation 1 by setting the ratio of c s u m a x 10 the maximum velocity u m a x in this work is defined as u m a x 2 g h where h is the still water depth it has been well recognized that the weakly compressible sph wcsph method experiences high frequency pressure oscillation to address this issue we used the density diffusion method of molteni and colagrossi 2009 who introduced a proper diffusive term in the wcsph continuity equation to prevent the development of instabilities as well as the presence of high frequencies numerical noise on the pressure field in gpusph the computational domain including rigid body is discretized into a collection of particles with a fixed particle size the governing equations as presented above are discretized by using the quintic wendland 1995 kernel as used in our previous work e g wei et al 2016 the solid boundary is treated by using the dynamic boundary condition presented by dalrymple and knio 2000 this boundary condition establishes several rows of boundary particles which share the same equations of continuity and state as the fluid particles placed inside the domain however their positions and velocities remain unchanged in time successful application of the dynamic boundary condition in gpusph can be found in several works e g wei et al 2015b wei and dalrymple 2016 wei et al 2016 shi et al 2017 2 2 project chrono project chrono https projectchrono org is an open source software developed by researchers at university of wisconsin madison usa and university of parma italy the core strength of project chrono is the handling of the time evolution of systems governed by very large sets of differential algebraic equations ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations tasora et al 2016 highlighted that project chrono could be used to simulate multi physics problems including i the dynamics of large systems of connected bodies governed by differential algebraic equations ii controls and other first order dynamic systems governed by ordinary differential equations iii fluid solid interaction problems governed in part by the navier stokes equations and iv the dynamics of deformable bodies governed by partial differential equations the present study makes use of the capability of project chrono in simulating rigid body dynamics the implementation of project chrono utilizes the latest high performance computing techniques including both cpu parallelism and gpu parallelism project chrono is almost entirely written in c it is compiled into a library subsequently used by third party applications tasora et al 2016 this feature makes the coupling of project chrono with other numerical models straightforward 2 3 gpusph and project chrono coupling the motion of rigid body is computed by coupling gpusph with project chrono gpusph invokes the newton euler equations implemented in project chrono via an application programming interface api to predict rigid body dynamics driven by hydrodynamic force the coupling procedure is illustrated in fig 1 by considering the advance of one computation time step δ t from t t 0 to t 1 t 0 δ t at time t t 0 gpusph calculates the rigid body kinematics including linear and angular velocities center of gravity and rotation with respect to the problem coordinate system associated with a floating structure which is discretized into a set of sph particles x i y i z i in gpusph for a computation time step δ t gpusph first computes the motion of fluid particle by solving eqs 1 2 and 6 then gpusph calculates the fluid force and torque on the rigid body next gpusph passes the rigid body kinematics at t t 0 and external force on body exerted by fluid to project chrono at t 1 t 0 δ t the physics engine project chrono then solves the newton euler equations of motion with the rigid body kinematics and external force provided by gpusph to obtain the rigid body kinematics at t 1 t 0 δ t following that the updated rigid body kinematics is sent back to gpusph by project chrono subsequently gpusph computes the rigid body acceleration during the time step δ t by using the rigid body kinematics at t t 0 and the updated rigid body kinematics provided by project chrono gpusph further solves the equations of motion to determine the rigid body location at t 1 t 0 δ t based on the rigid body acceleration in the time step δ t and its location at t t 0 this also marks the completion of gpusph and project chrono coupling in the following sections we validate the capability of the coupled model to simulate wave body interaction and further apply the model to simulate wave energy converters it is worthy pointing out that although it is feasible to compute the motion of rigid body by directly solving the newton euler equations within an sph model see e g henry et al 2013 and crespo et al 2017 rather than a coupling approach as presented in this work the coupling of an sph model e g gpusph with the physics engine project chrono that considers a series of sophisticated physical processes allows us to explore more challenging scenarios such as wave interaction with flexible body and body body collision driven by water waves which will be explored in the future 3 model verification and validation 3 1 floating bodies in still water the model verification examines the performance of gpusph to simulate a floating body in still water this ideal setup allows us to identify possible influence of the weakly compressible assumption i e high frequency pressure oscillation on the floating body motion furthermore it also helps verify the capability of the coupled model to predict some fundamental phenomena e g the balance between the buoyancy force and the weight of the floating body the numerical experimental sketch is shown in fig 2 the dimension of the numerical wave basin is 3 m 3 m 0 6 m l w h and the still water depth is h 0 4 m the size of a floating body is 0 3 m 0 3 m 0 2 m l b w b h b and its horizontal center is initially placed at the center of the basin i e x c 1 5 m y c 1 5 m the density of the floating body is assumed to be half of the water density ρ b 0 5 ρ w the center of gravity of the floating body is placed at the still water level as indicated in fig 2 since the density of the floating body is half of the water this setup indicates that the buoyancy force and the body weight are initially balanced in terms of numerical setup the floating body is considered as a project chrono rigid body and its motion is determined by the model coupling procedure as mentioned above the computation domain was discretized by using a fixed sph particle size δ p 0 01 m resulting in 4 2 million particles the simulation was run on 1 nvidia tesla k80 gpus and it took about 2 h of computation to simulate the physical time of 10 s fig 3 presents several snapshots of the position of a floating body that has its initial center of gravity at the still water level since there is no motion of floating body in the transverse direction we only show the floating body position and the ambient velocity field in the x z plane the time t is renormalized by g h where g is the gravity acceleration and h is the still water depth the initial position of the floating body is indicated as a black dashed line rectangle and the simulated position of the floating body is indicated as a red solid line rectangle fig 3 a shows the floating body profile at t 0 1 s or t g h 0 495 the symmetric ambient velocity field indicates that there is an upward body movement however the floating body position profile the red solid line rectangle is almost the same as its initial position the black dashed line rectangle fig 3 b shows the floating body profile at t 0 5 s or t g h 2 476 the ambient velocity field shows that there is a relatively random motion of fluid particles even without any external driving force furthermore the simulated body position has a bigger discrepancy when comparing with its initial position this phenomenon is caused by the weakly compressible sph formulation used in this work as mentioned above the density diffusion method of molteni and colagrossi 2009 was implemented to address this issue and its effectiveness could be observed in fig 3 c at t 8 0 s or t g h 39 618 the first important observation is that the ambient velocity field shows that there is almost no fluid motion in the water body a state corresponding to an ideal still water setup furthermore the position of rigid body also returns to the initial body position overall this numerical experiment shows that even with the aid of density diffusion method it is important to have a short numerical model spin up time to minimize acoustic velocity motion in the water body before production runs this is consistent to the observation in our previous work wei et al 2018 for the rest of numerical experiments we generate the wave in the simulation only after one wave period of numerical model spin up time we further examine the hydrodynamic force on the floating body in fig 4 the force is renormalized by the floating body weight w m b g where m b is the floating body mass ideally the floating body is in a balanced state and there is no body motion at all however due to the weakly compressible sph formulation we have observed particle random motion indicated by the random velocity vectors in fig 3 similarly the force profile in fig 4 also shows random fluctuations around zero particularly as seen in the horizontal components forces f x and f y we can further observe minor vertical motion of the floating body in the f z profile in fig 4 before the force balanced is reached after a short period of model spin up time it should be pointed out that although there is a force fluctuation predicted by the numerical model the force magnitude is in the order of 10 3 when comparing with the floating body weight as seen in the horizontal components 3 2 floating body interaction with a wave packet this coupled model is further validated by using the laboratory experiment on a floating body impacted by a wave packet carried out in a small towing tank as reported by hadžić et al 2005 and xing kaeding 2006 fig 5 a shows the sketch of the laboratory experiment in the x z plane the wave flume had a water depth h 0 4 m the floating body was a rectangular prism 0 1 m wide 0 05 m high and 0 29 m long and its material density relative to water is about 0 68 the floating body was located at x 2 11 m away from the flap type wavemaker the time series rotation profile of the wavemaker is showed in fig 5 b and the generated wave packet had a focusing point at the location of the floating body the wave height at focusing point is equal to the floating body height resulting in a nonlinear interaction between the wave packet and the floating body the laboratory measurements included the time series free surface profile at two wave gauges and the time series sway and heave motions of the floating body under wave packet the laboratory experiment has been previously used to validate several sph works on waves and floating body interaction e g bouscasse et al 2013 barreiro et al 2016 in terms of numerical setup in gpusph a 3d computation domain was considered specifically the floating body dimension 0 1 m 0 05 m 0 29 m was fully reproduced in the numerical model to avoid boundary effect from the side wall a flume width of 0 5 m was used in the numerical simulation and the floating body was placed in the middle of the flume along the transverse direction similar to the treatment of floating body in our previous section the body was considered as a project chrono rigid body in the numerical simulation to evaluate the influence of particle resolution on the nonlinear wave generation and the induced floating body motion the computation domain was discretized by using three particle resolutions δ p 0 0125 m 0 01 m and 0 000833 m resulting in 1 1 1 5 and 2 2 million particles respectively the simulation was run on one nvidia tesla k80 gpu and it took about 4 7 h of computation to simulate the physical time of 10 s for three numerical setups fig 6 compares the predicted free surface profiles by gpusph with the laboratory measurement the first wave gauge at x 1 16 m is in front of the floating body and the other wave gauge at x 2 66 m is behind the floating body overall the comparison of sph predictions with three particle sizes at both wave gauges agree well with the laboratory experiment confirming the correct generation and propagation of the nonlinear wave packet by the sph model fig 7 further compares the predicted time series floating body motion driven by the wave packet the coupled model satisfactorily captures the heave motion of the floating body with all three particle sizes the predicted sway profile matches well with the laboratory experiment before the pass of the wave packet it is seen that a finer particle size improves the sph prediction of the sway profile after the pass of the wave but there is still an under prediction when comparing with the laboratory measurement and this discrepancy might be due to the minor loss damping of wave as observed in the free surface profile at x 2 66 m the second panel of fig 6 nevertheless the agreement of floating body motion in this study is comparable to model data comparisons made by barreiro et al 2016 with a similar sph modeling approach in short the model verification and validation presented above showed that the coupled model is suitable for modeling wave interaction with floating body the following sections apply the coupled model to simulate wave interaction with wave energy conversion devices under complex mechanical constraints and nonlinear sea states 4 modeling of oscillating wave surge converter following the model validation presented above the section applies the coupled model to simulate the bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converter which absorbs energy contained in the horizontal motion of water within ocean waves whittaker and folley 2012 the concept of oscillating wave surge converter has been commercialized into the surface piercing oyster device by aquamarine power ltd www aquamarinepower com and the submerged waveroller device by aw energy http aw energy com the present work considers an oyster type oscillating wave surge converter based on the experiment of wei et al 2015a it is noted that the simulation of oscillating wave surge converter has been reported in literature e g brito et al 2016 2017 huang et al 2018 however this present study not only carries out model validation comparison as presented in existing studies it further examines the performance of the device under power production mode and its survivability mode under storm waves 4 1 the oscillating wave surge converter experiment of wei et al 2015a the sketch of the laboratory experiment of wei et al 2015a is shown in fig 8 the wave basin is about 18 m long and 4 6 m wide the flume bottom is a compound slope and the offshore still water depth is h 0 692 m the laboratory work used a 1 25 scale model to represent a simplified oscillating wave surge converter and the device is placed approximately 7 92 m from the wavemaker the device is a 1 04 m 0 48 m 0 12 m box with a hinge height of 0 16 m above the flume bottom fig 8 a the device is placed in the position along the wave basin at y 0 m fig 8 b in terms of numerical setup the flap device and its bottom foundation are represented as project chrono rigid bodies in the simulation the bottom foundation is fixed the flap device is free to move but it is connected with the bottom foundation through a revolute joint defined by the project chrono library it is further possible to apply kinematic constraints to the joint so that the motion of the device can be damped reduced as shown later regular waves with a wave height of h 0 12 m and wave period of t 2 0 s are generated at the left side of the wave flume by a wavemaker at the other end of the flume the waves are absorbed by a numerical sponge layer technique developed by carmigniani and violeau 2018 and the length of the sponge layer is about one wave length the full wave basin is discretized by a constant sph particle size δ p 0 02 m resulting in 7 million particles the simulation was run on 4 nvidia tesla k80 gpus and it took about 2 h of computation to simulate one numerical wave period t 2 s 4 2 wave device interaction and wave gauge comparison fig 9 presents three snapshots showing the interaction between the oscillating wave surge converter with waves predicted by gpusph fig 9 a shows that the device reaches the maximal rotation in the offshore direction when the wave arrives at its offshore side fig 9 b shows that the wave crest arrives at the device and the device is in a nearly vertical position finally fig 9 c shows that the wave passes by the device and the device reaches the maximal rotation in the nearshore direction the comparison of gpusph prediction of time series free surface profiles at three selected wave gauges with the laboratory measurement is shown in fig 10 the first wave gauge is located at x 7 02 m which is in the seaward side of the oscillating wave surge converter and the other two are located at x 8 82 and 12 2 m which measure the free surface profile after the wave passes by the device we compare 15 waves from t 10 40 s since the start of the experiment the comparison at x 7 02 m shows that there is an excellent agreement between gpusph prediction and the laboratory measurement it should be noted that a minor wave peak in the wave troughs occurs since the wave gauge is located about 0 9 m from the device and there is wave reflection from the device as measured at x 7 02 m we can see that this phenomenon is accurately predicted by gpusph the second wave gauge at x 8 82 m is located at the toe of the second slope starting at x 8 52 m thus this wave gauge also measures the wave reflection from the slope the numerical model gpusph again accurately predicts the wave profile as measured in the laboratory the last wave gauge at x 12 2 m measures the wave propagation over the flat area at the end of the wave flume gpusph also satisfactorily predicts the wave profiles as pointed out earlier a numerical sponge layer is applied at the end of the wave flume the good agreement of free surface profile at x 12 2 m confirmed the effectiveness of the sponge layer method of carmigniani and violeau 2018 4 3 the hydrodynamic force and device motion the computed hydrodynamic force on the oscillating wave surge converter and its rotation profile from t 10 40 s are presented in fig 11 due to the fact that the incident wave is periodic with a wave period t 2 s fig 11 a shows that the hydrodynamic force exerted on the device is also periodic with the same oscillation period the comparison of gpusph prediction of oscillating wave surge converter rotation under regular waves with the laboratory measurement is shown in fig 11 b thanks to the excellent wave prediction as shown in fig 10 we obtain very good prediction of the device rotation profile 4 4 numerical experiment on the power take off operation so far we have validated that the coupled gpusph chrono model is effective in simulating oscillating wave surge converter based on our model validation we further carry out numerical experiments to examine the performance of the wave energy converter in two aspects the first one is the introduction of kinematic constraints to mimic the device power take off operation the second numerical experiment is to evaluate the device performance i e survivability under extreme waves the project chrono library provides the capability to introduce different kinematic constraints for rigid body dynamics modeling the kinematic constraint used in the present study considers the damping of the angular velocity of the device and it mimics the mechanical damping similar to the power take off operation the mathematical formulation that describes this process can be defined by 8 i d ω d t τ k d ω where i indicates the moment of inertia ω is the angular velocity τ is the external torque exerted on the device and k d is a damping coefficient which indicates the extent of kinematic constraints on the device fig 12 shows the numerical experiment result based on the validated setup i e wave height h 0 12 m and wave period t 2 0 s which does not involve any mechanical damping labeled as k d 0 in the plot we can see that as we increase the damping coefficient k d the rotation of the device is further reduced it is worthy pointing out that the device rotation reduction does not fit a linear relationship i e the rotation reduction ratio from k d 0 to k d 10 is not equal to the rotation reduction ratio from k d 10 to k d 25 thus the power take off operation on the device is a nonlinear process 4 5 the device performance under extreme wave conditions to evaluate the performance of the oscillating wave surge converter under extreme waves we further carry out numerical experiments to examine the device under storm condition the non storm condition refers to the validated numerical experiment setup and its results were shown in figs 9 11 the storm condition in our numerical setup is determined in two steps 1 we increase the mean water level i e the wave setup due to storm surge by 1 m in the prototype scale in the simulation note that the laboratory scale is 1 25 and 2 we increase the wave height by 60 by considering a stronger wave field under storms fig 13 shows the comparison of the rotation profile of the oscillating wave surge converter under storm condition with non storm condition the non storm profile is the same one as the gpusph prediction presented in fig 11 b we can see that the rotation under storms has the same phase profile as the non storm condition however there is about 32 increase of rotation amplitude from 31 o to 41 o we further note that there is an overtopping over the device under storms as shown in fig 14 fig 14 a shows the instantaneous wave profile and the position of oscillating wave surge converter under the original laboratory setup i e the non storm condition fig 14 b shows the corresponding profile but under storm waves it is seen that the wave is larger resulting in wave overtopping over the wave energy conversion device 5 modeling of large scale wave energy converter under sea states in the previous sections we have validated the model capability for predicting wave force on structures and we further assessed its efficiency in modeling oscillating wave surge converter this section focuses on model application and assesses its capability for modeling real life scale wave energy conversion device developed at coastal studies institute csi in north carolina usa 5 1 csi device a conceptualized wave energy converter the wave energy converter considered in this section is the so called csi device a conceptualized wave energy conversion device the sketch of the csi device is shown in fig 15 fig 15 a shows the zoom in view of the csi device which is made of a floating platform length width height 6 m 6 m 1 m two towers height diameter 7 65 m 1 m a cross bar length diameter 4 m 1 m connecting two towers and a free motion pendulum diameter 1 5 m connecting with the cross bar the density of the platform towers and cross bar is 0 1 ρ w and the material density of the pendulum is 2 ρ w the distance between the center of the pendulum and the cross bar is adjustable and it is 4 5 m for the present setup resulting in a natural frequency of the pendulum t p 4 9 s the four corners of the device are restricted by four mooring lines anchored at the sea bed the horizontal center of csi device is located at x c y c 26 0 m fig 15 b shows the zoom out view of the csi device in particular the mooring line anchoring points at the 25 m deep sea bed at 32 55 25 m 32 55 25 m 78 55 25 m and 78 55 25 m the principle to extract ocean wave energy by csi device is to utilize the forward and backward swing of the pendulum driven by the motion of a floating platform on the water surface we expect that there is a higher potential to extract wave energy if the swing of the pendulum is larger stronger it should be emphasized that since no physical experiments for such a device were available we simulated the conceptualized prototype size of the device compared with the work presented in the previous section there is an additional challenge for this work is that the device motion is restricted by four mooring lines the numerical mooring line setup follows the catenary mooring line method of garza rios et al 1997 the mooring line has one end anchored on the sea bed and the other end connected the floating platform e g csi device in the present work a catenary curved is formed due to its own weight of the mooring line on the other hand the floating device is subject to the tension pulling force from the mooring line garza rios et al 1997 developed analytical expressions to compute the horizontal tension exerted on the floating device their analytical solutions were implemented as a callback function in gpusph to compute the mooring line tension on the csi device in this work in terms of numerical setup the csi device is represented as a set of rigid bodies whose motions are determined by the project chrono library by using the hydrodynamic force simulated by the gpusph model and the mooring force exerted by mooring lines the local water depth is 25 m and we consider a wave train with the incident wave period equal to the natural frequency of the pendulum t n 4 9 s according to the linear dispersion relationship the generated waves are deep water waves the computation domain in the cross shore direction is about three times of the wave length l 37 m and the domain with one wave length nearshore represents the wave absorbing sponge layer by using the sponge layer formulation by carmigniani and violeau 2018 regarding the computation domain in the vertical direction we only simulate the 5 m depth below the mean water level by considering the fact that the propagation of deep water trains is not subject to bottom damping therefore it is not necessary to numerically simulate the full 25 m deep water this strategy allows us to reduce the computation cost significantly 5 2 csi device interaction with regular waves we first investigated the interaction between csi device and regular waves the wave height seaward of the device is about h 1 m and the incident wave period is t 4 9 s which is the same as the natural frequency of a fixed pendulum based on the specific setup in this work the simulated alongshore width of the domain is about 14 m with the device placed at the alongshore center by using a constant sph particle size δ p 0 1 m we obtain 8 2 million particles for the full basin the simulation was run on 4 nvidia tesla k80 gpus and it took about 3 h of computation to simulate one numerical wave period t 4 9 s the interaction of csi device with regular waves is illustrated by three snapshots as presented in fig 16 after about 14 waves have been simulated fig 16 a indicates that the instant when the incoming wave arrives at the seaward side of the device and the pendulum reaches the maximal swing position in the offshore direction fig 16 b shows that the device is riding over the wave crest and both the pendulum and the tower are in the vertical position finally fig 16 c shows the instant when the wave passed by the device and the pendulum reaches the maximal swing position in the nearshore direction fig 17 presents the time series mooring force exerted on the floating platform by the four mooring lines the coordinate e g 32 55 25 indicates the anchoring point of the cable on the sea bed due to the symmetric location of four cables and the considered incident regular wave condition we can see that 1 the mooring force component f x would be the same if two cables anchored at the same x position 2 the mooring force component f y would be the same if two cables anchored at the same y position and 3 the mooring force component f z would be the same if two cables anchored at the same x position however the magnitude of the mooring force f z by the two cables offshore is larger than the mooring force f z exerted by the two cables nearshore next we examine the time series device rotation profile driven by incident regular waves as shown in fig 18 the top panel of fig 18 shows the rotation profile of the pendulum about the vertical axis and the bottom panel of fig 18 shows the rotation profile of the tower we have two important observations one is that the rotation of the pendulum is out of phase with that of the tower in other words when the pendulum reaches the maximal positive rotation amplitude the tower reaches the maximal negative rotation amplitude the other is that the rotation amplitude of the pendulum 65 o is much larger than the rotation amplitude of the tower 13 o we further examined the influence of incident wave period on the pendulum motion as pointed out earlier that the natural frequency of the pendulum used in this work is about t p 4 9 s equal to the incident wave period and we would like to examine two incident wave periods different from the natural frequency specifically we consider three wave periods t 3 9 4 9 and 5 9 s and we obtain their corresponding swing profiles or rotation amplitudes of the csi device as shown in fig 19 it is seen that if the incident wave period is equal to the natural frequency of the device i e 4 9 s we can see that due to resonance the rotation amplitude is about twice of the other two cases with incident wave periods t 3 9 and 5 9 s this observation has an important engineering implication in terms of deploying the csi device in sea waves that is if we know the local wave period of deploying site we should design the pendulum of csi device to have a similar natural frequency to maximize the swing motion 5 3 csi device interaction with directional spectral waves finally we extend the above work to consider the interaction of csi device with directional spectral waves the generation of spectral waves by gpusph was first made by wei et al 2017 the basic idea is to combine a 1d wave energy spectrum with a directional spread function and the interested readers are referred to the appendix of wei et al 2017 for details the present study utilizes the pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 and a cosine squared directional spreading distribution to generate directional sea waves to build a realistic directional spectral wave basin the alongshore width of the basin was extended from 14 m used in the regular wave case to 50 m resulting in 26 5 million sph particles this study presents two cases with the same significant wave period t s 4 9 s but different significant wave heights h s 0 8 m and 2 0 m due to significantly increased computation burden and the limitation of computation resources only a few wave periods were simulated fig 20 presents the numerical prediction of the interaction of csi device with directional spectral sea waves at three time instants the left panel of fig 20 shows the device interaction with waves with a relatively small significant wave height h s 0 8 m generally speaking the device motion is relatively weak the right panel of fig 20 shows the device interaction with waves with a relatively large significant wave height h s 2 0 m which could be storm waves in nature we observed a much stronger device motion under h s 2 0 m by comparing with that under h s 0 8 m we can further examine the mooring force and the device rotation profile under spectral waves predicted by the numerical model as shown in fig 21 we have observed in fig 17 that the mooring force component f z under regular waves would be the same if two cables anchored at the same x position however fig 21 a shows the vertical component of mooring force f z on the csi device under directional spectral waves is very irregular over time furthermore due to the directional spreading of the waves the mooring force component f z exerted by two cables anchored at the same x position is no longer necessary the same as observed under regular waves fig 21 b and c show the time series profile of pendulum rotation and the tower rotation respectively the pendulum rotation is still much larger than the tower rotation indicating that the significant potential of csi device to harvest the ocean wave energy through the pendulum motion furthermore the rotation of the tower is generally out of phase with that of the pendulum consistent with the phenomenon observed under regular waves as shown in fig 18 6 conclusions we have presented a novel numerical approach to simulate wave energy conversion devices under realistic sea states our study utilizes the gpu accelerated mesh free sph model gpusph to simulate sea waves and further takes advantage of the physics engine project chrono to consider rigid body dynamics the computation of wave body interaction was fully coupled by establishing a two way communication between gpusph and chrono the conclusions and major contributions of this study are summarized as follows the coupled model was first validated with analytical solution to examine its capability to simulate a floating body in still water the results showed that gpusph correctly predicts the motion of floating body thus verified the success of the model coupling procedure the validation test further confirmed the effectiveness of density diffusion method in reducing acoustic noise in a weakly compressible sph model furthermore the coupled model was validated by laboratory experiment on floating body interaction with nonlinear wave packet next we conducted a thorough study of gpusph modeling of oyster type oscillating wave surge converter under waves we showed that gpusph accurately predicts both wave gauge measurements and the device rotation as recorded in the laboratory we also carried out numerical experiments to examine the power take off scenario of the oscillating wave surge converter by introducing kinematic constraint into the system through the project chrono library furthermore we examined the device performance under storm condition lastly we presented and simulated a conceptualized catenary mooring wave energy converter device csi device under sea states we examined the interaction of csi device with regular waves and we obtained the mooring forcing that can facilitate the design of wave energy converters we showed that to maximize the energy extraction it is important to design the device to have a natural frequency similar to the wave period of deploying site to maximize the swing motion of the pendulum finally we developed a directional spectral wave basin and examined the interaction of csi device under different sea states with both relatively small and large wave heights overall

22773,with complex terrains and varied physical environments near bridge sites it is challenging to include uncertainties for dynamic analyses of sea crossing bridges in this paper an efficient frequency domain method for the dynamic analysis of a freestanding bridge pylon is proposed with a copula model to consider the correlation between wind and waves firstly the data of wind and waves are obtained by field measurements a best copula model is chosen to simulate the joint probability distribution after calculating the fluctuating wind field and the random wave filed the wind and the wave loadings are obtained to reduce the calculation cost for dynamic analyses the harmonic response analysis is introduced to solve the structural response spectrum by integrating the transfer function between the environmental load and the structural response a sea crossing railway bridge pylon located in the sea crossing region is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method finally the influence of seasons load directions and water depths on the displacement response of the top pylon is further discussed the response spectrum analysis illustrates the influence mechanism of the correlated wind and wave on bridge pylon keywords freestanding bridge pylon frequency domain dynamic analysis correlated wind and wave 1 introduction with the continuous development of construction technology a great number of long span bridges have been constructed in order to cross islands and straits chen et al 2011 qin and gao 2017 the bridge pylon which supports huge cables and transfers tremendous loads to the ground is crucially important in particular it focuses at the free standing construction that is the stand alone condition when the girder is not present and the pylon is independent the wind excitation is generally assumed to be more significant than the wave excitation for taller pylons with shallower water foundations however as the water depth of bridge site becomes deeper and the pile foundation becomes longer for sea crossing bridges the wave excitation has also been increasingly emphasized by researchers due to the huge wave load zhu et al 2018a fang et al 2018 this implies that it is necessary to study the impact of wind and waves on bridge pylons of sea crossing bridges many existing literature have studied the wind induced vibration of bridge pylon through field observations wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations in both time domain e g belloli et al 2011 casciati and giuliano 2009 fujino 2002 siringoringo and fujino 2012 and frequency domain e g davenport 1962 xu et al 2000 it was found that dynamic characteristics of slender structures are sensitive to wind loads and the aerodynamic response of bridge pylon at the construction stage is more pronounced when compared with the completed bridge stage due to the lack of girder and cable constraints these studies provided valuable information for researching aerodynamics structure interaction effects as to hydrodynamic effects on bridges in deep water some literature analyzed the effects of waves on bridge foundations or pylon in time domain liu et al 2007 wei et al 2013 2017 sea crossing bridges are always simultaneously subjected to wind and wave loadings during the service period most of researchers studied the dynamic response of bridge pylon under winds alone or waves alone only few works guo et al 2016 zhu and zhang 2017 were carried out under wind and waves together zhu and zhang 2017 developed a bridge wind wave system to simulate the wind and the wave fields for bridge pylons and contributed an approach to further analyze the dynamic performance for coastal slender bridges guo et al 2016 presented dynamic response experiments of a freestanding bridge pylon under coupled wind and waves in which the coupled effects on the pylon could be clearly observed although some studies considered an ideal wind wave relationship the accurately correlations between wind and waves are still not clear around sea crossing bridges in recent decades the copula model has been widely used for modeling the correlation among random variables in coastal and ocean engineering e g salvadori and de michele 2007 yang and zhang 2013 the diverse copula models such as gumbel gaussian frank and clayton copulas could better fit the joint probability distribution of wind and wave parameters although there are some traditional numerical wave prediction models such as waw swan and wavewatch models the low resolutions are unable to meet the needs of sea crossing bridges rusu et al 2018 meanwhile the construction period for sea crossing bridges is longer than that for land bridges generally such as hongkong zhuhai macau bridge and zhoushan cross sea bridge which took more than 8 years and 10 years respectively therefore the free standing bridge pylon is more likely to be affected by extreme wind and waves which serious impact construction machinery and workers in normal construction for this reason this paper proposes a prediction approach for the wind and wave joint return period within 15 years in the basis of copula method providing a valuable reference for sea crossing bridges under construction there are two main differences between the bridge pylon and other offshore structures on the one hand the pylon height above the sea level usually exceeds 100 m which is much higher than many offshore structures like jackets wind turbines and floating foundations due to the severe fluctuations of wind speed at higher positions it is inappropriate to approximate the wind speed to its mean value only the actual wind velocity field is composed of the mean wind component static wind plus the time varying wind component fluctuating wind the offshore structures are typically designed with static wind field hansen et al 2006 wei et al 2014 however taller bridge towers are more susceptible to fluctuating winds with higher frequencies which have potential effects on the dynamic wind excitation in extreme conditions on the other hand the foundation of the bridge pylon is supported by the pile group which generally consists of 30 50 piles each pile is filled with concrete surrounded by a steel casing the densely arranged piles are drilled deep into seabed rocks so the pile group foundation of bridge pylon has larger stiffness than the foundations of jackets and tension leg platforms therefore it is necessary to study the influence mechanism of correlated wind and waves on bridge pylons most studies mainly focused on time domain calculation of bridge pylon which is still time consuming especially when several bridge pylons need to be compared or when the support foundations need to be optimized for different locations in this study in order to more accurately simulate the relationship between wind and waves near a bridge site and clarify the response and the mechanism of the free standing tower under the combined action of wind and waves the measured data are obtained in the bridge region the seasons are considered by dividing measurements into a monsoon period and a typhoon period the copula models are used to fit the wind wave joint probability distribution then a frequency domain approach for the dynamic analysis of the bridge pylon of the sea crossing bridge is proposed the dynamic analysis is divided into two parts which includes the pylon body in the wind field and the pile foundation in the wave field the wind field is simulated as random stationary wind of which the fluctuating component is generated by the lumley panpfsky spectrum due to the shelter effect and the interference effect among piles the estimation of pile group loads is extremely complicated compared with that on a single isolated pile the wave field is simulated as random wave based on the pierson moskowitz spectrum considering the pile group effect the total response is obtained by linearly summing the ordinates per frequency of the wind wave induced response a freestanding bridge pylon of a sea crossing bridge is utilized as an example to verify the validity of the frequency domain method and the influences of seasons load directions and water depths are further analyzed a brief summary and concluding remarks are provided at the end of paper 2 model definition and analysis procedure 2 1 model definition the present pylon model for the dynamic analysis involves the pylon tower subjected to wind load and the pile foundation subjected to wave load the load patterns of the bridge pylon under wind and wave loads are shown in fig 1 to simplify the model the following assumptions are made to develop a frequency domain method for freestanding bridge pylons of sea crossing bridges 1 the wind and wave are modeled as individually unidirectional the wind and wave acting in one direction and codirectional the direction of the wind and wave is the same 2 the responses due to the wind and the wave response are assumed to be fully independent 3 the bridge pylon is discretized into small elements by the finite element method its mass distribution is idealized by replacing with discrete masses located at the centroids of finite elements all forces including weight wave forces on the submerged parts and wind forces on the parts above sea level are assumed to act at these centroids 2 2 analysis framework of bridge pylon once the structure and the environmental loadings have been defined the procedures illustrated in fig 2 are performed as follows 1 with available field measured data of wind and waves several different copula models are compared to choose the most suitable model based on akaike information criterion aic 2 determine the most likely wind and wave metocean conditions to different return periods for typhoon and monsoon periods based on copula models e g the significant wave height h s the mean wind speed u and the mean zero up crossing wave periods t p 3 generate the random wind field by a spectral representation model and the wave field by a linear superposition method and calculate the wind and the wave loads 4 establish the finite element model of bridge pylon the transfer function between the pylon displacement and the environmental load are determined at a specific location based on the harmonic response analysis the combined dynamic response spectrum of the bridge pylon is calculated by multiplying the transfer function with the wind load spectrum and the wave load spectrum respectively 5 repeat step 1 4 calculate the response spectra in different combinations of the wind and wave and compare the response spectra between the frequency domain method proposed in this paper and the traditional time domain method 6 after verifying correctness and validity of the proposed model the influence of seasons load directions and water depths is further discussed in frequency domain 3 joint probability model of wind and waves for the dynamic analysis of freestanding bridge pylon in frequency domain the joint probability distribution function pdf of the wind velocity and the wave height should be determined first 3 1 field measurement the wind and the wave are mutually influenced at the bridge site with complex topography the relationship between the wind and wave defined by the code with deterministic methods cannot accurately describe the environmental characteristics of the bridge site therefore field measurements were carried out in the bridge site area the location of the monitoring point is shown in fig 3 the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge and a two dimensional ultrasonic anemometer are installed on a platform the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge is adopted to measure the wave height and the two dimensional ultrasonic anemometer is applied to monitor the wind speed simultaneously the sampling frequencies of the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge and the ultrasonic anemometer are 2 hz and 1 hz respectively the monitoring equipment for wave and winds fixed in a stable environment are 13 m and 20 25 m away from the mean sea level msl respectively the data of wave heights are continuously collected for about 17 min per hour and the data of wind speeds are continuously collected for 24 h the significant wave height and the mean wind speed per day are used in the joint probability model because the target bridge is still in the construction period the data of wind and waves in only 3 years from 2015 to 2017 were recorded as the resource used in the example actually many sea crossing bridge projects have only a small amount of measured data available although the measured data with 3 years may be not enough to predict accurately the meteorological characteristics in the service life of bridges with 100 years but it is reasonable to predict the wind and wave parameters during the construction period which generally does not exceed 15 years 3 2 copula based joint probability model as an effective model in probability theory the copula model is used to simulate the correlation between the wind and wave based on the field measured data in the example site the copula allows the marginal univariate distribution to follow different forms to find the optimal selection with available wind and wave data in the bridge site various models allow the copula to better fit the joint probability distribution of parameters of wind and waves such as the significant wave height h s the mean wind speed v w the copula approach for dependence modeling is formalized based on the sklar representation theorem for the bivariate case the joint cumulative distribution function h x y of any pair x y of continuous random variables may be written in the form 1 h x y c f x f y θ where f x f y are the marginal distributions c 0 1 2 0 1 denotes the connection relationship between the marginal distributions thought 2d copula θ is the dependence parameter which is estimated through the maximum likelihood method before applying the copula approach for the measured data of h s and v w the marginal distributions need to be determined as indicated in eq 2 existing research demonstrates that the gumbel logistic model is applicable to the field of ocean engineering yang and zhang 2013 with the gumbel distribution as the marginal distribution the distribution function can be expressed as 2 f x exp exp x a b where a and b are the positional parameter and the scale parameter of the gumbel distribution in order to test the marginal distribution the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test is adopted in the distribution fitting test if the test statistic d n is less than the critical value d 0 05 with 5 significance level the marginal distribution follows the gumbel distribution with the parameters of a and b on the contrary it rejects the gumbel distribution the marginal distributions are examined by least squares method and the parameters are summarized in table 1 according to k s test the d n is less than d 0 05 in all cases which proves that the marginal distribution follows the gumbel distribution after obtaining the marginal distribution for each random variable an appropriate bivariate copula function can be adopted to correlate two random variables the copula function is selected to many forms of models such as gumbel gaussian frank and clayton which is not restricted to a certain type of distributions to find the best copula model the root mean square error rmse and aic are utilized to evaluate the goodness of the fit for four different copulas the lowest value suggests a better model 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p c i p o i 2 4 a i c 2 l θ 2 p where n is the number of samples p c is the theory frequency value of copula joint distribution p o is the empirical frequency values of joint distribution l θ is the maximum log likelihood value of the copula model p is the number of parameters used in the copula model the copula model is examined by the maximum likelihood method the dependent parameter and evaluation index with the rmse and aic values for the proposed copulas are summarized in table 2 both the rmse and aic values show that the clayton copula model is the best fit to the mean wind speed and the significant wave height the contour plots of joint probability density for the proposed copulas are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 for monsoon period and typhoon period respectively as is apparently demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 when the wind speed is small the distribution of wave height is concentrated as the wind speed increases the distribution of wave height is more dispersed compared with the other three models the clayton copula model can better reflect these distribution characteristics the fitting copula is in good agreement with the measured points which indicates the strong correlation between the wind and wave for the monsoon period the wind speed distribution range is 0 16 4 m s and the wave height distribution range is 0 4 2 m for the typhoon period the wind speed distribution range is 0 19 4 m s and the wave height distribution range is 0 5 1 m the typhoon period is prone to higher waves at the same wind speed in addition it is easier to generate huge waves under strong winds so it is necessary to consider the coupled wind and wave loads 3 3 joint return period once the marginal distribution of wind speed or wave height is determined the corresponding return period for the variables x or y exceeding certain values is given by 5 t x 1 1 f x r where r is the annual arrival rate of the variable x after the joint probability model of wind speed and wave height is obtained the joint return period t x y of any of x or y or both exceeding the corresponding values x and y x x y y or x x and y y can be expressed as 6 t x y 1 1 h x y r some studies show that there are significant seasonal differences in wind wave field boeck et al 2010 willems 2000 it is helpful for engineers to understand the impact mechanism and the conduct construction planning by studying differences of wind and wave fields in different seasons according to the historical meteorological characteristics of the bridge site the monsoon period is from january to may and the typhoon period is from august to october the values of the wind speed and the wave height at a given return period are predicted based on typhoon period and monsoon period data respectively these excluded months are considered unrelated to investigate the characteristics during the typhoon and the monsoon periods respectively therefore the joint return period is divided into the typhoon period t t and the monsoon period t m several combinations of the wind speed and the wave height will occur during the same return period the most possible combination can be obtained for a joint return period t t or t m when the joint probability density of this combination reaches the maximum according to the measured data with limited time the return periods are set to be 5 10 and 15 years the corresponding most possible values of the significant wave height h s the mean wind speed u and the mean zero up crossing wave periods t p are listed in table 3 as to the correlation between h s and t p the expression proposed by valamanesh et al 2015 is adopted as follow 7 t p 11 7 h s g there are 6 different combinations of return periods including m5 m10 m15 t5 t10 and t15 it is obvious that the environmental parameters in the typhoon season are significantly higher than those in the monsoon period the mean wind speeds during the typhoon are increased by 39 37 and 35 when compared with the monsoon period in return periods of 5 10 and 15 years respectively the significant wave heights during the typhoon are increased by 73 65 and 67 when compared with the monsoon period in return periods of 5 10 and 15 years respectively therefore we need to pay attention to the effect of this huge difference on the structure 4 frequency domain dynamic analyses 4 1 random wind load because the height of pylon increases with the increase in bridge span especially for these sea crossing bridges the flexible bridge pylon is vulnerable to wind forces guo et al 2016 the wind loads acting on the bridge pylon consist of static wind forces self excited forces and buffeting forces the self excited force is the interaction force between the wind and the bridge motion which can be expressed as a relationship between the arbitrary bridge deck motion and the associated impulse functions the buffeting forces are caused by fluctuating winds which can be expressed as a relationship between the fluctuating winds and the associated aerodynamic response coefficients due to the larger stiffness and smaller width relative to the bridge deck the self excited force on the concrete pylon is generally ignored zhu and zhang 2017 therefore the total wind forces f wind on bridge pylon are given by 8 f wind t 0 l e f h t d x 0 l e f v t d x 0 l e f m t d x where the subscripts h v m are the drag force lift force and moment respectively l e is the length of pylon body the load diagram is shown in fig 6 a and the total wind forces on unit length bridge pylon li et al 2005 are obtained as 9 f h t f st h f bu h t 1 2 ρ u 2 c d h 1 2 ρ u 2 b 2 h b c d v t u γ 1 10 f v t f st v f bu v t 1 2 ρ u 2 c l b 1 2 ρ u 2 b 2 c l v t

force ρ is the air density u is the mean wind velocity which is given by u u 10 ln z z 0 ln 10 z 0 u 10 is mean wind speed at 10 m height above msl z 0 is the sea surface roughness which is approximately 0 005 m for a rough sea surface h and b are the height and the width of the bridge pylon v t w t denote the two dimensional fluctuating wind velocities in x axis direction and y axis direction at time t γ i i 1 2 3 4 5 is the aerodynamic admittance function in time domain which is taken as 1 0 due to its blunt body section c d c l c m are the drag coefficient lift coefficient and moment coefficient respectively which are usually obtained by wind tunnel tests or numerical simulations in present work the two dimensional numerical wind tunnel technology is used to calculate the three component coefficient shown in fig 6 b although this method does not consider aerodynamic interference in three dimensional space this approach is still practical and economical in comparison with the wind tunnel test the aerodynamic parameters of the bridge pylon are detailed in table 4 the element size progressively increases from the sides of tower columns to the computational boundary the k ω sst turbulence model is used and the time step is set equal to 10 4 s a second order scheme is selected for pressure and a second order upwind scheme is selected for momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate the discretized problem has been numerically solved by adopting a simple pressure velocity coupling algorithm the unsteady flow is simulated by cfd software fluent the bridge pylon consists of a front tower and a behind tower each tower column is assumed to be constant with a cross sectional size of 6m 10 4 m the distance between the two tower columns is 38 m as v t and w t are random processes the lumley panpfsky spectrum is taken as the target wind spectra for the bridge pylon li et al 2004 then multipoint wind fields can be generated as a uniformly modulated process the cross spectral density matrix of the vector process v t v z 1 t v z 2 t v z n t t is given by 12 s 0 w s 11 0 w s 12 0 w s 1 n 0 w s 21 0 w s 22 0 w s 2 n 0 w s n 1 0 w s n 2 0 w s n n 0 w the cross spectrum s j m 0 w can be expressed as follows 13 s j m 0 w s j j 0 w s m m 0 w c o h j m w where s j j 0 w s m m 0 w are the real matrices c o h j m w is the coherence function suggested by davenport and the form between point j and point m can be rewritten as follows 14 c o h w exp w 2 π λ z j z m u j u m 2 where w is the frequency λ is the dimensionless decay factor ranging from 7 to 10 then the stochastic wind fields of the bridge pylon at n height can be solved by the numerous approach of spectral representation model srm in present work a practical method based on srm presented by li et al 2004 is adopted which is more suitable for engineering 4 2 random wave load the morison equation has been widely used for prediction of the wave loads on slender offshore structures chen et al 2016 wei et al 2017 when the ratio of structure diameter d to length l is smaller than 0 2 random waves can be considered as the superposition of multiple cosine waves with individual periods and random initial phases random wave loads can also be regarded as a superposition of regular wave loads therefore the total wave forces f wave on the pile group of the bridge pylon are given by 15 f wave t p d t p i t 16 p d t j 1 n j k 1 n k l 1 n l i 1 m φ d u j k i z l t u j k i z l t k g j k δ z 17 p i t j 1 n j k 1 n k l 1 n l i 1 m φ m u j k i z l t k g j k δ z where p d p i are the drag and inertia force induced by wave n j n k are the rows and columns of pile group foundations as shown in fig 7 a b are the row width and the column width n l is the number of intervals in the length of the pile that is to calculate the total wave force of a single pile m is the number of intervals in frequency which is to simulate random waves based on the linear superposition method δ z d η n l d is the water depth η is the wave surface elevation k g j k is the pile group coefficient at the j kth pile u i j u i j are the water particle velocity and acceleration normal to the displaced j kth pile which is solved by the pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 φ d 0 5 ρ w c d d ρ w is the water density φ d 0 25 ρ w c m a a is the cross sectional area c d c m are the drag coefficient and inertia coefficient for pile foundation that are set to be 1 2 and 2 0 according to chinese standard of hydrology for harbour and waterway jts 145 2015 2015 some existing studies indicate that the pile group effect needs to be considered for a large pile group bonakdar et al 2015 zhu et al 2018b the interaction among piles depends mainly on the kc number the wave direction and the relative spacing a d to simplify the modeling procedure of wave loading the pile group coefficient is proposed by bonakdar et al 2015 which only depends on the relative spacing a d the expression is given by 18 k g 1 265 0 225 ln a d 1 0 middlepile sidepile where k g is the pile group coefficient considering only the interference effect because the shelter effect will reduce the wave force on the pile hence it is a conservative method to ignore the shelter effect 4 3 frequency domain transform method for the calculation of structural random vibration response a long time calculation is performed following the step by step integration method which takes approximately 1 3 h for offshore structures therefore the time domain simulation costs a great deal of time especially when the structure requires optimization or comparison in different sea states for other coastal constructions including offshore wind turbines and floating foundations many efforts have been made to develop the frequency domain analysis method van der et al 2005 developed a frequency domain approach for offshore wind turbine support structures under wind and wave loads which could be used for fatigue analysis zhang et al 2013 studied the dynamic behaviors for semi submersible floating foundations under wind current and waves the dynamic analyses were computed in the frequency and time domains by the sesam software however none of current studies analyze the dynamic response for bridge pylon in the frequency domain under wind and wave loads in this paper a simplified calculation method in the frequency domain is proposed for random loads p such as wave excitation wind excitation it can be regarded as the superposition of regular loads therefore random loads in time domain can be expressed as 19 p t re j 1 n a j e i w j t where a j w j are the amplitude and the frequency at the jth harmonic component according to fft fast fourier transform technique the simulation process in frequency domain is shown as 20 p w j a j exp i φ j according to the fourth hypothesis when the bridge pylon reaches the steady state the frequency dependent response under the harmonic effect can be written as 21 y w j a j h w j exp i φ j where h j φ j denote the real and the imaginary parts respectively h w j h j i φ j is the transfer function which can be calculated through harmonic response analysis using ansys software the total response of the bridge pylon should also satisfy the principle of superposition under m harmonic excitations 22 r w j a 1 j h 1 w j exp i φ j a 2 j h 2 w j exp i φ j a m j h m w j exp i φ j 5 dynamic analyses of freestanding bridge pylon 5 1 finite element model of bridge pylon the example sea crossing railway bridge is an 1190 m long double tower cable stayed bridge and connects changle city with pingtan island in east china sea as shown in fig 8 the bridge pylon is made from reinforced concrete with varied h shape cross section consisting of two parts the pylon column and the pile foundation the pylon column is built on the immense platform and rises to a height of 216 m so it is very sensitive to wind loads below the platform the pile foundation consisting of 38 piles with a radius of 3 4 m extends to a depth over 56 m under the sea so it is strongly subjected to wave loads the finite element model of the bridge pylon is established fig 9 with 3d beam elements the effect of pile soil interaction is on the basis of three orthogonal beam model li et al 2010 the rayleigh damping is adopted in dynamic analyses and damping ratios are determined by two specific vibration modes of the bridge pylon the first 8 natural frequencies and the associated modes of the bridge pylon are listed in table 5 5 2 frequency domain method verification in order to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method two representative cases with m10 and t10 are compared between the frequency domain and the time domain after the finite element model of the bridge pylon is established the transfer function is obtained by harmonic response analysis of ansys software as the transfer function for wave loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon a sinusoidal load with the maximum value of 1 n is applied on the resultant point of wave force for the pile group the transfer function is shown in fig 10 a as the transfer function for wind loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon 12 sinusoidal loads with the maximum value of 1 n are applied on each node of the pylon column elements with the length of 18 m see fig 1 a total of 24 load points are acted on the bridge pylon and the transfer function is obtained in fig 10 b considering the larger stiffness of the concrete bridge pylon the loads are applied with increasing form 0 01 hz to 4 hz in steps of 0 01 hz it can be clearly seen that the influence of wind load on displacement of the top pylon is much greater than that of wave load the two cases with m10 in the monsoon period and t10 in the typhoon period are selected to verify the proposed method in time domain the time history of the lateral displacement of the top pylon is calculated through the transient dynamic analysis of the bridge pylon model the time history of the displacement results can be transformed next to a spectrum based on fft in frequency domain the response spectrum is obtained by the frequency method proposed in this paper and then the linear least square filter is used to smooth the data which is to more clearly compare the results and understand the impact mechanism of the wind and wave the compare results are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 which show that the frequency domain results are greatly consistent with the time domain results in both m10 and t10 conditions the nonlinearities of the model like the large deformation effect are considered in the time domain calculation while the frequency domain calculation is based on the assumption of linear system therefore tiny differences can still be found in the comparison results for what concerns the computational efficiency the frequency domain method takes approximately 3 min where the solution to the transfer function takes 2 min and 53 s almost all the time is spent in the calculation of the transfer function which is reusable in the calculation of the lateral displacement for top pylon in all cases on the contrary random load response takes about 1 h in time domain method although the frequency domain method still has a bit of room for improvement especially in the nonlinear system it show rationality and efficiency in dynamic analysis of complex engineering structures like sea crossing bridges and could help us understand the mechanism of influence of the wind and wave 5 3 dynamic analysis 5 3 1 influence of different seasons fig 13 shows the response spectrum for wind and wave loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon in the typhoon period and the monsoon period the larger the area covered by the response spectrum the greater the energy produced by the wind and wave and the greater the displacement response of the top pylon it is obvious that the spectral energy content of the typhoon period is approximately twice as large as that of the monsoon period which indicates that the structural response in the typhoon period is much greater fig 13 a is characterized by two peaks the first peak appears at the frequency of 0 312 hz corresponding to the 1st symmetric lateral bending of the bridge pylon which shows that the dynamic response of the bridge pylon is mainly governed by its own dynamic characteristics the second peak occurs near the wave peak frequency of about 0 125 hz corresponding to the wave period of 8 0s for m10 due to its larger stiffness the high order natural frequency of bridge pylon has almost no contribution to the dynamic response the phenomenon shown in fig 13 b is almost the same as fig 13 a there are two main differences between the typhoon period and the monsoon period one is the relatively large energy content of response spectrum and the other is the relatively small second peak frequency because of the larger wave period meanwhile a longer return period has a larger response spectral value in the monsoon period or the typhoon period in other words the values decrease gradually from the largest to the smallest in the order of m15 m10 m5 or t15 t10 t5 for different seasons the response spectral value of the first peak in t5 is 1 29 times the amount of that in m15 although the return period is greater the response spectral value in the monsoon period is still smaller than that in the typhoon season which indicates a significant seasonal effect in order to further clarify the impact mechanism of the correlated wind and wave on the bridge pylon the response spectrums induced by the single wave the single wind and the correlated wind wave are show in fig 14 fig 14 a demonstrates the response spectrum in the monsoon period with m10 condition which has relatively low wind speeds and wave heights according to the contribution of the wind and the wave to the dynamic response of the bridge pylon the response spectrum is divided into three regions including the wind dominant region the wave dominant region and the wind and wave common dominant region the wind dominant region belongs to the low frequency vibrational region whose frequency is less than 0 05 hz which shows the influence of wind on displacement response the wave dominant region has the second peak whose frequency is smaller than the first order frequency of the structure for the wind and wave common dominant region the energy content of the first peak consists of the wind energy and the wave energy where the latter is slightly higher than the former the energy contributed by the wave accounts for about 50 of the total energy indicating that the wave makes a significant contribution to the structural vibration in addition the fundamental frequency of the structure should avoid falling into the wave dominant region which may cause structural resonances fig 14 b shows the response spectrum in the typhoon period with t10 condition with larger wind speeds and wave heights the influence area of the wind dominant region becomes smaller due to the lower peak frequency of the wave spectrum inhibiting the resonant wind induced response of the bridge pylon moreover the contribution from winds to the first peak is slightly higher than that from waves which is exactly the opposite of the phenomenon observed in the monsoon period with m10 condition this is because different joint probability distributions of wind and waves affect their contribution mechanism in different periods 5 3 2 influence of different directions fig 15 illustrates the response spectrum for wind and wave loads to the longitudinal displacement of the top pylon with t10 condition in 7 loading directions i e 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 with the x axis the total energy content decreases from 0 longitudinal bridge to 90 lateral bridge in the range from 0 to 45 the energy content in the wind dominant region decreases the first peak appears in the wind and wave common dominant region the 1st symmetric longitudinal frequency of the bridge pylon is 0 186 hz which is reflected in the location of first peak as the peak frequency of the wave spectrum is close to the longitudinal fundamental frequency of the structure there is no obvious wave dominant region in the response spectrum whose energy is concentrated at the first peak the second peak could be observed hardly in the range from 45 to 90 the energy content in the wind dominant region also decreases and the wave dominant region is still not obvious however the response spectrum has a second peak corresponding to the lateral fundamental frequency of the structure in the wind and wave common dominant region although it is not apparent the second peak shows that the longitudinal response induced by the inclined load is affected by the lateral vibration characteristics of the structure especially for the loading direction of 75 with the x axis when the loading direction is along the lateral bridge the longitudinal displacement is not influenced by the lateral excitation to further understand the direction effect of inclined load the detailed response spectrum at the loading direction of 75 with the x axis is shown in fig 15 the peaks are located at the frequencies of 0 186 hz and 0 312 hz respectively for the longitudinal displacement the relative contribution produced by the 1st symmetric lateral bending of bridge pylon is larger than that by the 1st symmetric longitudinal bending the longitudinal displacement of the top pylon is mainly controlled by the fundamental frequency of the lateral bending on the bridge pylon 5 3 3 influence of water depths fig 16 shows the response spectrum for wind and wave loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon at five sets of water depth with 60 m 55 m 50 m 45 m 40 m other environmental parameters are valued according to t10 condition the water level fluctuation will affect the environmental loads wave loads will decrease and wind loads will increase with the decreasing water depth in the wind dominant region the five curves almost coincide which indicates that the water depth has no significant effect on the low frequency region in the wave dominant region and the wind and wave common dominant region the response spectrum changes significantly at different water depths two distinct peaks appear in the response spectrum the highest peak occurs near the structure s second frequency in the wind and wave common dominant region and the second highest peak occurs near the wave frequency in the wave dominant region the maximum values in the highest peak decrease gradually from the largest to the smallest in the order of water depth with 40 m 60 m 45 m 55 m 50 m with the same water depth the larger the highest peak is the smaller the second highest peak becomes the highest peak has the maximum and the second highest peak has the minimum with the water depth of 40 m the second highest peak has the maximum and the highest peak has the minimum with the water depth of 50 m the total energy content is almost constant for different depths which means that the influence of water depth on the displacement of the top pylon is not obvious however the change in water depth significantly alters the distribution of energy content waves contribute the most energy and the least energy to the structure with the water depth of 50 m and 40 m respectively this phenomenon helps us understand the mechanism of the influence of water depth on the bridge pylon 6 summary and remarks during the extreme environment with strong winds and high waves the dynamic analysis under the correlated wind and wave is the basis to assess the safety of sea crossing bridge especially for the freestanding structure under construction in the present study the data of wind and waves were obtained through field measurements the correlation between wind and waves is considered through the joint probability distribution based on the copula model the fluctuating wind fields based on the spectral representation model and the random wave fields based on the linear superposition method are simulated separately the wind loads considering static wind forces and buffeting forces are calculated where the three component coefficients are obtained by two dimensional numerical simulations the wave loads are solved considering the pile group effect then the frequency domain transform for the dynamic response is proposed based on harmonic response analysis a freestanding bridge pylon of a sea crossing bridge is used as an example to verify this method the influence of seasons load directions and water depths is then discussed the result from the joint distribution of wind and wave indicates that strong correlation exists in wind and waves around the bridge site therefore the wind load and the wave load need to be considered simultaneously especially in the extreme environment the result of the frequency domain method for calculating the response spectrum of bridge pylon is comparable to that of the time domain simulation when looking at typical cases with different environmental parameters the proposed approach provides valuable information used in the design of bridge pylon avoiding the fundamental frequency of the pylon falling into the potential wave or wind dominant region it also could help designers to understand the mechanism of wind and waves effects on the bridge pylon after analyzing the influence of seasons load directions and water depths the significant seasonal variation is found in the response spectrum of the bridge pylon the different combinations of wind and waves result in the significant difference in their contribution mechanism in the typhoon period and the monsoon period the peak frequency of the wave spectrum during the monsoon period is closest to structural fundamental frequency which could cause relatively large vibrations and even resonances the unidirectional response induced by inclined loads is affected by the multi directional vibration characteristics of the structure which are obviously different form unidirectional loads the change in water depth affects the energy distribution against the frequencies significantly this may be particularly meaningful when choosing the bridge position the proposed approach provides a practical and efficient method for the dynamic analysis of freestanding bridge pylon in frequency domain furthermore the adequate measured data need to be obtained to improve the limitations of higher accuracy and further extrapolation acknowledgements this work was supported

22773,with complex terrains and varied physical environments near bridge sites it is challenging to include uncertainties for dynamic analyses of sea crossing bridges in this paper an efficient frequency domain method for the dynamic analysis of a freestanding bridge pylon is proposed with a copula model to consider the correlation between wind and waves firstly the data of wind and waves are obtained by field measurements a best copula model is chosen to simulate the joint probability distribution after calculating the fluctuating wind field and the random wave filed the wind and the wave loadings are obtained to reduce the calculation cost for dynamic analyses the harmonic response analysis is introduced to solve the structural response spectrum by integrating the transfer function between the environmental load and the structural response a sea crossing railway bridge pylon located in the sea crossing region is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method finally the influence of seasons load directions and water depths on the displacement response of the top pylon is further discussed the response spectrum analysis illustrates the influence mechanism of the correlated wind and wave on bridge pylon keywords freestanding bridge pylon frequency domain dynamic analysis correlated wind and wave 1 introduction with the continuous development of construction technology a great number of long span bridges have been constructed in order to cross islands and straits chen et al 2011 qin and gao 2017 the bridge pylon which supports huge cables and transfers tremendous loads to the ground is crucially important in particular it focuses at the free standing construction that is the stand alone condition when the girder is not present and the pylon is independent the wind excitation is generally assumed to be more significant than the wave excitation for taller pylons with shallower water foundations however as the water depth of bridge site becomes deeper and the pile foundation becomes longer for sea crossing bridges the wave excitation has also been increasingly emphasized by researchers due to the huge wave load zhu et al 2018a fang et al 2018 this implies that it is necessary to study the impact of wind and waves on bridge pylons of sea crossing bridges many existing literature have studied the wind induced vibration of bridge pylon through field observations wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations in both time domain e g belloli et al 2011 casciati and giuliano 2009 fujino 2002 siringoringo and fujino 2012 and frequency domain e g davenport 1962 xu et al 2000 it was found that dynamic characteristics of slender structures are sensitive to wind loads and the aerodynamic response of bridge pylon at the construction stage is more pronounced when compared with the completed bridge stage due to the lack of girder and cable constraints these studies provided valuable information for researching aerodynamics structure interaction effects as to hydrodynamic effects on bridges in deep water some literature analyzed the effects of waves on bridge foundations or pylon in time domain liu et al 2007 wei et al 2013 2017 sea crossing bridges are always simultaneously subjected to wind and wave loadings during the service period most of researchers studied the dynamic response of bridge pylon under winds alone or waves alone only few works guo et al 2016 zhu and zhang 2017 were carried out under wind and waves together zhu and zhang 2017 developed a bridge wind wave system to simulate the wind and the wave fields for bridge pylons and contributed an approach to further analyze the dynamic performance for coastal slender bridges guo et al 2016 presented dynamic response experiments of a freestanding bridge pylon under coupled wind and waves in which the coupled effects on the pylon could be clearly observed although some studies considered an ideal wind wave relationship the accurately correlations between wind and waves are still not clear around sea crossing bridges in recent decades the copula model has been widely used for modeling the correlation among random variables in coastal and ocean engineering e g salvadori and de michele 2007 yang and zhang 2013 the diverse copula models such as gumbel gaussian frank and clayton copulas could better fit the joint probability distribution of wind and wave parameters although there are some traditional numerical wave prediction models such as waw swan and wavewatch models the low resolutions are unable to meet the needs of sea crossing bridges rusu et al 2018 meanwhile the construction period for sea crossing bridges is longer than that for land bridges generally such as hongkong zhuhai macau bridge and zhoushan cross sea bridge which took more than 8 years and 10 years respectively therefore the free standing bridge pylon is more likely to be affected by extreme wind and waves which serious impact construction machinery and workers in normal construction for this reason this paper proposes a prediction approach for the wind and wave joint return period within 15 years in the basis of copula method providing a valuable reference for sea crossing bridges under construction there are two main differences between the bridge pylon and other offshore structures on the one hand the pylon height above the sea level usually exceeds 100 m which is much higher than many offshore structures like jackets wind turbines and floating foundations due to the severe fluctuations of wind speed at higher positions it is inappropriate to approximate the wind speed to its mean value only the actual wind velocity field is composed of the mean wind component static wind plus the time varying wind component fluctuating wind the offshore structures are typically designed with static wind field hansen et al 2006 wei et al 2014 however taller bridge towers are more susceptible to fluctuating winds with higher frequencies which have potential effects on the dynamic wind excitation in extreme conditions on the other hand the foundation of the bridge pylon is supported by the pile group which generally consists of 30 50 piles each pile is filled with concrete surrounded by a steel casing the densely arranged piles are drilled deep into seabed rocks so the pile group foundation of bridge pylon has larger stiffness than the foundations of jackets and tension leg platforms therefore it is necessary to study the influence mechanism of correlated wind and waves on bridge pylons most studies mainly focused on time domain calculation of bridge pylon which is still time consuming especially when several bridge pylons need to be compared or when the support foundations need to be optimized for different locations in this study in order to more accurately simulate the relationship between wind and waves near a bridge site and clarify the response and the mechanism of the free standing tower under the combined action of wind and waves the measured data are obtained in the bridge region the seasons are considered by dividing measurements into a monsoon period and a typhoon period the copula models are used to fit the wind wave joint probability distribution then a frequency domain approach for the dynamic analysis of the bridge pylon of the sea crossing bridge is proposed the dynamic analysis is divided into two parts which includes the pylon body in the wind field and the pile foundation in the wave field the wind field is simulated as random stationary wind of which the fluctuating component is generated by the lumley panpfsky spectrum due to the shelter effect and the interference effect among piles the estimation of pile group loads is extremely complicated compared with that on a single isolated pile the wave field is simulated as random wave based on the pierson moskowitz spectrum considering the pile group effect the total response is obtained by linearly summing the ordinates per frequency of the wind wave induced response a freestanding bridge pylon of a sea crossing bridge is utilized as an example to verify the validity of the frequency domain method and the influences of seasons load directions and water depths are further analyzed a brief summary and concluding remarks are provided at the end of paper 2 model definition and analysis procedure 2 1 model definition the present pylon model for the dynamic analysis involves the pylon tower subjected to wind load and the pile foundation subjected to wave load the load patterns of the bridge pylon under wind and wave loads are shown in fig 1 to simplify the model the following assumptions are made to develop a frequency domain method for freestanding bridge pylons of sea crossing bridges 1 the wind and wave are modeled as individually unidirectional the wind and wave acting in one direction and codirectional the direction of the wind and wave is the same 2 the responses due to the wind and the wave response are assumed to be fully independent 3 the bridge pylon is discretized into small elements by the finite element method its mass distribution is idealized by replacing with discrete masses located at the centroids of finite elements all forces including weight wave forces on the submerged parts and wind forces on the parts above sea level are assumed to act at these centroids 2 2 analysis framework of bridge pylon once the structure and the environmental loadings have been defined the procedures illustrated in fig 2 are performed as follows 1 with available field measured data of wind and waves several different copula models are compared to choose the most suitable model based on akaike information criterion aic 2 determine the most likely wind and wave metocean conditions to different return periods for typhoon and monsoon periods based on copula models e g the significant wave height h s the mean wind speed u and the mean zero up crossing wave periods t p 3 generate the random wind field by a spectral representation model and the wave field by a linear superposition method and calculate the wind and the wave loads 4 establish the finite element model of bridge pylon the transfer function between the pylon displacement and the environmental load are determined at a specific location based on the harmonic response analysis the combined dynamic response spectrum of the bridge pylon is calculated by multiplying the transfer function with the wind load spectrum and the wave load spectrum respectively 5 repeat step 1 4 calculate the response spectra in different combinations of the wind and wave and compare the response spectra between the frequency domain method proposed in this paper and the traditional time domain method 6 after verifying correctness and validity of the proposed model the influence of seasons load directions and water depths is further discussed in frequency domain 3 joint probability model of wind and waves for the dynamic analysis of freestanding bridge pylon in frequency domain the joint probability distribution function pdf of the wind velocity and the wave height should be determined first 3 1 field measurement the wind and the wave are mutually influenced at the bridge site with complex topography the relationship between the wind and wave defined by the code with deterministic methods cannot accurately describe the environmental characteristics of the bridge site therefore field measurements were carried out in the bridge site area the location of the monitoring point is shown in fig 3 the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge and a two dimensional ultrasonic anemometer are installed on a platform the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge is adopted to measure the wave height and the two dimensional ultrasonic anemometer is applied to monitor the wind speed simultaneously the sampling frequencies of the sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge and the ultrasonic anemometer are 2 hz and 1 hz respectively the monitoring equipment for wave and winds fixed in a stable environment are 13 m and 20 25 m away from the mean sea level msl respectively the data of wave heights are continuously collected for about 17 min per hour and the data of wind speeds are continuously collected for 24 h the significant wave height and the mean wind speed per day are used in the joint probability model because the target bridge is still in the construction period the data of wind and waves in only 3 years from 2015 to 2017 were recorded as the resource used in the example actually many sea crossing bridge projects have only a small amount of measured data available although the measured data with 3 years may be not enough to predict accurately the meteorological characteristics in the service life of bridges with 100 years but it is reasonable to predict the wind and wave parameters during the construction period which generally does not exceed 15 years 3 2 copula based joint probability model as an effective model in probability theory the copula model is used to simulate the correlation between the wind and wave based on the field measured data in the example site the copula allows the marginal univariate distribution to follow different forms to find the optimal selection with available wind and wave data in the bridge site various models allow the copula to better fit the joint probability distribution of parameters of wind and waves such as the significant wave height h s the mean wind speed v w the copula approach for dependence modeling is formalized based on the sklar representation theorem for the bivariate case the joint cumulative distribution function h x y of any pair x y of continuous random variables may be written in the form 1 h x y c f x f y θ where f x f y are the marginal distributions c 0 1 2 0 1 denotes the connection relationship between the marginal distributions thought 2d copula θ is the dependence parameter which is estimated through the maximum likelihood method before applying the copula approach for the measured data of h s and v w the marginal distributions need to be determined as indicated in eq 2 existing research demonstrates that the gumbel logistic model is applicable to the field of ocean engineering yang and zhang 2013 with the gumbel distribution as the marginal distribution the distribution function can be expressed as 2 f x exp exp x a b where a and b are the positional parameter and the scale parameter of the gumbel distribution in order to test the marginal distribution the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test is adopted in the distribution fitting test if the test statistic d n is less than the critical value d 0 05 with 5 significance level the marginal distribution follows the gumbel distribution with the parameters of a and b on the contrary it rejects the gumbel distribution the marginal distributions are examined by least squares method and the parameters are summarized in table 1 according to k s test the d n is less than d 0 05 in all cases which proves that the marginal distribution follows the gumbel distribution after obtaining the marginal distribution for each random variable an appropriate bivariate copula function can be adopted to correlate two random variables the copula function is selected to many forms of models such as gumbel gaussian frank and clayton which is not restricted to a certain type of distributions to find the best copula model the root mean square error rmse and aic are utilized to evaluate the goodness of the fit for four different copulas the lowest value suggests a better model 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p c i p o i 2 4 a i c 2 l θ 2 p where n is the number of samples p c is the theory frequency value of copula joint distribution p o is the empirical frequency values of joint distribution l θ is the maximum log likelihood value of the copula model p is the number of parameters used in the copula model the copula model is examined by the maximum likelihood method the dependent parameter and evaluation index with the rmse and aic values for the proposed copulas are summarized in table 2 both the rmse and aic values show that the clayton copula model is the best fit to the mean wind speed and the significant wave height the contour plots of joint probability density for the proposed copulas are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 for monsoon period and typhoon period respectively as is apparently demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 when the wind speed is small the distribution of wave height is concentrated as the wind speed increases the distribution of wave height is more dispersed compared with the other three models the clayton copula model can better reflect these distribution characteristics the fitting copula is in good agreement with the measured points which indicates the strong correlation between the wind and wave for the monsoon period the wind speed distribution range is 0 16 4 m s and the wave height distribution range is 0 4 2 m for the typhoon period the wind speed distribution range is 0 19 4 m s and the wave height distribution range is 0 5 1 m the typhoon period is prone to higher waves at the same wind speed in addition it is easier to generate huge waves under strong winds so it is necessary to consider the coupled wind and wave loads 3 3 joint return period once the marginal distribution of wind speed or wave height is determined the corresponding return period for the variables x or y exceeding certain values is given by 5 t x 1 1 f x r where r is the annual arrival rate of the variable x after the joint probability model of wind speed and wave height is obtained the joint return period t x y of any of x or y or both exceeding the corresponding values x and y x x y y or x x and y y can be expressed as 6 t x y 1 1 h x y r some studies show that there are significant seasonal differences in wind wave field boeck et al 2010 willems 2000 it is helpful for engineers to understand the impact mechanism and the conduct construction planning by studying differences of wind and wave fields in different seasons according to the historical meteorological characteristics of the bridge site the monsoon period is from january to may and the typhoon period is from august to october the values of the wind speed and the wave height at a given return period are predicted based on typhoon period and monsoon period data respectively these excluded months are considered unrelated to investigate the characteristics during the typhoon and the monsoon periods respectively therefore the joint return period is divided into the typhoon period t t and the monsoon period t m several combinations of the wind speed and the wave height will occur during the same return period the most possible combination can be obtained for a joint return period t t or t m when the joint probability density of this combination reaches the maximum according to the measured data with limited time the return periods are set to be 5 10 and 15 years the corresponding most possible values of the significant wave height h s the mean wind speed u and the mean zero up crossing wave periods t p are listed in table 3 as to the correlation between h s and t p the expression proposed by valamanesh et al 2015 is adopted as follow 7 t p 11 7 h s g there are 6 different combinations of return periods including m5 m10 m15 t5 t10 and t15 it is obvious that the environmental parameters in the typhoon season are significantly higher than those in the monsoon period the mean wind speeds during the typhoon are increased by 39 37 and 35 when compared with the monsoon period in return periods of 5 10 and 15 years respectively the significant wave heights during the typhoon are increased by 73 65 and 67 when compared with the monsoon period in return periods of 5 10 and 15 years respectively therefore we need to pay attention to the effect of this huge difference on the structure 4 frequency domain dynamic analyses 4 1 random wind load because the height of pylon increases with the increase in bridge span especially for these sea crossing bridges the flexible bridge pylon is vulnerable to wind forces guo et al 2016 the wind loads acting on the bridge pylon consist of static wind forces self excited forces and buffeting forces the self excited force is the interaction force between the wind and the bridge motion which can be expressed as a relationship between the arbitrary bridge deck motion and the associated impulse functions the buffeting forces are caused by fluctuating winds which can be expressed as a relationship between the fluctuating winds and the associated aerodynamic response coefficients due to the larger stiffness and smaller width relative to the bridge deck the self excited force on the concrete pylon is generally ignored zhu and zhang 2017 therefore the total wind forces f wind on bridge pylon are given by 8 f wind t 0 l e f h t d x 0 l e f v t d x 0 l e f m t d x where the subscripts h v m are the drag force lift force and moment respectively l e is the length of pylon body the load diagram is shown in fig 6 a and the total wind forces on unit length bridge pylon li et al 2005 are obtained as 9 f h t f st h f bu h t 1 2 ρ u 2 c d h 1 2 ρ u 2 b 2 h b c d v t u γ 1 10 f v t f st v f bu v t 1 2 ρ u 2 c l b 1 2 ρ u 2 b 2 c l v t

force ρ is the air density u is the mean wind velocity which is given by u u 10 ln z z 0 ln 10 z 0 u 10 is mean wind speed at 10 m height above msl z 0 is the sea surface roughness which is approximately 0 005 m for a rough sea surface h and b are the height and the width of the bridge pylon v t w t denote the two dimensional fluctuating wind velocities in x axis direction and y axis direction at time t γ i i 1 2 3 4 5 is the aerodynamic admittance function in time domain which is taken as 1 0 due to its blunt body section c d c l c m are the drag coefficient lift coefficient and moment coefficient respectively which are usually obtained by wind tunnel tests or numerical simulations in present work the two dimensional numerical wind tunnel technology is used to calculate the three component coefficient shown in fig 6 b although this method does not consider aerodynamic interference in three dimensional space this approach is still practical and economical in comparison with the wind tunnel test the aerodynamic parameters of the bridge pylon are detailed in table 4 the element size progressively increases from the sides of tower columns to the computational boundary the k ω sst turbulence model is used and the time step is set equal to 10 4 s a second order scheme is selected for pressure and a second order upwind scheme is selected for momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate the discretized problem has been numerically solved by adopting a simple pressure velocity coupling algorithm the unsteady flow is simulated by cfd software fluent the bridge pylon consists of a front tower and a behind tower each tower column is assumed to be constant with a cross sectional size of 6m 10 4 m the distance between the two tower columns is 38 m as v t and w t are random processes the lumley panpfsky spectrum is taken as the target wind spectra for the bridge pylon li et al 2004 then multipoint wind fields can be generated as a uniformly modulated process the cross spectral density matrix of the vector process v t v z 1 t v z 2 t v z n t t is given by 12 s 0 w s 11 0 w s 12 0 w s 1 n 0 w s 21 0 w s 22 0 w s 2 n 0 w s n 1 0 w s n 2 0 w s n n 0 w the cross spectrum s j m 0 w can be expressed as follows 13 s j m 0 w s j j 0 w s m m 0 w c o h j m w where s j j 0 w s m m 0 w are the real matrices c o h j m w is the coherence function suggested by davenport and the form between point j and point m can be rewritten as follows 14 c o h w exp w 2 π λ z j z m u j u m 2 where w is the frequency λ is the dimensionless decay factor ranging from 7 to 10 then the stochastic wind fields of the bridge pylon at n height can be solved by the numerous approach of spectral representation model srm in present work a practical method based on srm presented by li et al 2004 is adopted which is more suitable for engineering 4 2 random wave load the morison equation has been widely used for prediction of the wave loads on slender offshore structures chen et al 2016 wei et al 2017 when the ratio of structure diameter d to length l is smaller than 0 2 random waves can be considered as the superposition of multiple cosine waves with individual periods and random initial phases random wave loads can also be regarded as a superposition of regular wave loads therefore the total wave forces f wave on the pile group of the bridge pylon are given by 15 f wave t p d t p i t 16 p d t j 1 n j k 1 n k l 1 n l i 1 m φ d u j k i z l t u j k i z l t k g j k δ z 17 p i t j 1 n j k 1 n k l 1 n l i 1 m φ m u j k i z l t k g j k δ z where p d p i are the drag and inertia force induced by wave n j n k are the rows and columns of pile group foundations as shown in fig 7 a b are the row width and the column width n l is the number of intervals in the length of the pile that is to calculate the total wave force of a single pile m is the number of intervals in frequency which is to simulate random waves based on the linear superposition method δ z d η n l d is the water depth η is the wave surface elevation k g j k is the pile group coefficient at the j kth pile u i j u i j are the water particle velocity and acceleration normal to the displaced j kth pile which is solved by the pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 φ d 0 5 ρ w c d d ρ w is the water density φ d 0 25 ρ w c m a a is the cross sectional area c d c m are the drag coefficient and inertia coefficient for pile foundation that are set to be 1 2 and 2 0 according to chinese standard of hydrology for harbour and waterway jts 145 2015 2015 some existing studies indicate that the pile group effect needs to be considered for a large pile group bonakdar et al 2015 zhu et al 2018b the interaction among piles depends mainly on the kc number the wave direction and the relative spacing a d to simplify the modeling procedure of wave loading the pile group coefficient is proposed by bonakdar et al 2015 which only depends on the relative spacing a d the expression is given by 18 k g 1 265 0 225 ln a d 1 0 middlepile sidepile where k g is the pile group coefficient considering only the interference effect because the shelter effect will reduce the wave force on the pile hence it is a conservative method to ignore the shelter effect 4 3 frequency domain transform method for the calculation of structural random vibration response a long time calculation is performed following the step by step integration method which takes approximately 1 3 h for offshore structures therefore the time domain simulation costs a great deal of time especially when the structure requires optimization or comparison in different sea states for other coastal constructions including offshore wind turbines and floating foundations many efforts have been made to develop the frequency domain analysis method van der et al 2005 developed a frequency domain approach for offshore wind turbine support structures under wind and wave loads which could be used for fatigue analysis zhang et al 2013 studied the dynamic behaviors for semi submersible floating foundations under wind current and waves the dynamic analyses were computed in the frequency and time domains by the sesam software however none of current studies analyze the dynamic response for bridge pylon in the frequency domain under wind and wave loads in this paper a simplified calculation method in the frequency domain is proposed for random loads p such as wave excitation wind excitation it can be regarded as the superposition of regular loads therefore random loads in time domain can be expressed as 19 p t re j 1 n a j e i w j t where a j w j are the amplitude and the frequency at the jth harmonic component according to fft fast fourier transform technique the simulation process in frequency domain is shown as 20 p w j a j exp i φ j according to the fourth hypothesis when the bridge pylon reaches the steady state the frequency dependent response under the harmonic effect can be written as 21 y w j a j h w j exp i φ j where h j φ j denote the real and the imaginary parts respectively h w j h j i φ j is the transfer function which can be calculated through harmonic response analysis using ansys software the total response of the bridge pylon should also satisfy the principle of superposition under m harmonic excitations 22 r w j a 1 j h 1 w j exp i φ j a 2 j h 2 w j exp i φ j a m j h m w j exp i φ j 5 dynamic analyses of freestanding bridge pylon 5 1 finite element model of bridge pylon the example sea crossing railway bridge is an 1190 m long double tower cable stayed bridge and connects changle city with pingtan island in east china sea as shown in fig 8 the bridge pylon is made from reinforced concrete with varied h shape cross section consisting of two parts the pylon column and the pile foundation the pylon column is built on the immense platform and rises to a height of 216 m so it is very sensitive to wind loads below the platform the pile foundation consisting of 38 piles with a radius of 3 4 m extends to a depth over 56 m under the sea so it is strongly subjected to wave loads the finite element model of the bridge pylon is established fig 9 with 3d beam elements the effect of pile soil interaction is on the basis of three orthogonal beam model li et al 2010 the rayleigh damping is adopted in dynamic analyses and damping ratios are determined by two specific vibration modes of the bridge pylon the first 8 natural frequencies and the associated modes of the bridge pylon are listed in table 5 5 2 frequency domain method verification in order to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method two representative cases with m10 and t10 are compared between the frequency domain and the time domain after the finite element model of the bridge pylon is established the transfer function is obtained by harmonic response analysis of ansys software as the transfer function for wave loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon a sinusoidal load with the maximum value of 1 n is applied on the resultant point of wave force for the pile group the transfer function is shown in fig 10 a as the transfer function for wind loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon 12 sinusoidal loads with the maximum value of 1 n are applied on each node of the pylon column elements with the length of 18 m see fig 1 a total of 24 load points are acted on the bridge pylon and the transfer function is obtained in fig 10 b considering the larger stiffness of the concrete bridge pylon the loads are applied with increasing form 0 01 hz to 4 hz in steps of 0 01 hz it can be clearly seen that the influence of wind load on displacement of the top pylon is much greater than that of wave load the two cases with m10 in the monsoon period and t10 in the typhoon period are selected to verify the proposed method in time domain the time history of the lateral displacement of the top pylon is calculated through the transient dynamic analysis of the bridge pylon model the time history of the displacement results can be transformed next to a spectrum based on fft in frequency domain the response spectrum is obtained by the frequency method proposed in this paper and then the linear least square filter is used to smooth the data which is to more clearly compare the results and understand the impact mechanism of the wind and wave the compare results are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 which show that the frequency domain results are greatly consistent with the time domain results in both m10 and t10 conditions the nonlinearities of the model like the large deformation effect are considered in the time domain calculation while the frequency domain calculation is based on the assumption of linear system therefore tiny differences can still be found in the comparison results for what concerns the computational efficiency the frequency domain method takes approximately 3 min where the solution to the transfer function takes 2 min and 53 s almost all the time is spent in the calculation of the transfer function which is reusable in the calculation of the lateral displacement for top pylon in all cases on the contrary random load response takes about 1 h in time domain method although the frequency domain method still has a bit of room for improvement especially in the nonlinear system it show rationality and efficiency in dynamic analysis of complex engineering structures like sea crossing bridges and could help us understand the mechanism of influence of the wind and wave 5 3 dynamic analysis 5 3 1 influence of different seasons fig 13 shows the response spectrum for wind and wave loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon in the typhoon period and the monsoon period the larger the area covered by the response spectrum the greater the energy produced by the wind and wave and the greater the displacement response of the top pylon it is obvious that the spectral energy content of the typhoon period is approximately twice as large as that of the monsoon period which indicates that the structural response in the typhoon period is much greater fig 13 a is characterized by two peaks the first peak appears at the frequency of 0 312 hz corresponding to the 1st symmetric lateral bending of the bridge pylon which shows that the dynamic response of the bridge pylon is mainly governed by its own dynamic characteristics the second peak occurs near the wave peak frequency of about 0 125 hz corresponding to the wave period of 8 0s for m10 due to its larger stiffness the high order natural frequency of bridge pylon has almost no contribution to the dynamic response the phenomenon shown in fig 13 b is almost the same as fig 13 a there are two main differences between the typhoon period and the monsoon period one is the relatively large energy content of response spectrum and the other is the relatively small second peak frequency because of the larger wave period meanwhile a longer return period has a larger response spectral value in the monsoon period or the typhoon period in other words the values decrease gradually from the largest to the smallest in the order of m15 m10 m5 or t15 t10 t5 for different seasons the response spectral value of the first peak in t5 is 1 29 times the amount of that in m15 although the return period is greater the response spectral value in the monsoon period is still smaller than that in the typhoon season which indicates a significant seasonal effect in order to further clarify the impact mechanism of the correlated wind and wave on the bridge pylon the response spectrums induced by the single wave the single wind and the correlated wind wave are show in fig 14 fig 14 a demonstrates the response spectrum in the monsoon period with m10 condition which has relatively low wind speeds and wave heights according to the contribution of the wind and the wave to the dynamic response of the bridge pylon the response spectrum is divided into three regions including the wind dominant region the wave dominant region and the wind and wave common dominant region the wind dominant region belongs to the low frequency vibrational region whose frequency is less than 0 05 hz which shows the influence of wind on displacement response the wave dominant region has the second peak whose frequency is smaller than the first order frequency of the structure for the wind and wave common dominant region the energy content of the first peak consists of the wind energy and the wave energy where the latter is slightly higher than the former the energy contributed by the wave accounts for about 50 of the total energy indicating that the wave makes a significant contribution to the structural vibration in addition the fundamental frequency of the structure should avoid falling into the wave dominant region which may cause structural resonances fig 14 b shows the response spectrum in the typhoon period with t10 condition with larger wind speeds and wave heights the influence area of the wind dominant region becomes smaller due to the lower peak frequency of the wave spectrum inhibiting the resonant wind induced response of the bridge pylon moreover the contribution from winds to the first peak is slightly higher than that from waves which is exactly the opposite of the phenomenon observed in the monsoon period with m10 condition this is because different joint probability distributions of wind and waves affect their contribution mechanism in different periods 5 3 2 influence of different directions fig 15 illustrates the response spectrum for wind and wave loads to the longitudinal displacement of the top pylon with t10 condition in 7 loading directions i e 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 with the x axis the total energy content decreases from 0 longitudinal bridge to 90 lateral bridge in the range from 0 to 45 the energy content in the wind dominant region decreases the first peak appears in the wind and wave common dominant region the 1st symmetric longitudinal frequency of the bridge pylon is 0 186 hz which is reflected in the location of first peak as the peak frequency of the wave spectrum is close to the longitudinal fundamental frequency of the structure there is no obvious wave dominant region in the response spectrum whose energy is concentrated at the first peak the second peak could be observed hardly in the range from 45 to 90 the energy content in the wind dominant region also decreases and the wave dominant region is still not obvious however the response spectrum has a second peak corresponding to the lateral fundamental frequency of the structure in the wind and wave common dominant region although it is not apparent the second peak shows that the longitudinal response induced by the inclined load is affected by the lateral vibration characteristics of the structure especially for the loading direction of 75 with the x axis when the loading direction is along the lateral bridge the longitudinal displacement is not influenced by the lateral excitation to further understand the direction effect of inclined load the detailed response spectrum at the loading direction of 75 with the x axis is shown in fig 15 the peaks are located at the frequencies of 0 186 hz and 0 312 hz respectively for the longitudinal displacement the relative contribution produced by the 1st symmetric lateral bending of bridge pylon is larger than that by the 1st symmetric longitudinal bending the longitudinal displacement of the top pylon is mainly controlled by the fundamental frequency of the lateral bending on the bridge pylon 5 3 3 influence of water depths fig 16 shows the response spectrum for wind and wave loads to the lateral displacement of the top pylon at five sets of water depth with 60 m 55 m 50 m 45 m 40 m other environmental parameters are valued according to t10 condition the water level fluctuation will affect the environmental loads wave loads will decrease and wind loads will increase with the decreasing water depth in the wind dominant region the five curves almost coincide which indicates that the water depth has no significant effect on the low frequency region in the wave dominant region and the wind and wave common dominant region the response spectrum changes significantly at different water depths two distinct peaks appear in the response spectrum the highest peak occurs near the structure s second frequency in the wind and wave common dominant region and the second highest peak occurs near the wave frequency in the wave dominant region the maximum values in the highest peak decrease gradually from the largest to the smallest in the order of water depth with 40 m 60 m 45 m 55 m 50 m with the same water depth the larger the highest peak is the smaller the second highest peak becomes the highest peak has the maximum and the second highest peak has the minimum with the water depth of 40 m the second highest peak has the maximum and the highest peak has the minimum with the water depth of 50 m the total energy content is almost constant for different depths which means that the influence of water depth on the displacement of the top pylon is not obvious however the change in water depth significantly alters the distribution of energy content waves contribute the most energy and the least energy to the structure with the water depth of 50 m and 40 m respectively this phenomenon helps us understand the mechanism of the influence of water depth on the bridge pylon 6 summary and remarks during the extreme environment with strong winds and high waves the dynamic analysis under the correlated wind and wave is the basis to assess the safety of sea crossing bridge especially for the freestanding structure under construction in the present study the data of wind and waves were obtained through field measurements the correlation between wind and waves is considered through the joint probability distribution based on the copula model the fluctuating wind fields based on the spectral representation model and the random wave fields based on the linear superposition method are simulated separately the wind loads considering static wind forces and buffeting forces are calculated where the three component coefficients are obtained by two dimensional numerical simulations the wave loads are solved considering the pile group effect then the frequency domain transform for the dynamic response is proposed based on harmonic response analysis a freestanding bridge pylon of a sea crossing bridge is used as an example to verify this method the influence of seasons load directions and water depths is then discussed the result from the joint distribution of wind and wave indicates that strong correlation exists in wind and waves around the bridge site therefore the wind load and the wave load need to be considered simultaneously especially in the extreme environment the result of the frequency domain method for calculating the response spectrum of bridge pylon is comparable to that of the time domain simulation when looking at typical cases with different environmental parameters the proposed approach provides valuable information used in the design of bridge pylon avoiding the fundamental frequency of the pylon falling into the potential wave or wind dominant region it also could help designers to understand the mechanism of wind and waves effects on the bridge pylon after analyzing the influence of seasons load directions and water depths the significant seasonal variation is found in the response spectrum of the bridge pylon the different combinations of wind and waves result in the significant difference in their contribution mechanism in the typhoon period and the monsoon period the peak frequency of the wave spectrum during the monsoon period is closest to structural fundamental frequency which could cause relatively large vibrations and even resonances the unidirectional response induced by inclined loads is affected by the multi directional vibration characteristics of the structure which are obviously different form unidirectional loads the change in water depth affects the energy distribution against the frequencies significantly this may be particularly meaningful when choosing the bridge position the proposed approach provides a practical and efficient method for the dynamic analysis of freestanding bridge pylon in frequency domain furthermore the adequate measured data need to be obtained to improve the limitations of higher accuracy and further extrapolation acknowledgements this work was supported

22774,an iterative noise extraction and elimination method is proposed to solve the difficulty of modal parameter identification caused by contaminated high energy components in measured signals the approach is based on the idea that if only the high energy noise is extracted and eliminated accurately modal parameter identification can be improved significantly by using the remaining filtered signal a theoretical development is that a general form of noises is considered i e they can be purely harmonic or damped which implies noises from machine vibration or other unknown sources can be taken into account the advantage of this approach is that only one significant relatively noisy component is extracted at each iteration i e only the most reliable component is extracted each time so more accurate high energy noise elimination is expected to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method a numerical signal with one high energy noisy component is used numerical results show that the approach can extract and eliminate high energy noise at 2 1 hz accurately by setting a small model order a special case is the noisy component as a harmonic which means the traditional fourier transform can be applied however one can conclude that the proposed method outperforms the fourier transform due to its limitation of fixed frequency resolution to further investigate the effectiveness of the approach an experiment on a steel offshore platform is conducted and experimental results indicate that when measured raw data is used only the first mode can be identified if filtered data is used by employing the proposed method the first two modes can be identified with improved damping ratio estimation finally sea test data from an offshore wind turbine in operating conditions are used results show that the first mode with a frequency of 0 3592 hz and a damping ratio of 0 0151 are successfully identified while no reasonable parameters can be obtained by employing the stochastic subspace identification method even when the used model order reaches 300 keywords offshore wind turbine modal parameter identification signal extraction noise elimination high energy 1 introduction in recent decades offshore wind electricity generation has become one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy compared to onshore wind turbines these marine structures are exposed to much more serious external environmental loads including waves currents winds etc in other words maintenance and repair of these marine structures is much more difficult due to the difficulty of access referring to reference pierre et al 2014 operation and maintenance costs of a wind turbine can account for approximately 20 of the total cost therefore it is easy to understand why a structural health monitoring shm system is so important for ensuring structural safety and operational serviceability e g a better understanding of behavior of wind turbines under different environmental conditions ciang et al 2008 dong et al 2018 hu et al 2015 when designing a shm system for offshore wind turbines it is important to obtain dynamic responses of the whole structure by installing a number of sensors different types of sensors have been installed in wind turbines such as a number of accelerometers in the nacelle or on different levels of towers baqersad et al 2015 benedetti et al 2011 ozbek et al 2013 the reason sensors such as strain gauges are seldom used is that this technique usually causes additional damage to the protective paint different from the installation of strain gauges accelerometers can be quickly installed and removed by employing a magnetic base which has been demonstrated as a very effective method in ocean engineering liu et al 2015 from these sensors dynamic responses of the whole structure can be measured and used to extract its frequencies and corresponding damping ratios and even mode shapes the first order frequency often called the natural frequency is used to assess whether the measured resonance frequencies match the design assumptions accurate extraction of meaningful modal parameters from environment excited measured data often relies on techniques such as noise filtering model order determination modal parameter identification and so on in these techniques modal parameter identification plays an important role and has been termed the experimental modal analysis ema classical ema requires input and output information simultaneously and was later developed as a combination of vibration response and deterministic knowledge of input ewins 2000 in contrast without requiring the input modern output only modal identification methods only utilize response data and the term operational modal analysis oma has been adopted peeters and roeck 2001 note that although deterministic input knowledge is not required for output only methods these methods still require a mathematical assumption about the excitation properties which usually assumes the input satisfies a gaussian white noise random process the poly reference complex exponential prce and the eigen system realization algorithm era are currently the two most popular methods in classical ema and their difference lies in different models i e a high order polynomial model and a state space model juang 1994 juang and rechard 1985 for output only modal analysis the counterpart is the instrumental variable iv and the stochastic subspace identification ssi method which are based on the arma model and stochastic state space model peeters and roeck 1999 respectively applications of these in ocean engineering techniques can be found in references choi et al 2005 feng et al 2016 jin and xing 2007 liu et al 2014a b 2016b osgood 2001 park et al 2010 similar to offshore platforms or wave energy devices offshore wind turbines are subjected to continuous wind wave and current excitations however an obvious difference is that loads excitations originating from the rotor will have significant influence on the structural dynamics of offshore wind turbines a measured signal from an operating offshore wind turbine located in the yellow sea china is shown in fig 1 a with sampling frequency 100 hz and the result in frequency domain by using the fourier transform is shown in fig 1 b to exhibit clearly the spectrum of frequency below 3 hz is plotted from fig 1 b unwanted high energy components due to oscillation of the blades generators or nacelle can be observed they are an integer times the frequency almost 0 4 hz close to and very significant compared with expected fundamental frequency normally near 0 3 hz theoretically extracting the modal parameters of offshore wind turbines is not different from other types of offshore structures however when applying traditional modal parameter identification methods to measured data such as fig 1 one can conclude that high energy components fake modes are the easiest to be identified which not only opposes to the traditional concept of modal parameter identification but also raises a much more serious issue reasonable modes cannot be identified due to the interference of the high energy components one possible method of identifying expected true modes is by increasing the model order to estimate increasingly more modal modes the theoretical foundation of this method is based on the fact that active modes buried in the measured data will stabilize only when a low model order is used while poorly excited modes may not stabilize even by setting a high model order in addition utilizing a high model order cannot always ensure proper identification of true modes since it depends on the level of signal to noise and is also a data dependent problem another method of identifying the true modes buried in high energy noise is by noise filtering as a preprocessing step such as a low pass filter kalman filter kalman 1960 kalman and bucy 1961 etc however traditional wisdom shows that a priori bandwidth should be known before low pass filters are used and adjusting the kalman filter has be carefully considered when the accuracy of the measurement instrument and the model of the system are not determined properly jwo and chang 2008 sanliturk and cakar 2005 proposed a noise elimination method by employing the singular value decomposition svd technique to improve the quality of measured data the results from hu et al 2010 show that it is also very difficult to identify poorly excited modes compared with some noisy ones during the estimation of modal parameters from noisy impulse response function irf recently liu et al 2016a presented a new modal parameter identification method and applied the method to offshore structures although the modal parameter identification method performed well for offshore platforms it faces the difficulty of interference of high energy noise when a rough pole window is assigned in the second step this paper proposes a one by one high energy noise extraction and elimination method for improving the accuracy of modal parameter identification of operational offshore wind turbines for clarity high energy noises are defined as those components with large amplitudes and their frequencies close to natural frequencies of tested structures the method is based on the fact that if high energy noise is extracted accurately and eliminated from the original signal the true signal in the remaining filtered part is relatively significant and can be easily identified accordingly therefore two issues must be carefully handled in the proposed method the first is how to ensure the accuracy of the extraction of high energy noise and the second is how to deal with a general form of the noise when it is not strictly limited to harmonic noise to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method a numerical signal with one high energy noisy component is used then an experimental offshore platform subject to a harmonic excitation is employed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method finally real sea test data from an offshore wind turbine in operating conditions is used to show the capacity and the potential application of the method for dealing with high energy noises 2 modal parameter identification based on interference reduction of high energy noises 2 1 mechanism between true signals and noises when a measured structural response y t is contaminated by high energy noise y h t it can be divided into three parts i e 1 y t m 1 n m y m t n 1 n n y n t h 1 n h y h t where y m t and y n t are the true signal and normal noise n m n n and n h are the number of y m t y n t and y h t respectively in eq 1 the reason for dividing the measured noise into two parts y h t and y n t is their amplitudes have a large difference i e the amplitude of y n t is relatively smaller than that of y m t which means these normal noises can be readily removed by using the truncated svd therefore eq 1 can be simplified as 2 y t y l a l l t y h a l l t l 1 n l y l t h 1 n h y h t where y l a l l t is a combination of all y m t and y n t and n l n m n n eq 2 clearly shows that if y l t can be obtained reasonably the accuracy of modal parameter identification will be significantly improved by replacing y t with y l t however isolating and eliminating the dominant component y h t becomes a significant challenge especially when y h t is not a purely harmonic component which mainly comes from the fact that the component corresponding to the dynamic properties of the structure is usually not a strict harmonic so for a linear structure its free vibration consists of the infinite mode components of which each one can be expressed by a complex exponential function a damped vibration therefore we can represent the dynamic response time history of the structure subject a hammer impact as 3 y t l 1 n l γ l e λ l t h 1 n h γ h e λ h t where λ l and λ h are both called poles γ l and γ h are corresponding residues denoting α the damping factor ω the frequency ϝ the amplitude and θ the initial phase eq 3 becomes 4 y t l 1 n l ϝ l e i θ l e α l i ω l t h 1 n h ϝ h e i θ h e α h i ω h t a special case is that the high energy noise y h t is a purely harmonic signal so eq 4 becomes 5 y t l 1 n l ϝ l e i θ l e α l i ω l t h 1 n h ϝ h cos ω h t θ h for simplification eq 3 and eq 5 can be further written as 6 y t n 1 n p γ n e λ n t where n p n l n h 2 2 estimation of poles and residues of interested component when measured data y t is obtained with an equally spaced interval δ t eq 6 can be written by 7 y t y k y k δ t n 1 p γ n λ n k where λ n e λ n δ t k 0 1 2 n 1 in theory eq 7 is the general solution of a p th order linear ordinary difference equation with coefficients b n which is expressed by 8 n 0 p b n y k n 0 for k 0 1 n p 1 let b p 1 the characteristic equation of eq 8 can be obtained 9 n 1 p b n λ n 0 and then one can get its equivalent matrix equation as follows 10 c b y where 11 c y 0 y 1 y p 1 y 1 y 2 y p y n p 1 y n p y n 2 12 b b 0 b 1 b p 1 t 13 y y p y p 1 y n 1 t to calculate parameters λ and γ in eq 7 three steps are included the first step is calculating coefficients b n from the equivalent matrix equation eq 10 then the poles can be estimated by solving the characteristic equation denote its roots as λ in eq 9 once poles are obtained then residues can be estimated from eq 7 2 3 iterative extraction and elimination of high energy component different from hu et al 2013 and liu et al 2016a b a new method of extracting and eliminating the high energy components y h t is proposed based on the idea that the amplitudes of the high energy components are often bigger than those of the true signals i e ϝ h ϝ l therefore if the high energy components can be accurately eliminated one by one the accuracy of y l t can be guaranteed and used to improve the accuracy of modal parameter identification however the method to extract and eliminate these components with enough accuracy still has to be determined to avoid ill conditioning of directly solving eq 9 the state space model is employed to estimate the poles λ n by constructing a hankel matrix as 14 h k β η y k y k 1 y k η 1 y k 1 y k 2 y k η y k β 1 y k β y k β η 2 β η where β and η are the selected row and column of h k respectively considering the fact that measured data y usually contains noises so eq 14 is divided into two parts based on the svd e g when k 0 one has 15 h 0 β η u β β s β η v η η t where u β β and v η η are two orthogonal matrices for the case of real matrix h 0 β η and s β η is a diagonal matrix in this study one notes that the model order which is denoted as m o is not very large theoretically m o 2 because only the most significant component in the measured signal y t is extracted at one time furthermore traditional wisdom shows that a square matrix of h k usually provides a good estimation of modal parameters li et al 2012 liu et al 2016a then a can be represented by 16 a s m o 1 2 u m o t h 1 v m o s m o 1 2 where h 1 is the truncated hankel matrix of eq 14 when k 1 in terms of the selected model order m o from eq 16 the eigenvalues of a can be calculated and the poles are 17 λ p ln λ p δ t thus the residues can also be estimated by substituting eq 17 into eq 7 with linear least squares procedures once eq 17 is obtained natural frequencies in hz can be expressed as 18 f p λ p 2 π where means absolute of a complex number to ensure the accuracy of extraction a criterion is established based on the l 2 norm of the difference between adjacent two model orders as 19 δ δ ν p 2 ν p m o 2 in which 20 ν p ϝ p δ ν p ν p m o 1 ν p m o and ν p m o is the estimated ν p when the model order is set as m o in eq 15 when δ is stable and reaches an expected accuracy indicating the estimated poles and residues corresponding to the most significant component are sufficiently accurate they are denoted as λ h 1 and γ h 1 respectively substituting the obtained λ h 1 and γ h 1 into eq 7 the first extracted noise the most significant component can be written as 21 y ˆ h k 1 γ h 1 e λ h 1 k δ t where λ h 1 and γ h 1 both appear in conjugate pairs let p 2 n h all the high energy harmonics can be extracted as 22 y ˆ h k a l l p 1 n h γ h p e λ h p k δ t from eq 2 the remaining portion of the signal with the high energy harmonic components eliminated can be obtained as 23 y ˆ l k a l l l 1 n l y ˆ l k y k y ˆ h k a l l eq 23 clearly shows the recalculated signal y ˆ l k a l l only contains the true signal and the normal noise by eliminating the high energy harmonic noise the signal to noise ratio is significantly improved for a better modal parameter identification 2 4 modal parameter identification based on elimination of high energy noises compared to traditional modal parameter identification the only difference of the proposed method is the original signal y k is replaced with the high energy noise eliminated y ˆ l k a l l similar to eq 17 the re estimated poles usually occur in complex conjugated pairs then one writes 24 λ c q λ c q ξ q ω q i ω q 1 ξ q 2 where ω q and ξ q are the undamped frequency and corresponding damping ratio of the q th mode from eq 24 one obtains 25 ω q λ c q and 26 ξ q re λ c q λ c q the detailed procedure for implementing the era or the ssi method can be found in juang 1994 juang and rechard 1985 peeters and roeck 1999 3 numerical studies signal with one high energy noisy component the purpose of this example is to present the detailed numerical procedure of the proposed method a signal with three components is synthesized by 27 y k n 1 3 b n e ξ n t k cos 2 π f n t k θ n and the parameters used in eq 27 are listed in table 1 based on previous definition of high energy noise the three components are as follows the mode at 2 1 hz that represents a high energy noisy component with the greatest amplitude 8 20 normal noise at 0 8 hz with the smallest amplitude of 1 5 and the true signal at 5 hz with an amplitude of 4 6 which is greater than the amplitude of the normal noise in the following study two scenarios are going to be investigated the first is that the high energy noisy component is a non harmonic signal to show the correctness and capability of the proposed method by comparing with the analytical results and the second is that the noisy component is a purely harmonic which means the fourier transform can be employed to eliminate this noisy component then comparisons can be made between the proposed method and the traditional fourier transform 3 1 scenario 1 extraction and elimination of non harmonic noise by using the proposed method the actual reason of assuming the high energy noise at 2 1 hz as a non harmonic one is to provide a universal technique for potential readers when they deal with their interested sources of marine noise comparing eq 27 to eq 2 the simulated signal y t green line in fig 2 a can be divided into two parts i e y l a l l t and y h a l l t which are plotted as blue and red lines with time interval δ t 0 01 s respectively with the sampled number of points 2048 the result of employing the fourier on the simulated signal y t is shown in fig 2 b the 2 1 hz component clearly has the highest energy among the three components one purpose of this numerical example is to extract this component and investigate the influence on model order determination since it is a key issue for modal parameter identification to extract and eliminate the high energy harmonic noise the extracting indicator ν p is calculated by using eq 20 to determine which component has the highest energy in detail ϝ p can be obtained from the results of the fft as shown in fig 2 b where ν p ϝ p 6 7442 and p 1 the case of multiple high energy noises will be studied in the next example by comparing the computed amplitude ϝ p 6 7442 from the fft with the amplitude in table 1 which is 8 2 there is an obvious difference between the two values the theoretical reason for this discrepancy is that the combined signal y k is not a purely harmonic composed signal which violates the assumption of utilizing the fft and is only used to determine the sequence of components in terms of energy substituting the combined signal y k in eq 11 the singular values are obtained and the normalized result is shown as the red line in fig 3 a significant decrease after model order m o 6 is shown in fig 3 which is consistent with the theoretical result that the model order is twice the number of modes of the system here the system refers to the original signal y k from fig 3 one can also conclude that the model order m o should be greater than 4 for traditional modal parameter identification methods such as ssi or era to ensure the true signal at a frequency of 5 hz can be obtained for example if m o 2 the only identified modal parameters correspond to the high energy noise which is not desired contrasting traditional modal parameter identification methods that have to identify high energy noise the proposed method first extracts and eliminates the high energy noise to ensure the true signals are relatively significant in this example we set m o 2 to investigate whether noise at 2 1 hz can be extracted effectively by utilizing eq 16 with model order m o 2 a 0 9913 0 1315 0 1315 0 9909 then the estimated poles λ p are λ p ln z p δ t 0 0216 13 1929 i and the residues γ p 3 5906 2 1224 i from eq 7 by substituting the estimated values of λ p and γ p into eq 21 a comparison between the extracted noise and the analytical signal is shown in fig 4 which includes the relative errors plotted as the green line from fig 4 the extracted component and analytical component are in good agreement despite using a model order m o 2 as expected if model order m o 4 is used the accuracy of extraction is improved furthermore based on the relationship of γ p ϝ p e i θ p the amplitude of the extracted component at a frequency of 2 1 hz can be obtained when different model orders are used i e ϝ p 8 3418 when m o 2 and ϝ p 8 2621 when m o 4 then the factor δ 0 96 from eq 19 can be used as a threshold for controlling the accuracy of high energy noise extraction recalculate the singular values in σ by substituting the remained signal y l a l l t in eq 11 the normalized singular values are shown as the blue line in fig 3 from fig 3 there are two significant drops the first corresponds to the true signal at 5 hz and the second corresponds to the normal noise at 0 8 hz which means the true signal becomes the most significant for modal parameter identification one should note that the preset three frequencies in table 1 are not so close the actual reason of doing that is to avoid using high sampling frequency in the following comparison with the traditional fourier transform readers can change values of f in table 1 and will find consistent conclusions 3 2 scenario 2 comparison of the proposed method with the fourier transform because the fourier transform has long been recognized as a very effective technique in signal processing one may predict that implementing the fft could perform better in the high energy extraction to show the capacity of the proposed method the fft will be used to extract the high energy noise at frequency of 2 1 hz one should note that the fourier transform is based on a harmonic model which employs predetermined frequencies to decompose a signal into a series of harmonic components so the damping factor ξ in table 1 is set to be 0 similar to fig 2 a time interval δ t of 0 01 s is used and the sampled number of points is 1024 which means the frequency resolution is 0 0977 hz employing the fft on eq 27 with the above parameters the amplitudes of the synthesized signal y t can be obtained because the noise at a frequency of 2 1 hz is the most significant the maximum amplitudes can be set to 0 and the remained signal y l a l l t can be easily obtained by using the inverse fft therefore the extracted high energy noise can be obtained by y t y l a l l t as shown in fig 5 also includes a comparison with the analytical results and results from the proposed method which reveals an opposite conclusion to the previous prediction the primary reason is that a fourier series is based on a periodic assumption where each component has a preset frequency which is an integer times the fundamental frequency 0 0977 hz in other words since the noise has a frequency of 2 1 hz the leakage issue will be more serious when implementing the fft to further investigate this explanation the number of points can be changed to 2048 to improve the frequency resolution from 0 0977 hz to 0 0488 hz using the same process that yields fig 5 the extracted signal by using the fft with a frequency resolution of 0 0488 hz is shown in fig 6 a which shows a good agreement to investigate the accuracy of high energy noise extraction by using the fft or the proposed method relative errors are calculated compared with the analytical result as shown in fig 6 b the proposed method outperforms the fft when the frequency resolution is not properly determined 4 experimental study an offshore platform excited by a harmonic force a five layered three dimensional steel offshore platform is used to further study the effectiveness of the proposed method the experimental structure was rigidly fixed on the ground with bolts the height of the structure is 2 5 m with a 400 mm 300 mm 12 mm plate on the top to simulate the upside structure and the dimensions of the bottom is 700 mm 500 mm the structure was established by using steel tubes i e 22 mm 2 2 mm section for 4 legs and 12 mm 1 6 mm section for other braces 48 members to simulate the interference of high energy noise a harmonic excitation with a period of 0 1 s and an amplitude of 0 3 g was imposed on the structure which was implemented by a vibration shaker as shown in fig 7 twelve accelerometers meas 4803a 0002 were installed to measure the dynamic response of the structure a recorded signal with a sampling frequency of 500 hz is shown in fig 8 which shows an obvious excitation interference at integer times 10 hz 4 1 modal parameter identification using impulse response function because the converter in fig 7 will provide a lateral constraint which implies that the stiffness in some correlated directions will be affected considering the difficulty of determining the caused stiffness modal parameters of this structure without the mentioned lateral constraint should be obtained firstly and aims at providing references for determining interested parameters of the structure with the lateral harmonic excitation thus an impulsive load by using a hammer is applied and the corresponding acceleration signals for about 30 s with sampling rate 500 hz are recorded fig 9 shows the recorded accelerations in the three directions by sensors 1 to 3 in the following study only the segment between 6 and 10 s with 2001 sample points would be taken for later analysis to obtain reliable results all the sensors will be used in the following modal parameter identification i e there are 54 signals in different directions altogether and the era will be used because it is based on the state space model and the input is assumed as an impulse during the implementation of era the model order is set to 200 here the reason of using this value is based on multiple trials to obtain the first three modal parameters at the same time the dimension of the hankel matrix used in implementing era is 54 000 1001 in which the row number 54 000 comes from 1000 blocks with the dimension of 1000 1001 the estimated first three frequencies and corresponding damping ratios are listed in table 2 and the reason of judging the estimated three modal parameters are the first three is based on the identified mode shapes as shown in fig 10 which is in a good agreement with the theoretical results from table 2 a conclusion can be drawn that the frequency in the lateral constraint direction will be greater than 15 6136 hz due to the increasing stiffness while the second frequency may not be greater because the two directions are orthogonal the values in table 2 can be used as a reference for determining the modal parameters of the structure fig 7 4 2 modal parameter identification using raw data with high energy noise interference in this study the measured accelerations of sensor 1 fig 8 have a total signal length of 5001 points consider the fact that the input is not an impulse so the ssi method will be used because it is based on the stochastic subspace model note that selecting the size of the constructed hankel matrix for the ssi method is not arbitrary but requires careful selection based on multiple trials in this example a size of selection 1250 2502 for the hankel matrix was found to identify more modes with better estimated values based on eqs 26 and 24 the estimated frequencies as the model order increases from 50 to 300 can be determined as shown in fig 11 according to the conventional wisdom that only true modes can be stabilized as the model order increases one could conclude that frequencies near 20 hz and 30 hz are the true modes however comparing the modal results from ssi with those from era associated with the impulse loading test one might conclude otherwise actually by referring to table 2 the frequency stabilized at 16 8 hz is the first frequency of the restrained structure which also matches the previous prediction that the frequency in the lateral constraint direction should be a slightly greater than the value in table 2 in addition the estimated corresponding damping ratio is shown in fig 12 which shows the first order frequency stabilizes when the model order reaches 120 additionally it is much more difficult to identify the second mode including the frequency and its damping ratio 4 3 modal parameter identification using remained data after noise elimination in this section two questions will be further studied 1 what is the advantage of the proposed method compared to the prony ss method and 2 can the identification of modal parameters be improved when the filtered data by extracting high energy noises is used 4 3 1 comparison of the proposed method to the prony ss according to hu et al 2013 a first order matrix homogeneous difference equation is used to replace the high order homogeneous difference equation to achieve better numerical conditioning signal decomposition by substituting the measured accelerations of sensor 1 into eq 11 and calculating the roots of the characteristic equation of eq 10 by using the state space model the corresponding residues can be obtained in terms of eq 7 the calculated coefficient of determinate between the original signal and reconstructed signal is shown in fig 13 fig 13 shows the coefficient of determinant stabilizes when the model order is bigger than 80 which implies the original signal could be efficiently decomposed into 40 components to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed signal a model order of 100 will be used when implementing the prony ss method a comparison between the original signal and reconstructed signal is shown in fig 14 which shows good consistency but with slight differences in contrast to the prony ss method which decomposes the original signal into a series of components at one time the proposed method iteratively extracts the most significant component one by one for direct comparison with the prony ss method 50 components will be extracted iteratively by setting a constant model order of 40 and the residuals from prony ss and the approach are calculated as shown in fig 15 here the residuals are calculated by using the subtraction between the original signal and the reconstructed signal from fig 15 the proposed method has a small residual compared to the prony ss which means the approach can provide better signal decomposition and reconstruction 4 3 2 modal parameter identification after relative high energy noise elimination the estimation of modal parameters especially damping ratios can be significantly improved if filtered signals rather than the measured signals are utilized therefore a frequency range will be assigned to cover the targeted modes of the structure e g the first three modes are usually required for model updating or damage detection and the first mode is often used to assess the dynamic performance of the structure during the design stage referring to table 2 a frequency range of 15 to 32 hz is used in the following study however high energy noise near 20 hz and 30 hz is in the assigned frequency range which implies these high energy noises cannot be eliminated completely even by employing traditional band filtering techniques different from traditional band filtering techniques the proposed method employs two steps to eliminate the relatively high energy noises the first step is using the assigned frequency range for band filtering and the second step is based on the implementation of noise extraction to eliminate the expected high energy noise to make a comparison with figs 11 and 12 50 components will be extracted iteratively by setting a constant model order of 40 and the components whose frequencies are not in the assigned range will be removed then the two high energy noises near 20 hz and 30 hz will be extracted sequentially to obtain the modal parameters of the structure with the lateral constraint a time series of all the sensors is used and the arguments used to obtain figs 11 and 12 are unchanged the estimated frequencies and corresponding damping ratios with an increasing model order are shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively comparing figs 16 and 17 to figs 11 and 12 one can draw the flowing conclusions 1 the second mode could be identified because of the elimination of high energy noises i e it is 19 9836 hz which can be demonstrated by mode shapes as shown in fig 10 and 2 accuracy of identified damping ratios can be improved significantly for example the discrete coefficient of damping ratios is reduced from 0 3701 to 0 2611 5 field test study an offshore wind turbine in the yellow sea in practical engineering the interference of high energy noise on modal parameter identification can be very serious so the performance of the proposed method is also investigated using real measurements the offshore wind turbine used in this analysis is located in the yellow sea area of china whose foundation is in the form of a pile structure with a diameter of 5 5 m the pipe is fixed in the seabed with a penetration depth of 50 35 m the height from the seabed to the fixed flange is 22 65 m the turbine tower has a total height of 86 m and a total weight of 2500 tons the three bladed direct drive wind turbine generator has a rated power of 4 0 mw and a blade length of 88 m to collect vibration data of the wind turbine structure in the x and y directions at each position two tri axial acceleration sensors are installed in the inwall of the turbine tower at a height of 45 m and a distance to the flange of 75 m as shown in fig 18 the type of acceleration sensor is model 4630 005 060 c with measure range 5g and voltage sensitivity 400 mv g the used data acquisition instrument is cronosflex 400 by imcaccess co ltd with the natural excitation of the structure the corresponding acceleration data is recorded at a sampling rate of 100 hz when the wind turbine structure is operating one hour of acceleration response data of sensor 1 and sensor 2 in the x direction is shown in fig 18 from the time domain figure the amplitude of the acceleration vibration changes at different times because the wind and wave loads vary with time to analyze the modal parameters of the wind turbine structure from the collected acceleration data a stable duration should be selected the duration from 900 s to 1000 s is relatively stable in fig 18 and is chosen to conduct the following analysis frequency spectrum analysis is a simple method to obtain the frequency components of a time domain signal preliminarily by using the fourier transform the time history and spectrum of the duration from 900 s to 1000 s of sensor 1 and sensor 2 in the x direction are shown in fig 19 six peaks are present in the spectra curve with frequencies of almost 0 40 hz 0 80 hz 1 20 hz 1 60 hz 2 00 hz and 2 39 hz the frequencies at the peaks are multiples of 0 4 hz corresponding to 3p frequency of the offshore wind turbine which means the rotating speed of blades is about 8 rpm the frequency divisions occupy the dominant energy of the signal which results in the intrinsic modal information drowning in the periodic signal to further detail the influence of harmonic excitation on modal identification the duration at sensor 1 is selected to extract the modal parameters using stochastic subspace identification ssi the true model order of the wind turbine structure is usually difficult to determine which is inconvenient for modal identification to solve the problem a way similar to stability diagram method is implemented in this paper the model orders ranging from 50 to 300 with an interval of 50 are adopted when modal parameters estimated using ssi the identified frequencies versus model orders are exhibited in fig 20 which shows that the identified stable frequencies are near 0 4 hz 0 8 hz 1 2 hz and 2 4 hz the true modal of wind turbine structure are drawing the harmonic components which could not be extracted using traditional ssi the proposed method is applied to manage the influence of harmonic components the order is set equal to 80 and 100 components and are extracted using the proposed method to remove the adverse effect of the harmonic components on modal identification the frequency multiplication components of 0 4 hz in the 100 components extracted are eliminated implementing a fourier transform on the signal to eliminate the harmonic components the frequency spectra of sensor 1 and sensor 2 are shown in fig 21 compared with fig 19 the high energy harmonic components are eliminated using the same method to identify the modal parameter of the eliminated signal based on ssi the modal frequencies and damping ratios versus model orders are shown in fig 22 and fig 23 the identified frequencies of different sensor are stable around 0 36 hz and corresponding damping ratios are stale as well taking results of finite element model into account the first order frequency is 0 3202 hz which can provide a useful reference to true modal parameters identification actually the identified frequency is 0 3592 hz and the corresponding damping ratio is 0 0151 when the order is set as 200 using ssi to filtered signal of sensor 1 in x direction due to the lack of the true values for modal frequencies of the structure examining the agreement among the modal frequencies estimated from different signals seems to be the best way to evaluate the estimation performance therefore data from sensor 2 in x direction is also used and the identified frequency is 0 3596 hz and the corresponding damping ratio is 0 0272 with the same identifying parameters one can find that results from the two sensors agree with each other well 6 conclusions based on signal decomposition a high energy noise extraction method was proposed to make poorly excited true modes relatively significant so they can be stably identified the approach was achieved by dividing the original signal into three parts i e the true signal the normal noise and the high energy noise the specialty of the method is that each part is represented by complex exponentials the reason for employing complex exponentials is that noise in the original signal will have a universal form i e purely harmonic damped harmonic or purely damped exponential components meaning the noise in the measured signal is not limited to only machine caused noise different from traditional low pass or band pass filtering an iterative procedure was developed for the proposed method by extracting noisy components one by one to ensure the true signals buried in the original signal are not incorrectly eliminated to demonstrate and investigate the performance of the proposed method three examples were used the first example is a numerical signal with one high energy noisy component in which two scenarios non harmonic and harmonic noise were studied numerical results show that the noisy component can be accurately extracted whether or not it is harmonic the second example is a three dimensional steel offshore platform which was fixed on the ground to simulate the interference of high energy noise a harmonic excitation with a period of 0 1 s and an amplitude of 0 3 g was imposed on the structure experimental results indicated that when measured raw data are used only the first mode can be identified if filtered data are used by employing the proposed method the first two modes can be identified with improved damping ratio estimation finally sea test data from an offshore wind turbine in operating conditions was used a more serious problem occurred that no reasonable modal parameters could be obtained by employing the ssi method if the raw measured data was used even when the used model order reaches 300 but the first mode can be identified i e a frequency of 0 3592 hz and a damping ratio of 0 0151 by using the proposed method acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support of the national natural science foundation of china

22774,an iterative noise extraction and elimination method is proposed to solve the difficulty of modal parameter identification caused by contaminated high energy components in measured signals the approach is based on the idea that if only the high energy noise is extracted and eliminated accurately modal parameter identification can be improved significantly by using the remaining filtered signal a theoretical development is that a general form of noises is considered i e they can be purely harmonic or damped which implies noises from machine vibration or other unknown sources can be taken into account the advantage of this approach is that only one significant relatively noisy component is extracted at each iteration i e only the most reliable component is extracted each time so more accurate high energy noise elimination is expected to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method a numerical signal with one high energy noisy component is used numerical results show that the approach can extract and eliminate high energy noise at 2 1 hz accurately by setting a small model order a special case is the noisy component as a harmonic which means the traditional fourier transform can be applied however one can conclude that the proposed method outperforms the fourier transform due to its limitation of fixed frequency resolution to further investigate the effectiveness of the approach an experiment on a steel offshore platform is conducted and experimental results indicate that when measured raw data is used only the first mode can be identified if filtered data is used by employing the proposed method the first two modes can be identified with improved damping ratio estimation finally sea test data from an offshore wind turbine in operating conditions are used results show that the first mode with a frequency of 0 3592 hz and a damping ratio of 0 0151 are successfully identified while no reasonable parameters can be obtained by employing the stochastic subspace identification method even when the used model order reaches 300 keywords offshore wind turbine modal parameter identification signal extraction noise elimination high energy 1 introduction in recent decades offshore wind electricity generation has become one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy compared to onshore wind turbines these marine structures are exposed to much more serious external environmental loads including waves currents winds etc in other words maintenance and repair of these marine structures is much more difficult due to the difficulty of access referring to reference pierre et al 2014 operation and maintenance costs of a wind turbine can account for approximately 20 of the total cost therefore it is easy to understand why a structural health monitoring shm system is so important for ensuring structural safety and operational serviceability e g a better understanding of behavior of wind turbines under different environmental conditions ciang et al 2008 dong et al 2018 hu et al 2015 when designing a shm system for offshore wind turbines it is important to obtain dynamic responses of the whole structure by installing a number of sensors different types of sensors have been installed in wind turbines such as a number of accelerometers in the nacelle or on different levels of towers baqersad et al 2015 benedetti et al 2011 ozbek et al 2013 the reason sensors such as strain gauges are seldom used is that this technique usually causes additional damage to the protective paint different from the installation of strain gauges accelerometers can be quickly installed and removed by employing a magnetic base which has been demonstrated as a very effective method in ocean engineering liu et al 2015 from these sensors dynamic responses of the whole structure can be measured and used to extract its frequencies and corresponding damping ratios and even mode shapes the first order frequency often called the natural frequency is used to assess whether the measured resonance frequencies match the design assumptions accurate extraction of meaningful modal parameters from environment excited measured data often relies on techniques such as noise filtering model order determination modal parameter identification and so on in these techniques modal parameter identification plays an important role and has been termed the experimental modal analysis ema classical ema requires input and output information simultaneously and was later developed as a combination of vibration response and deterministic knowledge of input ewins 2000 in contrast without requiring the input modern output only modal identification methods only utilize response data and the term operational modal analysis oma has been adopted peeters and roeck 2001 note that although deterministic input knowledge is not required for output only methods these methods still require a mathematical assumption about the excitation properties which usually assumes the input satisfies a gaussian white noise random process the poly reference complex exponential prce and the eigen system realization algorithm era are currently the two most popular methods in classical ema and their difference lies in different models i e a high order polynomial model and a state space model juang 1994 juang and rechard 1985 for output only modal analysis the counterpart is the instrumental variable iv and the stochastic subspace identification ssi method which are based on the arma model and stochastic state space model peeters and roeck 1999 respectively applications of these in ocean engineering techniques can be found in references choi et al 2005 feng et al 2016 jin and xing 2007 liu et al 2014a b 2016b osgood 2001 park et al 2010 similar to offshore platforms or wave energy devices offshore wind turbines are subjected to continuous wind wave and current excitations however an obvious difference is that loads excitations originating from the rotor will have significant influence on the structural dynamics of offshore wind turbines a measured signal from an operating offshore wind turbine located in the yellow sea china is shown in fig 1 a with sampling frequency 100 hz and the result in frequency domain by using the fourier transform is shown in fig 1 b to exhibit clearly the spectrum of frequency below 3 hz is plotted from fig 1 b unwanted high energy components due to oscillation of the blades generators or nacelle can be observed they are an integer times the frequency almost 0 4 hz close to and very significant compared with expected fundamental frequency normally near 0 3 hz theoretically extracting the modal parameters of offshore wind turbines is not different from other types of offshore structures however when applying traditional modal parameter identification methods to measured data such as fig 1 one can conclude that high energy components fake modes are the easiest to be identified which not only opposes to the traditional concept of modal parameter identification but also raises a much more serious issue reasonable modes cannot be identified due to the interference of the high energy components one possible method of identifying expected true modes is by increasing the model order to estimate increasingly more modal modes the theoretical foundation of this method is based on the fact that active modes buried in the measured data will stabilize only when a low model order is used while poorly excited modes may not stabilize even by setting a high model order in addition utilizing a high model order cannot always ensure proper identification of true modes since it depends on the level of signal to noise and is also a data dependent problem another method of identifying the true modes buried in high energy noise is by noise filtering as a preprocessing step such as a low pass filter kalman filter kalman 1960 kalman and bucy 1961 etc however traditional wisdom shows that a priori bandwidth should be known before low pass filters are used and adjusting the kalman filter has be carefully considered when the accuracy of the measurement instrument and the model of the system are not determined properly jwo and chang 2008 sanliturk and cakar 2005 proposed a noise elimination method by employing the singular value decomposition svd technique to improve the quality of measured data the results from hu et al 2010 show that it is also very difficult to identify poorly excited modes compared with some noisy ones during the estimation of modal parameters from noisy impulse response function irf recently liu et al 2016a presented a new modal parameter identification method and applied the method to offshore structures although the modal parameter identification method performed well for offshore platforms it faces the difficulty of interference of high energy noise when a rough pole window is assigned in the second step this paper proposes a one by one high energy noise extraction and elimination method for improving the accuracy of modal parameter identification of operational offshore wind turbines for clarity high energy noises are defined as those components with large amplitudes and their frequencies close to natural frequencies of tested structures the method is based on the fact that if high energy noise is extracted accurately and eliminated from the original signal the true signal in the remaining filtered part is relatively significant and can be easily identified accordingly therefore two issues must be carefully handled in the proposed method the first is how to ensure the accuracy of the extraction of high energy noise and the second is how to deal with a general form of the noise when it is not strictly limited to harmonic noise to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method a numerical signal with one high energy noisy component is used then an experimental offshore platform subject to a harmonic excitation is employed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method finally real sea test data from an offshore wind turbine in operating conditions is used to show the capacity and the potential application of the method for dealing with high energy noises 2 modal parameter identification based on interference reduction of high energy noises 2 1 mechanism between true signals and noises when a measured structural response y t is contaminated by high energy noise y h t it can be divided into three parts i e 1 y t m 1 n m y m t n 1 n n y n t h 1 n h y h t where y m t and y n t are the true signal and normal noise n m n n and n h are the number of y m t y n t and y h t respectively in eq 1 the reason for dividing the measured noise into two parts y h t and y n t is their amplitudes have a large difference i e the amplitude of y n t is relatively smaller than that of y m t which means these normal noises can be readily removed by using the truncated svd therefore eq 1 can be simplified as 2 y t y l a l l t y h a l l t l 1 n l y l t h 1 n h y h t where y l a l l t is a combination of all y m t and y n t and n l n m n n eq 2 clearly shows that if y l t can be obtained reasonably the accuracy of modal parameter identification will be significantly improved by replacing y t with y l t however isolating and eliminating the dominant component y h t becomes a significant challenge especially when y h t is not a purely harmonic component which mainly comes from the fact that the component corresponding to the dynamic properties of the structure is usually not a strict harmonic so for a linear structure its free vibration consists of the infinite mode components of which each one can be expressed by a complex exponential function a damped vibration therefore we can represent the dynamic response time history of the structure subject a hammer impact as 3 y t l 1 n l γ l e λ l t h 1 n h γ h e λ h t where λ l and λ h are both called poles γ l and γ h are corresponding residues denoting α the damping factor ω the frequency ϝ the amplitude and θ the initial phase eq 3 becomes 4 y t l 1 n l ϝ l e i θ l e α l i ω l t h 1 n h ϝ h e i θ h e α h i ω h t a special case is that the high energy noise y h t is a purely harmonic signal so eq 4 becomes 5 y t l 1 n l ϝ l e i θ l e α l i ω l t h 1 n h ϝ h cos ω h t θ h for simplification eq 3 and eq 5 can be further written as 6 y t n 1 n p γ n e λ n t where n p n l n h 2 2 estimation of poles and residues of interested component when measured data y t is obtained with an equally spaced interval δ t eq 6 can be written by 7 y t y k y k δ t n 1 p γ n λ n k where λ n e λ n δ t k 0 1 2 n 1 in theory eq 7 is the general solution of a p th order linear ordinary difference equation with coefficients b n which is expressed by 8 n 0 p b n y k n 0 for k 0 1 n p 1 let b p 1 the characteristic equation of eq 8 can be obtained 9 n 1 p b n λ n 0 and then one can get its equivalent matrix equation as follows 10 c b y where 11 c y 0 y 1 y p 1 y 1 y 2 y p y n p 1 y n p y n 2 12 b b 0 b 1 b p 1 t 13 y y p y p 1 y n 1 t to calculate parameters λ and γ in eq 7 three steps are included the first step is calculating coefficients b n from the equivalent matrix equation eq 10 then the poles can be estimated by solving the characteristic equation denote its roots as λ in eq 9 once poles are obtained then residues can be estimated from eq 7 2 3 iterative extraction and elimination of high energy component different from hu et al 2013 and liu et al 2016a b a new method of extracting and eliminating the high energy components y h t is proposed based on the idea that the amplitudes of the high energy components are often bigger than those of the true signals i e ϝ h ϝ l therefore if the high energy components can be accurately eliminated one by one the accuracy of y l t can be guaranteed and used to improve the accuracy of modal parameter identification however the method to extract and eliminate these components with enough accuracy still has to be determined to avoid ill conditioning of directly solving eq 9 the state space model is employed to estimate the poles λ n by constructing a hankel matrix as 14 h k β η y k y k 1 y k η 1 y k 1 y k 2 y k η y k β 1 y k β y k β η 2 β η where β and η are the selected row and column of h k respectively considering the fact that measured data y usually contains noises so eq 14 is divided into two parts based on the svd e g when k 0 one has 15 h 0 β η u β β s β η v η η t where u β β and v η η are two orthogonal matrices for the case of real matrix h 0 β η and s β η is a diagonal matrix in this study one notes that the model order which is denoted as m o is not very large theoretically m o 2 because only the most significant component in the measured signal y t is extracted at one time furthermore traditional wisdom shows that a square matrix of h k usually provides a good estimation of modal parameters li et al 2012 liu et al 2016a then a can be represented by 16 a s m o 1 2 u m o t h 1 v m o s m o 1 2 where h 1 is the truncated hankel matrix of eq 14 when k 1 in terms of the selected model order m o from eq 16 the eigenvalues of a can be calculated and the poles are 17 λ p ln λ p δ t thus the residues can also be estimated by substituting eq 17 into eq 7 with linear least squares procedures once eq 17 is obtained natural frequencies in hz can be expressed as 18 f p λ p 2 π where means absolute of a complex number to ensure the accuracy of extraction a criterion is established based on the l 2 norm of the difference between adjacent two model orders as 19 δ δ ν p 2 ν p m o 2 in which 20 ν p ϝ p δ ν p ν p m o 1 ν p m o and ν p m o is the estimated ν p when the model order is set as m o in eq 15 when δ is stable and reaches an expected accuracy indicating the estimated poles and residues corresponding to the most significant component are sufficiently accurate they are denoted as λ h 1 and γ h 1 respectively substituting the obtained λ h 1 and γ h 1 into eq 7 the first extracted noise the most significant component can be written as 21 y ˆ h k 1 γ h 1 e λ h 1 k δ t where λ h 1 and γ h 1 both appear in conjugate pairs let p 2 n h all the high energy harmonics can be extracted as 22 y ˆ h k a l l p 1 n h γ h p e λ h p k δ t from eq 2 the remaining portion of the signal with the high energy harmonic components eliminated can be obtained as 23 y ˆ l k a l l l 1 n l y ˆ l k y k y ˆ h k a l l eq 23 clearly shows the recalculated signal y ˆ l k a l l only contains the true signal and the normal noise by eliminating the high energy harmonic noise the signal to noise ratio is significantly improved for a better modal parameter identification 2 4 modal parameter identification based on elimination of high energy noises compared to traditional modal parameter identification the only difference of the proposed method is the original signal y k is replaced with the high energy noise eliminated y ˆ l k a l l similar to eq 17 the re estimated poles usually occur in complex conjugated pairs then one writes 24 λ c q λ c q ξ q ω q i ω q 1 ξ q 2 where ω q and ξ q are the undamped frequency and corresponding damping ratio of the q th mode from eq 24 one obtains 25 ω q λ c q and 26 ξ q re λ c q λ c q the detailed procedure for implementing the era or the ssi method can be found in juang 1994 juang and rechard 1985 peeters and roeck 1999 3 numerical studies signal with one high energy noisy component the purpose of this example is to present the detailed numerical procedure of the proposed method a signal with three components is synthesized by 27 y k n 1 3 b n e ξ n t k cos 2 π f n t k θ n and the parameters used in eq 27 are listed in table 1 based on previous definition of high energy noise the three components are as follows the mode at 2 1 hz that represents a high energy noisy component with the greatest amplitude 8 20 normal noise at 0 8 hz with the smallest amplitude of 1 5 and the true signal at 5 hz with an amplitude of 4 6 which is greater than the amplitude of the normal noise in the following study two scenarios are going to be investigated the first is that the high energy noisy component is a non harmonic signal to show the correctness and capability of the proposed method by comparing with the analytical results and the second is that the noisy component is a purely harmonic which means the fourier transform can be employed to eliminate this noisy component then comparisons can be made between the proposed method and the traditional fourier transform 3 1 scenario 1 extraction and elimination of non harmonic noise by using the proposed method the actual reason of assuming the high energy noise at 2 1 hz as a non harmonic one is to provide a universal technique for potential readers when they deal with their interested sources of marine noise comparing eq 27 to eq 2 the simulated signal y t green line in fig 2 a can be divided into two parts i e y l a l l t and y h a l l t which are plotted as blue and red lines with time interval δ t 0 01 s respectively with the sampled number of points 2048 the result of employing the fourier on the simulated signal y t is shown in fig 2 b the 2 1 hz component clearly has the highest energy among the three components one purpose of this numerical example is to extract this component and investigate the influence on model order determination since it is a key issue for modal parameter identification to extract and eliminate the high energy harmonic noise the extracting indicator ν p is calculated by using eq 20 to determine which component has the highest energy in detail ϝ p can be obtained from the results of the fft as shown in fig 2 b where ν p ϝ p 6 7442 and p 1 the case of multiple high energy noises will be studied in the next example by comparing the computed amplitude ϝ p 6 7442 from the fft with the amplitude in table 1 which is 8 2 there is an obvious difference between the two values the theoretical reason for this discrepancy is that the combined signal y k is not a purely harmonic composed signal which violates the assumption of utilizing the fft and is only used to determine the sequence of components in terms of energy substituting the combined signal y k in eq 11 the singular values are obtained and the normalized result is shown as the red line in fig 3 a significant decrease after model order m o 6 is shown in fig 3 which is consistent with the theoretical result that the model order is twice the number of modes of the system here the system refers to the original signal y k from fig 3 one can also conclude that the model order m o should be greater than 4 for traditional modal parameter identification methods such as ssi or era to ensure the true signal at a frequency of 5 hz can be obtained for example if m o 2 the only identified modal parameters correspond to the high energy noise which is not desired contrasting traditional modal parameter identification methods that have to identify high energy noise the proposed method first extracts and eliminates the high energy noise to ensure the true signals are relatively significant in this example we set m o 2 to investigate whether noise at 2 1 hz can be extracted effectively by utilizing eq 16 with model order m o 2 a 0 9913 0 1315 0 1315 0 9909 then the estimated poles λ p are λ p ln z p δ t 0 0216 13 1929 i and the residues γ p 3 5906 2 1224 i from eq 7 by substituting the estimated values of λ p and γ p into eq 21 a comparison between the extracted noise and the analytical signal is shown in fig 4 which includes the relative errors plotted as the green line from fig 4 the extracted component and analytical component are in good agreement despite using a model order m o 2 as expected if model order m o 4 is used the accuracy of extraction is improved furthermore based on the relationship of γ p ϝ p e i θ p the amplitude of the extracted component at a frequency of 2 1 hz can be obtained when different model orders are used i e ϝ p 8 3418 when m o 2 and ϝ p 8 2621 when m o 4 then the factor δ 0 96 from eq 19 can be used as a threshold for controlling the accuracy of high energy noise extraction recalculate the singular values in σ by substituting the remained signal y l a l l t in eq 11 the normalized singular values are shown as the blue line in fig 3 from fig 3 there are two significant drops the first corresponds to the true signal at 5 hz and the second corresponds to the normal noise at 0 8 hz which means the true signal becomes the most significant for modal parameter identification one should note that the preset three frequencies in table 1 are not so close the actual reason of doing that is to avoid using high sampling frequency in the following comparison with the traditional fourier transform readers can change values of f in table 1 and will find consistent conclusions 3 2 scenario 2 comparison of the proposed method with the fourier transform because the fourier transform has long been recognized as a very effective technique in signal processing one may predict that implementing the fft could perform better in the high energy extraction to show the capacity of the proposed method the fft will be used to extract the high energy noise at frequency of 2 1 hz one should note that the fourier transform is based on a harmonic model which employs predetermined frequencies to decompose a signal into a series of harmonic components so the damping factor ξ in table 1 is set to be 0 similar to fig 2 a time interval δ t of 0 01 s is used and the sampled number of points is 1024 which means the frequency resolution is 0 0977 hz employing the fft on eq 27 with the above parameters the amplitudes of the synthesized signal y t can be obtained because the noise at a frequency of 2 1 hz is the most significant the maximum amplitudes can be set to 0 and the remained signal y l a l l t can be easily obtained by using the inverse fft therefore the extracted high energy noise can be obtained by y t y l a l l t as shown in fig 5 also includes a comparison with the analytical results and results from the proposed method which reveals an opposite conclusion to the previous prediction the primary reason is that a fourier series is based on a periodic assumption where each component has a preset frequency which is an integer times the fundamental frequency 0 0977 hz in other words since the noise has a frequency of 2 1 hz the leakage issue will be more serious when implementing the fft to further investigate this explanation the number of points can be changed to 2048 to improve the frequency resolution from 0 0977 hz to 0 0488 hz using the same process that yields fig 5 the extracted signal by using the fft with a frequency resolution of 0 0488 hz is shown in fig 6 a which shows a good agreement to investigate the accuracy of high energy noise extraction by using the fft or the proposed method relative errors are calculated compared with the analytical result as shown in fig 6 b the proposed method outperforms the fft when the frequency resolution is not properly determined 4 experimental study an offshore platform excited by a harmonic force a five layered three dimensional steel offshore platform is used to further study the effectiveness of the proposed method the experimental structure was rigidly fixed on the ground with bolts the height of the structure is 2 5 m with a 400 mm 300 mm 12 mm plate on the top to simulate the upside structure and the dimensions of the bottom is 700 mm 500 mm the structure was established by using steel tubes i e 22 mm 2 2 mm section for 4 legs and 12 mm 1 6 mm section for other braces 48 members to simulate the interference of high energy noise a harmonic excitation with a period of 0 1 s and an amplitude of 0 3 g was imposed on the structure which was implemented by a vibration shaker as shown in fig 7 twelve accelerometers meas 4803a 0002 were installed to measure the dynamic response of the structure a recorded signal with a sampling frequency of 500 hz is shown in fig 8 which shows an obvious excitation interference at integer times 10 hz 4 1 modal parameter identification using impulse response function because the converter in fig 7 will provide a lateral constraint which implies that the stiffness in some correlated directions will be affected considering the difficulty of determining the caused stiffness modal parameters of this structure without the mentioned lateral constraint should be obtained firstly and aims at providing references for determining interested parameters of the structure with the lateral harmonic excitation thus an impulsive load by using a hammer is applied and the corresponding acceleration signals for about 30 s with sampling rate 500 hz are recorded fig 9 shows the recorded accelerations in the three directions by sensors 1 to 3 in the following study only the segment between 6 and 10 s with 2001 sample points would be taken for later analysis to obtain reliable results all the sensors will be used in the following modal parameter identification i e there are 54 signals in different directions altogether and the era will be used because it is based on the state space model and the input is assumed as an impulse during the implementation of era the model order is set to 200 here the reason of using this value is based on multiple trials to obtain the first three modal parameters at the same time the dimension of the hankel matrix used in implementing era is 54 000 1001 in which the row number 54 000 comes from 1000 blocks with the dimension of 1000 1001 the estimated first three frequencies and corresponding damping ratios are listed in table 2 and the reason of judging the estimated three modal parameters are the first three is based on the identified mode shapes as shown in fig 10 which is in a good agreement with the theoretical results from table 2 a conclusion can be drawn that the frequency in the lateral constraint direction will be greater than 15 6136 hz due to the increasing stiffness while the second frequency may not be greater because the two directions are orthogonal the values in table 2 can be used as a reference for determining the modal parameters of the structure fig 7 4 2 modal parameter identification using raw data with high energy noise interference in this study the measured accelerations of sensor 1 fig 8 have a total signal length of 5001 points consider the fact that the input is not an impulse so the ssi method will be used because it is based on the stochastic subspace model note that selecting the size of the constructed hankel matrix for the ssi method is not arbitrary but requires careful selection based on multiple trials in this example a size of selection 1250 2502 for the hankel matrix was found to identify more modes with better estimated values based on eqs 26 and 24 the estimated frequencies as the model order increases from 50 to 300 can be determined as shown in fig 11 according to the conventional wisdom that only true modes can be stabilized as the model order increases one could conclude that frequencies near 20 hz and 30 hz are the true modes however comparing the modal results from ssi with those from era associated with the impulse loading test one might conclude otherwise actually by referring to table 2 the frequency stabilized at 16 8 hz is the first frequency of the restrained structure which also matches the previous prediction that the frequency in the lateral constraint direction should be a slightly greater than the value in table 2 in addition the estimated corresponding damping ratio is shown in fig 12 which shows the first order frequency stabilizes when the model order reaches 120 additionally it is much more difficult to identify the second mode including the frequency and its damping ratio 4 3 modal parameter identification using remained data after noise elimination in this section two questions will be further studied 1 what is the advantage of the proposed method compared to the prony ss method and 2 can the identification of modal parameters be improved when the filtered data by extracting high energy noises is used 4 3 1 comparison of the proposed method to the prony ss according to hu et al 2013 a first order matrix homogeneous difference equation is used to replace the high order homogeneous difference equation to achieve better numerical conditioning signal decomposition by substituting the measured accelerations of sensor 1 into eq 11 and calculating the roots of the characteristic equation of eq 10 by using the state space model the corresponding residues can be obtained in terms of eq 7 the calculated coefficient of determinate between the original signal and reconstructed signal is shown in fig 13 fig 13 shows the coefficient of determinant stabilizes when the model order is bigger than 80 which implies the original signal could be efficiently decomposed into 40 components to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed signal a model order of 100 will be used when implementing the prony ss method a comparison between the original signal and reconstructed signal is shown in fig 14 which shows good consistency but with slight differences in contrast to the prony ss method which decomposes the original signal into a series of components at one time the proposed method iteratively extracts the most significant component one by one for direct comparison with the prony ss method 50 components will be extracted iteratively by setting a constant model order of 40 and the residuals from prony ss and the approach are calculated as shown in fig 15 here the residuals are calculated by using the subtraction between the original signal and the reconstructed signal from fig 15 the proposed method has a small residual compared to the prony ss which means the approach can provide better signal decomposition and reconstruction 4 3 2 modal parameter identification after relative high energy noise elimination the estimation of modal parameters especially damping ratios can be significantly improved if filtered signals rather than the measured signals are utilized therefore a frequency range will be assigned to cover the targeted modes of the structure e g the first three modes are usually required for model updating or damage detection and the first mode is often used to assess the dynamic performance of the structure during the design stage referring to table 2 a frequency range of 15 to 32 hz is used in the following study however high energy noise near 20 hz and 30 hz is in the assigned frequency range which implies these high energy noises cannot be eliminated completely even by employing traditional band filtering techniques different from traditional band filtering techniques the proposed method employs two steps to eliminate the relatively high energy noises the first step is using the assigned frequency range for band filtering and the second step is based on the implementation of noise extraction to eliminate the expected high energy noise to make a comparison with figs 11 and 12 50 components will be extracted iteratively by setting a constant model order of 40 and the components whose frequencies are not in the assigned range will be removed then the two high energy noises near 20 hz and 30 hz will be extracted sequentially to obtain the modal parameters of the structure with the lateral constraint a time series of all the sensors is used and the arguments used to obtain figs 11 and 12 are unchanged the estimated frequencies and corresponding damping ratios with an increasing model order are shown in figs 16 and 17 respectively comparing figs 16 and 17 to figs 11 and 12 one can draw the flowing conclusions 1 the second mode could be identified because of the elimination of high energy noises i e it is 19 9836 hz which can be demonstrated by mode shapes as shown in fig 10 and 2 accuracy of identified damping ratios can be improved significantly for example the discrete coefficient of damping ratios is reduced from 0 3701 to 0 2611 5 field test study an offshore wind turbine in the yellow sea in practical engineering the interference of high energy noise on modal parameter identification can be very serious so the performance of the proposed method is also investigated using real measurements the offshore wind turbine used in this analysis is located in the yellow sea area of china whose foundation is in the form of a pile structure with a diameter of 5 5 m the pipe is fixed in the seabed with a penetration depth of 50 35 m the height from the seabed to the fixed flange is 22 65 m the turbine tower has a total height of 86 m and a total weight of 2500 tons the three bladed direct drive wind turbine generator has a rated power of 4 0 mw and a blade length of 88 m to collect vibration data of the wind turbine structure in the x and y directions at each position two tri axial acceleration sensors are installed in the inwall of the turbine tower at a height of 45 m and a distance to the flange of 75 m as shown in fig 18 the type of acceleration sensor is model 4630 005 060 c with measure range 5g and voltage sensitivity 400 mv g the used data acquisition instrument is cronosflex 400 by imcaccess co ltd with the natural excitation of the structure the corresponding acceleration data is recorded at a sampling rate of 100 hz when the wind turbine structure is operating one hour of acceleration response data of sensor 1 and sensor 2 in the x direction is shown in fig 18 from the time domain figure the amplitude of the acceleration vibration changes at different times because the wind and wave loads vary with time to analyze the modal parameters of the wind turbine structure from the collected acceleration data a stable duration should be selected the duration from 900 s to 1000 s is relatively stable in fig 18 and is chosen to conduct the following analysis frequency spectrum analysis is a simple method to obtain the frequency components of a time domain signal preliminarily by using the fourier transform the time history and spectrum of the duration from 900 s to 1000 s of sensor 1 and sensor 2 in the x direction are shown in fig 19 six peaks are present in the spectra curve with frequencies of almost 0 40 hz 0 80 hz 1 20 hz 1 60 hz 2 00 hz and 2 39 hz the frequencies at the peaks are multiples of 0 4 hz corresponding to 3p frequency of the offshore wind turbine which means the rotating speed of blades is about 8 rpm the frequency divisions occupy the dominant energy of the signal which results in the intrinsic modal information drowning in the periodic signal to further detail the influence of harmonic excitation on modal identification the duration at sensor 1 is selected to extract the modal parameters using stochastic subspace identification ssi the true model order of the wind turbine structure is usually difficult to determine which is inconvenient for modal identification to solve the problem a way similar to stability diagram method is implemented in this paper the model orders ranging from 50 to 300 with an interval of 50 are adopted when modal parameters estimated using ssi the identified frequencies versus model orders are exhibited in fig 20 which shows that the identified stable frequencies are near 0 4 hz 0 8 hz 1 2 hz and 2 4 hz the true modal of wind turbine structure are drawing the harmonic components which could not be extracted using traditional ssi the proposed method is applied to manage the influence of harmonic components the order is set equal to 80 and 100 components and are extracted using the proposed method to remove the adverse effect of the harmonic components on modal identification the frequency multiplication components of 0 4 hz in the 100 components extracted are eliminated implementing a fourier transform on the signal to eliminate the harmonic components the frequency spectra of sensor 1 and sensor 2 are shown in fig 21 compared with fig 19 the high energy harmonic components are eliminated using the same method to identify the modal parameter of the eliminated signal based on ssi the modal frequencies and damping ratios versus model orders are shown in fig 22 and fig 23 the identified frequencies of different sensor are stable around 0 36 hz and corresponding damping ratios are stale as well taking results of finite element model into account the first order frequency is 0 3202 hz which can provide a useful reference to true modal parameters identification actually the identified frequency is 0 3592 hz and the corresponding damping ratio is 0 0151 when the order is set as 200 using ssi to filtered signal of sensor 1 in x direction due to the lack of the true values for modal frequencies of the structure examining the agreement among the modal frequencies estimated from different signals seems to be the best way to evaluate the estimation performance therefore data from sensor 2 in x direction is also used and the identified frequency is 0 3596 hz and the corresponding damping ratio is 0 0272 with the same identifying parameters one can find that results from the two sensors agree with each other well 6 conclusions based on signal decomposition a high energy noise extraction method was proposed to make poorly excited true modes relatively significant so they can be stably identified the approach was achieved by dividing the original signal into three parts i e the true signal the normal noise and the high energy noise the specialty of the method is that each part is represented by complex exponentials the reason for employing complex exponentials is that noise in the original signal will have a universal form i e purely harmonic damped harmonic or purely damped exponential components meaning the noise in the measured signal is not limited to only machine caused noise different from traditional low pass or band pass filtering an iterative procedure was developed for the proposed method by extracting noisy components one by one to ensure the true signals buried in the original signal are not incorrectly eliminated to demonstrate and investigate the performance of the proposed method three examples were used the first example is a numerical signal with one high energy noisy component in which two scenarios non harmonic and harmonic noise were studied numerical results show that the noisy component can be accurately extracted whether or not it is harmonic the second example is a three dimensional steel offshore platform which was fixed on the ground to simulate the interference of high energy noise a harmonic excitation with a period of 0 1 s and an amplitude of 0 3 g was imposed on the structure experimental results indicated that when measured raw data are used only the first mode can be identified if filtered data are used by employing the proposed method the first two modes can be identified with improved damping ratio estimation finally sea test data from an offshore wind turbine in operating conditions was used a more serious problem occurred that no reasonable modal parameters could be obtained by employing the ssi method if the raw measured data was used even when the used model order reaches 300 but the first mode can be identified i e a frequency of 0 3592 hz and a damping ratio of 0 0151 by using the proposed method acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support of the national natural science foundation of china
