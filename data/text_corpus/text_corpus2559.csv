12795,the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential non potable uses that can be given to the water flowing from a green roof through the characterization of its quality using the parameters and reference values contained in the brazilian standard abnt nbr 15527 2007 the research was carried out in the garage building of the charles darwin business for a period of five months fifteen samples were collected from three collection points rainwater irrigation and drainage from the green roof and evaluated for the qualitative characterization of the waters the physicochemical parameters hydrogen potential ph turbidity tbd apparent color ac free residual chlorine frc and electrical conductivity ec in addition to the microbiological parameters total coliforms escherichia coli and number of heterotrophic bacteria hb were determined data were subjected to descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis the results obtained show that the green roof contributed to the reduction of rainwater ph the green roof drainage water had higher levels of ac and tbd due to the concentrations of suspended particles which acted as a source of ec the frc values complied with the legislation in all treatments likewise the microbiological parameters partially complied with the standards established by the legislation cluster analysis formed two distinct groups g1 comprising hb and tbd and g2 containing the variables ph ac ec and frc although the quality of the drainage water does not meet all the standards required by law this water has the potential for reuse for non potable purposes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords urban constructions water reuse sustainability 1 introduction in large urban centers the expansion in the number of constructions is directly related to the increase in impermeable areas and the volume of surface runoff of rainwater 1 2 the climate and poor drainage of the surface layer are the enhancers of surface runoff that lead to floods in most large urban centers 3 the urbanization process drastically affects the water cycle as the addition of buildings and paved surfaces to the landscape reduces the infiltration of rainwater and evapotranspiration rates causing an increase in flows and in the volume of rainwater runoff furthermore it favors the emergence of problems with floods and stress on supply and drainage systems 4 5 the intensification of anthropogenic activity in the natural environment has caused a decrease in water quality linked to reduction in its availability for drinking purposes generating greater demand for good quality water 6 the quality decrease is also related to the reduced availability of water for more important purposes 7 the transport of sediments by surface runoff resulting from human activities and the release of effluents into springs act as some of the leading causes of water quality decrease 8 consequently it is essential to adopt measures to solve the problems arising from the scarcity of water and drainage in urban centers because of this the collection and use of rainwater have been accepted as an important and effective alternative and or complementary source to public water supply systems because in addition to mitigating water scarcity it reduces the volume of runoff in the urban centers 9 10 the use of rainwater is a viable alternative and or complementary source to public water supply systems for non potable purposes in addition the use of rainwater can reduce the demand for drinking water used for non potable purposes contributing to the preservation and conservation of water resources 11 15 in recent decades increasing water demand pressures associated with climate environmental and social changes have driven many countries to support the implementation of rainwater harvesting through new technologies for sustainable water supply 16 several solutions have been suggested to address water related issues in urban areas including smart cities and green cities 17 18 in this context green roofs have stood out as a rainwater management tool due to their ability to retain rainwater and its runoff storing it in the substrate for example where plants absorb it and then return it to the atmosphere through the process of evapotranspiration 19 20 therefore green roofs i e building rooftops covered with growing medium and vegetation are also known as roof gardens living roofs and eco roofs green roofs consist of a vegetation cover formed by grasses or other plant species planted on conventional roofs or roof slabs 21 22 and are classified into three types extensive semi intensive and intensive whose differences are mainly in the type of vegetation used cost plant community and substrate layer 23 24 in this respect studies with green roofs have shown to be promising due to the advantages arising from their use such as improvement in thermal comfort 25 27 energy savings 28 29 reduction in the effects of urban heat islands 30 31 rainwater retention 32 33 improvement in air quality 34 and rainwater use 35 36 finally in view of the multiple benefits linked to the use of green roofs as a tool to mitigate the adverse effects brought about by urbanization the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential non potable uses that can be given to water from the drainage of a green roof located in the city of recife pernambuco state brazil through the characterization of its quality using the parameters and reference values contained in the brazilian standard abnt nbr 15527 2007 2 material and methods 2 1 location and characterization of the study area the research was carried out in the garage building of the charles darwin business of the rio ave enterprises construction company in the city of recife pernambuco state brazil latitude 8 3 56 12 s longitude 34 53 45 94 w fig 1 the climate of the region is humid tropical specifically an as type climate according to köppen s classification 37 the rainy season occurs from may to august and the annual accumulated precipitation is 2204 3 mm the annual average temperature is 25 9 c with maximum average temperature of 29 5 c minimum average temperature of 22 3 c with an average relative humidity of 78 3 38 the green roof used is of the extensive type covering an area of 2800 m2 with grass of the zoysia japonica species the substrate used was treated sewage sludge with thickness of 7 5 cm a layer of granular material forms the drainage system with thickness of 2 5 cm from concrete waste recycling this material is covered by two drainage blankets bidim op 30 i e geotextile filter material with thickness of 0 1 cm on their top and bottom faces which act as separating filters preventing fine particles from being removed from the substrate and obstructing the drainage layer the waterproofing layer is composed of a 0 4 cm thick asphalt blanket and the green roof slab was built with conventional reinforced concrete sand gravel water and steel with thickness of 21 cm fig 2 this green roof has a pop up sprinkler irrigation system and is hydraulically connected to a reservoir with storage capacity of 380 m3 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 chemical analysis of treated sewage sludge in the present study a chemical analysis of the treated sewage sludge used as substrate was performed the analyzed parameters were ph total nitrogen carbon organic matter total carbon nitrogen ratio phosphorus potassium sodium calcium magnesium aluminum iron zinc cadmium copper nickel lead chromium barium antimony cobalt molybdenum manganese vanadium silver mercury arsenic and selenium the chemical analysis was performed at the environmental chemistry laboratory of the federal rural university of pernambuco 2 2 2 collection conservation transport and analysis of water samples the collection conservation transport and analysis procedures were carried out following methodologies contained in the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 42 water samples were collected at 10 00 am sampled and stored in plastic containers afterward the samples were sent for processing and analysis at the laboratory of analysis of minerals soils and water of the federal rural university of pernambuco and to the laboratory of water analysis of the department of agricultural engineering of the federal rural university of pernambuco the qualitative characterizations of the water were divided into three collection points namely rainwater irrigation water and water drained by the green roof fifteen samples were collected over five months april 19 may 19 june 19 july 19 and august 19 and three samples were collected per month one from each collection point the total number of samples was defined by taking into account the statistical premise suggested by hoffmann 43 according to which the number of repetitions of an experiment must be defined in a way that it provides at least ten degrees of freedom for the residual the rainwater was collected using a graduated rain gauge installed next to a meteorological station 1 80 m from the roof floor the water from the irrigation point consists of the water drained by the green roof the wastewater from the cooling of the air conditioners installed in the business building and the water from the public supply system water samples were collected directly from the emitter as for the samples from the drainage point the collection was carried out through an external tap existing in the hydraulic pipe the drainage water is composed of rainwater and irrigation water which pass through the green roof construction system 2 2 3 legislation the values of the water quality parameters of the collected samples were compared with the reference values of the standard nbr 15527 44 for non potable purposes contained in table 1 in addition to the parameters contained in nbr 15527 the electrical conductivity ec and standard count of heterotrophic bacteria hb of the collected samples were analyzed 2 3 statistical analysis data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis to obtain the mean median and coefficient of variation cv cv was classified according to the methodology of warrick and nielsen 45 as low cv 12 medium 12 cv 24 and high cv 24 posteriorly to determine the similarity between the water quality characteristics physical chemical and biological described in section 2 2 a multivariate cluster analysis was applied through the tree diagram using the ward aggregation method and the euclidean distance 46 then the similarities were attributed to the variables by calculating the euclidean distance dij and by ward s hierarchical method between two objects i and j in which the smaller the distance the greater the quantitative similarity between the variables 46 47 as described in eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d ij k 1 n x ik x jk 2 where dij is the euclidean distance and xik and xjk are the data observed at meteorological stations in municipalities i and j respectively 2 w i 1 n x i 2 1 n x i 2 where w is the minimum intergroup variance by ward s hierarchical method n is the number of elements and xi is the ith element of the group a principal component analysis pca and a correlation analysis by principal components pcc were also used considering five variables and three collection points based on the principal components pc the covariance matrix was obtained to extract the eigenvalues that originate from the eigenvectors the kaiser criterion was used to identify the variables that showed correlation considering eigenvalues above 1 which generate components with an appropriate amount of information contained in the original data 48 49 finally a pearson s correlation analysis confirmed the correlations between the variables and the groups formed the rainfall levels in this study were obtained from the meteorological station installed in the garage building of the charles darwin business and from the national institute of meteorology inmet database all statistical analyses were performed using r software version 3 6 1 50 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the chemical composition of sewage sludge the chemical composition of the treated sewage sludge used as a substrate on the green roof is shown in table 2 the chemical composition of the treated sewage sludge used as a substrate on the green roof meets the maximum limits established by the ministry of the environment together with the national environment council conama through resolution 375 2006 51 for the agricultural use of sewage sludge 3 2 rainfall levels for the study period the comparison between rainfall and the historical average for the experimental period is shown in fig 3 the rainfall accumulated in the experimental period was 1289 70 mm below the historical average for the period 1538 20 mm which is equivalent in percentage terms to a reduction of 16 15 the accumulated rainfall in april may and august was below the historical average the months of june and july had the highest rainfall with about 412 40 mm and 406 30 mm respectively and june was responsible for 31 50 of the total rainfall in the period on the other hand june and july were above the historical average and august was the month with the lowest volume of rainfall with accumulated monthly precipitation of around 133 50 mm which corresponded to 10 35 of the total volume of rainfall in the period 3 3 statistical analysis and comparison with legislation descriptive statistics of the water quality analyses mean standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv minimum median and maximum are shown in table 3 all variables had the highest averages at the drainage collection point followed by the irrigation and rain point the standard count of heterotrophic bacteria hb showed high concentrations at all collection points 930 to 57 000 cfu ml 1 colony forming unit cfu especially at the drainage point where the mean was 36 340 cfu ml 1 these bacteria are part of the aquatic microbiota and this increase in their counts indicates an increase in the presence of organic matter in the water 54 the average values of hydrogen potential ph in the water from the three points of collection rain irrigation and drainage were 5 32 6 47 and 7 32 respectively regarding compliance with the standards of nbr 15527 table 1 the average ph values at the three collection points partially met the limits established by the standard corroborating the findings of this study buffam et al 55 highlight that the increase in ph in samples collected at other irrigation and drainage points is related to the components contained in the substrate and certifies that green roofs have the potential to neutralize acid deposition in this same study carried out in the united states rainwater had an average ph equal to 5 75 while water from green roofs had an average ph within the range from 6 5 to 7 4 corroborating the results of the present study the average values of apparent color ac in the samples at the rain point ranged from 1 20 to 4 80 uh in the irrigation point samples the results were within the range from 15 40 to 45 20 uh as for the samples from the drainage point the ac ranged from 44 5 to values 100 uh this result is due to the fact that in continuous green roofs there is an increase in the transport of particles and the content of organic matter from the substrate therefore the samples collected at the rain point met the limit allowed by nbr 15527 however the samples obtained both at the irrigation collection point and at the drainage point showed ac values higher than those established by the standard which determines that they must be lower than 15 uh liu et al 52 in a study in gansu province china semi arid climate investigated whether extensive green roofs behaved as a sink or source of nutrients and total suspended solids in stormwater runoff compared to a conventional roof and evaluated the influences of substrate and vegetation on the quality of water from green roof outlets the authors concluded that the substrate significantly affects the quality of rainwater runoff from extensive green roofs and emphasized that the appropriate choice of substrate and plants should be based on the quality of runoff water aiming to reduce the transport of fine particles from the substrate and hence the suspended solids levels in green roof runoff regarding the free residual chlorine frc of the samples obtained at the rain collection point the values found in all analyses ranged from 0 04 to 0 15 mg l 1 this is because the composition of rainwater is influenced by geographic location 56 in the samples from the irrigation point the concentration of frc ranged from 0 06 to 0 16 mg l 1 and in the samples from the drainage point this variation was from 0 53 to 0 93 mg l 1 the frc concentration was below the limit established by the standard in all treatments which is 0 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 according to nbr 15527 this data must be taken into account if chlorine compounds are used for disinfection however the presence of frc in the collected samples is related to the composition of the water used in irrigation which is partly constituted by public supply water which has chlorine as the main disinfection agent during water treatment 57 the tbd values for samples from both the rain and the irrigation points ranged from 0 26 to 1 15 ntu and from 1 48 to 4 34 ntu respectively however the values ranged from 56 00 to 743 00 ntu in the samples from the drainage point this significant level of tbd is related to the increase in the volume of precipitation especially in june and july as greater volume of precipitation favors a more significant transport of particles from the substrate to the drainage system for both the samples from the rain point and the samples from the irrigation point the results met the standard required by the legislation however in samples from the drainage point the values exceeded the maximum limit of 5 0 ntu established by nbr 15527 teixeira et al 36 in a study carried out in paraná report this change in the turbidity of the water drained by green roofs related to the increase in precipitation in the studied period the ec of the water represents the content of dissolved mineral salts in the rain point samples the values ranged from 0 02 ds m 1 to 0 06 ds m 1 for the samples obtained at the irrigation point the values ranged from 0 21 ds m 1 to 0 30 ds m 1 and in the samples collected at the drainage point the variation was from 0 53 ds m 1 to 0 93 ds m 1 from the results obtained it is possible to observe that the samples obtained at the drainage and irrigation points showed higher ec values and this increase is a function of the increase in the ionic content in the flow caused by the leaching of salts 58 liu et al 59 evaluated the quality of water drained by ten prototypes of extensive green roofs in china and found ec values ranging from 0 0027 ds m 1 to 0 006 ds m 1 as for rainwater the authors found an average ec value close to 0 003 ds m 1 in general the electrical conductivity data found by the cited authors are similar to those described in this study the results of the analysis of microbiological parameters of collected water with respect to total and thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli for the three treatments are presented in table 4 regarding thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli and total coliforms nbr 15527 establishes that they should not be present in 100 ml of water in the analyses carried out at the rainwater point microbiological parameters were absent in april july and august whereas in july the result was absence only for thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli partially complying with the legislation the presence of coliforms in the samples from the rainwater point is related to the container s exposure to birds dust and other atmospheric pollutants that can reduce its quality for the samples collected at the irrigation point only in august was there absence of coliforms which is related to the reduction of tbd and the concentration of hb recorded in august in the other months the samples did not comply with the legislation therefore it is observed that none of the samples collected from the drainage point showed sufficient quality for reuse in more restrictive non potable uses according to nbr 15527 and that in august both the rain point and the irrigation point samples showed absence of total and thermotolerant coliforms however after the water was drained by the green roof system both microbiological parameters were present corroborating the results obtained in the present study tonial et al 60 and teixeira et al 36 when analyzing the quality of water collected from the drainage of a green roof and rainwater found the presence of coliforms above the limit established by legislation the coefficient of variation cv according to the criterion of warrick and nielsen 45 at the rw point there was high variability cv 24 for most variables except for the ph which showed low variability with cv equal to 6 25 at this point and cv 12 at the other collection points irrigation and drainage the ec showed moderate variability with cv equal to 16 02 at the irrigation point and the other variables showed high variation cv 24 only ec and frc showed moderate variation at the drainage point with a cv equal to 22 62 this variability is explained by the fact that green roof ecosystems show seasonal fluctuations in the composition of drained water due to variation in plant productivity microbial activity and other processes governed by both temperature and light 55 according to the results obtained in this study the waters analyzed here have great potential for non potable uses such as irrigation cleaning washing toilet flushing landscape elements firefighting and cooling towers among others however the need to implement a stage of treatment of the water drained by the green roofs to enables its effective use becomes evident 3 4 multivariate analysis fig 4 shows the principal component analysis principal component correlation pearson s correlation and cluster analysis for the water quality parameters associated with the three collection points the eigenvalues for the principal components 1 and 2 pc1 and pc2 respectively were 1 meeting the criteria established by kaiser 49 the cumulative percentage for the two components was 86 37 72 45 and 13 92 for pc1 and pc2 respectively being a significant fit which shows the adequacy of the analysis therefore the projection of the graph of scores and factor loadings biplots was made with pc1 and pc2 fig 4a and b the total variance accumulated in pc1 72 45 shows satisfactory results for the water quality parameters associated with the three collection points similarly finkler et al 61 used pca to identify the main quality parameters and polluting sources related to spatial and temporal variation in the municipality of caxias do sul located in the state of rio grande do sul pc1 was mainly influenced by the apparent color ac electrical conductivity ec free residual chlorine frc and hydrogen potential ph parameters with the highest correlations fig 4b and values at the drainage collection point fig 4a this being the point with the greatest concentration of the variables described pc2 showed strong correlations with hb and tbd variables fig 4a the tbd variable is associated with dissolved substances and suspended particles in the water such as organic matter which explains this positive correlation because these bacteria feed on organic sources as described by brasil et al 62 through the correlation analysis by principal components pcc fig 4b it was possible to verify the correlation factors between the variables emphasizing that the correlations ranged from 0 75 to 0 95 which were significant silva et al 63 emphasize that pcc values above 0 75 are representative of the positive proportionality between the variables making this a precursor analysis in the characterization of the dependence between the variables among the variables studied frc and ec had the highest correlations with each other 0 95 being directly proportional that is showing a positive correlation with each other with a proportional increase or decrease this correlation is explained by the fact that chlorine is one of the most common ions that cause an increase in water salinity in addition to sodium calcium magnesium sulfate and bicarbonate 64 pearson s correlation is an indicator of the similarity of the results and as shown in fig 4c the variables analyzed were positively correlated with a correlation ranging from weak to very strong 0 4 to 1 0 65 the correlation of the hb variable was moderate with ph ac tbd ec and frc which denotes a directly proportional moderate influence between these variables this moderate and positive correlation r 0 4 between hb and ec and frc can be explained by the fact that chlorine reacts with a considerable number of substances such as organic matter metal ions such as iron and numerous salts reducing its disinfectant action and producing compounds without the expected action 66 ward s aggregation method 46 established euclidean distances of 0 4 for the variables studied forming two groups highlighted in red and green fig 4d the first group g1 is formed by the variables hb and tbd both related to the presence of suspended material in the water originating mainly from the substrate rich in organic matter table 2 the second group g2 is composed of the variables ph ac ec and frc and the similarity between these variables occurs because they show a strong correlation and correspond to the lowest concentrations at all collection points table 3 it is also noteworthy that ec and frc had the shortest euclidean distance in g2 reinforcing the highest correlations found in pcc and pearson s correlation figs 4b and c correlation analysis by principal components and pearson s correlation highlight the distinctions in the correlations and reinforce the relationships between the variables studied the results pointed out in this study are fundamental for public policies in urban and metropolitan regions this study will help in future projects of urban constructions in the metropolitan region of recife and other urban and metropolitan regions in the world the results of this research will be key in the planning and sizing of green roofs and the collection and use of rainwater irrigation water and drainage water under green roofs 4 conclusions the rainwater irrigation water and drainage water from the collection points evaluated partially complied with nbr 15527 2007 the passage through the green roof led to a reduction in the natural acidity of the water and a greater concentration of color and turbidity due to the presence of total solids which acted as a source of electrical conductivity the residual chlorine values complied with the legislation in all treatments the microbiological parameters partially met the standards established by nbr 15527 44 in the samples collected however although the quality of the green roof drainage water does not meet all the standards indicated in nbr 15527 44 this water has the potential to be used for non potable purposes such as cleaning sidewalks garden irrigation and toilet flushing in addition to being an important alternative to reduce the consumption of public

chemical composition of sewage sludge the chemical composition of the treated sewage sludge used as a substrate on the green roof is shown in table 2 the chemical composition of the treated sewage sludge used as a substrate on the green roof meets the maximum limits established by the ministry of the environment together with the national environment council conama through resolution 375 2006 51 for the agricultural use of sewage sludge 3 2 rainfall levels for the study period the comparison between rainfall and the historical average for the experimental period is shown in fig 3 the rainfall accumulated in the experimental period was 1289 70 mm below the historical average for the period 1538 20 mm which is equivalent in percentage terms to a reduction of 16 15 the accumulated rainfall in april may and august was below the historical average the months of june and july had the highest rainfall with about 412 40 mm and 406 30 mm respectively and june was responsible for 31 50 of the total rainfall in the period on the other hand june and july were above the historical average and august was the month with the lowest volume of rainfall with accumulated monthly precipitation of around 133 50 mm which corresponded to 10 35 of the total volume of rainfall in the period 3 3 statistical analysis and comparison with legislation descriptive statistics of the water quality analyses mean standard deviation sd coefficient of variation cv minimum median and maximum are shown in table 3 all variables had the highest averages at the drainage collection point followed by the irrigation and rain point the standard count of heterotrophic bacteria hb showed high concentrations at all collection points 930 to 57 000 cfu ml 1 colony forming unit cfu especially at the drainage point where the mean was 36 340 cfu ml 1 these bacteria are part of the aquatic microbiota and this increase in their counts indicates an increase in the presence of organic matter in the water 54 the average values of hydrogen potential ph in the water from the three points of collection rain irrigation and drainage were 5 32 6 47 and 7 32 respectively regarding compliance with the standards of nbr 15527 table 1 the average ph values at the three collection points partially met the limits established by the standard corroborating the findings of this study buffam et al 55 highlight that the increase in ph in samples collected at other irrigation and drainage points is related to the components contained in the substrate and certifies that green roofs have the potential to neutralize acid deposition in this same study carried out in the united states rainwater had an average ph equal to 5 75 while water from green roofs had an average ph within the range from 6 5 to 7 4 corroborating the results of the present study the average values of apparent color ac in the samples at the rain point ranged from 1 20 to 4 80 uh in the irrigation point samples the results were within the range from 15 40 to 45 20 uh as for the samples from the drainage point the ac ranged from 44 5 to values 100 uh this result is due to the fact that in continuous green roofs there is an increase in the transport of particles and the content of organic matter from the substrate therefore the samples collected at the rain point met the limit allowed by nbr 15527 however the samples obtained both at the irrigation collection point and at the drainage point showed ac values higher than those established by the standard which determines that they must be lower than 15 uh liu et al 52 in a study in gansu province china semi arid climate investigated whether extensive green roofs behaved as a sink or source of nutrients and total suspended solids in stormwater runoff compared to a conventional roof and evaluated the influences of substrate and vegetation on the quality of water from green roof outlets the authors concluded that the substrate significantly affects the quality of rainwater runoff from extensive green roofs and emphasized that the appropriate choice of substrate and plants should be based on the quality of runoff water aiming to reduce the transport of fine particles from the substrate and hence the suspended solids levels in green roof runoff regarding the free residual chlorine frc of the samples obtained at the rain collection point the values found in all analyses ranged from 0 04 to 0 15 mg l 1 this is because the composition of rainwater is influenced by geographic location 56 in the samples from the irrigation point the concentration of frc ranged from 0 06 to 0 16 mg l 1 and in the samples from the drainage point this variation was from 0 53 to 0 93 mg l 1 the frc concentration was below the limit established by the standard in all treatments which is 0 5 to 3 0 mg l 1 according to nbr 15527 this data must be taken into account if chlorine compounds are used for disinfection however the presence of frc in the collected samples is related to the composition of the water used in irrigation which is partly constituted by public supply water which has chlorine as the main disinfection agent during water treatment 57 the tbd values for samples from both the rain and the irrigation points ranged from 0 26 to 1 15 ntu and from 1 48 to 4 34 ntu respectively however the values ranged from 56 00 to 743 00 ntu in the samples from the drainage point this significant level of tbd is related to the increase in the volume of precipitation especially in june and july as greater volume of precipitation favors a more significant transport of particles from the substrate to the drainage system for both the samples from the rain point and the samples from the irrigation point the results met the standard required by the legislation however in samples from the drainage point the values exceeded the maximum limit of 5 0 ntu established by nbr 15527 teixeira et al 36 in a study carried out in paraná report this change in the turbidity of the water drained by green roofs related to the increase in precipitation in the studied period the ec of the water represents the content of dissolved mineral salts in the rain point samples the values ranged from 0 02 ds m 1 to 0 06 ds m 1 for the samples obtained at the irrigation point the values ranged from 0 21 ds m 1 to 0 30 ds m 1 and in the samples collected at the drainage point the variation was from 0 53 ds m 1 to 0 93 ds m 1 from the results obtained it is possible to observe that the samples obtained at the drainage and irrigation points showed higher ec values and this increase is a function of the increase in the ionic content in the flow caused by the leaching of salts 58 liu et al 59 evaluated the quality of water drained by ten prototypes of extensive green roofs in china and found ec values ranging from 0 0027 ds m 1 to 0 006 ds m 1 as for rainwater the authors found an average ec value close to 0 003 ds m 1 in general the electrical conductivity data found by the cited authors are similar to those described in this study the results of the analysis of microbiological parameters of collected water with respect to total and thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli for the three treatments are presented in table 4 regarding thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli and total coliforms nbr 15527 establishes that they should not be present in 100 ml of water in the analyses carried out at the rainwater point microbiological parameters were absent in april july and august whereas in july the result was absence only for thermotolerant coliforms escherichia coli partially complying with the legislation the presence of coliforms in the samples from the rainwater point is related to the container s exposure to birds dust and other atmospheric pollutants that can reduce its quality for the samples collected at the irrigation point only in august was there absence of coliforms which is related to the reduction of tbd and the concentration of hb recorded in august in the other months the samples did not comply with the legislation therefore it is observed that none of the samples collected from the drainage point showed sufficient quality for reuse in more restrictive non potable uses according to nbr 15527 and that in august both the rain point and the irrigation point samples showed absence of total and thermotolerant coliforms however after the water was drained by the green roof system both microbiological parameters were present corroborating the results obtained in the present study tonial et al 60 and teixeira et al 36 when analyzing the quality of water collected from the drainage of a green roof and rainwater found the presence of coliforms above the limit established by legislation the coefficient of variation cv according to the criterion of warrick and nielsen 45 at the rw point there was high variability cv 24 for most variables except for the ph which showed low variability with cv equal to 6 25 at this point and cv 12 at the other collection points irrigation and drainage the ec showed moderate variability with cv equal to 16 02 at the irrigation point and the other variables showed high variation cv 24 only ec and frc showed moderate variation at the drainage point with a cv equal to 22 62 this variability is explained by the fact that green roof ecosystems show seasonal fluctuations in the composition of drained water due to variation in plant productivity microbial activity and other processes governed by both temperature and light 55 according to the results obtained in this study the waters analyzed here have great potential for non potable uses such as irrigation cleaning washing toilet flushing landscape elements firefighting and cooling towers among others however the need to implement a stage of treatment of the water drained by the green roofs to enables its effective use becomes evident 3 4 multivariate analysis fig 4 shows the principal component analysis principal component correlation pearson s correlation and cluster analysis for the water quality parameters associated with the three collection points the eigenvalues for the principal components 1 and 2 pc1 and pc2 respectively were 1 meeting the criteria established by kaiser 49 the cumulative percentage for the two components was 86 37 72 45 and 13 92 for pc1 and pc2 respectively being a significant fit which shows the adequacy of the analysis therefore the projection of the graph of scores and factor loadings biplots was made with pc1 and pc2 fig 4a and b the total variance accumulated in pc1 72 45 shows satisfactory results for the water quality parameters associated with the three collection points similarly finkler et al 61 used pca to identify the main quality parameters and polluting sources related to spatial and temporal variation in the municipality of caxias do sul located in the state of rio grande do sul pc1 was mainly influenced by the apparent color ac electrical conductivity ec free residual chlorine frc and hydrogen potential ph parameters with the highest correlations fig 4b and values at the drainage collection point fig 4a this being the point with the greatest concentration of the variables described pc2 showed strong correlations with hb and tbd variables fig 4a the tbd variable is associated with dissolved substances and suspended particles in the water such as organic matter which explains this positive correlation because these bacteria feed on organic sources as described by brasil et al 62 through the correlation analysis by principal components pcc fig 4b it was possible to verify the correlation factors between the variables emphasizing that the correlations ranged from 0 75 to 0 95 which were significant silva et al 63 emphasize that pcc values above 0 75 are representative of the positive proportionality between the variables making this a precursor analysis in the characterization of the dependence between the variables among the variables studied frc and ec had the highest correlations with each other 0 95 being directly proportional that is showing a positive correlation with each other with a proportional increase or decrease this correlation is explained by the fact that chlorine is one of the most common ions that cause an increase in water salinity in addition to sodium calcium magnesium sulfate and bicarbonate 64 pearson s correlation is an indicator of the similarity of the results and as shown in fig 4c the variables analyzed were positively correlated with a correlation ranging from weak to very strong 0 4 to 1 0 65 the correlation of the hb variable was moderate with ph ac tbd ec and frc which denotes a directly proportional moderate influence between these variables this moderate and positive correlation r 0 4 between hb and ec and frc can be explained by the fact that chlorine reacts with a considerable number of substances such as organic matter metal ions such as iron and numerous salts reducing its disinfectant action and producing compounds without the expected action 66 ward s aggregation method 46 established euclidean distances of 0 4 for the variables studied forming two groups highlighted in red and green fig 4d the first group g1 is formed by the variables hb and tbd both related to the presence of suspended material in the water originating mainly from the substrate rich in organic matter table 2 the second group g2 is composed of the variables ph ac ec and frc and the similarity between these variables occurs because they show a strong correlation and correspond to the lowest concentrations at all collection points table 3 it is also noteworthy that ec and frc had the shortest euclidean distance in g2 reinforcing the highest correlations found in pcc and pearson s correlation figs 4b and c correlation analysis by principal components and pearson s correlation highlight the distinctions in the correlations and reinforce the relationships between the variables studied the results pointed out in this study are fundamental for public policies in urban and metropolitan regions this study will help in future projects of urban constructions in the metropolitan region of recife and other urban and metropolitan regions in the world the results of this research will be key in the planning and sizing of green roofs and the collection and use of rainwater irrigation water and drainage water under green roofs 4 conclusions the rainwater irrigation water and drainage water from the collection points evaluated partially complied with nbr 15527 2007 the passage through the green roof led to a reduction in the natural acidity of the water and a greater concentration of color and turbidity due to the presence of total solids which acted as a source of electrical conductivity the residual chlorine values complied with the legislation in all treatments the microbiological parameters partially met the standards established by nbr 15527 44 in the samples collected however although the quality of the green roof drainage water does not meet all the standards indicated in nbr 15527 44 this water has the potential to be used for non potable purposes such as cleaning sidewalks garden irrigation and toilet flushing in addition to being an important alternative to reduce the consumption of public

12796,a novel pilot scale post anoxic integrated biofilm activated sludge system of capacity 50 m3 d was used to treat municipal wastewater treatment process comprised of three biological reactors which includes aerobic tank with pva gel beads followed by anoxic tank and aerobic tank the plant was operated at hrt of 6 h with an average srt of 10 days long term performance evaluation of the combined system showed that bod cod tss and tn removal efficiencies were 91 90 93 and 84 respectively in pva gel tank significant removal of nh4 n and no3 n occurred due to nitrification and denitrification process 85 in the system it was observed that the efficiency of snd process varied with temperature and cod n ratio variation maximum tn removal of 80 90 was noted at temperature range 10 25 c and cod n ratio was 10 22 kg cod kg of tn removal of organic matter and nh4 n in first media tank was dependent on temperature and the loading rates significant removal was observed at loading rate 16 kg scod m3 gel d and 2 4 kg nh4 m3 gel d respectively the pathogens removal efficacy of the system was higher 90 bacterial community analysis of immobilized biomass pva gel beads revealed the presence of alpha proteobacteria genera actinobacterium nitrosococcus pseudomonas fusobacterium and nitrosomanas species responsible for high carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency of the system the study concluded that bod tss and tn 10 mg l values were below indian effluent discharge standards average cost to treat 1 m3 of wastewater was calculated as inr 36 05 electricity input cost inr 9 6 overall post anoxic integrated biofilm process achieved significant removal of nitrogen and carbon graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords moving bed biofilm reactor nitrogen removal pva gel media simultaneous nitrification and denitrification wastewater treatment 1 introduction several small scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps flow 1000 m3 day were installed in india in the last two decades for rapid pollution control 1 conventional activated sludge cas processes are facing the issues like poor organic matter removal efficiency and low nitrification rates 2 in comparison to suspended growth processes attached growth on biofilm processes like moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr have shown greater efficiency and stability also proved better effectiveness at variable temperatures and loading conditions 3 6 moreover mbbr system installation and construction cost is low minimal space requirement low sludge production high biomass concentration lower head loss and no clogging issues 7 8 in india biological nutrient removal bnr systems have been installed for small community clusters but most of them are under performing the key issues are low organic matter removal and the formation of pinpoint flocs which causes high suspended solids ss concentration in the effluent majority of the treatment system uses non spongy and not penetrable media having specific surface area 160 350 m2 m3 which is low and smooth for slow process and easy detachment of biofilm 8 9 thus the effective removal of organics and high nitrification rate can be achieved by oxygen availability and a large specific surface area 10 highly porous biomass carriers can overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and support high biomass density with huge specific surface area and enhanced the treatment process 4 9 poly vinyl alcohol pva gel beads are considered as one of the highly effective porous media for enlarged biomass retention as it embraces extensive porosity more specific surface area and density of 2500 m2 m3 and 1 025 g cm3 respectively 11 43 pva gel beads are hydrophilic in nature and demonstrated as an effective biofilm media for organic matter removal nitrification denitrification and lower sludge production 2 furthermore large surface area reduced the volumetric packing ratio of pva gel beads is maintained at 10 15 which is lower than other media types 50 70 usually 11 rajpal et al 2021 aforementioned properties of pva gel beads provide favorable conditions such as diffusion of oxygen organic matter and nutrients for biomass growth wastewater treatment using pva gel beads results in low sludge yield and effective treatment in terms of organics and nitrogen removal 2 12 13 however the government of india has stringent effluent discharge standards to biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ortho phosphorus po4 p and total nitrogen tn phosphorus can be easily achieved by chemical dosing during wastewater treatment while nitrogen removal can be removed through a biological process still there is a necessity to develop small wwtps for nitrogen removal along with organic removal the previous research revealed that subsequent anoxic or anaerobic and aerobic conditions enhanced the nutrient removal from the wastewater 14 15 the lab scale findings revealed that the process with hydraulic retention time hrt of 5 6 h h can bring effluent quality to anticipated level along with minimal sludge production which helps in developing the concept of pva gel based wwtp 16 based on lab scale findings the field scale municipal wastewater treatment system of capacity 50 m3 d was installed in a small vicinity of kirtinagar city of uttarakhand state india situated on the bank of river alaknanda the main objective of this study was to evaluate the novel post anoxic integrated biofilm process for wastewater treatment and reclamation under variable seasonal conditions shock loads simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd and microbial dynamics in the system the microbial community analysis reveal the dynamic behavior of microbes and helps in assess the long term effects of operational conditions and correlate the community characteristics with bioreactor functionality a profound investigation of the microbial community development and relationship with the process efficiency and an in depth assessment of the community structure have not been well reported also limited information is available on cost analysis of wwtps in india 17 18 therefore cost assessment was correspondingly conducted to realize the economic feasibility of the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 process description small scale 50 m3 d wwtp comprised of receiving chamber

the activated sludge from the bottom of the tube settler is recirculated to the anoxic tank and the excess sludge is transferred to the sludge holding tank the excess sludge is dewatered with the help of a basket centrifuge the total hrt of the process was 6 h and the plant was operated with an average solid retention time srt of 10 days a brief description of each unit is given in supplementary

analysis of sludge pva gel beads were washed and the biomass sludge was collected a sample of 25 μl in the four replicates was used to count the protozoans under phase contrast illumination 100 magnifications 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational parameters during start up phase raw sewage temperature varied between 25 and 30 c from may 2018 to november 2018 followed by a dip between 20 and 25 c in november 2018 and 8 19 c in january 2019 supplementary table s4 later the temperature was increased to 24 c until march 2019 ph values of the influent effluent and inside three biological reactors were in the range of 6 5 8 0 the oxidation reduction potential orp values of pva gel anoxic and aeration tank were observed to be 38 mv to 130 mv 60 mv to 162 mv and 39 mv to 92 mv respectively a positive and negative value of orp revealed the stability of the oxic and anoxic reactors dissolved oxygen do values observed in range from 3 3 to 7 5 mg l pva gel tank 0 1 to 0 25 mg l anoxic tank and 2 6 to 5 5 mg l aeration tank respectively these values indicated the optimum range of do inside the reactors is necessary for better performance of the plant kuraray japan provided the pva gel beads media diameter 3 4 mm for the study and reported media life of 25 years and can be used continuously 23 supplementary table s5 and fig s10 3 2 performance evaluation of integrated system 3 2 1 organics matter and total nitrogen removal the average values of bod cod and tss in the influent varied from 58 14 to 451 14 mg l 88 15 to 1049 117 mg l and 145 18 to 486 18 mg l respectively from may 2018 to march 2019 fig 1 after start up period of 1 month the process attained steady state and value of bod cod and tss in the effluent were observed to be 10 mg l 80 removal 40 mg l 88 removal and 10 mg l 94 removal respectively throughout the study period except in november a shock load was observed in november due to illegal discharge of milk by product during festival time resulting in incoming wastewater with high bod cod and tss the average values of nh4 n and t n in the influent varied from 12 1 3 to 39 6 14 mg l and 14 9 3 to 39 8 7 mg l respectively from may 2018 to march 2019 in steady state the value of nh4 n and t n in the effluent were 2 mg l 79 removal and 10 mg l 92 removal respectively during the entire study period except in november 2018 during the shock load condition the rate of nitrification and denitrification was affected but system buffer capacity control the process and the process recovered itself in a short period 3 2 2 role of temperature on bod ammonia and total nitrogen removal the effect of temperature variations on organics and nutrient removal was studied the findings show that the bod removal efficiency of the system was 85 least affected by temperature changes as the temperature dependency of microbial activity is not very much significant for organic matter removal i e heterotrophic microbes even function at temperatures as low as 5 c 11 24 25 it might be due to the bod removal process taking place in three biological reactors a part of bod was oxidized by pva gel tank while the remaining was consumed in the anoxic tank for denitrification and the residual was removed in the aeration tank nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies of the system were 85 and 75 and also not affected by temperature variation it was due to the major part of ammonia being oxidized in pva gel tank and the remaining part getting removed in the aeration tank and nitrogen removal occurred in pva gel by the process of snd anoxic tank by denitrification and remaining part in the aeration tank earlier experiences have shown that ammonia n and total nitrogen removal efficiencies in the mbbr process based on different media other than pva gel were affected by temperature variation 25 while in pva gel based mbbr the effect of temperature was negligible on ammonia n and total nitrogen removal 11 26 3 2 3 pathogens removal the pathogens removal efficiency was examined based on culture plate technique for indicator organisms fc and e coli salmonella shigella and pseudomonas species fc values were decreased from 21 000 24 000 mpn 100 ml inlet to 290 340 mpn 100 ml outlet these numbers were further reduced to 170 270 mpn 100 ml after chlorination chlorine dose 1 5 mg l e coli species values were deduced from the 19 000 21 000 cfu 100 ml in inlet to 120 210 cfu 100 ml in effluent and 150 190 cfu 100 ml after chlorination salmonella species were reduced from 120 to 230 cfu 100 ml to 57 92 cfu 100 ml these numbers were further reduced to 37 48 cfu 100 ml by chlorination similarly shigella and pseudomonas species were reduced from 124 to 270 cfu 100 ml and 135 210 cfu 100 ml to 69 79 cfu 100 ml and 56 89 cfu 100 ml respectively during biological treatment supplementary table s6 these numbers of both shigella and pseudomonas species were further reduced to 37 45 cfu 100 ml by chlorination salmonella species 3 log and shigella species 2 log reduction relate to the greater pathogen removal efficacy moreover the effluent fecal coliforms numbers satisfy world health organization who effluent reuse standard of 1000 mpn 100 ml earlier studies show the pathogens reduced in pva gel beads based reactor treating municipal wastewater 2 a large number of beneficial microbes developed and attached to media pva gel beads however the process can effectively reduce the pathogens through the mechanism of autolysis 13 but addition of the aeration tank in the wwtps enhanced the pathogen removal efficacy attributing to the bacterial competition within the system and predation by the protozoans 22 although chlorine dosing system consists of metering pump of 12 l h capacity and 50 l tank through which hypochlorite solution is fed in the chlorine contact tank hypochlorite solution with 7 chlorine and 10 purity is used for disinfection and only 2 3 ppm dosing is enough for complete disinfection 3 2 4 microbial diversity bacterial community composition and diversity were studied using operational taxonomic units otus based 16sr rna analysis alpha proteobacteria show a significant role in organic matter removal nitrifiers played an important role in the conversion of total nitrogen in wwtp to nitrate nitrospira species were the dominating nitrite oxidizers nitrosomonas species was responsible for ammonia oxidizing into nitrite during the metabolic process table 1 flavobacteriales and pesudomonas species prevailing in the system attributed to the denitrification process 41 denitrifies includes the species of clostridium pseudomonas and flavobacterium phylum firmicutes was also identified as denitrifying bacteria 27 actinobacteria species were the gram positive bacteria having 98 similarity and act as a dominating bacterial group in the removal of phosphorus 28 29 nitrosomonadales species of genus betaproteobacteria has been previously reported as the primary ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob respectively in wastewater treatment system 27 30 taxonomic analysis of bacterial community up to phylum and genus level describe in supplementary fig s18 3 2 5 enumeration of microfaunal species microscopic analysis carried out revealed a significant presence of microfauna such as such as arcella amoeba paranema flagellates ciliates such as litonotus aspidisca and vorticella rotifers as aelosoma and filamentous bacteria table 2 the presence of microbiota at the surface of gel beads is responsible for efficient degradation of organics as its large surface area is used by the microbes for the process of adsorption 13 22 assemblages of filamentous organisms according to their morphological physiological characteristics and the grouped environments are given in table 3 the higher number of arcella species relates to the higher level of aeration and better nitrification activity 22 aerobic zone growers such as type 1701 nostocoida limicola preferred optimum srt and high substrate concentrations microthrix parvicella favoured high organic loading conditions whereas species such as nocardia leads to foaming conditions different species of filamentous strains are associated with varied operating conditions of the wastewater treatment system studying the sludge condition helps in avoiding the operational problems of bulking and foaming in the aerobic systems 31 overall the quality of the sludge showed excellent settling features i e svi 50 ml g and sv30 of 200 250 ml l 3 3 performance assessment of biological reactors the performance evaluation of each biological reactor was conducted for organic matter and nitrogen removal pva gel tank was designed for the oxidation of organics and ammonia thus evaluated for soluble cod scod and nh4 n removal rates to determine the effect of different operational parameters like temperature and loading rate 3 3 1 soluble cod removal scod removal rate has been increased gradually with increment in temperature ranges 8 to 30 c the scod removal efficiency was decreased from 66 to 36 upon decreasing the temperature from 30 to 8 c respectively fig 2a with a rise in temperature the microbial community diversity increases in higher amounts i e a diverse and dense microbiome are present in the working temperature range as compared with low temperature range 5 thus the overall microbial activity increases lead to enhancement in scod removal rate cod removal efficiency was decreased with a decrease in temperature 13 pva gel based system can remove about 40 of scod effectively in the winter season ambient 10 c and about 65 of scod in the summer season the scod removal rate increased with the enhanced scod loading rate in the pva gel tank fig 2b this might be due to the higher availability of organic matter as the organic load increases growth of heterotrophic bacteria also increases and hence results in a high removal rate the removal rate follows first order kinetics the maximum scod loading rate was 20 kg scod m3 gel d and the corresponding scod removal rate was 16 kg scod m3 gel d the system can be effectively loaded with 20 kg scod m3 gel d where the cod removal rate might increase or become constant as observed in earlier studies 9 in a conventional mbbr process scod removal rate increased with the enhanced scod loading rate kg scod m3 gel d 8 9 3 3 2 nitrification in pva gel reactor availability of sufficient d o and higher specific surface area of pva gel beads resulted in higher nitrification rate however the ammonia removal efficiency of pva gel system was reduced with the decreasing temperature as shown in fig 3a in the temperature range of 15 to 30 c the nitrification rate or ammonia removal rate was not affected as the ammonia removal was 90 within the temperature range of 20 30 c however the nitrification rate was decreased from 90 to 50 at a temperature lower than 15 c this might be due to the lower activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob below 15 c 5 32 the biofilm thickness on the surface of beads increased as the temperature decreased and may be reduced the oxygen diffusion rate inside the biofilm it indicates the formation of anoxic zone inside the beads that leads to a decrease in nitrification rate earlier studies on mbbr with pva gel and other beads like kaldnes k1 demonstrated that the nitrification rate was decreased as the operating temperature was decreased 5 11 13 32 to determine the relationship between ammonia loading rate alr and nitrification rate the ammonia loading rate and nitrification rate curve were plotted fig 3b pva gel media was designed for the maximum loading rate of 6 kg nh4 m3 gel d and the optimum dosing of ammonia was 3 kg nh4 m3 gel d for enhanced nitrification rate 4 as ammonia loading rate was increased the nitrification rate also increased and accomplished a threshold once ammonia loading rate attains 3 2 kg nh4 m3 gel d the nitrification rate was increased and achieved its threshold limit during the initial nitrification rate increment the rate follows the first order and after that the order of reaction was reduced at 3 2 kg nh4 m3 gel d ammonia loading rate the nitrification rate accomplished the threshold limit therefore ammonia loading rate of 3 2 kg nh4 m3 gel d can be considered as the optimum rate the maximum nitrification rate corresponding to the optimum ammonia loading rate was 2 4 kg nh4 m3 gel d in the previous studies the nitrification rate depends on the ammonia loading rate and the increment in ammonia loading rate results in enhanced nitrification rate 5 11 33 3 3 3 snd in pva gel reactor nitrogen removal in a pva gel media reactor was accomplished by nitrification of ammonia to nitrate and snd of ammonia to nitrogen gas in pva gel tank a limited supply of air oxygen inside the core of pva gel media leads to the development of the anoxic zone however a large specific surface area and abundance of high do concentration on the outer surface of media leads to a higher nitrification rate these results are similar to observations of other researchers 34 35 snd rate was calculated by a specified equation 35 snd 1 no 3 produced nh 4 oxidized 100 the findings revealed that the snd rate was between 75 and 90 at a temperature scale from 10 to 25 c fig 4a an snd rate was dropped up to 50 within an increased temperature range above 25 to 35 c this might be due to different factors and conditions like temperature dependency of biofilm thickness nitrification rate denitrification rate and microbial activity 5 32 the biofilm thickness on the surface of beads increased as the temperature decreased 5 it limits the d o concentration inside the beads or inner surface of biofilm and results in a good denitrification rate snd rate decreased at a low cod n ratio 10 due to the availability of inadequate soluble carbon source which act as a source of electron donor during the nitrification process by autotrophic bacteria 34 these conditions were observed during the monsoon season when the organic loading rate olr was low similarly snd rate also decreased at high cod n 20 with the increase of cod n ratio heterotrophic bacteria gradually become dominated over autotrophs and compete with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob for the available do and surface area 34 in pva gel tank the best snd rate was achieved between 10 and 20 cod n ratio fig 4b whereas the best snd rate was reported in between 8 and 15 cod n ratio by another study 34 the anoxic reactor was designed and integrated into the process chain to denitrify the nitrate generated in the pva gel reactor the soluble carbon source used for electron donating in the denitrification process 36 was provided by 20 augmented wastewater to the anoxic tank the snd was predominant in pva gel tank as low nitrate 4 5 mg l was available in the anoxic tank almost 90 of nitrate was converted to nitrogen gas in this reactor fig 5a denitrification rate was almost constant until the temperature dropped to 10 c whereas the nitrate removal decreased to 60 70 as denitrifying bacteria i e heterotrophs are sensitive to decrease in the temperature 5 36 37 nitrate removal was also affected by cod n ratio as shown in fig 5 b nitrate removal rate decreased with reduction in cod n ratio i e 7 as sufficient carbon source was not available 3 4 nitrogen balance mostly nitrogen in the system was removed by snd i e 40 to 60 in pva gel tank 10 20 removed by other processes denitrification of nitrate in anoxic tank snd in aeration tank and denitrification at the bottom of tube settler 5 8 nitrogen remains in sludge and residual nitrogen remains in the effluent 42 fig 6a b nitrogen balance calculated as per the following equations 1 mass of tn in influent kg d qt tn influent mass of nitrogen in the influent per day was calculated by multiplying influent flow rate qt m3 d and concentration of tn in influent mg l mass of tn in influent varied between 0 75 and 2 77 kg d 2 mass of tn in effluent kg d qt tn effluent mass of nitrogen in the effluent per day was calculated by multiplying influent flow rate qt m3 d and concentration of tn in effluent in mg l mass of total n in effluent varied between 0 11 and 0 4 kg d 3 mass of tn in sludge kg d ss generated fraction of nitrogen in sludge the pilot scale study revealed that 1 kg of cod removed was equivalent to 0 2 kg of ss produced nitrogen content in sludge was 4 6 therefore mass of tn in sludge is 0 046 ss generated in kg d mass of tn in sludge varied between 0 08 and 0 3 kg d 4 tn removed in the form of n 2 gas by snd in pva gel tank tn in influent pva gel tank tn in the effluent of pva gel tank most nitrogen removals took place in the pva gel tank by snd ammonia got converted to nitrogen gas in the same tank mass of tn remove in the form of n2 gas by snd varied between 0 37 and 1 64 kg d 5 tn removed in the form of n 2 gas by other processes tn in influent tn in effluent tn in sludge tn removed in the form of n 2 gas by snd in pva gel tank tn removed as nitrogen gas was varied between 0 17 and 0 41 kg d 3 5 techno economic analysis cost assessment was performed to estimate the expenses associated with the wastewater treatment system total cost includes the four components of electricity cost chemical cost manpower cost and plant operation and maintenance cost electricity cost was assessed theoretically as well as actual electric unit was noted from the electricity meter the actual electric units 73 78 kwh were less than the electric unit assessed theoretically 114 0 kwh the major part of electricity was consumed by agitator required for continuously mixing in an anoxic tank and air blower for maintaining high do concentration 5 6 mg l in pva gel tank and 3 4 mg l in the aeration tank the specific energy consumption was 1 47 kwh m3 while specific cost was estimated at inr 9 6 m3 fig 7 30 ppm alum was dosed which act as coagulant as well as utilized for chemical phosphorous removal hypochlorite was dosed up with 3 mg l for disinfection and polyelectrolyte was used for sludge dewatering thus the calculated chemical cost was inr 0 364 m3 which was almost negligible as compared to energy cost the annual maintenance cost was assumed as 1 of civil capital cost for civil structure maintenance and 1 5 of electro mechanical equipment capital cost for electromechanical equipment yearly maintenance the specific maintenance cost was inr 26 1 m3 finally the total cost for treating 1 m3 of wastewater was estimated at inr 36 05 table 4 supplementary table s7 s10 4 conclusions final effluent quality was observed well throughout the study in terms of bod 10 mg l cod 50 mg l tss 10 mg l and tn 10 mg l in pva gel tank the nitrification and scod removal rate were reduced at low temperature 10 c ammonia and scod removal rate were also affected by the organic loading rates in pva gel tank in pva gel

12796,a novel pilot scale post anoxic integrated biofilm activated sludge system of capacity 50 m3 d was used to treat municipal wastewater treatment process comprised of three biological reactors which includes aerobic tank with pva gel beads followed by anoxic tank and aerobic tank the plant was operated at hrt of 6 h with an average srt of 10 days long term performance evaluation of the combined system showed that bod cod tss and tn removal efficiencies were 91 90 93 and 84 respectively in pva gel tank significant removal of nh4 n and no3 n occurred due to nitrification and denitrification process 85 in the system it was observed that the efficiency of snd process varied with temperature and cod n ratio variation maximum tn removal of 80 90 was noted at temperature range 10 25 c and cod n ratio was 10 22 kg cod kg of tn removal of organic matter and nh4 n in first media tank was dependent on temperature and the loading rates significant removal was observed at loading rate 16 kg scod m3 gel d and 2 4 kg nh4 m3 gel d respectively the pathogens removal efficacy of the system was higher 90 bacterial community analysis of immobilized biomass pva gel beads revealed the presence of alpha proteobacteria genera actinobacterium nitrosococcus pseudomonas fusobacterium and nitrosomanas species responsible for high carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency of the system the study concluded that bod tss and tn 10 mg l values were below indian effluent discharge standards average cost to treat 1 m3 of wastewater was calculated as inr 36 05 electricity input cost inr 9 6 overall post anoxic integrated biofilm process achieved significant removal of nitrogen and carbon graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords moving bed biofilm reactor nitrogen removal pva gel media simultaneous nitrification and denitrification wastewater treatment 1 introduction several small scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps flow 1000 m3 day were installed in india in the last two decades for rapid pollution control 1 conventional activated sludge cas processes are facing the issues like poor organic matter removal efficiency and low nitrification rates 2 in comparison to suspended growth processes attached growth on biofilm processes like moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr have shown greater efficiency and stability also proved better effectiveness at variable temperatures and loading conditions 3 6 moreover mbbr system installation and construction cost is low minimal space requirement low sludge production high biomass concentration lower head loss and no clogging issues 7 8 in india biological nutrient removal bnr systems have been installed for small community clusters but most of them are under performing the key issues are low organic matter removal and the formation of pinpoint flocs which causes high suspended solids ss concentration in the effluent majority of the treatment system uses non spongy and not penetrable media having specific surface area 160 350 m2 m3 which is low and smooth for slow process and easy detachment of biofilm 8 9 thus the effective removal of organics and high nitrification rate can be achieved by oxygen availability and a large specific surface area 10 highly porous biomass carriers can overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and support high biomass density with huge specific surface area and enhanced the treatment process 4 9 poly vinyl alcohol pva gel beads are considered as one of the highly effective porous media for enlarged biomass retention as it embraces extensive porosity more specific surface area and density of 2500 m2 m3 and 1 025 g cm3 respectively 11 43 pva gel beads are hydrophilic in nature and demonstrated as an effective biofilm media for organic matter removal nitrification denitrification and lower sludge production 2 furthermore large surface area reduced the volumetric packing ratio of pva gel beads is maintained at 10 15 which is lower than other media types 50 70 usually 11 rajpal et al 2021 aforementioned properties of pva gel beads provide favorable conditions such as diffusion of oxygen organic matter and nutrients for biomass growth wastewater treatment using pva gel beads results in low sludge yield and effective treatment in terms of organics and nitrogen removal 2 12 13 however the government of india has stringent effluent discharge standards to biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss ortho phosphorus po4 p and total nitrogen tn phosphorus can be easily achieved by chemical dosing during wastewater treatment while nitrogen removal can be removed through a biological process still there is a necessity to develop small wwtps for nitrogen removal along with organic removal the previous research revealed that subsequent anoxic or anaerobic and aerobic conditions enhanced the nutrient removal from the wastewater 14 15 the lab scale findings revealed that the process with hydraulic retention time hrt of 5 6 h h can bring effluent quality to anticipated level along with minimal sludge production which helps in developing the concept of pva gel based wwtp 16 based on lab scale findings the field scale municipal wastewater treatment system of capacity 50 m3 d was installed in a small vicinity of kirtinagar city of uttarakhand state india situated on the bank of river alaknanda the main objective of this study was to evaluate the novel post anoxic integrated biofilm process for wastewater treatment and reclamation under variable seasonal conditions shock loads simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd and microbial dynamics in the system the microbial community analysis reveal the dynamic behavior of microbes and helps in assess the long term effects of operational conditions and correlate the community characteristics with bioreactor functionality a profound investigation of the microbial community development and relationship with the process efficiency and an in depth assessment of the community structure have not been well reported also limited information is available on cost analysis of wwtps in india 17 18 therefore cost assessment was correspondingly conducted to realize the economic feasibility of the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 process description small scale 50 m3 d wwtp comprised of receiving chamber

the activated sludge from the bottom of the tube settler is recirculated to the anoxic tank and the excess sludge is transferred to the sludge holding tank the excess sludge is dewatered with the help of a basket centrifuge the total hrt of the process was 6 h and the plant was operated with an average solid retention time srt of 10 days a brief description of each unit is given in supplementary

analysis of sludge pva gel beads were washed and the biomass sludge was collected a sample of 25 μl in the four replicates was used to count the protozoans under phase contrast illumination 100 magnifications 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational parameters during start up phase raw sewage temperature varied between 25 and 30 c from may 2018 to november 2018 followed by a dip between 20 and 25 c in november 2018 and 8 19 c in january 2019 supplementary table s4 later the temperature was increased to 24 c until march 2019 ph values of the influent effluent and inside three biological reactors were in the range of 6 5 8 0 the oxidation reduction potential orp values of pva gel anoxic and aeration tank were observed to be 38 mv to 130 mv 60 mv to 162 mv and 39 mv to 92 mv respectively a positive and negative value of orp revealed the stability of the oxic and anoxic reactors dissolved oxygen do values observed in range from 3 3 to 7 5 mg l pva gel tank 0 1 to 0 25 mg l anoxic tank and 2 6 to 5 5 mg l aeration tank respectively these values indicated the optimum range of do inside the reactors is necessary for better performance of the plant kuraray japan provided the pva gel beads media diameter 3 4 mm for the study and reported media life of 25 years and can be used continuously 23 supplementary table s5 and fig s10 3 2 performance evaluation of integrated system 3 2 1 organics matter and total nitrogen removal the average values of bod cod and tss in the influent varied from 58 14 to 451 14 mg l 88 15 to 1049 117 mg l and 145 18 to 486 18 mg l respectively from may 2018 to march 2019 fig 1 after start up period of 1 month the process attained steady state and value of bod cod and tss in the effluent were observed to be 10 mg l 80 removal 40 mg l 88 removal and 10 mg l 94 removal respectively throughout the study period except in november a shock load was observed in november due to illegal discharge of milk by product during festival time resulting in incoming wastewater with high bod cod and tss the average values of nh4 n and t n in the influent varied from 12 1 3 to 39 6 14 mg l and 14 9 3 to 39 8 7 mg l respectively from may 2018 to march 2019 in steady state the value of nh4 n and t n in the effluent were 2 mg l 79 removal and 10 mg l 92 removal respectively during the entire study period except in november 2018 during the shock load condition the rate of nitrification and denitrification was affected but system buffer capacity control the process and the process recovered itself in a short period 3 2 2 role of temperature on bod ammonia and total nitrogen removal the effect of temperature variations on organics and nutrient removal was studied the findings show that the bod removal efficiency of the system was 85 least affected by temperature changes as the temperature dependency of microbial activity is not very much significant for organic matter removal i e heterotrophic microbes even function at temperatures as low as 5 c 11 24 25 it might be due to the bod removal process taking place in three biological reactors a part of bod was oxidized by pva gel tank while the remaining was consumed in the anoxic tank for denitrification and the residual was removed in the aeration tank nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies of the system were 85 and 75 and also not affected by temperature variation it was due to the major part of ammonia being oxidized in pva gel tank and the remaining part getting removed in the aeration tank and nitrogen removal occurred in pva gel by the process of snd anoxic tank by denitrification and remaining part in the aeration tank earlier experiences have shown that ammonia n and total nitrogen removal efficiencies in the mbbr process based on different media other than pva gel were affected by temperature variation 25 while in pva gel based mbbr the effect of temperature was negligible on ammonia n and total nitrogen removal 11 26 3 2 3 pathogens removal the pathogens removal efficiency was examined based on culture plate technique for indicator organisms fc and e coli salmonella shigella and pseudomonas species fc values were decreased from 21 000 24 000 mpn 100 ml inlet to 290 340 mpn 100 ml outlet these numbers were further reduced to 170 270 mpn 100 ml after chlorination chlorine dose 1 5 mg l e coli species values were deduced from the 19 000 21 000 cfu 100 ml in inlet to 120 210 cfu 100 ml in effluent and 150 190 cfu 100 ml after chlorination salmonella species were reduced from 120 to 230 cfu 100 ml to 57 92 cfu 100 ml these numbers were further reduced to 37 48 cfu 100 ml by chlorination similarly shigella and pseudomonas species were reduced from 124 to 270 cfu 100 ml and 135 210 cfu 100 ml to 69 79 cfu 100 ml and 56 89 cfu 100 ml respectively during biological treatment supplementary table s6 these numbers of both shigella and pseudomonas species were further reduced to 37 45 cfu 100 ml by chlorination salmonella species 3 log and shigella species 2 log reduction relate to the greater pathogen removal efficacy moreover the effluent fecal coliforms numbers satisfy world health organization who effluent reuse standard of 1000 mpn 100 ml earlier studies show the pathogens reduced in pva gel beads based reactor treating municipal wastewater 2 a large number of beneficial microbes developed and attached to media pva gel beads however the process can effectively reduce the pathogens through the mechanism of autolysis 13 but addition of the aeration tank in the wwtps enhanced the pathogen removal efficacy attributing to the bacterial competition within the system and predation by the protozoans 22 although chlorine dosing system consists of metering pump of 12 l h capacity and 50 l tank through which hypochlorite solution is fed in the chlorine contact tank hypochlorite solution with 7 chlorine and 10 purity is used for disinfection and only 2 3 ppm dosing is enough for complete disinfection 3 2 4 microbial diversity bacterial community composition and diversity were studied using operational taxonomic units otus based 16sr rna analysis alpha proteobacteria show a significant role in organic matter removal nitrifiers played an important role in the conversion of total nitrogen in wwtp to nitrate nitrospira species were the dominating nitrite oxidizers nitrosomonas species was responsible for ammonia oxidizing into nitrite during the metabolic process table 1 flavobacteriales and pesudomonas species prevailing in the system attributed to the denitrification process 41 denitrifies includes the species of clostridium pseudomonas and flavobacterium phylum firmicutes was also identified as denitrifying bacteria 27 actinobacteria species were the gram positive bacteria having 98 similarity and act as a dominating bacterial group in the removal of phosphorus 28 29 nitrosomonadales species of genus betaproteobacteria has been previously reported as the primary ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob respectively in wastewater treatment system 27 30 taxonomic analysis of bacterial community up to phylum and genus level describe in supplementary fig s18 3 2 5 enumeration of microfaunal species microscopic analysis carried out revealed a significant presence of microfauna such as such as arcella amoeba paranema flagellates ciliates such as litonotus aspidisca and vorticella rotifers as aelosoma and filamentous bacteria table 2 the presence of microbiota at the surface of gel beads is responsible for efficient degradation of organics as its large surface area is used by the microbes for the process of adsorption 13 22 assemblages of filamentous organisms according to their morphological physiological characteristics and the grouped environments are given in table 3 the higher number of arcella species relates to the higher level of aeration and better nitrification activity 22 aerobic zone growers such as type 1701 nostocoida limicola preferred optimum srt and high substrate concentrations microthrix parvicella favoured high organic loading conditions whereas species such as nocardia leads to foaming conditions different species of filamentous strains are associated with varied operating conditions of the wastewater treatment system studying the sludge condition helps in avoiding the operational problems of bulking and foaming in the aerobic systems 31 overall the quality of the sludge showed excellent settling features i e svi 50 ml g and sv30 of 200 250 ml l 3 3 performance assessment of biological reactors the performance evaluation of each biological reactor was conducted for organic matter and nitrogen removal pva gel tank was designed for the oxidation of organics and ammonia thus evaluated for soluble cod scod and nh4 n removal rates to determine the effect of different operational parameters like temperature and loading rate 3 3 1 soluble cod removal scod removal rate has been increased gradually with increment in temperature ranges 8 to 30 c the scod removal efficiency was decreased from 66 to 36 upon decreasing the temperature from 30 to 8 c respectively fig 2a with a rise in temperature the microbial community diversity increases in higher amounts i e a diverse and dense microbiome are present in the working temperature range as compared with low temperature range 5 thus the overall microbial activity increases lead to enhancement in scod removal rate cod removal efficiency was decreased with a decrease in temperature 13 pva gel based system can remove about 40 of scod effectively in the winter season ambient 10 c and about 65 of scod in the summer season the scod removal rate increased with the enhanced scod loading rate in the pva gel tank fig 2b this might be due to the higher availability of organic matter as the organic load increases growth of heterotrophic bacteria also increases and hence results in a high removal rate the removal rate follows first order kinetics the maximum scod loading rate was 20 kg scod m3 gel d and the corresponding scod removal rate was 16 kg scod m3 gel d the system can be effectively loaded with 20 kg scod m3 gel d where the cod removal rate might increase or become constant as observed in earlier studies 9 in a conventional mbbr process scod removal rate increased with the enhanced scod loading rate kg scod m3 gel d 8 9 3 3 2 nitrification in pva gel reactor availability of sufficient d o and higher specific surface area of pva gel beads resulted in higher nitrification rate however the ammonia removal efficiency of pva gel system was reduced with the decreasing temperature as shown in fig 3a in the temperature range of 15 to 30 c the nitrification rate or ammonia removal rate was not affected as the ammonia removal was 90 within the temperature range of 20 30 c however the nitrification rate was decreased from 90 to 50 at a temperature lower than 15 c this might be due to the lower activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob below 15 c 5 32 the biofilm thickness on the surface of beads increased as the temperature decreased and may be reduced the oxygen diffusion rate inside the biofilm it indicates the formation of anoxic zone inside the beads that leads to a decrease in nitrification rate earlier studies on mbbr with pva gel and other beads like kaldnes k1 demonstrated that the nitrification rate was decreased as the operating temperature was decreased 5 11 13 32 to determine the relationship between ammonia loading rate alr and nitrification rate the ammonia loading rate and nitrification rate curve were plotted fig 3b pva gel media was designed for the maximum loading rate of 6 kg nh4 m3 gel d and the optimum dosing of ammonia was 3 kg nh4 m3 gel d for enhanced nitrification rate 4 as ammonia loading rate was increased the nitrification rate also increased and accomplished a threshold once ammonia loading rate attains 3 2 kg nh4 m3 gel d the nitrification rate was increased and achieved its threshold limit during the initial nitrification rate increment the rate follows the first order and after that the order of reaction was reduced at 3 2 kg nh4 m3 gel d ammonia loading rate the nitrification rate accomplished the threshold limit therefore ammonia loading rate of 3 2 kg nh4 m3 gel d can be considered as the optimum rate the maximum nitrification rate corresponding to the optimum ammonia loading rate was 2 4 kg nh4 m3 gel d in the previous studies the nitrification rate depends on the ammonia loading rate and the increment in ammonia loading rate results in enhanced nitrification rate 5 11 33 3 3 3 snd in pva gel reactor nitrogen removal in a pva gel media reactor was accomplished by nitrification of ammonia to nitrate and snd of ammonia to nitrogen gas in pva gel tank a limited supply of air oxygen inside the core of pva gel media leads to the development of the anoxic zone however a large specific surface area and abundance of high do concentration on the outer surface of media leads to a higher nitrification rate these results are similar to observations of other researchers 34 35 snd rate was calculated by a specified equation 35 snd 1 no 3 produced nh 4 oxidized 100 the findings revealed that the snd rate was between 75 and 90 at a temperature scale from 10 to 25 c fig 4a an snd rate was dropped up to 50 within an increased temperature range above 25 to 35 c this might be due to different factors and conditions like temperature dependency of biofilm thickness nitrification rate denitrification rate and microbial activity 5 32 the biofilm thickness on the surface of beads increased as the temperature decreased 5 it limits the d o concentration inside the beads or inner surface of biofilm and results in a good denitrification rate snd rate decreased at a low cod n ratio 10 due to the availability of inadequate soluble carbon source which act as a source of electron donor during the nitrification process by autotrophic bacteria 34 these conditions were observed during the monsoon season when the organic loading rate olr was low similarly snd rate also decreased at high cod n 20 with the increase of cod n ratio heterotrophic bacteria gradually become dominated over autotrophs and compete with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob for the available do and surface area 34 in pva gel tank the best snd rate was achieved between 10 and 20 cod n ratio fig 4b whereas the best snd rate was reported in between 8 and 15 cod n ratio by another study 34 the anoxic reactor was designed and integrated into the process chain to denitrify the nitrate generated in the pva gel reactor the soluble carbon source used for electron donating in the denitrification process 36 was provided by 20 augmented wastewater to the anoxic tank the snd was predominant in pva gel tank as low nitrate 4 5 mg l was available in the anoxic tank almost 90 of nitrate was converted to nitrogen gas in this reactor fig 5a denitrification rate was almost constant until the temperature dropped to 10 c whereas the nitrate removal decreased to 60 70 as denitrifying bacteria i e heterotrophs are sensitive to decrease in the temperature 5 36 37 nitrate removal was also affected by cod n ratio as shown in fig 5 b nitrate removal rate decreased with reduction in cod n ratio i e 7 as sufficient carbon source

12797,in this study the suitability of a novel modified resin gallic acid modified resin ga type resin for silicic acid removal was investigated using fixed bed column adsorption laboratory dynamic experiments were conducted at different flow rates bed heights and influent concentrations with rising flow rate the breakthrough time exhaust time and absorption capacity of the column bed decreased while increasing with column bed height with the increasing influent concentration from 20 mg l to 60 mg l decrease in both breakthrough time and exhaust time but an increase in adsorption capacity from 3 73 mg g to 4 20 mg g to simulate the experimental breakthrough curves btcs and predict the column dynamics basic and empirical models bed depth service time bdst thomas and yoon nelson models as well as an artificial intelligence approach artificial neural network ann model were applied all three conventional models were able to reflect well the behavior for silicic acid continuous adsorption with ga type resin and estimated the characteristic model parameters for removal ann model had a higher accuracy r2 0 9997 in predicting btcs and predicting breakthrough times analyzing the parameters obtained from the simulation of the ann model the initial concentration was found to have the highest relative importance of 32 94 and the specific order of relative importance was as follows initial concentration column height flow rate total running time furthermore due to its certain regeneration potential ga type resin can be recycled making it a promising material for removing silicic acid from water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords silicic acid fixed bed column adsorption breakthrough curve traditional models artificial neural network 1 introduction silicon as the second most common element in the earth s crust is abundant in the lithosphere hydrosphere and biosphere in the hydrosphere silicon primarily exists as silicic acid by means of a concentration of approximately 10 60 mg l 1 however the polysilicic acid is formed by self polymerization in water when the silicic acid concentration is supersaturated with respect to the solubility of silica typically 50 60 mg l as si at near neutral ph and 25 c 2 3 and eventually forms silica sio2 therefore in the water utilization system the silica or silicate minerals such as calcium silicate and magnesium silicate are formed due to the evaporation of water and adhere to the equipment walls or surfaces to form silica scale 4 once formed it can cause equipment corrosion and significantly shorten the lifetime of the water treatment plant facility additionally due to lower flow or membrane obstruction operational service costs and resource consumption would be correspondingly higher and in severe instances might even result in unplanned downtime and impair system efficiency 5 this kind of phenomenon ubiquitous exists in thermal power plants industrial boilers and oil recovery fields seriously affecting the production process 6 7 during the cooling process involved in the operation of thermal power plants the rapid temperature drop of the cooling towers can over saturate silica and lead to large amounts of silica precipitating on the heat exchanger reducing the efficiency of the power plant 8 silica scale has now become a major obstacle to the cost effectiveness and sustainable operation of engineered systems in some industries to ensure product quality and safe production there are strict requirements for the concentration of silicic acid in the feed water the paper mills limit the silicic acid concentration in the feed water from 100 mg l down to 20 mg l as the paper quality improves 9 the beverage and food industries require silicic acid concentration in the water below 10 mg l 10 in highly accurate industries like the electronics industry the limit on silicic acid concentration is even more strict only 1 μg l 11 in this regard silicic acid removal should be fully considered in different feed water treatment systems nevertheless effective treatment technologies for the removal of silicic acid are still limited 12 because of its affinity for hydrophobic contaminants activated carbon is commonly utilized in water treatment operations nevertheless its implications on hydrophilic soluble silicic acid are relatively poor 13 although chemical flocculants such as lime caustic soda or poly aluminum chloride are effective accompanying generate large amounts of sludge and cause negative physiochemical changes e g high ph high temperature which require additional treatment processes 14 15 in contrast adsorption processes are considered a potentially effective and economical method because they are efficient simple and low cost 16 anion exchange resins are a highly worthwhile research adsorbent for silicic acid removal and the removal rate can achieve 94 at ph 12 17 other metal ions such as ca2 or mg2 precipitate as hydroxides in this ph range forming the hydroxides scale furthermore other common anions like co3 2 and so4 2 experience competing adsorption limiting the efficacy of the silicate ion exchange anion exchange resins can only remove silicate ions and have limited influence on silicic acid molecular and polymeric forms therefore some researchers have modified the resin to improve its selective adsorption capacity oohara et al grafted zirconium hydroxide onto the resin to adsorb silicic acid from the water and the new resin can remove up to 95 of silicic acid the initial concentration is 500 mg l as si and the resin has regenerative properties 18 a gallic acid ga modified resin has been prepared by grafting in our previous studies and the adsorption capacity for silicic acid was 30 40 times higher 8 99 mg g as si than that of the original resin oh type resin which has been demonstrated by performing the batch adsorption experiments 19 despite the fact that batch tests may give fundamental information regarding adsorption effectiveness there is a gap between optimum laboratory operating settings and actual applications dynamic adsorption experiments on the other hand allow for the prediction and modeling of breakthrough curves btcs in a simple mode of operation and are easily scaled up in industrial applications acting as a connection between laboratory scale and practical applications in addition their ability to handle large numbers of solutions makes them more realistic for calculating design parameters for practical applications 20 several mathematical models for fixed bed btcs have been developed to anticipate real adsorption performance without the need of experimental equipment and to offer successful design information for columns 21 there are three representative models for describing the dynamic adsorption performance of fixed bed columns namely the bed depth service time bdst thomas and yoon nelson models which have been playing an important role to date 22 talat et al successfully used bdst thomas and yoon nelson models analyze and describe the btcs of fluoride adsorption by coconut activated carbon in a fixed bed column 23 nath et al chose the adams bohart yoon nelson and thomas models to fit the btcs for the removal of malachite green by bacillus cereus m116 and determined the kinetic characteristics parameters providing an effective guide for industrial design 24 artificial neural networks anns are a fast growing technology for dealing with extremely nonlinear systems ann models do not rely on assumptions about the nature of phenomenological mechanisms or comprehension of the mathematical underpinnings of the underlying processes the feed forward structure also known as multilayer perception mlp is the most widely used ann model of the system a representative model of mlp is a feed forward bp back propagation neural network 25 it has gained particularly high importance in recent years in the fields of pollution management and modeling analysis where it has been successfully used to simulate the adsorption removal process of pollutants such as heavy metal ions inorganic acids salts and dyes among other amiri et al employed anns to predict hg ii removal by ostrich bone ash nzvi composite in a fixed bed column and found that anns could be a more accurate and time saving alternative to laboratory measurements 26 wang et al used ann to predict the removal of boron by magnetic metal organic rame based composite well with a correlation coefficient of 0 993 between the predicted and actual experimental values 27 ghadge et al performed an accurate modeling and simulation of the degradation rate for rhodamine b dye during hydraulic cavitation using ann 28 however the anns are black box models and their fundamental coding mechanisms have not been fully revealed which adds to the spatial complexity besides there are also drawbacks i e over fitting the increase in processing time caused by the huge input 29 combining ann models with other algorithms is a frequently used approach to circumvent its technical disadvantages some researchers established a genetic neural model by combining genetic algorithms and anns which successfully predicted the removal of methylene blue aq by three bio adsorbents 30 and the removal of pb ii and cr vi from aqueous solution by rice husk 31 in this study it was the first time that the potential of a new resin ga type resin to remove silicic acid in a fixed bed column was investigated providing evidence to justify its use to regulate silicic acid concentrations during the actual water utilization process btcs described the performance of the fixed bed column using a plot of the final and initial effluent silicic acid concentrations versus time the impact of various operational factors such as flow rate bed height and original silicic acid concentration on the morphology of the btcs was investigated the obtained experimental results were then fitted to three traditional models of either the bdst thomas and yoon nelson as well as a modern ann model in order to assess the validity guidance and accuracy the innovation in this study is the use of ann models to simulate and predict the removal of silicic acid by adsorption of ga type resins in a fixed bed column this study can provide support for the future promotion and application of ga type resins in practical engineering process 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods analytical quality chemical reagents were used throughout the experiment shanghai maclin biochemical co ltd provided amberlite ira402 cl resin anion exchange capacity 2 0 mequiv dry g and gallic acid ga sodium metasilicate na2sio3 9h2o was purchased from fujifilm wako pure chemical co all solutions were produced with ultra pure water milli q sp system merck millipore the concentration of silicic acid in the starting solution and effluent was measured using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c for practical purposes the dilute solutions of hcl and naoh were employed to alter the ph of the solution the silicic acid concentration was expressed in this research as si mg l 2 2 preparation of the ga type resin stirring the strong base anion exchange resins 0 5 g for 26 h in ga solution 100 ml 2 5 g l ph 6 5 ml of ga solution was taken at certain time intervals and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the resulting filtrate was scanned over the whole 200 800 nm wavelength range by a uv vis spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of ga the grafted resins were washed three times with water after being filtered through a paper filter they were then air dried for 1 day at room temperature 32 the quantity of ga grafted on the resins qga was then estimated as eq 1 which related to the difference between the initial solution and the filtrate concentrations 1 q ga c c e v m where c mg l and ce mg l is the initial and equilibrium ga concentration respectively v ml and m g stand for the volume of solution and resin mass respectively 2 3 fixed bed column experiments for the fixed bed investigations a glass cylinder with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 15 cm was used as a column the experimental setup is depicted schematically in fig 1 ga type resins were used to pack the column a variable speed peristaltic pump longer pump yz1515x and a 5 mm diameter silicone tube were used to continuously feed the sodium silicate solution from the reservoir into the reactor the effluent from the bottom of the bed enters the sample collection chamber through a silicone tube with the use of a peristaltic pump the column was filled with modified resins and had a layer of glass wool at the bottom the bed heights h were 4 4 5 and 5 cm corresponding to 10 51 g 11 52 g and 14 56 g of ga type resins flow rates of 0 9 2 5 ml min were applied with starting silicic acid concentrations of 20 40 and 60 mg l at certain intervals wastewater samples were collected when the silicic acid concentration in the effluent approached 99 of the original concentration the flow was halted 33 to acquire btcs spectrophotometry shimadzu uv 3600 was used to determine the silicic acid content in the succeeding fractions this method is based on the generation of yellow molybdosilicic acid at 400 nm wavelength 34 2 4 fixed bed column data analysis btcs can be used as a criterion to assess the fixed bed column performance which is a plot of ct c0 versus time t under specified conditions and would be capable of being used to measure the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent within certain operating parameters 23 35 the breakthrough time tb which is the time corresponding to a certain breakthrough concentration is also an essential property for defining the dynamic loading behavior in a fixed bed column for adsorbent removal 36 since there is no limit for silicic acid concentration in the national standard the breakthrough time selected for this study is the time when the effluent silicic acid concentration was 10 mg l which is based on the silicic acid concentration required in some industrial water 9 37 the effluent volume veff that this column can handle was estimated using the equation below 2 v eff q t e where q is the flow rate ml min and te min is the exhaust time the amount of silicic acid which has been adsorbed in the fixed bed column qtotal mg was calculated from the area under the btcs 38 3 q total qa 1000 q 1000 t 0 t t e c 0 c t dt where q is the flow rate ml min and a is the area under the btcs ct mg l and c0 mg l denote the silicic acid concentrations of the effluent and influent respectively the maximum adsorbent uptake capacity qe mg g can be defined according to eq 4 4 q e q total m where m g represents the dry weight of adsorbent the total silicic acid removal efficiency r was computed by dividing the mass of adsorbed silicic acid qtotal through the total quantity of silicic acid injected into the column as follows 5 r 1000 q total c 0 qt e 100 2 5 breakthrough curve model fitting optimization of operating parameters at the experimental scale is arduous expensive and time consuming but it can be effectively avoided by modeling the btcs 39 conventional breakthrough equations the bdst thomas and yoon nelson models have yielded a broad range of guiding parameters in prior column investigations 22 34 ann is a data driven model that emulates biological neural networks to implement distributed and parallel information processing and it has recently gained widespread use in the pollution management and modeling analysis fields 2 5 1 bdst model the time approach simplified model bdst was proposed by adams bohart for the design of carbon adsorption columns this model enables prediction of how long the adsorbent can adsorb from the aqueous solution before depletion 40 it establishes the link between service time t and bed depth h the linear form of the bdst model is written in eq 6 6 t n 0 c 0 ν h 1 c 0 k bdst ln c 0 c t 1 where t min is the service time the column adsorption capacity is n0 mg l c0 and ct mg l are the influent and effluent concentration respectively h cm is the bed depth the rate constant is represented by kbdst l mg min the empty column flow rate is ν cm min 2 5 2 thomas model one of the most versatile and extensively used models in column performance theory the thomas model can handle continuous mode survey column data and determine the maximum solid phase concentration and adsorption rate constant on the adsorbent 41 under the premise that the derivation process is consistent with langmuir adsorption kinetics and there is no axial dispersion the driving force of adsorption obeys second order reversible reaction kinetics 42 the following is the nonlinear thomas model 7 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th q th m q k th c 0 t where kth is the thomas rate constant ml mg min q is the volume flow rate l min and the resin mass is denoted by m g qth mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the column 2 5 3 yoon nelson model yoon nelson developed a relatively simple model it relies on the rate at which the adsorption potential for each adsorbent molecule decreases in direct proportion to the adsorbent adsorption potential while being influenced by adsorbent breakthrough probability 43 eq 8 can be used to represent the nonlinear yoon nelson model 8 c t c 0 exp k yn t τ k yn 1 exp k yn t τ k yn where the yoon nelson rate constant is kyn l mg min and τ is the time min required when the concentration ct mg l reaches 50 of the initial concentration c0 mg l 2 5 4 ann model artificial neural networks are developed similar to the working model of the brain with powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities self learning and fault tolerance 44 anns have three layers which include an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer each layer of the network includes a number of treatment elements called neurons the input and output layers have the same number of neurons as the number of known independent and dependent parameters respectively 21 the neural network tool box of matlab r2018b was used to develop the ann model the mean squared error mse as given in eq 9 was utilized to evaluate the training validation and testing performance 9 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbents to calculate the grafting amount of ga on the resin a measurement of full wavelength scanning spectra of the solution was carried out during the modification process as shown in fig 2a the peak top at 260 nm gradually decreased with time indicating that a part of ga has been grafted onto the resin based on the curve in fig 2b the concentrations of ga in the initial and final filtrate after 26 h were 2 46 g l and 0 69 mg l respectively the grafting amount was 354 14 mg g calculated from eq 1 morphologically it was observed that the original oh type resin was light yellow and changed to dark brown after grafting fig 2a meanwhile to further verify the grafting of ga on the resin the ft ir spectra of the samples were measured using a fourier transform ir spectrometer nicolet 5700 as shown in fig s1 and table s1 for comparison the ft ir spectrum of pure ga and oh type resin were also measured under the same condition observing the spectra of the three substances above three distinct characteristic peaks appeared in the spectrum for the ga type resin located at 3498 cm 1 1721 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 corresponding to the phenolic hydroxyl group ar o h the co stretching and co stretching of the carboxyl group on ga respectively 45 46 all of these proved that ga was successfully grafted onto the resin 3 2 effect of operating variables on silicic acid adsorption in fixed bed column 3 2 1 effect of flow rate the flow rate which affects the residence time of the water stream in the column is one of the most critical parameters affecting the efficacy of a fixed bed column in eliminating impurities 47 fig 3a shows the effect of varying the flow rate in the range of 0 9 2 5 ml min on the silicic acid removal from the aqueous solution by the ga type resins with the bed height and initial silicic acid concentration set at 4 5 cm and 40 mg l respectively the column breakthrough time decreased as the flow rate increased with flow rates of 0 9 ml min and 2 5 ml min corresponding to breakthrough times of 959 and 232 min respectively concurrently the column capacity decreased from 4 87 mg g to 2 54 mg g table 1 this is evident because contact duration decreases as flow rate increases resulting in a decrease in adsorption behavior 22 34 at a slow flow rate the silicic acid passing through the adsorption column has sufficient time to contact the resin and the hydroxyl functional groups on the resin will sufficiently engage with the silicic acid when the flow rate of the system increases the effective time for the adsorption reduces and the effluent silicic acid concentration will rapidly reach the initial value leading to an early breakthrough 3 2 2 effect of bed height the bed height influences the adsorption site number and the residence time of the solution in the column both of them are critical factors in a continuous adsorption system fig 3b shows the btcs for silicic acid adsorption at various bed heights 4 4 5 and 5 5 cm when the flow rate was 1 5 ml min and the starting concentration was 40 mg l as the bed height raised from 4 cm to 5 5 cm the breakthrough time increased from 397 min to 612 min the bed capacity and adsorption efficiency rose from 3 22 mg g to 4 10 mg g when bed height increased the solution residence duration within the adsorption column increased as the bed height increased the silicic acid penetrates deeper into the modified resin enhancing the effectiveness of removal 48 higher absorption rates were observed at the greatest bed heights because increasing the bed height is comparable to increasing the adsorbent surface area which offers more binding sites to the adsorption process 49 the treated effluent volume breakthrough time and exhaust time all increased with increasing bed height table 1 the most important parameter in the process is breakthrough time the longer it is the greater the column adsorption capacity 3 2 3 effect of initial concentration three different initial concentrations of silicic acid 20 40 and 60 mg l were used to evaluate the effect of the initial concentration on the btcs at this stage the bed height and flow rate were 4 5 cm and 1 5 ml min respectively the results obtained are shown in fig 3c and table 1 the breakthrough time reduces as the initial concentration increases and the btcs get steeper the ct c0 on the ordinate axis were 0 5 0 25 and 0 167 for the outlet silicic acid concentrations up to 10 mg l corresponding to 20 40 and 60 mg l initial concentrations respectively the resin increased the experimental adsorption capacity from 3 73 mg g to 4 20 mg g the reason is that the increasing initial silicic acid concentration increases the mass transfer driving force of the adsorption process the silicic acid rapidly occupies the adsorption sites on the resin within a short time 50 however the removal rate decreased from 58 29 to 44 78 as the initial inlet concentration increased from 20 mg l to 60 mg l this fact was due to that although the contact of silicic acid with the adsorption sites enhanced with the increasing inlet concentration the effluent concentration also increased while the breakthrough time shortened resulting in a lower removal rate 3 3 breakthrough curve modeling the findings of the column adsorption data were evaluated using three classic models namely bdst thomas and yoon nelson and the current intelligence ann model with the aim of predicting the relative critical parameters and measuring the dynamic properties of silicic acid from the column and the suitability of the above models to describe the adsorption process of the adsorbent was judged using r squared r2 and mean square error mse 3 3 1 application of bdst model the bdst model which employs experimentally acquired adsorption parameters to derive a connection between service time t and bed depth h is one of the most often used models in column studies this makes it easier to investigate the two parameters in the bdst model which describe the adsorption properties of the adsorbent kbdst and n0 the results for bed depth and breakthrough time tb at column bed depths of 4 4 5 and 5 5 cm are plotted in fig 4 for 20 60 and 90 breakthrough points and the respective values of all kbdst and n0 at different breakthrough points are listed in table 2 all of the fitted curves for bdst showed a significant linear connection and well correlate the fitted curves of the bdst model showed significant linearity and all had high correlation coefficients r2 0 96 which indicated its validity as the breakthrough percentage increased from 20 to 90 the dynamic removal capacity increased from 6 61 mg l to 29 96 mg l at lower breakthrough values certain active sites of the resin remained unoccupied so the column was still not saturated in which case the dynamic removal capacity is necessarily weaker than the full bed capacity of the resin 51 3 3 2 application of thomas model the thomas model has a widespread application in fitting adsorption btc and determining the adsorption capacity of specific adsorbent adsorbent systems the reasonable accuracy of predicting btcs under various operating conditions is its most significant advantage 52 fig 5 shows the comparison of the experimental and predicted btcs under different operating conditions according to the nonlinear thomas equation and the fitting parameters listed in table 3 as seen in table 3 not only were the r2 values higher and mse lower but also the column adsorption capacity qthexp was very close to the fitted values of qthcal at each operation condition demonstrating that the thomas model can successfully predict the continuous silicic acid adsorption process by ga type resins under various operational conditions it was observed that the value of kth decreased with an increase in influent concentration and bed height but increased for an increase in flow rate these results can be related to the fact that the high concentration causes external mass transfer in the system dynamics during the first phase of column adsorption in contrast increasing the bed height or slowing the flow rate may increase flow resistance and to some extent reduce the mass transfer effect 24 3 3 3 application of yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model is not only simple but it also doesn t require precise parameters of the adsorbent and adsorbent bed qualities 53 fig 6 depicts the yoon nelson model fitting plots corresponding to the different operating parameters and the parameters of the results are given in table 4 the r2 of the model fitting for all operating circumstances was 0 98 and mse values ranged from 0 000784 to 0 002704 confirming the remarkable accuracy of the yoon nelson model in describing the silicic acid adsorption behavior on ga type resins furthermore the obtained values qyncal and τcal had a similar relationship with the experimental values qykexp τexp which indicated that the yoon nelson model is well adapted to the column adsorption process kyn increases with increasing flow rate and concentration but τ decreases as the possibility for proper interaction between silicic acid and adsorption sites decrease kyn progressively decreased as bed height increased but τ increased indicating that an increase in adsorbent content favored silicic acid contact but prolonged the adsorption time 3 3 4 application of ann model to predict the adsorption capacity on silicic acid of ga type resins an ann in a three layer feed forward model was built which used the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm to train the bp neural network and as activation functions by the hidden and output layers the tan sigmoid and linear transfer functions were chosen respectively table s2 54 while bed height flow rate initial concentration and total effluent time used as input to the network are shown in fig 7a table s3 lists the variables for the input and output in order the dataset was split into three groups at random of which 70 was used to train the network 15 was used for cross validation and 15 was used to test the reliability of the ann model and its prediction results 55 the neurons number in the hidden layer affects the operation of the ann model hence different numbers of neurons must be used to identify the appropriate number of hidden layers 54 the connection between the mse and the neurons number in the hidden layer is shown in fig 7b throughout the training testing and validation process it was found that six neurons had the lowest mse this was chosen as the optimal productivity for ann simulation fig s2 fig 7c depicts the correlation between the experimental and ann model prediction data the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9997 in the figure confirmed a good fit between the experimental results and the ann predictions fig s3 this result implied that the ann simulation has a satisfactory demonstration for ga type resins adsorbing silicic acid and therefore the ann model can accurately predict the silicic acid uptake during the adsorption of the dynamic fixed bed column and guide the actual water treatment process the weighting matrix as listed in table s4 was employed to determine the relative relevance of the input variables to the output variables 54 55 fig 7d presents the relative relevance for the input variables with a relative value of 32 94 the starting concentration was deemed the most relevant parameter this was succeeded by column height 23 61 flow rate 23 37 and total running time 20 08 in dynamic adsorption the initial concentration affects the contact rate between the silicic acid in the feed water and the adsorption sites and the increasing concentration of the influent accelerates the reaction rate with the adsorbent sites and becomes the first important variable affecting the adsorption capacity the column height is linked to the adsorption surface area and the number of adsorption sites and its increasing gives the silicic acid a more adequate opportunity to contact the adsorbent moreover the flow rate also affects the reaction rate of silicic acid in the column after contact with the adsorbent in this study the total running time has a weak influence on adsorption capacity one possible reason is that the capacity of the adsorbent has a certain limit and changing the total effluent time can t fundamentally influence the properties of the adsorbent 3 4 adsorption mechanism in aqueous solution the form of ga varies with ph due to the different acidity coefficients pka1 4 41 pka2 8 45 56 when the ph exceeds 4 41 the carboxyl group on ga is deprotonated to become negatively charged and can be grafted to the anion exchange resin though ion exchange the adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies have been reported in detail in earlier study 19 the adsorption of silicic acid by ga type resins could be well described by the temkin isotherm which indicated the silicic acid adsorbed on ga type resin occurs as chemisorption 57 the hydroxyl groups of ga face outward and interact with silicic acid molecules to form gallate silicon complexes c7o5h3 si oh 2 by dehydration condensation reaction which bind the silicic acid to the grafted resin fig 8 3 5 proper disposal of contaminated adsorbent resin adsorption and regeneration is a reversible process when the adsorption of ion exchange resin reaches saturation its exchange capacity declines which affects the adsorption efficiency 58 it is necessary to regenerate the resin in time normally hcl and naoh are used as regenerants to dissolve the adsorbate and restore the adsorption capacity in our previous studies the use of hcl as an eluent was found to have relatively little effect on the amount of silicic acid absorbed after resin regeneration 19 after three regeneration cycles using the same hcl and naoh concentrations the resin could still reach 51 28 of its initial value when hcl was used as the regenerant while that of naoh was only 33 64 the initial adsorption capacity of the resin was 4 31 mg g the acid regenerant removed the silicic acid in molecular form

economics of its production were evaluated in consideration of the prospective large scale application of ga type resin in practical engineering the materials required to produce ga type resin are strong basic anion exchange resin and gallic acid both of which cost 37 cny kg and 26 5 cny kg respectively the alibaba com purchasing platform provides the raw material costs june 2022 according to the ga type resin synthesis process the chemical cost required to produce this adsorbent is 50 25 cny kg 4 conclusions in this experiment the continuous capability of the ga type resin to remove silicic acid was investigated using a dynamic adsorption column to support the effective control of silicic acid in practical water utilization processes ga type resin has the ability to remove silicic acid in water and because of its regeneration ability it can be recycled to a certain extent the breakthrough time exhaust time and column absorption capacity were shown to increase as bed height increased while decreasing as the influent flow rate increased breakthrough and exhaust times followed the same pattern as flow rate with influent concentration but had the reverse impact on adsorption capacity with a rise in influent concentration increasing adsorption capacity the error between the bed height and the corresponding breakthrough time calculated using the bdst model was

12797,in this study the suitability of a novel modified resin gallic acid modified resin ga type resin for silicic acid removal was investigated using fixed bed column adsorption laboratory dynamic experiments were conducted at different flow rates bed heights and influent concentrations with rising flow rate the breakthrough time exhaust time and absorption capacity of the column bed decreased while increasing with column bed height with the increasing influent concentration from 20 mg l to 60 mg l decrease in both breakthrough time and exhaust time but an increase in adsorption capacity from 3 73 mg g to 4 20 mg g to simulate the experimental breakthrough curves btcs and predict the column dynamics basic and empirical models bed depth service time bdst thomas and yoon nelson models as well as an artificial intelligence approach artificial neural network ann model were applied all three conventional models were able to reflect well the behavior for silicic acid continuous adsorption with ga type resin and estimated the characteristic model parameters for removal ann model had a higher accuracy r2 0 9997 in predicting btcs and predicting breakthrough times analyzing the parameters obtained from the simulation of the ann model the initial concentration was found to have the highest relative importance of 32 94 and the specific order of relative importance was as follows initial concentration column height flow rate total running time furthermore due to its certain regeneration potential ga type resin can be recycled making it a promising material for removing silicic acid from water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords silicic acid fixed bed column adsorption breakthrough curve traditional models artificial neural network 1 introduction silicon as the second most common element in the earth s crust is abundant in the lithosphere hydrosphere and biosphere in the hydrosphere silicon primarily exists as silicic acid by means of a concentration of approximately 10 60 mg l 1 however the polysilicic acid is formed by self polymerization in water when the silicic acid concentration is supersaturated with respect to the solubility of silica typically 50 60 mg l as si at near neutral ph and 25 c 2 3 and eventually forms silica sio2 therefore in the water utilization system the silica or silicate minerals such as calcium silicate and magnesium silicate are formed due to the evaporation of water and adhere to the equipment walls or surfaces to form silica scale 4 once formed it can cause equipment corrosion and significantly shorten the lifetime of the water treatment plant facility additionally due to lower flow or membrane obstruction operational service costs and resource consumption would be correspondingly higher and in severe instances might even result in unplanned downtime and impair system efficiency 5 this kind of phenomenon ubiquitous exists in thermal power plants industrial boilers and oil recovery fields seriously affecting the production process 6 7 during the cooling process involved in the operation of thermal power plants the rapid temperature drop of the cooling towers can over saturate silica and lead to large amounts of silica precipitating on the heat exchanger reducing the efficiency of the power plant 8 silica scale has now become a major obstacle to the cost effectiveness and sustainable operation of engineered systems in some industries to ensure product quality and safe production there are strict requirements for the concentration of silicic acid in the feed water the paper mills limit the silicic acid concentration in the feed water from 100 mg l down to 20 mg l as the paper quality improves 9 the beverage and food industries require silicic acid concentration in the water below 10 mg l 10 in highly accurate industries like the electronics industry the limit on silicic acid concentration is even more strict only 1 μg l 11 in this regard silicic acid removal should be fully considered in different feed water treatment systems nevertheless effective treatment technologies for the removal of silicic acid are still limited 12 because of its affinity for hydrophobic contaminants activated carbon is commonly utilized in water treatment operations nevertheless its implications on hydrophilic soluble silicic acid are relatively poor 13 although chemical flocculants such as lime caustic soda or poly aluminum chloride are effective accompanying generate large amounts of sludge and cause negative physiochemical changes e g high ph high temperature which require additional treatment processes 14 15 in contrast adsorption processes are considered a potentially effective and economical method because they are efficient simple and low cost 16 anion exchange resins are a highly worthwhile research adsorbent for silicic acid removal and the removal rate can achieve 94 at ph 12 17 other metal ions such as ca2 or mg2 precipitate as hydroxides in this ph range forming the hydroxides scale furthermore other common anions like co3 2 and so4 2 experience competing adsorption limiting the efficacy of the silicate ion exchange anion exchange resins can only remove silicate ions and have limited influence on silicic acid molecular and polymeric forms therefore some researchers have modified the resin to improve its selective adsorption capacity oohara et al grafted zirconium hydroxide onto the resin to adsorb silicic acid from the water and the new resin can remove up to 95 of silicic acid the initial concentration is 500 mg l as si and the resin has regenerative properties 18 a gallic acid ga modified resin has been prepared by grafting in our previous studies and the adsorption capacity for silicic acid was 30 40 times higher 8 99 mg g as si than that of the original resin oh type resin which has been demonstrated by performing the batch adsorption experiments 19 despite the fact that batch tests may give fundamental information regarding adsorption effectiveness there is a gap between optimum laboratory operating settings and actual applications dynamic adsorption experiments on the other hand allow for the prediction and modeling of breakthrough curves btcs in a simple mode of operation and are easily scaled up in industrial applications acting as a connection between laboratory scale and practical applications in addition their ability to handle large numbers of solutions makes them more realistic for calculating design parameters for practical applications 20 several mathematical models for fixed bed btcs have been developed to anticipate real adsorption performance without the need of experimental equipment and to offer successful design information for columns 21 there are three representative models for describing the dynamic adsorption performance of fixed bed columns namely the bed depth service time bdst thomas and yoon nelson models which have been playing an important role to date 22 talat et al successfully used bdst thomas and yoon nelson models analyze and describe the btcs of fluoride adsorption by coconut activated carbon in a fixed bed column 23 nath et al chose the adams bohart yoon nelson and thomas models to fit the btcs for the removal of malachite green by bacillus cereus m116 and determined the kinetic characteristics parameters providing an effective guide for industrial design 24 artificial neural networks anns are a fast growing technology for dealing with extremely nonlinear systems ann models do not rely on assumptions about the nature of phenomenological mechanisms or comprehension of the mathematical underpinnings of the underlying processes the feed forward structure also known as multilayer perception mlp is the most widely used ann model of the system a representative model of mlp is a feed forward bp back propagation neural network 25 it has gained particularly high importance in recent years in the fields of pollution management and modeling analysis where it has been successfully used to simulate the adsorption removal process of pollutants such as heavy metal ions inorganic acids salts and dyes among other amiri et al employed anns to predict hg ii removal by ostrich bone ash nzvi composite in a fixed bed column and found that anns could be a more accurate and time saving alternative to laboratory measurements 26 wang et al used ann to predict the removal of boron by magnetic metal organic rame based composite well with a correlation coefficient of 0 993 between the predicted and actual experimental values 27 ghadge et al performed an accurate modeling and simulation of the degradation rate for rhodamine b dye during hydraulic cavitation using ann 28 however the anns are black box models and their fundamental coding mechanisms have not been fully revealed which adds to the spatial complexity besides there are also drawbacks i e over fitting the increase in processing time caused by the huge input 29 combining ann models with other algorithms is a frequently used approach to circumvent its technical disadvantages some researchers established a genetic neural model by combining genetic algorithms and anns which successfully predicted the removal of methylene blue aq by three bio adsorbents 30 and the removal of pb ii and cr vi from aqueous solution by rice husk 31 in this study it was the first time that the potential of a new resin ga type resin to remove silicic acid in a fixed bed column was investigated providing evidence to justify its use to regulate silicic acid concentrations during the actual water utilization process btcs described the performance of the fixed bed column using a plot of the final and initial effluent silicic acid concentrations versus time the impact of various operational factors such as flow rate bed height and original silicic acid concentration on the morphology of the btcs was investigated the obtained experimental results were then fitted to three traditional models of either the bdst thomas and yoon nelson as well as a modern ann model in order to assess the validity guidance and accuracy the innovation in this study is the use of ann models to simulate and predict the removal of silicic acid by adsorption of ga type resins in a fixed bed column this study can provide support for the future promotion and application of ga type resins in practical engineering process 2 experimental 2 1 materials and methods analytical quality chemical reagents were used throughout the experiment shanghai maclin biochemical co ltd provided amberlite ira402 cl resin anion exchange capacity 2 0 mequiv dry g and gallic acid ga sodium metasilicate na2sio3 9h2o was purchased from fujifilm wako pure chemical co all solutions were produced with ultra pure water milli q sp system merck millipore the concentration of silicic acid in the starting solution and effluent was measured using a uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c for practical purposes the dilute solutions of hcl and naoh were employed to alter the ph of the solution the silicic acid concentration was expressed in this research as si mg l 2 2 preparation of the ga type resin stirring the strong base anion exchange resins 0 5 g for 26 h in ga solution 100 ml 2 5 g l ph 6 5 ml of ga solution was taken at certain time intervals and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the resulting filtrate was scanned over the whole 200 800 nm wavelength range by a uv vis spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of ga the grafted resins were washed three times with water after being filtered through a paper filter they were then air dried for 1 day at room temperature 32 the quantity of ga grafted on the resins qga was then estimated as eq 1 which related to the difference between the initial solution and the filtrate concentrations 1 q ga c c e v m where c mg l and ce mg l is the initial and equilibrium ga concentration respectively v ml and m g stand for the volume of solution and resin mass respectively 2 3 fixed bed column experiments for the fixed bed investigations a glass cylinder with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 15 cm was used as a column the experimental setup is depicted schematically in fig 1 ga type resins were used to pack the column a variable speed peristaltic pump longer pump yz1515x and a 5 mm diameter silicone tube were used to continuously feed the sodium silicate solution from the reservoir into the reactor the effluent from the bottom of the bed enters the sample collection chamber through a silicone tube with the use of a peristaltic pump the column was filled with modified resins and had a layer of glass wool at the bottom the bed heights h were 4 4 5 and 5 cm corresponding to 10 51 g 11 52 g and 14 56 g of ga type resins flow rates of 0 9 2 5 ml min were applied with starting silicic acid concentrations of 20 40 and 60 mg l at certain intervals wastewater samples were collected when the silicic acid concentration in the effluent approached 99 of the original concentration the flow was halted 33 to acquire btcs spectrophotometry shimadzu uv 3600 was used to determine the silicic acid content in the succeeding fractions this method is based on the generation of yellow molybdosilicic acid at 400 nm wavelength 34 2 4 fixed bed column data analysis btcs can be used as a criterion to assess the fixed bed column performance which is a plot of ct c0 versus time t under specified conditions and would be capable of being used to measure the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent within certain operating parameters 23 35 the breakthrough time tb which is the time corresponding to a certain breakthrough concentration is also an essential property for defining the dynamic loading behavior in a fixed bed column for adsorbent removal 36 since there is no limit for silicic acid concentration in the national standard the breakthrough time selected for this study is the time when the effluent silicic acid concentration was 10 mg l which is based on the silicic acid concentration required in some industrial water 9 37 the effluent volume veff that this column can handle was estimated using the equation below 2 v eff q t e where q is the flow rate ml min and te min is the exhaust time the amount of silicic acid which has been adsorbed in the fixed bed column qtotal mg was calculated from the area under the btcs 38 3 q total qa 1000 q 1000 t 0 t t e c 0 c t dt where q is the flow rate ml min and a is the area under the btcs ct mg l and c0 mg l denote the silicic acid concentrations of the effluent and influent respectively the maximum adsorbent uptake capacity qe mg g can be defined according to eq 4 4 q e q total m where m g represents the dry weight of adsorbent the total silicic acid removal efficiency r was computed by dividing the mass of adsorbed silicic acid qtotal through the total quantity of silicic acid injected into the column as follows 5 r 1000 q total c 0 qt e 100 2 5 breakthrough curve model fitting optimization of operating parameters at the experimental scale is arduous expensive and time consuming but it can be effectively avoided by modeling the btcs 39 conventional breakthrough equations the bdst thomas and yoon nelson models have yielded a broad range of guiding parameters in prior column investigations 22 34 ann is a data driven model that emulates biological neural networks to implement distributed and parallel information processing and it has recently gained widespread use in the pollution management and modeling analysis fields 2 5 1 bdst model the time approach simplified model bdst was proposed by adams bohart for the design of carbon adsorption columns this model enables prediction of how long the adsorbent can adsorb from the aqueous solution before depletion 40 it establishes the link between service time t and bed depth h the linear form of the bdst model is written in eq 6 6 t n 0 c 0 ν h 1 c 0 k bdst ln c 0 c t 1 where t min is the service time the column adsorption capacity is n0 mg l c0 and ct mg l are the influent and effluent concentration respectively h cm is the bed depth the rate constant is represented by kbdst l mg min the empty column flow rate is ν cm min 2 5 2 thomas model one of the most versatile and extensively used models in column performance theory the thomas model can handle continuous mode survey column data and determine the maximum solid phase concentration and adsorption rate constant on the adsorbent 41 under the premise that the derivation process is consistent with langmuir adsorption kinetics and there is no axial dispersion the driving force of adsorption obeys second order reversible reaction kinetics 42 the following is the nonlinear thomas model 7 c t c 0 1 1 exp k th q th m q k th c 0 t where kth is the thomas rate constant ml mg min q is the volume flow rate l min and the resin mass is denoted by m g qth mg g is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the column 2 5 3 yoon nelson model yoon nelson developed a relatively simple model it relies on the rate at which the adsorption potential for each adsorbent molecule decreases in direct proportion to the adsorbent adsorption potential while being influenced by adsorbent breakthrough probability 43 eq 8 can be used to represent the nonlinear yoon nelson model 8 c t c 0 exp k yn t τ k yn 1 exp k yn t τ k yn where the yoon nelson rate constant is kyn l mg min and τ is the time min required when the concentration ct mg l reaches 50 of the initial concentration c0 mg l 2 5 4 ann model artificial neural networks are developed similar to the working model of the brain with powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities self learning and fault tolerance 44 anns have three layers which include an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer each layer of the network includes a number of treatment elements called neurons the input and output layers have the same number of neurons as the number of known independent and dependent parameters respectively 21 the neural network tool box of matlab r2018b was used to develop the ann model the mean squared error mse as given in eq 9 was utilized to evaluate the training validation and testing performance 9 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbents to calculate the grafting amount of ga on the resin a measurement of full wavelength scanning spectra of the solution was carried out during the modification process as shown in fig 2a the peak top at 260 nm gradually decreased with time indicating that a part of ga has been grafted onto the resin based on the curve in fig 2b the concentrations of ga in the initial and final filtrate after 26 h were 2 46 g l and 0 69 mg l respectively the grafting amount was 354 14 mg g calculated from eq 1 morphologically it was observed that the original oh type resin was light yellow and changed to dark brown after grafting fig 2a meanwhile to further verify the grafting of ga on the resin the ft ir spectra of the samples were measured using a fourier transform ir spectrometer nicolet 5700 as shown in fig s1 and table s1 for comparison the ft ir spectrum of pure ga and oh type resin were also measured under the same condition observing the spectra of the three substances above three distinct characteristic peaks appeared in the spectrum for the ga type resin located at 3498 cm 1 1721 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 corresponding to the phenolic hydroxyl group ar o h the co stretching and co stretching of the carboxyl group on ga respectively 45 46 all of these proved that ga was successfully grafted onto the resin 3 2 effect of operating variables on silicic acid adsorption in fixed bed column 3 2 1 effect of flow rate the flow rate which affects the residence time of the water stream in the column is one of the most critical parameters affecting the efficacy of a fixed bed column in eliminating impurities 47 fig 3a shows the effect of varying the flow rate in the range of 0 9 2 5 ml min on the silicic acid removal from the aqueous solution by the ga type resins with the bed height and initial silicic acid concentration set at 4 5 cm and 40 mg l respectively the column breakthrough time decreased as the flow rate increased with flow rates of 0 9 ml min and 2 5 ml min corresponding to breakthrough times of 959 and 232 min respectively concurrently the column capacity decreased from 4 87 mg g to 2 54 mg g table 1 this is evident because contact duration decreases as flow rate increases resulting in a decrease in adsorption behavior 22 34 at a slow flow rate the silicic acid passing through the adsorption column has sufficient time to contact the resin and the hydroxyl functional groups on the resin will sufficiently engage with the silicic acid when the flow rate of the system increases the effective time for the adsorption reduces and the effluent silicic acid concentration will rapidly reach the initial value leading to an early breakthrough 3 2 2 effect of bed height the bed height influences the adsorption site number and the residence time of the solution in the column both of them are critical factors in a continuous adsorption system fig 3b shows the btcs for silicic acid adsorption at various bed heights 4 4 5 and 5 5 cm when the flow rate was 1 5 ml min and the starting concentration was 40 mg l as the bed height raised from 4 cm to 5 5 cm the breakthrough time increased from 397 min to 612 min the bed capacity and adsorption efficiency rose from 3 22 mg g to 4 10 mg g when bed height increased the solution residence duration within the adsorption column increased as the bed height increased the silicic acid penetrates deeper into the modified resin enhancing the effectiveness of removal 48 higher absorption rates were observed at the greatest bed heights because increasing the bed height is comparable to increasing the adsorbent surface area which offers more binding sites to the adsorption process 49 the treated effluent volume breakthrough time and exhaust time all increased with increasing bed height table 1 the most important parameter in the process is breakthrough time the longer it is the greater the column adsorption capacity 3 2 3 effect of initial concentration three different initial concentrations of silicic acid 20 40 and 60 mg l were used to evaluate the effect of the initial concentration on the btcs at this stage the bed height and flow rate were 4 5 cm and 1 5 ml min respectively the results obtained are shown in fig 3c and table 1 the breakthrough time reduces as the initial concentration increases and the btcs get steeper the ct c0 on the ordinate axis were 0 5 0 25 and 0 167 for the outlet silicic acid concentrations up to 10 mg l corresponding to 20 40 and 60 mg l initial concentrations respectively the resin increased the experimental adsorption capacity from 3 73 mg g to 4 20 mg g the reason is that the increasing initial silicic acid concentration increases the mass transfer driving force of the adsorption process the silicic acid rapidly occupies the adsorption sites on the resin within a short time 50 however the removal rate decreased from 58 29 to 44 78 as the initial inlet concentration increased from 20 mg l to 60 mg l this fact was due to that although the contact of silicic acid with the adsorption sites enhanced with the increasing inlet concentration the effluent concentration also increased while the breakthrough time shortened resulting in a lower removal rate 3 3 breakthrough curve modeling the findings of the column adsorption data were evaluated using three classic models namely bdst thomas and yoon nelson and the current intelligence ann model with the aim of predicting the relative critical parameters and measuring the dynamic properties of silicic acid from the column and the suitability of the above models to describe the adsorption process of the adsorbent was judged using r squared r2 and mean square error mse 3 3 1 application of bdst model the bdst model which employs experimentally acquired adsorption parameters to derive a connection between service time t and bed depth h is one of the most often used models in column studies this makes it easier to investigate the two parameters in the bdst model which describe the adsorption properties of the adsorbent kbdst and n0 the results for bed depth and breakthrough time tb at column bed depths of 4 4 5 and 5 5 cm are plotted in fig 4 for 20 60 and 90 breakthrough points and the respective values of all kbdst and n0 at different breakthrough points are listed in table 2 all of the fitted curves for bdst showed a significant linear connection and well correlate the fitted curves of the bdst model showed significant linearity and all had high correlation coefficients r2 0 96 which indicated its validity as the breakthrough percentage increased from 20 to 90 the dynamic removal capacity increased from 6 61 mg l to 29 96 mg l at lower breakthrough values certain active sites of the resin remained unoccupied so the column was still not saturated in which case the dynamic removal capacity is necessarily weaker than the full bed capacity of the resin 51 3 3 2 application of thomas model the thomas model has a widespread application in fitting adsorption btc and determining the adsorption capacity of specific adsorbent adsorbent systems the reasonable accuracy of predicting btcs under various operating conditions is its most significant advantage 52 fig 5 shows the comparison of the experimental and predicted btcs under different operating conditions according to the nonlinear thomas equation and the fitting parameters listed in table 3 as seen in table 3 not only were the r2 values higher and mse lower but also the column adsorption capacity qthexp was very close to the fitted values of qthcal at each operation condition demonstrating that the thomas model can successfully predict the continuous silicic acid adsorption process by ga type resins under various operational conditions it was observed that the value of kth decreased with an increase in influent concentration and bed height but increased for an increase in flow rate these results can be related to the fact that the high concentration causes external mass transfer in the system dynamics during the first phase of column adsorption in contrast increasing the bed height or slowing the flow rate may increase flow resistance and to some extent reduce the mass transfer effect 24 3 3 3 application of yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model is not only simple but it also doesn t require precise parameters of the adsorbent and adsorbent bed qualities 53 fig 6 depicts the yoon nelson model fitting plots corresponding to the different operating parameters and the parameters of the results are given in table 4 the r2 of the model fitting for all operating circumstances was 0 98 and mse values ranged from 0 000784 to 0 002704 confirming the remarkable accuracy of the yoon nelson model in describing the silicic acid adsorption behavior on ga type resins furthermore the obtained values qyncal and τcal had a similar relationship with the experimental values qykexp τexp which indicated that the yoon nelson model is well adapted to the column adsorption process kyn increases with increasing flow rate and concentration but τ decreases as the possibility for proper interaction between silicic acid and adsorption sites decrease kyn progressively decreased as bed height increased but τ increased indicating that an increase in adsorbent content favored silicic acid contact but prolonged the adsorption time 3 3 4 application of ann model to predict the adsorption capacity on silicic acid of ga type resins an ann in a three layer feed forward model was built which used the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm to train the bp neural network and as activation functions by the hidden and output layers the tan sigmoid and linear transfer functions were chosen respectively table s2 54 while bed height flow rate initial concentration and total effluent time used as input to the network are shown in fig 7a table s3 lists the variables for the input and output in order the dataset was split into three groups at random of which 70 was used to train the network 15 was used for cross validation and 15 was used to test the reliability of the ann model and its prediction results 55 the neurons number in the hidden layer affects the operation of the ann model hence different numbers of neurons must be used to identify the appropriate number of hidden layers 54 the connection between the mse and the neurons number in the hidden layer is shown in fig 7b throughout the training testing and validation process it was found that six neurons had the lowest mse this was chosen as the optimal productivity for ann simulation fig s2 fig 7c depicts the correlation between the experimental and ann model prediction data the correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9997 in the figure confirmed a good fit between the experimental results and the ann predictions fig s3 this result implied that the ann simulation has a satisfactory demonstration for ga type resins adsorbing silicic acid and therefore the ann model can accurately predict the silicic acid uptake during the adsorption of the dynamic fixed bed column and guide the actual water treatment process the weighting matrix as listed in table s4 was employed to determine the relative relevance of the input variables to the output variables 54 55 fig 7d presents the relative relevance for the input variables with a relative value of 32 94 the starting concentration was deemed the most relevant parameter this was succeeded by column height 23 61 flow rate 23 37 and total running time 20 08 in dynamic adsorption the initial concentration affects the contact rate between the silicic acid in the feed water and the adsorption sites and the increasing concentration of the influent accelerates the reaction rate with the adsorbent sites and becomes the first important variable affecting the adsorption capacity the column height is linked to the adsorption surface area and the number of adsorption sites and its increasing gives the silicic acid a more adequate opportunity to contact the adsorbent moreover the flow rate also affects the reaction rate of silicic acid in the column after contact with the adsorbent in this study the total running time has a weak influence on adsorption capacity one possible reason is that the capacity of the adsorbent has a certain limit and changing the total effluent time can t fundamentally influence the properties of the adsorbent 3 4 adsorption mechanism in aqueous solution the form of ga varies with ph due to the different acidity coefficients pka1 4 41 pka2 8 45 56 when the ph exceeds 4 41 the carboxyl group on ga is deprotonated to become negatively charged and can be grafted to the anion exchange resin though ion exchange the adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies have been reported in detail in earlier study 19 the adsorption of silicic acid by ga type resins could be well described by the temkin isotherm which indicated the silicic acid adsorbed on ga type resin occurs as chemisorption 57 the hydroxyl groups of ga face outward and interact with silicic acid molecules to form gallate silicon complexes c7o5h3 si oh 2 by dehydration condensation reaction which bind the silicic acid to the grafted resin fig 8 3 5 proper disposal of contaminated adsorbent resin adsorption and regeneration is a reversible process when the adsorption of ion exchange resin reaches saturation its exchange capacity declines which affects the adsorption efficiency 58 it is necessary to regenerate the resin in time normally hcl and naoh are used as regenerants to dissolve the adsorbate and restore the adsorption capacity in our previous studies the use of hcl as an eluent was found to have relatively little effect on the amount of silicic acid absorbed after resin regeneration 19 after three regeneration cycles using the same hcl and naoh concentrations the resin could still reach 51 28 of its initial value when hcl was used as the regenerant while that of naoh was only 33 64 the initial adsorption capacity of the resin was 4 31 mg g the acid regenerant removed the silicic acid in molecular form and a gallate silicate complex c7o5h3 si oh 2 from the resin releasing the original ion exchange sites on the resin and allowing for additional grafting 3 6 cost of chemicals to produce adsorbent the economics of its production were evaluated in consideration of the prospective large scale application of ga type resin in practical engineering the materials required to produce ga type resin are strong basic anion exchange resin and gallic acid both of which cost 37 cny kg and 26 5 cny kg respectively the alibaba com purchasing platform provides the raw material costs june 2022 according to the ga type resin synthesis process the chemical cost required to produce this adsorbent is 50 25 cny kg 4 conclusions in this experiment the continuous capability of the ga type resin to remove silicic acid was investigated using a dynamic adsorption column to support the effective control of silicic acid in practical water utilization processes ga type resin has the ability to remove silicic acid in water and because of its regeneration ability it can be recycled to a certain extent the breakthrough time exhaust time and column absorption capacity were shown to increase as bed height increased while decreasing as the influent flow rate increased breakthrough and exhaust times followed the same pattern as flow rate with influent concentration but had the reverse impact on adsorption capacity with a rise in influent concentration increasing adsorption capacity the error between the bed height and the corresponding breakthrough time calculated using the bdst model was small showing a good linear connection that might be used for column design when changing the flow rate or initial concentration values the experimental from the column fitted with the thomas and yoon nelson models showed good results which confirmed the ability of both models to accurately predict the entire btcs they were also appropriate when scaled up the ann model fit achieved the lowest error and the highest correlation implying that it is more accurate than the traditional model the operational parameters were prioritized in the following order initial concentration column height flow rate total running time the model fitting results have guiding significance for the potential large scale application of ga type resins in practical swater treatment system and the parameter design of

finishing wastewater hydrolysis acidification alternately anoxic oxic sequencing batch reactor synchronous coagulation three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction according to the statistics 1 nearly 0 28 million tons of dyes have been annually discharged into wastewater worldwide china has the globally largest textile industry with massive wastewater discharge e g 1 84 billion tons in 2015 accounting for 10 1 of the national industrial wastewater discharge and ranking third place among all industrial categories of which dyeing and finishing wastewater dfw accounts for 70 80 2 the dyeing and finishing process generally consists of desizing boiling rinsing dyeing printing and finishing in sequence 3 dfw mainly contains slurry dyes auxiliaries surfactants etc resulting in high organics in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod with 1000 3000 mg l high chroma with hundreds to thousands of dilution times high organic nitrogen on accounting for 50 of total nitrogen tn from the widespread use of nitrogenous dyes presence of toxic substances e g some azo dyes aniline and low biodegradability compared to municipal wastewater which in turn incurs high treatment difficulties and costs 4 7 in addition with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in china the water ecological environment carrying capacity of some population and industrial gathering areas e g beijing tianjin hebei region yangtze river delta and pearl river delta tends to be saturated prompting the wastewater discharge standards of the dyeing and finishing industry to become more and more stringent the cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tn total phosphorus tp aniline suspended solids ss and chroma in treated dfw directly discharged into ordinary surface water receiving bodies are 80 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l 0 5 mg l 1 mg l 50 mg l and 50 dilution times respectively according to the discharge standards of water pollutants for dyeing and finishing of textile industry in china 8 the cod nh4 n tn tp aniline ss and chroma in treated dfw directly discharged into sensitive surface water receiving bodies e g tai lake are even 60 mg l 8 mg l 12 mg l 0 5 mg l 1 mg l 20 mg l and 30 dilution times respectively therefore the high efficiency treatment technology for dfw is needed the process flow of the dfw treatment plant is generally long and complex consisting of physicochemical pre treatment primary biological treatment and physicochemical post treatment to achieve indirect direct discharge or nearby reuse 3 4 9 pre treatment generally employs acid neutralization due to the ph of raw dfw normally higher than 10 4 cooling via air and heat pump technology if required 10 11 coagulation followed by sedimentation or flotation to remove ss and cod partially 4 9 and advanced oxidation processes such as iron carbon micro electrolysis 12 uv o3 13 fenton 14 to remove refractory organics partially providing suitable influent for the primary biological treatment biological treatment generally uses a combination of anaerobic e g hydrolysis acidification ha stage full anaerobic digestion anaerobic ammonium oxidation and just for phosphorus release anoxic and aerobic processes for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal 5 15 17 due to the high chroma of dfw derived from residual dyes the anaerobic process mainly ha has been widely used as an essential part of the dfw treatment plant because ha microorganisms can destroy azo chromophores of dyes and thus achieve better decolorization performance 18 20 ha can also transform insoluble and macromolecular organics containing c and n into vfas and nh4 n which would improve the biodegradability of dfw and facilitate the subsequent biological treatment anoxic oxic a o or anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o activated sludge process is usually employed to remove most of cod tn and tp where external carbon source and coagulant are sometimes required for enhanced denitrification and phosphorus removal 18 21 22 limited by the low biodegradability of dfw cod and chroma in the primary biological treatment effluent often exceed the discharge standards thus necessitating the utilization of physicochemical post treatment e g ozonation 23 photo and hydrogen peroxide catalytic oxidation 24 25 coagulation 26 adsorption via activated carbon and biochar 27 28 reverse osmosis 29 to meet the discharge or reuse standards however the physicochemical treatment would significantly increase the cost of dfw treatment considering the low profit margin of the textile dyeing and finishing industry 4 it is urgent to develop a low cost and high efficiency wastewater treatment process thus promoting the sustainable development of the industry improving the pollutants removal of primary biological treatment thus reducing or eliminating the cost of physicochemical pre post treatment is a critical way to reduce the cost of dfw treatment 4 sequencing batch reactor sbr has the characteristics of complete mixing in spatial scale plug flow in temporal scale good settleability simple structure flexible operation and low cost and thus has good potential for application in dfw treatment 30 32 sbr can be operated under anaerobic ha and or methanogenesis or a a o environments and can also be inoculated with activated sludge biofilm and their mixture its operating parameters including hydraulic and sludge retention time hrt srt influent distribution ratio and dissolved oxygen can be flexibly adjusted according to influent and target effluent quality thus maximizing biological treatment capability and reducing overall operating cost the widespread use of nitrogen containing dyes especially azo dyes makes the on from residual dyes account for a high percentage 50 of tn in dfw 5 18 the removal of on in nitrogen containing groups of dyes is generally limited by the first step of ammonification due to the refractory characteristics of dyes it is usually believed that the anaerobic microorganisms during the ha process can secrete azo reductase to destroy the azo group effectively and thus achieve decolorization while converting on into nh4 n facilitating subsequent nitrification and denitrification for final nitrogen removal 33 34 however there is little information on the conversion of on into nh4 n and the removal of tn from real dfw in the literature motivated by the failure of ha stage i e volatile fatty acids vfas after treatment high cost from glucose addition for denitrification and ozonation for chroma removal in a dfw treatment plant in guangdong china a lab scale low cost hybrid process of ha and alternately a o sbr ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation was proposed for dfw treatment in this study ha failure was firstly diagnosed and solved via ha sbr tests the removal and transformation mechanism of cod tn especially nh4 n and on tp aniline and chroma was then investigated the main operational parameters including hrt for both ha and a o sbr step feeding ratio and synchronous coagulant dosage for a o sbr of the hybrid process were also optimized to meet the abovementioned direct discharge standard after treatment the outcome would provide technical support for the engineering application of the proposed hybrid process in dfw treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater and inoculated sludge the wastewater was collected from the outlet of the sedimentation tank of a dfw treatment plant in zhongshan city guangdong province china where a lengthy and costly treatment process flow consisting of raw wastewater equalization ph neutralization coagulation sedimentation ha a a o mbr membrane bioreactor ozonation discharge was employed for treatment capacity of 20 000 m3 d the wastewater sample i e pre treated dfw by ph neutralization coagulation and sedimentation looked dark blue to black and was examined with the following water quality indicators cod of 1100 100 mg l nh4 n of 9 1 mg l tn of 37 2 mg l tp of 4 1 mg l chroma of 650 50 dilution times acetic acid of 30 5 mg l n valeric acid of 15 5 mg l ph of 9 3 0 2 nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n nitrogen were not detected thus on was 28 mg l accounting for 75 of tn in dfw significantly higher than 10 30 in municipal wastewater reflecting the contribution of nitrogen containing dyes in addition vfas were also detected mainly due to the long residence time about 1 d in the equalization tank where some organics in the raw wastewater had undergone the ha process the inoculated sludge of the lab scale ha sbr was collected from the bottom of the ha tank of the dfw treatment plant looked like a black and viscous sludge and had mlss of 25 3 g l and mlvss of 11 8 g l the inoculated sludge of the lab scale a o sbr was collected from the oxic tank of the dfw treatment plant looked like a black suspension and had mlss of 10 3 g l and mlvss of 8 2 g l 2 2 ha sbr set up the lab scale ha sbr set up with an effective volume of 4 l used in the study is shown in fig s1 in each sbr cycle feeding 2 l 5 min reaction 22 h for phases 1 and 2 10 h for phase 3 sedimentation 2 h drainage 2 l 10 min and standby 15 min were performed sequentially with a motor speed of 200 r min when feeding and reaction and inoculated sludge of 12 g l the experiment was conducted in three phases phase 1 confirmed the same phenomenon as occurred in the ha tank of the plant that vfas decreased instead of increased after ha treatment via single factor temperature ph tests shown in figs s2 and s3 implying the existence of vfas consuming microorganisms e g methanogenic bacteria in the inoculated sludge however the ha sbr was employed to produce more vfas as easily biodegradable carbon source and nh4 n from ammonification of on for better nitrogen removal in the following a o sbr in this study therefore phase 2 first conducted operation test with controlled low ph of 5 to inhibit or eliminate vfas consuming microorganisms and thus realize the effective accumulation of vfas then the effective ammonification of on was achieved via the operation test without ph control in phase 3 the optimal reaction time was first determined via the batch test without ph control shown in fig s4 then the pollutants removal and conversion performance of ha sbr under optimal conditions was verified via continuous operation after the successfully commissioning of the ha sbr a large amount of effluent was collected during the stable operation in phase 3 and stored in refrigeration at 0 4 c for subsequent a o sbr tests 2 3 alternately a o sbr set up the lab scale a o sbr set up with an effective volume of 2 l is shown in fig s5 in each sbr cycle in phase 1 feeding 1 l 8 min anoxic reaction stirring only 6 5 h oxic reaction stirring and aeration 5 5 h anoxic reaction stirring only 5 5 h oxic reaction stirring and aeration 5 5 h sedimentation 40 min drainage 1 l 2 min standby 10 min were performed sequentially with a motor speed of 150 r min blower airflow of 0 1 0 15 l min and inoculated mlss of 4 g l phase 1 was carried out successively to compare the performance of a o sbr treating pre treated dfw and ha sbr effluent shown in figs s6 s12 which demonstrated the critical role of ha and also revealed that the carbon source in single feeding was not fully utilized for denitrification therefore in the subsequent phase 2 the ha sbr effluent was fed twice before the first and second a stages in one cycle the reaction time of two a and o stages and the step feeding ratio between the first and second a stages were optimized successively to achieve full utilization of carbon source for denitrification in phase 2 for reaction time optimization two cycles with monitoring the changes of nh4 n no3 n cod and tp with reaction time were successively operated to determine the reaction time of the first a and o stage and the reaction time of the second a and o stage for step feeding ratio optimization a totally of 1 l ha sbr effluent was fed into the reactor at the beginning of two a stages in each cycle which was divided into four step feeding ratios i e 1000 0 900 100 800 200 700 300 ml during the test the changes of cod nh4 n no3 n tn tp aniline chroma and sludge concentration with time were monitored the reactor was operated at room temperature of 25 30 c ph of 7 8 and srt of 15 d in phase 2 in phase 3 with optimal conditions reaction time and step feeding ratio the selected coagulant with its dosage from jar tests shown below was spiked into the reactor 15 min before sedimentation thus mixing and flocculation were completed under the stirring and aeration conditions in each cycle of the a o sbr to further improve effluent quality for meeting the direct discharge standards 2 4 jar tests for coagulation the coagulation tests were mainly targeted for phosphorus removal and also brought some marginal effects including the removal of some organic colloids and ss jar tests were conducted for coagulant and its dosage selection where a o sbr effluent was spiked by two commercial coagulants 21 iron containing polymeric ferric sulfate pfs and 13 8 aluminum containing polymeric aluminum chloride pac the dosage of two coagulants was calculated according to eqs 1 to 3 and the test dosage is shown in table 1 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 2 c 4 n 1 m 1 m 3 c 1 21 3 c 5 n 2 m 2 m 3 c 1 13 8 where c1 is tp to be removed mg l c2 is tp in a o sbr effluent mg l c3 is the direct discharge standard for tp i e 0 5 mg l c4 is the pfs dosing concentration mg l c5 is the pac dosing concentration mg l n1 is the pfs dosing molar ratio n2 is the pac dosing molar ratio m1 is the relative atomic mass of iron 56 m2 is the relative atomic mass of aluminum 27 and m3 is the relative atomic mass of phosphorus 31 the detailed test procedure was as follows the a o sbr effluent 200 ml and the added coagulant determined according to table 1 were firstly stirred at 500 r min for 10 min by a magnetic stirrer then decreased to 200 r min for 10 min and finally stopped stirring and settled for 30 min before sampling and analysis 2 5 analytical methods the routine water quality during the experiment was analyzed according to the standards 35 cod was determined by potassium dichromate oxidation followed by titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate tn was determined by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion followed by uv spectrophotometry tp was determined by potassium persulfate digestion followed by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry aniline was determined by n 1 naphthalenyl ethylenediamine azo photometric method chroma was determined by the dilution times method 36 where the colored wastewater sample was diluted with pure water until no color via visual comparison and thus the dilution times just at that time of no color was defined as the unit of chroma nh4 n was determined by nesslerization spectrophotometry no2 n was determined by n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride azo photometric method no3 n was determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method vfas were determined by a gas chromatograph model gc7980 techcomp shanghai equipped with a capillary column cnw cd wax 30 m 0 32 mm 0 50 μm and a hydrogen flame ionization detector where nitrogen hydrogen and air was used as carrier gas and combustion gas the oven program started at an initial temperature of 80 c for 2 min ramped up to 110 c with a heating rate of 20 c min and remained for 1 min and amped up to 200 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and remained for 2 min ss was determined by the scorch weighing method in order to get a preliminary understanding in the changes of organic characteristics of the dfw in the hybrid process of ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation gel chromatography omnisec malvern and three dimensional fluorescence spectrometry rf 6000 shimadzu were employed to analyze pre treated dfw by coagulation ha sbr effluent a o sbr effluent under optimal conditions and a o sbr effluent with synchronous coagulation pfs with a fe p molar ratio of 6 based on the manufacturer s guidance and analytical methods in the literature 37 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 debugging and optimization of ha sbr 3 1 1 performance with controlled low ph the ha sbr was operated for 10 cycles with controlled low ph of 5 in phase 2 for inhibiting or eliminating methanogenic bacteria from the inoculated sludge based on ph tolerance difference between ha microorganisms with a ph of 4 9 and methanogenic microorganisms with a ph of 6 8 41 as shown in fig 1a the average influent cod was 1142 mg l the average effluent cod at steady operation i e cycle 4 10 was 722 mg l thus an average cod removal of 37 was achieved it was lower than about 50 obtained from other studies in ha process for synthetic dye wastewater treatment 18 42 the low average cod removal obtained in this study might be due to the fact that real dfw contained some refractory cod studies 43 44 have shown that the ha process could improve the biodegradability of dyestuffs and remove chroma as shown in fig 1b the total vfas and acetic acid in effluent increased gradually till cycle 6 and then kept stable after that showing successful accumulation of vfas after ha treatment acetic acid increased by 33 mg l on average 30 9 63 9 mg l and total vfas increased by 28 mg l on average 46 74 mg l during the stable operation of ha sbr the n valeric acid decreased by an average of 5 mg l 15 5 10 5 mg l which could be due to the transformation of n valeric acid to acetic acid by acetogenesis microorganisms 41 although it was impossible to judge whether all methanogenic bacteria were eliminated without dna sequencing vfas accumulation at ph of 5 implied the effective inhibition of methanogenic process as shown in fig 1c the nh4 n in effluent gradually decreased to nearly the same as in influent after 5 cycles of operation indicating that the ammonification of on was seriously inhibited with the lowest ammonification rate of on i e effluent nh4 n influent nh4 n influent tn influent nh4 n down to only 0 07 since the conversion of on to nh4 n is a prerequisite for the subsequent nitrification and denitrification process the low ph of 5 is not favorable for the removal of tn 3 1 2 performance without ph control although the low ph operation could achieve the accumulation of vfas but seriously inhibit the ammonification rate of on the ha sbr was operated without ph control in the subsequent experiments owing to the alkalinity of pre treated dfw ph of 9 3 ph in the reactor gradually increased with operation time and stabilized at 7 8 as shown in fig 2a the average influent cod was 1156 mg l the average effluent cod was 729 mg l and thus an average cod removal of 36 was achieved which was nearly the same as the low ph operation showing that the test ph range had no significant effects on cod removal as shown in fig 2b the average increase of acetic acid and total vfas after ha treatment was 23 8 mg l 30 53 8 mg l and 19 mg l 43 3 62 3 mg l at the same time the average decrease of n valeric acid after ha treatment was 4 8 mg l 13 17 8 3 mg l during the stable operation of the ha sbr the effective accumulation of vfas was still achieved in the ha sbr without ph control indicating that the vfas consuming microorganisms e g methanogens were successfully inhibited and or eliminated after the controlled low ph operation as shown in fig 2c the nh4 n in effluent first increased gradually till cycle 6 and then roughly stabilized after that indicating that the bacteria responsible for ammonification of on survived during previous operation at ph of 5 and recovered its activity gradually with ph increase to the neutral range the average nh4 n after ha treatment increased by 10 3 mg l 9 7 20 mg l during the stable operation of the ha sbr and thus the average ammonification rate of on was 38 7 this was similar to the study that ha yielded an nh4 n increase by 6 7 mg l during synthetic dye wastewater treatment 18 3 1 3 performance with optimal conditions the ha sbr achieved stable and continuous operation under optimal conditions uncontrolled ph temperature of 30 c reaction time of 10 h and hrt of 24 h in phase 3 as shown in fig 3a the average influent cod was 1085 mg l the average effluent cod was 736 mg l and thus an average cod removal of 32 was achieved based on hrt of 24 h and average mlvss of 4 4 g l the average volumetric and sludge load removal was calculated as 0 35 kgcod m3 d and 0 08 kgcod kgmlvss d respectively as shown in fig 3b the average increase of acetic acid and total vfas after ha treatment was 24 3 mg l 31 3 55 6 mg l and 20 5 mg l 43 7 64 2 mg l while the average decrease of n valeric acid after ha treatment was 3 8 mg l 12 3 8 5 mg l as shown in fig 3c the average nh4 n after ha treatment increased by 10 mg l 9 5 19 5 mg l resulting in the average ammonification rate of on of 37 1 from the mass balance of tn partial on of 12 2 mg l was removed via ammonification and cell synthesis in the ha sbr the effective cod reduction vfas accumulation and ammonification of on by the ha sbr laid a good foundation for the subsequent biological carbon and nitrogen removal based on the ha sbr results a solution of short time acidification of the ha tank stopping operation and adjusting the ph to 5 via adding sulfuric acid for 5 d and 50 of sludge discharge from the ha tank was proposed and successfully implemented in the plant after resuming operation the ha tank achieved the accumulation of vfas the effluent was 15 30 mg l higher than the influent and the ammonification of on the effluent nh4 n was 8 15 mg l higher than the influent the external carbon source consumption for denitrification in the a a o mbr was also significantly reduced in order to avoid the re occurrence of vfas consumption by methanogens in the ha tank a solution of controlling influent temperature lower than the optimal temperature of methanogens 30 35 c and shortening srt via more sludge discharge was proposed to the plant 3 2 optimization of alternately a o sbr 3 2 1 a o reaction time optimization the batch results of ha sbr effluent treatment by a o sbr are shown in fig 4 in the first operation cycle shown in fig 4a the no3 n remaining in the reactor after the previous operation cycle rapidly decreased from 7 1 to near 0 mg l within the reaction time of 0 2 h which could be mainly from denitrification due to the sufficient easily biodegradable carbon source in ha sbr effluent e g vfas during this period in addition there was a minor but clear contribution from cell synthesis for no3 n removal which was roughly calculated as 30 based on the assumption of 0 5 g cell mass per 1 g removed cod and cell composition cod n of 100 5 from fig 4a cod mainly from the influent rapidly decreased by 88 mg l within the reaction time of 0 2 h which could be mainly from cell synthesis 50 based on the assumption of 0 5 g cell mass per 1 g removed cod and 1 g equivalent cod per 1 g cell mass denitrification 16 based on the assumption of 2 87 g consumed cod per 1 g denitrified no3 n and catabolism 34 respectively both nh4 n conversion of on and phosphorus release rate within the reaction time of 0 2 h were lower than those within the reaction time of 2 3 h indicating the competitive capability for carbon source by denitrifying bacteria over ammonifying and phosphorous accumulating bacteria the nh4 n conversion and phosphorus release were only 0 2 and 0 1 mg l within the reaction time of 3 5 h which might be due to the deficiency of an easily biodegradable carbon source therefore the reaction time of the first a stage was determined as 3 h the reactor was brought to oxic condition by blowers within the reaction time of 5 9 h within the reaction time of 5 8 h nh4 n and no3 n showed a decrease of 12 8 mg l and an increase of 13 8 mg l respectively indicating complete nitrification within the reaction time of 8 9 h the nh4 n and no3 n showed only slight changes cod showed a rapid decrease of 168 mg l within the reaction time of 5 8 h followed by a slow decrease of 7 mg l within the reaction time of 8 9 h tp gradually decreased by 0 7 mg l within the reaction time of 5 8 h and kept roughly stable within the reaction time of 8 9 h therefore the reaction time of the first o stage was determined as 3 h in the second operation cycle shown in fig 4b the reaction time of the first a and o stage was adjusted to 3 h while the changes in pollutants concentration with the reaction time within the second a 6 10 h and o 10 14 h stage were monitored no3 n and cod showed a rapid decrease of 3 4 and 52 mg l within the reaction time of 6 8 h indicating simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal via denitrification cell synthesis and other catabolism no3 n further decreased by 0 4 mg l within the reaction time of 8 9 h and kept stable till 10 h which could be due to the deficiency of the easily biodegradable carbon sources cod further decreased by 28 mg l within reaction time of 8 10 h nh4 n slightly increased by 0 3 mg l within the reaction time of 6 10 h reflecting a week ammonification of on tp kept stable within the reaction time of 6 10 h indicating no further phosphorus release probably limited by the deficiency of the easily biodegradable carbon sources therefore the reaction time of the second a stage was determined as 3 h within the second o stage cod showed a small decrease of 10 mg l within the reaction time of 10 13 h and kept stable till 14 h nh4 n and no3 n showed a slight decrease and increase via nitrification and tp showed a slight decrease therefore the reaction time of the second o stage was determined as 3 h the final effluent had cod of 87 mg l almost zero nh4 n no3 n of 9 mg l and tp of 2 5 mg l the reaction time of two a and o stages was optimized as 3 h resulting in a total reaction time of 12 h and hrt of 26 h in the subsequent experiments however no3 n of 9 mg l in the final effluent implied that denitrification was still limited by insufficient easily biodegradable carbon sources and the utilization of carbon sources in ha sbr effluent still needed to be optimized therefore the a o sbr was operated with different step feeding ratios to further optimize the utilization of carbon sources in the subsequent experiments 3 2 2 step feeding optimization between two a stages as shown in fig 5a the average cod of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 87 91 94 and 104 mg l respectively resulting in the average cod removal of 87 9 87 3 86 9 and 85 5 respectively based on hrt of 26 h and average mlvss of 2 41 g l the average volumetric and sludge load removal was calculated as 0 58 0 6 kgcod m3 d and 0 24 0 25 kgcod kgmlvss d respectively the effluent cod showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was mainly caused by the deficiency of reaction time only 3 and 3 h for a and o stages for the second feeding among these four step feeding ratios only the effluent cod of the first and third cycles with a step feeding ratio of 1000 0 ml 80 and 77 mg l could barely meet the direct discharge standard of dfw 80 mg l also deriving from the deficiency of reaction time total 12 h as shown in fig 5b the average nh4 n of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratio of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 0 1 0 1 0 1 and 1 9 mg l far below the direct discharge standard of 10 mg l respectively resulting in the average nh4 n removal of 99 5 99 5 99 5 and 90 respectively the slight increase of nh4 n with a step feeding ratio of 700 300 ml was mainly due to the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding as shown in fig 5c the average no3 n and tn of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratio of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 8 and 16 5 mg l 6 and 14 7 mg l 4 5 and 13 5 mg l 5 and 16 mg l respectively resulting in the average tn removal of 54 8 59 8 62 8 and 56 1 respectively only the effluent tn with a step feeding ratio of 900 100 and 800 200 ml met the direct discharge standard 15 mg l in addition based on the mass balance of nitrogen and no detection of no2 n the on of 8 5 9 1 mg l was still in the effluent of a o sbr with all step feeding ratios indicating on of 6 7 7 3 mg l was removed via full ammonification nitrification denitrification and cell synthesis considering on of 12 2 mg l was removed via ammonification and cell synthesis in the ha sbr the total on removal was 18 9 mg l in the hybrid process of ha a o sbr with the optimal conditions only accounting for 67 5 of on in the pretreated dfw and thus resulting in the ammonification of on as the most limiting factor for tn removal the a o sbr with optimal conditions still produced effluent with no3 n of 4 5 mg l indicating the inadequate denitrification caused by deficiency in easily biodegradable carbon source as another limiting factor for tn removal considering high on content is the unique feature of dfw it is a future research direction to maximize the ammonification of on as well as vfas production via ha process as shown in fig 5d the average tp of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 2 36 2 49 2 63 and 2 76 mg l far over the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l respectively resulting in the average tp removal of 32 1 27 5 24 5 and 21 2 respectively like cod the effluent tp showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was also probably caused by the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding the low tp removal was limited by unfavorable conditions for phosphorus accumulating organisms in this study which might be improved via enriching denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms 45 as shown in fig 5e the average aniline of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 0 26 0 34 0 45 and 0 56 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 1 mg l respectively resulting in the average aniline removal of 79 9 73 9 66 and 58 4 respectively like cod the effluent aniline showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was also mainly caused by the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding as shown in fig 5f the average chroma of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 51 5 54 58 and 65 dilution times slightly over the direct discharge standard of 50 dilution times respectively resulting in the average chroma removal of 57 55 51 7 and 45 8 respectively like cod the effluent chroma showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was also mainly caused by the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding as shown in fig 6 during the whole operation with different step feeding ratios activated sludge characteristics were maintained in a roughly stable condition including mlss of 2 88 3 04 g l average of 2 96 g l mlvss of 2 32 2 5 g l average of 2 41 g l and mlvss mlss of 0 79 0 84 average of 0 81 during operation the activated sludge in the reactor had good settling with the effluent average ss of 31 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 50 mg l from the primary purpose of step feeding ratio optimization tests for efficient carbon source utilization for denitrification only a step feeding ratio of 800 200 ml consistently achieved effluent tn below the direct discharge standard of 15 mg l however the effluent cod tp and chroma with this step feeding ratio did not meet the direct discharge standards synchronous coagulation in biological wastewater treatment is usually employed to remove tp for meeting discharge standard due to its simple and efficient nature 46 besides tp removal coagulation also has the potential for cod and chroma removal due to the occurrence of some organic colloids e g proteins polysaccharides and humics in biologically treated wastewater 47 therefore the jar tests for selection of coagulant and its dosage followed by synchronous coagulation in the a o sbr were conducted to target removing tp cod and chroma in the subsequent experiments 3 3 optimization of coagulation for enhancing alternately a o sbr performance 3 3 1 optimization of coagulant and dosage via jar tests as shown in fig 7 the tp cod and chroma of the supernatant in the jar tests with pfs as coagulant showed a gradual decrease with increasing the molar ratio of fe p when the molar ratio of fe p was 6 i e 113 5 mg l the tp cod and chroma of the supernatant in the jar test were 0 49 mg l 73 mg l and 35 dilution times respectively satisfying the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l 80 mg l and 50 dilution times and the corresponding removals were 81 9 27 and 36 4 respectively for pac shown in fig s13 the molar ratio of al p meeting the direct discharge standard was 25 2 i e 350 1 mg l the molar ratios of both coagulants were significantly higher than the recommended value of 1 5 3 in the design guideline to achieve the targeted phosphorus removal which could be mainly due to the simultaneous removal of organic colloids i e some cod and or colorimetric substances from the wastewater by coagulation thus significantly increasing the coagulant consumption from the viewpoint of saving coagulant cost and reducing excessive sludge production polymerized ferric sulfate was selected for the subsequent tests of a o sbr with synchronous coagulation 3 3 2 performance of alternately a o sbr with synchronous coagulation as shown in fig 8a when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 the tp in the a o sbr effluent was 0 41 0 43 mg l with an average of 0 42 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l resulting in an average tp removal of 88 when the molar ratio of fe p was reduced to 5 the tp in the effluent increased slightly to 0 67 0 83 mg l with an average of 0 73 mg l well above the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l resulting in an average tp removal of 79 3 when the molar ratio of fe p was 6 the tp of the supernatant in the jar tests was 0 49 mg l which was very similar to that of the a o sbr effluent demonstrating that the results of the jar tests could be applied to synchronous coagulation in the a o sbr test as shown in fig 8b when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 cod in the a o sbr effluent was 73 80 mg l with an average of 77 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 80 mg l resulting in an average cod removal of 89 3 like tp when the molar ratio of fe p was reduced to 5 effluent cod increased slightly to 81 88 mg l with an average of 85 mg l mainly above the direct discharge standard of 80 mg l resulting in an average cod removal of 88 2 as shown in fig 8c when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 and 5 chroma in the a o sbr effluent was 35 and 40 dilution times well below the direct discharge standard of 50 dilution times resulting in an average chroma removal of 70 8 and 66 7 respectively in addition there was no significant difference in the removal of tn nh4 n aniline and ss when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 and 5 the average nh4 n tn aniline and ss were 0 1 13 9 0 37 and 19 mg l well below the direct discharge standards resulting in the average removal of 99 5 61 72 7 and 93 respectively among them only ss in the a o sbr effluent showed a significant decrease of 12 mg l after synchronous coagulation indicating the enhanced ss removal via flocculation 3 4 changes in organic characteristics along the treatment process the gel chromatogram of the four samples along the treatment process is shown in fig 9 where the earlier the peak time is the higher the relative molecular weight is there were two prominent peaks for all samples consisting of a small peak at an elution time of 10 12 min generally corresponding to high molecular weight organics including proteins and polysaccharides and a large peak at an elution time of 12 14 min usually corresponding to low molecular weight organics including humics 43 55 the elution time of the small peak showed a descending order of pre treated dfw ha sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent a o sbr effluent indicating the increasing order of molecular weight of this small peak i e the relative molecular weights in the wastewater increased step by step after the biological treatment the high molecular weight organics could mainly come from the metabolites of microorganisms e g proteins and polysaccharides there was not only the later elution time of small peak but also a slightly lower intensity of small peak for synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent than a o sbr effluent both indicating the performance of high molecular organics removal by coagulation which was also consistent with the previous results that pfs could remove partially cod and colorimetric substances the large peak of ha sbr effluent a o sbr effluent and synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent showed a similar trend to the small peak the elution time of the large peak showed a slight increase from pre treated dfw to ha sbr effluent which might reflect the conversion of the large molecules to small molecules during the ha process the three dimensional fluorescence contour of the four samples is shown in fig 10 where region a refers to aromatic protein like substances i region b refers to aromatic protein like substances ii region c refers to fulvic acid like substances region d refers to protein like soluble microbial products and region e refers to humic acid like substances 48 49 pre treated dfw had peak 1 with moderate intensity in region d and peaks 2 4 with weazk intensity in region e indicating the occurrence of soluble microbial products which might derive from the abovementioned partial ha of raw dfw in the equalization tank compared with pre treated dfw ha sbr effluent had peak 4 with increased intensity in region c one new peak 5 with weak intensity in region b and other peaks nearly unchanged indicating the increase of some fulvic acid like substances and the occurrence of new aromatic protein like substances ii after ha treatment which might derive from the decomposition and transformation of the organics in pre treated dfw by ha microorganisms and the secretion of their metabolites compared with ha sbr effluent a o sbr effluent had all 5 peaks with increased intensity especially peak 4 indicating that the a o microorganisms e g heterotrophic nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria further decomposed and transformed the organics in ha sbr effluent for their growth and metabolism compared with a o sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent had peaks 2 5 with decreased intensity especially peak 4 indicating that synchronous coagulation with pfs could remove some fulvic acid like and aromatic protein like substances the intensity of peaks 1 and 5 characterizing high molecular weight protein like substances showed an increasing order of pre treated dfw ha sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent a o sbr effluent which matched well with the changes of the small peak characterizing high molecular weight organics from gel chromatograms the intensity of peaks 2 4 characterizing low molecular weight fulvic like substances showed an increasing order of ha sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent a o sbr effluent which also matched with changes of the large peak characterizing low molecular weight organics from gel chromatograms in addition these fluorescent substances including protein like soluble microbial products aromatic protein like substances and fulvic acid like substances were also the primary organic components of the final effluent 4 conclusions a low cost hybrid process of ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation was proposed and optimized for pre treated dfw cod nh4 n tn tp and chroma of 1100 9 37 4 mg l and 650 dilution times treatment to meet the stringent direct discharge standard in china e g cod nh4 n tn tp and chroma 80 10 15 0 5 mg l and 50 dilution times in this study where the novelty was organic nitrogen removal ammonification followed by nitrification and denitrification because high organic nitrogen content mainly from azo dyes distinguished dfw from other wastewater main conclusions were summarized as below 1 the initial ha sbr operation with different ph and temperature confirmed the presence of vfas consuming microorganisms e g methanogenic bacteria in the seed sludge from the ha tank of the dfw treatment plant the following operation with controlled low ph of 5 inhibited and or eliminated vfas consuming microorganisms resulting in successful vfas accumulation after ha treatment further operation without ph control achieved simultaneous vfas accumulation and nh4 n conversion from on after ha treatment the optimal ha reaction time was then determined as 10 h the long term ha sbr operation with optimized conditions finally achieved an average cod removal of 32 average total vfas increase of 20 5 mg l average nh4 n increase of 10 5 mg l and average nh4 n conversion from on of 37 1 based on the ha sbr study the solution of short time acidification followed by sludge discharge for the ha tank was implemented in the plant achieving the successful vfas accumulation and nh4 n conversion from on in the ha tank 2 the reaction time of two a and o stages and the step feeding ratio at the beginning of the first and second a stages for the alternately a o sbr was successively optimized for ha sbr effluent treatment under the optimal reaction time of 3 h for each stage and step feeding ratio of 800 200 ml the a o sbr achieved average cod nh4 n tn tp aniline and chroma removal of 86 9 99 5 62 8 24 5 66 and 51 7 respectively and the effluent nh4 n tn aniline and ss met the direct discharge standard of dfw in china 3 based on coagulation jar tests for a o sbr effluent treatment pfs with a fe p molar ratio of 6 was selected for synchronous coagulation in the a o sbr operation which produced the effluent with average cod 77 mg l nh4 n 0 1 mg l tn 14 mg l tp 0 42 mg l aniline 0 38 mg l chroma 35 dilution times and ss 19 mg l satisfying the direct discharge standard of dfw in china the proposed hybrid process of ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation provided a low cost alternative for dfw treatment 4 gel chromatography and three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the molecular weight of organics in dfw increased stepwise during ha sbr and a o sbr treatment which was partially due to the increase of fluorescent protein like and fulvic acid like substances and then decreased after synchronous coagulation with pfs which was partially related to the removal of some aromatic protein like and fulvic acid like substances by

finishing wastewater hydrolysis acidification alternately anoxic oxic sequencing batch reactor synchronous coagulation three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy 1 introduction according to the statistics 1 nearly 0 28 million tons of dyes have been annually discharged into wastewater worldwide china has the globally largest textile industry with massive wastewater discharge e g 1 84 billion tons in 2015 accounting for 10 1 of the national industrial wastewater discharge and ranking third place among all industrial categories of which dyeing and finishing wastewater dfw accounts for 70 80 2 the dyeing and finishing process generally consists of desizing boiling rinsing dyeing printing and finishing in sequence 3 dfw mainly contains slurry dyes auxiliaries surfactants etc resulting in high organics in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod with 1000 3000 mg l high chroma with hundreds to thousands of dilution times high organic nitrogen on accounting for 50 of total nitrogen tn from the widespread use of nitrogenous dyes presence of toxic substances e g some azo dyes aniline and low biodegradability compared to municipal wastewater which in turn incurs high treatment difficulties and costs 4 7 in addition with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in china the water ecological environment carrying capacity of some population and industrial gathering areas e g beijing tianjin hebei region yangtze river delta and pearl river delta tends to be saturated prompting the wastewater discharge standards of the dyeing and finishing industry to become more and more stringent the cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tn total phosphorus tp aniline suspended solids ss and chroma in treated dfw directly discharged into ordinary surface water receiving bodies are 80 mg l 10 mg l 15 mg l 0 5 mg l 1 mg l 50 mg l and 50 dilution times respectively according to the discharge standards of water pollutants for dyeing and finishing of textile industry in china 8 the cod nh4 n tn tp aniline ss and chroma in treated dfw directly discharged into sensitive surface water receiving bodies e g tai lake are even 60 mg l 8 mg l 12 mg l 0 5 mg l 1 mg l 20 mg l and 30 dilution times respectively therefore the high efficiency treatment technology for dfw is needed the process flow of the dfw treatment plant is generally long and complex consisting of physicochemical pre treatment primary biological treatment and physicochemical post treatment to achieve indirect direct discharge or nearby reuse 3 4 9 pre treatment generally employs acid neutralization due to the ph of raw dfw normally higher than 10 4 cooling via air and heat pump technology if required 10 11 coagulation followed by sedimentation or flotation to remove ss and cod partially 4 9 and advanced oxidation processes such as iron carbon micro electrolysis 12 uv o3 13 fenton 14 to remove refractory organics partially providing suitable influent for the primary biological treatment biological treatment generally uses a combination of anaerobic e g hydrolysis acidification ha stage full anaerobic digestion anaerobic ammonium oxidation and just for phosphorus release anoxic and aerobic processes for carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal 5 15 17 due to the high chroma of dfw derived from residual dyes the anaerobic process mainly ha has been widely used as an essential part of the dfw treatment plant because ha microorganisms can destroy azo chromophores of dyes and thus achieve better decolorization performance 18 20 ha can also transform insoluble and macromolecular organics containing c and n into vfas and nh4 n which would improve the biodegradability of dfw and facilitate the subsequent biological treatment anoxic oxic a o or anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o activated sludge process is usually employed to remove most of cod tn and tp where external carbon source and coagulant are sometimes required for enhanced denitrification and phosphorus removal 18 21 22 limited by the low biodegradability of dfw cod and chroma in the primary biological treatment effluent often exceed the discharge standards thus necessitating the utilization of physicochemical post treatment e g ozonation 23 photo and hydrogen peroxide catalytic oxidation 24 25 coagulation 26 adsorption via activated carbon and biochar 27 28 reverse osmosis 29 to meet the discharge or reuse standards however the physicochemical treatment would significantly increase the cost of dfw treatment considering the low profit margin of the textile dyeing and finishing industry 4 it is urgent to develop a low cost and high efficiency wastewater treatment process thus promoting the sustainable development of the industry improving the pollutants removal of primary biological treatment thus reducing or eliminating the cost of physicochemical pre post treatment is a critical way to reduce the cost of dfw treatment 4 sequencing batch reactor sbr has the characteristics of complete mixing in spatial scale plug flow in temporal scale good settleability simple structure flexible operation and low cost and thus has good potential for application in dfw treatment 30 32 sbr can be operated under anaerobic ha and or methanogenesis or a a o environments and can also be inoculated with activated sludge biofilm and their mixture its operating parameters including hydraulic and sludge retention time hrt srt influent distribution ratio and dissolved oxygen can be flexibly adjusted according to influent and target effluent quality thus maximizing biological treatment capability and reducing overall operating cost the widespread use of nitrogen containing dyes especially azo dyes makes the on from residual dyes account for a high percentage 50 of tn in dfw 5 18 the removal of on in nitrogen containing groups of dyes is generally limited by the first step of ammonification due to the refractory characteristics of dyes it is usually believed that the anaerobic microorganisms during the ha process can secrete azo reductase to destroy the azo group effectively and thus achieve decolorization while converting on into nh4 n facilitating subsequent nitrification and denitrification for final nitrogen removal 33 34 however there is little information on the conversion of on into nh4 n and the removal of tn from real dfw in the literature motivated by the failure of ha stage i e volatile fatty acids vfas after treatment high cost from glucose addition for denitrification and ozonation for chroma removal in a dfw treatment plant in guangdong china a lab scale low cost hybrid process of ha and alternately a o sbr ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation was proposed for dfw treatment in this study ha failure was firstly diagnosed and solved via ha sbr tests the removal and transformation mechanism of cod tn especially nh4 n and on tp aniline and chroma was then investigated the main operational parameters including hrt for both ha and a o sbr step feeding ratio and synchronous coagulant dosage for a o sbr of the hybrid process were also optimized to meet the abovementioned direct discharge standard after treatment the outcome would provide technical support for the engineering application of the proposed hybrid process in dfw treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater and inoculated sludge the wastewater was collected from the outlet of the sedimentation tank of a dfw treatment plant in zhongshan city guangdong province china where a lengthy and costly treatment process flow consisting of raw wastewater equalization ph neutralization coagulation sedimentation ha a a o mbr membrane bioreactor ozonation discharge was employed for treatment capacity of 20 000 m3 d the wastewater sample i e pre treated dfw by ph neutralization coagulation and sedimentation looked dark blue to black and was examined with the following water quality indicators cod of 1100 100 mg l nh4 n of 9 1 mg l tn of 37 2 mg l tp of 4 1 mg l chroma of 650 50 dilution times acetic acid of 30 5 mg l n valeric acid of 15 5 mg l ph of 9 3 0 2 nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n nitrogen were not detected thus on was 28 mg l accounting for 75 of tn in dfw significantly higher than 10 30 in municipal wastewater reflecting the contribution of nitrogen containing dyes in addition vfas were also detected mainly due to the long residence time about 1 d in the equalization tank where some organics in the raw wastewater had undergone the ha process the inoculated sludge of the lab scale ha sbr was collected from the bottom of the ha tank of the dfw treatment plant looked like a black and viscous sludge and had mlss of 25 3 g l and mlvss of 11 8 g l the inoculated sludge of the lab scale a o sbr was collected from the oxic tank of the dfw treatment plant looked like a black suspension and had mlss of 10 3 g l and mlvss of 8 2 g l 2 2 ha sbr set up the lab scale ha sbr set up with an effective volume of 4 l used in the study is shown in fig s1 in each sbr cycle feeding 2 l 5 min reaction 22 h for phases 1 and 2 10 h for phase 3 sedimentation 2 h drainage 2 l 10 min and standby 15 min were performed sequentially with a motor speed of 200 r min when feeding and reaction and inoculated sludge of 12 g l the experiment was conducted in three phases phase 1 confirmed the same phenomenon as occurred in the ha tank of the plant that vfas decreased instead of increased after ha treatment via single factor temperature ph tests shown in figs s2 and s3 implying the existence of vfas consuming microorganisms e g methanogenic bacteria in the inoculated sludge however the ha sbr was employed to produce more vfas as easily biodegradable carbon source and nh4 n from ammonification of on for better nitrogen removal in the following a o sbr in this study therefore phase 2 first conducted operation test with controlled low ph of 5 to inhibit or eliminate vfas consuming microorganisms and thus realize the effective accumulation of vfas then the effective ammonification of on was achieved via the operation test without ph control in phase 3 the optimal reaction time was first determined via the batch test without ph control shown in fig s4 then the pollutants removal and conversion performance of ha sbr under optimal conditions was verified via continuous operation after the successfully commissioning of the ha sbr a large amount of effluent was collected during the stable operation in phase 3 and stored in refrigeration at 0 4 c for subsequent a o sbr tests 2 3 alternately a o sbr set up the lab scale a o sbr set up with an effective volume of 2 l is shown in fig s5 in each sbr cycle in phase 1 feeding 1 l 8 min anoxic reaction stirring only 6 5 h oxic reaction stirring and aeration 5 5 h anoxic reaction stirring only 5 5 h oxic reaction stirring and aeration 5 5 h sedimentation 40 min drainage 1 l 2 min standby 10 min were performed sequentially with a motor speed of 150 r min blower airflow of 0 1 0 15 l min and inoculated mlss of 4 g l phase 1 was carried out successively to compare the performance of a o sbr treating pre treated dfw and ha sbr effluent shown in figs s6 s12 which demonstrated the critical role of ha and also revealed that the carbon source in single feeding was not fully utilized for denitrification therefore in the subsequent phase 2 the ha sbr effluent was fed twice before the first and second a stages in one cycle the reaction time of two a and o stages and the step feeding ratio between the first and second a stages were optimized successively to achieve full utilization of carbon source for denitrification in phase 2 for reaction time optimization two cycles with monitoring the changes of nh4 n no3 n cod and tp with reaction time were successively operated to determine the reaction time of the first a and o stage and the reaction time of the second a and o stage for step feeding ratio optimization a totally of 1 l ha sbr effluent was fed into the reactor at the beginning of two a stages in each cycle which was divided into four step feeding ratios i e 1000 0 900 100 800 200 700 300 ml during the test the changes of cod nh4 n no3 n tn tp aniline chroma and sludge concentration with time were monitored the reactor was operated at room temperature of 25 30 c ph of 7 8 and srt of 15 d in phase 2 in phase 3 with optimal conditions reaction time and step feeding ratio the selected coagulant with its dosage from jar tests shown below was spiked into the reactor 15 min before sedimentation thus mixing and flocculation were completed under the stirring and aeration conditions in each cycle of the a o sbr to further improve effluent quality for meeting the direct discharge standards 2 4 jar tests for coagulation the coagulation tests were mainly targeted for phosphorus removal and also brought some marginal effects including the removal of some organic colloids and ss jar tests were conducted for coagulant and its dosage selection where a o sbr effluent was spiked by two commercial coagulants 21 iron containing polymeric ferric sulfate pfs and 13 8 aluminum containing polymeric aluminum chloride pac the dosage of two coagulants was calculated according to eqs 1 to 3 and the test dosage is shown in table 1 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 2 c 4 n 1 m 1 m 3 c 1 21 3 c 5 n 2 m 2 m 3 c 1 13 8 where c1 is tp to be removed mg l c2 is tp in a o sbr effluent mg l c3 is the direct discharge standard for tp i e 0 5 mg l c4 is the pfs dosing concentration mg l c5 is the pac dosing concentration mg l n1 is the pfs dosing molar ratio n2 is the pac dosing molar ratio m1 is the relative atomic mass of iron 56 m2 is the relative atomic mass of aluminum 27 and m3 is the relative atomic mass of phosphorus 31 the detailed test procedure was as follows the a o sbr effluent 200 ml and the added coagulant determined according to table 1 were firstly stirred at 500 r min for 10 min by a magnetic stirrer then decreased to 200 r min for 10 min and finally stopped stirring and settled for 30 min before sampling and analysis 2 5 analytical methods the routine water quality during the experiment was analyzed according to the standards 35 cod was determined by potassium dichromate oxidation followed by titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate tn was determined by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion followed by uv spectrophotometry tp was determined by potassium persulfate digestion followed by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry aniline was determined by n 1 naphthalenyl ethylenediamine azo photometric method chroma was determined by the dilution times method 36 where the colored wastewater sample was diluted with pure water until no color via visual comparison and thus the dilution times just at that time of no color was defined as the unit of chroma nh4 n was determined by nesslerization spectrophotometry no2 n was determined by n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride azo photometric method no3 n was determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method vfas were determined by a gas chromatograph model gc7980 techcomp shanghai equipped with a capillary column cnw cd wax 30 m 0 32 mm 0 50 μm and a hydrogen flame ionization detector where nitrogen hydrogen and air was used as carrier gas and combustion gas the oven program started at an initial temperature of 80 c for 2 min ramped up to 110 c with a heating rate of 20 c min and remained for 1 min and amped up to 200 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and remained for 2 min ss was determined by the scorch weighing method in order to get a preliminary understanding in the changes of organic characteristics of the dfw in the hybrid process of ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation gel chromatography omnisec malvern and three dimensional fluorescence spectrometry rf 6000 shimadzu were employed to analyze pre treated dfw by coagulation ha sbr effluent a o sbr effluent under optimal conditions and a o sbr effluent with synchronous coagulation pfs with a fe p molar ratio of 6 based on the manufacturer s guidance and analytical methods in the literature 37 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 debugging and optimization of ha sbr 3 1 1 performance with controlled low ph the ha sbr was operated for 10 cycles with controlled low ph of 5 in phase 2 for inhibiting or eliminating methanogenic bacteria from the inoculated sludge based on ph tolerance difference between ha microorganisms with a ph of 4 9 and methanogenic microorganisms with a ph of 6 8 41 as shown in fig 1a the average influent cod was 1142 mg l the average effluent cod at steady operation i e cycle 4 10 was 722 mg l thus an average cod removal of 37 was achieved it was lower than about 50 obtained from other studies in ha process for synthetic dye wastewater treatment 18 42 the low average cod removal obtained in this study might be due to the fact that real dfw contained some refractory cod studies 43 44 have shown that the ha process could improve the biodegradability of dyestuffs and remove chroma as shown in fig 1b the total vfas and acetic acid in effluent increased gradually till cycle 6 and then kept stable after that showing successful accumulation of vfas after ha treatment acetic acid increased by 33 mg l on average 30 9 63 9 mg l and total vfas increased by 28 mg l on average 46 74 mg l during the stable operation of ha sbr the n valeric acid decreased by an average of 5 mg l 15 5 10 5 mg l which could be due to the transformation of n valeric acid to acetic acid by acetogenesis microorganisms 41 although it was impossible to judge whether all methanogenic bacteria were eliminated without dna sequencing vfas accumulation at ph of 5 implied the effective inhibition of methanogenic process as shown in fig 1c the nh4 n in effluent gradually decreased to nearly the same as in influent after 5 cycles of operation indicating that the ammonification of on was seriously inhibited with the lowest ammonification rate of on i e effluent nh4 n influent nh4 n influent tn influent nh4 n down to only 0 07 since the conversion of on to nh4 n is a prerequisite for the subsequent nitrification and denitrification process the low ph of 5 is not favorable for the removal of tn 3 1 2 performance without ph control although the low ph operation could achieve the accumulation of vfas but seriously inhibit the ammonification rate of on the ha sbr was operated without ph control in the subsequent experiments owing to the alkalinity of pre treated dfw ph of 9 3 ph in the reactor gradually increased with operation time and stabilized at 7 8 as shown in fig 2a the average influent cod was 1156 mg l the average effluent cod was 729 mg l and thus an average cod removal of 36 was achieved which was nearly the same as the low ph operation showing that the test ph range had no significant effects on cod removal as shown in fig 2b the average increase of acetic acid and total vfas after ha treatment was 23 8 mg l 30 53 8 mg l and 19 mg l 43 3 62 3 mg l at the same time the average decrease of n valeric acid after ha treatment was 4 8 mg l 13 17 8 3 mg l during the stable operation of the ha sbr the effective accumulation of vfas was still achieved in the ha sbr without ph control indicating that the vfas consuming microorganisms e g methanogens were successfully inhibited and or eliminated after the controlled low ph operation as shown in fig 2c the nh4 n in effluent first increased gradually till cycle 6 and then roughly stabilized after that indicating that the bacteria responsible for ammonification of on survived during previous operation at ph of 5 and recovered its activity gradually with ph increase to the neutral range the average nh4 n after ha treatment increased by 10 3 mg l 9 7 20 mg l during the stable operation of the ha sbr and thus the average ammonification rate of on was 38 7 this was similar to the study that ha yielded an nh4 n increase by 6 7 mg l during synthetic dye wastewater treatment 18 3 1 3 performance with optimal conditions the ha sbr achieved stable and continuous operation under optimal conditions uncontrolled ph temperature of 30 c reaction time of 10 h and hrt of 24 h in phase 3 as shown in fig 3a the average influent cod was 1085 mg l the average effluent cod was 736 mg l and thus an average cod removal of 32 was achieved based on hrt of 24 h and average mlvss of 4 4 g l the average volumetric and sludge load removal was calculated as 0 35 kgcod m3 d and 0 08 kgcod kgmlvss d respectively as shown in fig 3b the average increase of acetic acid and total vfas after ha treatment was 24 3 mg l 31 3 55 6 mg l and 20 5 mg l 43 7 64 2 mg l while the average decrease of n valeric acid after ha treatment was 3 8 mg l 12 3 8 5 mg l as shown in fig 3c the average nh4 n after ha treatment increased by 10 mg l 9 5 19 5 mg l resulting in the average ammonification rate of on of 37 1 from the mass balance of tn partial on of 12 2 mg l was removed via ammonification and cell synthesis in the ha sbr the effective cod reduction vfas accumulation and ammonification of on by the ha sbr laid a good foundation for the subsequent biological carbon and nitrogen removal based on the ha sbr results a solution of short time acidification of the ha tank stopping operation and adjusting the ph to 5 via adding sulfuric acid for 5 d and 50 of sludge discharge from the ha tank was proposed and successfully implemented in the plant after resuming operation the ha tank achieved the accumulation of vfas the effluent was 15 30 mg l higher than the influent and the ammonification of on the effluent nh4 n was 8 15 mg l higher than the influent the external carbon source consumption for denitrification in the a a o mbr was also significantly reduced in order to avoid the re occurrence of vfas consumption by methanogens in the ha tank a solution of controlling influent temperature lower than the optimal temperature of methanogens 30 35 c and shortening srt via more sludge discharge was proposed to the plant 3 2 optimization of alternately a o sbr 3 2 1 a o reaction time optimization the batch results of ha sbr effluent treatment by a o sbr are shown in fig 4 in the first operation cycle shown in fig 4a the no3 n remaining in the reactor after the previous operation cycle rapidly decreased from 7 1 to near 0 mg l within the reaction time of 0 2 h which could be mainly from denitrification due to the sufficient easily biodegradable carbon source in ha sbr effluent e g vfas during this period in addition there was a minor but clear contribution from cell synthesis for no3 n removal which was roughly calculated as 30 based on the assumption of 0 5 g cell mass per 1 g removed cod and cell composition cod n of 100 5 from fig 4a cod mainly from the influent rapidly decreased by 88 mg l within the reaction time of 0 2 h which could be mainly from cell synthesis 50 based on the assumption of 0 5 g cell mass per 1 g removed cod and 1 g equivalent cod per 1 g cell mass denitrification 16 based on the assumption of 2 87 g consumed cod per 1 g denitrified no3 n and catabolism 34 respectively both nh4 n conversion of on and phosphorus release rate within the reaction time of 0 2 h were lower than those within the reaction time of 2 3 h indicating the competitive capability for carbon source by denitrifying bacteria over ammonifying and phosphorous accumulating bacteria the nh4 n conversion and phosphorus release were only 0 2 and 0 1 mg l within the reaction time of 3 5 h which might be due to the deficiency of an easily biodegradable carbon source therefore the reaction time of the first a stage was determined as 3 h the reactor was brought to oxic condition by blowers within the reaction time of 5 9 h within the reaction time of 5 8 h nh4 n and no3 n showed a decrease of 12 8 mg l and an increase of 13 8 mg l respectively indicating complete nitrification within the reaction time of 8 9 h the nh4 n and no3 n showed only slight changes cod showed a rapid decrease of 168 mg l within the reaction time of 5 8 h followed by a slow decrease of 7 mg l within the reaction time of 8 9 h tp gradually decreased by 0 7 mg l within the reaction time of 5 8 h and kept roughly stable within the reaction time of 8 9 h therefore the reaction time of the first o stage was determined as 3 h in the second operation cycle shown in fig 4b the reaction time of the first a and o stage was adjusted to 3 h while the changes in pollutants concentration with the reaction time within the second a 6 10 h and o 10 14 h stage were monitored no3 n and cod showed a rapid decrease of 3 4 and 52 mg l within the reaction time of 6 8 h indicating simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal via denitrification cell synthesis and other catabolism no3 n further decreased by 0 4 mg l within the reaction time of 8 9 h and kept stable till 10 h which could be due to the deficiency of the easily biodegradable carbon sources cod further decreased by 28 mg l within reaction time of 8 10 h nh4 n slightly increased by 0 3 mg l within the reaction time of 6 10 h reflecting a week ammonification of on tp kept stable within the reaction time of 6 10 h indicating no further phosphorus release probably limited by the deficiency of the easily biodegradable carbon sources therefore the reaction time of the second a stage was determined as 3 h within the second o stage cod showed a small decrease of 10 mg l within the reaction time of 10 13 h and kept stable till 14 h nh4 n and no3 n showed a slight decrease and increase via nitrification and tp showed a slight decrease therefore the reaction time of the second o stage was determined as 3 h the final effluent had cod of 87 mg l almost zero nh4 n no3 n of 9 mg l and tp of 2 5 mg l the reaction time of two a and o stages was optimized as 3 h resulting in a total reaction time of 12 h and hrt of 26 h in the subsequent experiments however no3 n of 9 mg l in the final effluent implied that denitrification was still limited by insufficient easily biodegradable carbon sources and the utilization of carbon sources in ha sbr effluent still needed to be optimized therefore the a o sbr was operated with different step feeding ratios to further optimize the utilization of carbon sources in the subsequent experiments 3 2 2 step feeding optimization between two a stages as shown in fig 5a the average cod of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 87 91 94 and 104 mg l respectively resulting in the average cod removal of 87 9 87 3 86 9 and 85 5 respectively based on hrt of 26 h and average mlvss of 2 41 g l the average volumetric and sludge load removal was calculated as 0 58 0 6 kgcod m3 d and 0 24 0 25 kgcod kgmlvss d respectively the effluent cod showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was mainly caused by the deficiency of reaction time only 3 and 3 h for a and o stages for the second feeding among these four step feeding ratios only the effluent cod of the first and third cycles with a step feeding ratio of 1000 0 ml 80 and 77 mg l could barely meet the direct discharge standard of dfw 80 mg l also deriving from the deficiency of reaction time total 12 h as shown in fig 5b the average nh4 n of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratio of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 0 1 0 1 0 1 and 1 9 mg l far below the direct discharge standard of 10 mg l respectively resulting in the average nh4 n removal of 99 5 99 5 99 5 and 90 respectively the slight increase of nh4 n with a step feeding ratio of 700 300 ml was mainly due to the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding as shown in fig 5c the average no3 n and tn of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratio of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 8 and 16 5 mg l 6 and 14 7 mg l 4 5 and 13 5 mg l 5 and 16 mg l respectively resulting in the average tn removal of 54 8 59 8 62 8 and 56 1 respectively only the effluent tn with a step feeding ratio of 900 100 and 800 200 ml met the direct discharge standard 15 mg l in addition based on the mass balance of nitrogen and no detection of no2 n the on of 8 5 9 1 mg l was still in the effluent of a o sbr with all step feeding ratios indicating on of 6 7 7 3 mg l was removed via full ammonification nitrification denitrification and cell synthesis considering on of 12 2 mg l was removed via ammonification and cell synthesis in the ha sbr the total on removal was 18 9 mg l in the hybrid process of ha a o sbr with the optimal conditions only accounting for 67 5 of on in the pretreated dfw and thus resulting in the ammonification of on as the most limiting factor for tn removal the a o sbr with optimal conditions still produced effluent with no3 n of 4 5 mg l indicating the inadequate denitrification caused by deficiency in easily biodegradable carbon source as another limiting factor for tn removal considering high on content is the unique feature of dfw it is a future research direction to maximize the ammonification of on as well as vfas production via ha process as shown in fig 5d the average tp of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 2 36 2 49 2 63 and 2 76 mg l far over the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l respectively resulting in the average tp removal of 32 1 27 5 24 5 and 21 2 respectively like cod the effluent tp showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was also probably caused by the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding the low tp removal was limited by unfavorable conditions for phosphorus accumulating organisms in this study which might be improved via enriching denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms 45 as shown in fig 5e the average aniline of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 0 26 0 34 0 45 and 0 56 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 1 mg l respectively resulting in the average aniline removal of 79 9 73 9 66 and 58 4 respectively like cod the effluent aniline showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was also mainly caused by the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding as shown in fig 5f the average chroma of the a o sbr effluent with step feeding ratios of 1000 0 900 100 800 200 and 700 300 ml was 51 5 54 58 and 65 dilution times slightly over the direct discharge standard of 50 dilution times respectively resulting in the average chroma removal of 57 55 51 7 and 45 8 respectively like cod the effluent chroma showed a gradual increase with increasing feeding volume in the second a stage which was also mainly caused by the deficiency of reaction time for the second feeding as shown in fig 6 during the whole operation with different step feeding ratios activated sludge characteristics were maintained in a roughly stable condition including mlss of 2 88 3 04 g l average of 2 96 g l mlvss of 2 32 2 5 g l average of 2 41 g l and mlvss mlss of 0 79 0 84 average of 0 81 during operation the activated sludge in the reactor had good settling with the effluent average ss of 31 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 50 mg l from the primary purpose of step feeding ratio optimization tests for efficient carbon source utilization for denitrification only a step feeding ratio of 800 200 ml consistently achieved effluent tn below the direct discharge standard of 15 mg l however the effluent cod tp and chroma with this step feeding ratio did not meet the direct discharge standards synchronous coagulation in biological wastewater treatment is usually employed to remove tp for meeting discharge standard due to its simple and efficient nature 46 besides tp removal coagulation also has the potential for cod and chroma removal due to the occurrence of some organic colloids e g proteins polysaccharides and humics in biologically treated wastewater 47 therefore the jar tests for selection of coagulant and its dosage followed by synchronous coagulation in the a o sbr were conducted to target removing tp cod and chroma in the subsequent experiments 3 3 optimization of coagulation for enhancing alternately a o sbr performance 3 3 1 optimization of coagulant and dosage via jar tests as shown in fig 7 the tp cod and chroma of the supernatant in the jar tests with pfs as coagulant showed a gradual decrease with increasing the molar ratio of fe p when the molar ratio of fe p was 6 i e 113 5 mg l the tp cod and chroma of the supernatant in the jar test were 0 49 mg l 73 mg l and 35 dilution times respectively satisfying the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l 80 mg l and 50 dilution times and the corresponding removals were 81 9 27 and 36 4 respectively for pac shown in fig s13 the molar ratio of al p meeting the direct discharge standard was 25 2 i e 350 1 mg l the molar ratios of both coagulants were significantly higher than the recommended value of 1 5 3 in the design guideline to achieve the targeted phosphorus removal which could be mainly due to the simultaneous removal of organic colloids i e some cod and or colorimetric substances from the wastewater by coagulation thus significantly increasing the coagulant consumption from the viewpoint of saving coagulant cost and reducing excessive sludge production polymerized ferric sulfate was selected for the subsequent tests of a o sbr with synchronous coagulation 3 3 2 performance of alternately a o sbr with synchronous coagulation as shown in fig 8a when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 the tp in the a o sbr effluent was 0 41 0 43 mg l with an average of 0 42 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l resulting in an average tp removal of 88 when the molar ratio of fe p was reduced to 5 the tp in the effluent increased slightly to 0 67 0 83 mg l with an average of 0 73 mg l well above the direct discharge standard of 0 5 mg l resulting in an average tp removal of 79 3 when the molar ratio of fe p was 6 the tp of the supernatant in the jar tests was 0 49 mg l which was very similar to that of the a o sbr effluent demonstrating that the results of the jar tests could be applied to synchronous coagulation in the a o sbr test as shown in fig 8b when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 cod in the a o sbr effluent was 73 80 mg l with an average of 77 mg l well below the direct discharge standard of 80 mg l resulting in an average cod removal of 89 3 like tp when the molar ratio of fe p was reduced to 5 effluent cod increased slightly to 81 88 mg l with an average of 85 mg l mainly above the direct discharge standard of 80 mg l resulting in an average cod removal of 88 2 as shown in fig 8c when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 and 5 chroma in the a o sbr effluent was 35 and 40 dilution times well below the direct discharge standard of 50 dilution times resulting in an average chroma removal of 70 8 and 66 7 respectively in addition there was no significant difference in the removal of tn nh4 n aniline and ss when the molar ratio of fe p for pfs was 6 and 5 the average nh4 n tn aniline and ss were 0 1 13 9 0 37 and 19 mg l well below the direct discharge standards resulting in the average removal of 99 5 61 72 7 and 93 respectively among them only ss in the a o sbr effluent showed a significant decrease of 12 mg l after synchronous coagulation indicating the enhanced ss removal via flocculation 3 4 changes in organic characteristics along the treatment process the gel chromatogram of the four samples along the treatment process is shown in fig 9 where the earlier the peak time is the higher the relative molecular weight is there were two prominent peaks for all samples consisting of a small peak at an elution time of 10 12 min generally corresponding to high molecular weight organics including proteins and polysaccharides and a large peak at an elution time of 12 14 min usually corresponding to low molecular weight organics including humics 43 55 the elution time of the small peak showed a descending order of pre treated dfw ha sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent a o sbr effluent indicating the increasing order of molecular weight of this small peak i e the relative molecular weights in the wastewater increased step by step after the biological treatment the high molecular weight organics could mainly come from the metabolites of microorganisms e g proteins and polysaccharides there was not only the later elution time of small peak but also a slightly lower intensity of small peak for synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent than a o sbr effluent both indicating the performance of high molecular organics removal by coagulation which was also consistent with the previous results that pfs could remove partially cod and colorimetric substances the large peak of ha sbr effluent a o sbr effluent and synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent showed a similar trend to the small peak the elution time of the large peak showed a slight increase from pre treated dfw to ha sbr effluent which might reflect the conversion of the large molecules to small molecules during the ha process the three dimensional fluorescence contour of the four samples is shown in fig 10 where region a refers to aromatic protein like substances i region b refers to aromatic protein like substances ii region c refers to fulvic acid like substances region d refers to protein like soluble microbial products and region e refers to humic acid like substances 48 49 pre treated dfw had peak 1 with moderate intensity in region d and peaks 2 4 with weazk intensity in region e indicating the occurrence of soluble microbial products which might derive from the abovementioned partial ha of raw dfw in the equalization tank compared with pre treated dfw ha sbr effluent had peak 4 with increased intensity in region c one new peak 5 with weak intensity in region b and other peaks nearly unchanged indicating the increase of some fulvic acid like substances and the occurrence of new aromatic protein like substances ii after ha treatment which might derive from the decomposition and transformation of the organics in pre treated dfw by ha microorganisms and the secretion of their metabolites compared with ha sbr effluent a o sbr effluent had all 5 peaks with increased intensity especially peak 4 indicating that the a o microorganisms e g heterotrophic nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria further decomposed and transformed the organics in ha sbr effluent for their growth and metabolism compared with a o sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent had peaks 2 5 with decreased intensity especially peak 4 indicating that synchronous coagulation with pfs could remove some fulvic acid like and aromatic protein like substances the intensity of peaks 1 and 5 characterizing high molecular weight protein like substances showed an increasing order of pre treated dfw ha sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent a o sbr effluent which matched well with the changes of the small peak characterizing high molecular weight organics from gel chromatograms the intensity of peaks 2 4 characterizing low molecular weight fulvic like substances showed an increasing order of ha sbr effluent synchronously coagulated a o sbr effluent a o sbr effluent which also matched with changes of the large peak characterizing low molecular weight organics from gel chromatograms in addition these fluorescent substances including protein like soluble microbial products aromatic protein like substances and fulvic acid like substances were also the primary organic components of the final effluent 4 conclusions a low cost hybrid process of ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation was proposed and optimized for pre treated dfw cod nh4 n tn tp and chroma of 1100 9 37 4 mg l and 650 dilution times treatment to meet the stringent direct discharge standard in china e g cod nh4 n tn tp and chroma 80 10 15 0 5 mg l and 50 dilution times in this study where the novelty was organic nitrogen removal ammonification followed by nitrification and denitrification because high organic nitrogen content mainly from azo dyes distinguished dfw from other wastewater main conclusions were summarized as below 1 the initial ha sbr operation with different ph and temperature confirmed the presence of vfas consuming microorganisms e g methanogenic bacteria in the seed sludge from the ha tank of the dfw treatment plant the following operation with controlled low ph of 5 inhibited and or eliminated vfas consuming microorganisms resulting in successful vfas accumulation after ha treatment further operation without ph control achieved simultaneous vfas accumulation and nh4 n conversion from on after ha treatment the optimal ha reaction time was then determined as 10 h the long term ha sbr operation with optimized conditions finally achieved an average cod removal of 32 average total vfas increase of 20 5 mg l average nh4 n increase of 10 5 mg l and average nh4 n conversion from on of 37 1 based on the ha sbr study the solution of short time acidification followed by sludge discharge for the ha tank was implemented in the plant achieving the successful vfas accumulation and nh4 n conversion from on in the ha tank 2 the reaction time of two a and o stages and the step feeding ratio at the beginning of the first and second a stages for the alternately a o sbr was successively optimized for ha sbr effluent treatment under the optimal reaction time of 3 h for each stage and step feeding ratio of 800 200 ml the a o sbr achieved average cod nh4 n tn tp aniline and chroma removal of 86 9 99 5 62 8 24 5 66 and 51 7 respectively and the effluent nh4 n tn aniline and ss met the direct discharge standard of dfw in china 3 based on coagulation jar tests for a o sbr effluent treatment pfs with a fe p molar ratio of 6 was selected for synchronous coagulation in the a o sbr operation which produced the effluent with average cod 77 mg l nh4 n 0 1 mg l tn 14 mg l tp 0 42 mg l aniline 0 38 mg l chroma 35 dilution times and ss 19 mg l satisfying the direct discharge standard of dfw in china the proposed hybrid process of ha a o sbr with synchronous coagulation provided a low cost alternative for dfw treatment 4 gel chromatography and three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the molecular weight of organics in dfw increased stepwise during ha sbr and a o sbr treatment which was partially due to the increase of fluorescent protein like and fulvic acid like substances and then decreased after synchronous coagulation with pfs which was partially related to the removal of some aromatic protein like and fulvic acid like substances by

12799,the use of conventional chemical coagulants and flocculants to treat pollutant laden effluents generates residues with harmful effects on the environment this has led us to think through this study of their replacement by more ecological natural products the present work focuses on the use of a bentonite based coagulant and a cactus based flocculant opuntia ficus indica ofip in the elimination of a methylene blue mb a basic textile dye the biomaterials are characterized by ftir xrd sem and phpzc to estimate the performance of the biomaterials in the coagulation flocculation process jar test work was performed on the mb dye in aqueous solution the monitoring of the variation of mb removal rates was performed by uv visible spectroscopy the effect of biomaterial masses stirring time and speed and settling time on the dye removal process were studied in addition the effects of ph and initial mb concentration were also studied the results show that a mass of 0 9 g of bentonite and 0 4 g of ofip are the optimal quantities giving a dye removal rate of 98 29 during 19 min at a stirring speed of 180 rpm and 40 rpm for coagulation and flocculation respectively these optimum values are obtained with a settling time of 15 min however ph does not have a significant influence on the mb removal rates these biomaterials gave excellent results with 98 99 dye removal rates at an initial mb concentration of 90 mg l in addition for the purpose of testing the performance of the biomaterials a comparative study using conventional chemicals was performed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords opuntia ficus indica bentonite coagulation flocculation methylene blue wastewater 1 introduction the environmental ecosystem and human health are increasingly damaged by the pollution generated by the liquid discharges of the textile industries among the toxicity problems caused by these colored discharges are perceived odours sources of carcinogenic diseases and also the alteration of the natural balance of aquatic flora and fauna 1 dye aromatic structures especially nitrogenous dye aromatic compounds are complex as a result their degradation is not without difficulty 2 so far a variety of chemical 3 4 and physicochemical treatment procedures have been employed 5 6 the coagulation flocculation technique is one of the most widespread physicochemical processes for the removal of coloring substances from wastewater 7 9 the coagulation flocculation technique is effective because it completely eliminates the dye even present in large concentrations in wastewater 10 the coagulation flocculation technique can be divided into three steps coagulation flocculation and decantation the first step or rapid stage which can be achieved by adding a chemical coagulant aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride etc consists of a chemical process that aims to destabilize colloidal suspensions by neutralizing their charges the formation of flocs is realized by adding a synthetic anionic or cationic polymer flocculant in the second step also called the slow step in this step the small particles already destabilized during the first step are grouped by a physical process the flocs sediment and separate easily from the water during the third and final stage the coagulation flocculation technique is a simple and easy way to treat effluents from textile industries however the method has some drawbacks excessive usage of chemical coagulants in highly colored wastewater result in the creation of a large amount of harmful chemical sludge 11 12 to address this the literature reports that a variety of low cost abundant ecologically benign biomaterials are being considered as prospective alternative for these harmful compounds 7 9 10 13 recently the removal of textile dye by coagulation flocculation technique which has attracted the attention of several authors includes the use of the opuntia ficus indica plant called cactus 10 13 15 according to the literature opuntia ficus indica is a bioresource known to act as a bioflocculant and the molecules involved in the flocculation mechanism are macromolecular quercetin a flavonoid with polyphenol groups and water soluble polysaccharides starch 16 17 also bentonite clay is known for its high specific surface area negative surface charge density as well as its high cation exchange capacity and these properties show that it can contribute in the coagulation flocculation process 18 a lot of research has been published on the use of clay minerals as coagulants in textile dye removal 16 18 it is known that natural bentonite b which is an inexpensive and locally available natural material has a high affinity for the textile dye methylene blue mb 19 20 the main objectives of this study are listed as follow i to substitute the conventional chemicals regularly used in coagulation flocculation process with biomaterials ii to elucidate the mechanism of the synergistic interactions of the opuntia ficus indica powder ofip and bentonite b with respect to the mb substance by characterizing these biomaterials using the physicochemical techniques of x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis and scanning electron microscopy sem iii to test the properties of ofip as a flocculant in combination with b as a coagulant on the removal of the micropollutant of mb iv to study the effect of the most influential physicochemical parameters on the process of elimination of the mb substance present in aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used opuntia ficus indica cladodes were harvested during the autumn period in the region of akbou 60 km south of bejaia they were washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature then the cactus cladodes were separated into an inner layer of whitish tissue parenchyma and outer layers of green tissue chlorenchyma see fig 1 21 the first layer was diced and dried at 100 c for 18 h the biomaterial was ground and sieved 100 μm and kept in hermetically sealed boxes raw bentonite noted b from the maghnia deposit western algeria was kindly donated by bental society algeria the bentonite was crushed and sieved 60 100 μm then activated by sodium ions and sedimented according to the procedure described in a previous work 22 the main

alumina as major constituents of bentonite in addition mineral analysis showed that the major constituent of the raw bentonite is montmorillonite 86 by weight the clay composition also contains quartz

polymer chemifloc ah 20p were used for comparative study demineralized water was used for the preparation of all required solutions the ph of the solutions was measured by a ph meter hanna 2210 equipped with a combined glass electrode 2 2 methods a stock solution of mb 1 g l was prepared and stored away from light to avoid degradation solutions of fixed concentration c mg l were regularly prepared by dilution in distilled water the coagulation flocculation tests were carried out on a jar test apparatus selecta model flocumatic equipped with four 1 l beakers and a simultaneous stirring system the procedure adopted was in three stages described as follows see fig 2 step 1 called coagulation is carried out under rapid agitation where bentonite coagulant 0 3 to 2 4 g was added to 1 l of mb solution 10 to 360 mg l followed by an amount of ofip flocculant 0 05 to 2 4 g in the last minute of agitation the suspension is maintained under a rapid stirring speed v 1 100 to 200 rpm for a time t 1 1 to 5 min step 2 called flocculation where the suspension is kept under a slow stirring speed v 2 20 to 70 rpm for a time t 2 5 to 25 min step 3 called decantation where the suspension is kept without agitation to settle freely for a time t3 3 to 60 min after decantation samples taken from half the depth of the supernatant are analysed by spectrophotometry in the visible light at ʎmax 664 nm the dye removal rate is calculated according to the following equation 1 dye removal abs i abs f abs i 100 where absi and absf are the absorbance of the mb solution before and after the coagulation flocculation treatment respectively the study of the effect of ph 2 to12 and the comparative study using conventional chemical reagents were carried out using the same jar test procedure

charge phpzc was performed according to the batch equilibrium method 20 3 results and discussions 3 1 ftir spectroscopy analysis the ftir spectrum of bentonite fig 3 shows a twin band at 3618 13 cm 1 associated with aloh and mgoh bond vibrations and the band at 3405 17 cm 1 is attributed to the oh bond stretching band of water molecules present in the interfoliar layer of montmorillonite 24 25 the band at 3618 13 cm 1 is typical of the presence of dioctahedral montmorillonite the band at 1623 07 cm 1 corresponds to deformation vibrations of the oh 5 26 the bands at 1500 1200 cm 1 region indicate the presence of calcite impurities 27 a stretching vibration in the plane of the sio bond is attributed to the band at 992 02 cm 1 20 the band at 777 89 cm 1 is attributed to vibrations of the sioal bond of quartz impurities 28 and the bands below 520 cm 1 are attributed to vibrations of sioal and or siosi 29 table 1 groups the main bands of bentonite for ofip a broad band is observed in the 3600 3000 cm 1 region corresponding to the vibration of the oh and nh bond fig 3 confirming the presence of glycoproteins in ofip according to some authors this glycoprotein substance promotes the flocculation mechanism 16 30 the peak at 2929 cm 1 corresponds to the ch stretching vibration of the methyl ester group of galacturonic acid 13 and that at 2850 cm 1 is due to the ch2 elongation vibration band of a carboxylic acid 31 for the ionized groups the characteristic bands of coo are at 1613 95 cm 1 antisymmetric stretching vibration and at 1428 06 cm 1 symmetric stretching vibration 13 the bands appearing at 1367 82 and 1314 92 cm 1 correspond to a symmetrical or asymmetrical valence vibration of the carboxylic groups of pectin and to the elongation vibration of the oh groups of phenolic compounds respectively 32 the bands at 1050 42 cm 1 1073 58 cm 1 and 1145 02 cm 1 correspond to the coh and coc elongation vibrations characteristic of pectin polysaccharides 33 the pics observed in 900 400 cm 1 region is attributed to bond vibrations of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides 34 or nitrogen bioligands 32 table 2 groups the primary bands of ofip 3 2 xrd analysis xrd analysis was performed on bentonite and ofip and the diffractograms obtained are shown in fig 4 the diffractogram of bentonite b shows numerous 2θ peaks representative of montmorillonite the main 2θ peaks being characterized by reflections 001 at 12 71 å 100 at 4 49 å 110 at 2 58 å 210 at 1 67 å and 060 at 1 50 å in addition the high reflection intensity of d060 at 1 50 å would indicate the presence of dioctahedral smectite 35 it should be noted that these results are in agreement with previous studies carried out on maghnia bentonite 20 23 these authors reported that the proportion of bentonite from maghnia in montmorillonite is high 85 w w montmorillonite xrd peaks of b show that our material also contains illite and non clay minerals the latter present as impurities consist mainly of quartz d001 3 35 å calcite d001 3 22 å and albite feldspars d001 4 05 å for ofip the material would can contain crystalline substances such as whewellite calcium oxalate at 2ɵ 14 7 24 2 and 38 corresponding to 5 98 3 66 and 2 36 å respectively and calcite at 2ɵ 29 9 39 6 and 45 7 and 46 7 corresponding to 2 97 2 26 1 98 and 1 94 å respectively other minority substances are observed such as potassium peroxyphosphate at 2ɵ 30 5 for a distance of 2 92 å dolomite at 2ɵ 31 3 corresponding to 2 85 å and periclase at 43 3 2 08 å 36 3 3 sem analysis sem microscopic observation allowed the visualization of the ground material surface morphology the sem image of the bentonite fig 5a shows a structure characterizing the presence of montmorillonite sheets aggregates impurities and a significant porous texture 37 fig 5b shows a heterogeneous and fibrous morphology characteristic of lignocellulosic materials 38 elongated and interconnected structures can be seen forming smooth roughened arrangements along the fiber which is characteristic of cellulosic materials 38 39 fig 5b also shows that the microstructure of the ofip surface consists of sheet like hollow fibrous particles of different sizes describing large pores of random shape 38 41 according to the literature these characteristics are very favourable to adsorption processes 38 3 4 adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 on ofip the adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 on the ofip is shown in fig 6 the cactus material shows a type iv isotherm with a slight hysteresis loop of type h3 according to the iupac classification confirming the mesoporous nature of the material the bet specific surface area value calculated in the relative pressure range p p0 from 0 060 to 0 249 is 25 10 m2 g furthermore we observed an increasing adsorption accentuated in the region of relative pressure p p0 0 8 confirming the presence of mesopores the average pore diameter and total pore volume of ofip were calculated from the bjh barret joyner halenda pore volume distribution analysis the results obtained show that the calculated average pore diameter and pore volume of ofip are 27 52 nm and 5 76 cm3 g respectively 3 5 determination of phpzc of biomaterials the point of zero charge phpzc is a point that defines a ph at which the net charge on the biomaterial surface is zero its value is deduced by projecting the point of intersection of the f phi curve and the phf phi 0 axis onto the x axis as shown in fig 7 the phpzc of bentonite is 5 7 and that of ofip is 7 09 for values of phsolution phpzc the surface of the biomaterials will be positively charged which can lead to anion attraction for phsolution phpzc the surface of the materials will be negatively charged therefore they are cation attractors 20 the ph conditions during the optimization of the coagulant and flocculant weights are set at 6 and during the optimization of the other parameters they are set between 6 and 7 neutral ph to this end maintaining the ph of the solution in the range 5 5 7 5 has beneficial effects with environmental and economic implications as the addition of polluting reagents to set an acidic or basic ph is not necessary under these working conditions the surfaces of the biomaterials have a net zero charge which explains why the reaction between these two biomaterials and mb is not an electrostatic attraction but rather a van der waals interaction which took place at the interface of the two reactive entities the rest of our work will be strictly carried out without any adjustment of the ph of the medium 6 5 7 5 3 6 optimization of coagulation flocculation parameters 3 6 1 optimization of coagulant and flocculant mass the curve representing the rate of dye removal as a function of the mass of coagulant increases up to a value of 0 9 g and then decreases this shows that the mass of coagulant that gives the highest dye removal rate 97 65 is 0 9 g see fig 8 the curve representing the rate of dye removal as a function of the mass of flocculant increases up to a value of 0 4 g and then decreases slightly to finally stabilize this shows that the mass of flocculant that gives the highest dye removal rate 98 25 is 0 4 g fig 8 the mechanism of the coagulation flocculation phenomenon is a charge neutralization during the coagulation step followed immediately by a bridging during the flocculation step 8 indeed mb is a cationic dye and the addition of bentonite with its colloidal properties due to negative surface charges and a high specific surface produces an attraction phenomenon by adsorption effect 29 this leads to a neutralization of the charges and the formation of small agglomerations the flocculant brings these small agglomerations together thanks to van der waals bonds by forming bridges between them 8 the low removal rate values for sub optimal doses can be attributed to low charge neutralization and low bridging 42 in other words there are insufficient particles to ensure good flocculation the decrease of dye removal rate for doses above the optimal dose of coagulant and flocculant is due to a re stabilization of the particles by repulsion between the biomaterials and the pollutant which prevents the formation of flocs 32 42 after optimizing the coagulant and flocculant masses we were interested to investigate the removal rate using each material alone to distinguish the most efficient step between coagulation and flocculation the results are shown in table 3 the removal rate is low when using bentonite and ofip alone however the rate is better when bentonite is used alone which proves that coagulation is more efficient in this case these results also show that the addition of the flocculant is necessary to have an even better dye removal efficiency 3 6 2 influence of ph on dye removal to study the influence of ph on the rate of dye removal we keep the same values of stirring speed and time and the decantation time used previously fig 9 the greatest dye removal rate is observed at ph 2 reaching 99 31 as shown in fig 9 however the removal rate remains high for each ph value 99 31 98 08 this suggests that the influence of ph on the removal rate of mb is not too great this can be explained by the fact that bentonite being a buffer material is not affected by changes in the ph of the solution and the latter does not affect the flocculating power of ofip towards mb 43 the mechanism of coagulation flocculation could be an adsorption mechanism associated with a bridging effect moreover we worked with a ph close to phpzc which means that the external charge of the biomaterials is zero which modified the electrostatic attraction mechanism that is a mechanism commonly used in coagulation in our case it is possible that the presence of the adsorption and bridging mechanism gave a weak influence of ph on the phenomenon of elimination of mb 21 44 for economic reasons and to minimize the amount of chemicals used we have worked with a medium at a ph close to neutrality ph 6 to 7 i e without any adjustment of the ph of the solution 3 6 3 optimization of the parameters of step 1 stirring speed and time for better coagulation efficiency the study of the variation of the rapid stirring speed is more than necessary its role is to disperse the coagulant in the solution to be treated in order to neutralize the repulsion charges between the coagulant particles and the pollutant thus destabilizing the phenomenon 45 the stirring speed of the coagulation step is fixed between 100 rpm and 200 rpm as shown in the results of fig 10 an increase in the dye removal rate with the stirring speed is observed up to a maximum value 98 34 corresponding to a speed of 180 rpm in the same figure we followed the variation of the dye removal rate of mb as a function of the stirring time of the coagulation step the results obtained show a similar pattern of the curve i e an increase in the dye removal rate with increasing stirring time until a maximum dye removal rate of 98 09 was reached see fig 9 after a stirring time of 4 min beyond 4 min stirring has a negative effect on the performance of dye removal rate for the rest of our work the experiments will be carried out with fixed values of speed and stirring time of 180 rpm and 4 min respectively 3 6 4 optimization of the parameters of step 2 stirring speed and time slow stirring is an essential part of the process of bringing together and forming larger and larger flocs this increase in size allows free settling according to stokes law 46 also stirring speed and time would be important parameters to evaluate the performance of the flocculation treatment 47 these must be sufficient to avoid floc rupture by maintaining the stability of the polluting particles 48 the results in fig 11 show that the stirring speed increases up to an optimum value of 40 rpm corresponding to a dye removal rate of 97 93 and then decreases and remains stable beyond 50 rpm for the evolution of the stirring time fig 11 also shows a similar evolution of increase until a value of 15 min corresponding to a mb removal rate of 98 19 then registers a decrease beyond this maximum according to the literature the mechanism of micropollutant removal by the coagulation flocculation technique is governed by charge neutralization which destabilizes the colloidal substances by the coagulant this would facilitate the collision between the particles by promoting the formation of microflocs and then larger flocs around the flocculant as a result the rate of agglomeration between particles is improved leading to faster settling according to the known stokes law 18 slower and slower mixing time and speed improve the removal efficiency of the micropollutant through the neutralization agglomeration of more and more colloids in our case an increase in mixing time and speed beyond a certain limit can cause the breakdown of self agglomerating flocs affecting the dye removal rate of mb in conclusion the removal of mb by bentonite ofip required sufficient mixing time 15 min and stirring speed 40 rpm to reach the optimum necessary for maximum agglomeration to occur and beyond these two values the phenomenon would lead to floc breakage and a decrease in the rate of dye removal 3 6 5 optimization of the settling time step 3 the efficiency of the coagulation flocculation process is dependent on the settling speed of the flocs 6 according to some authors 49 a particle of diameter 0 1 mm requires 38 s to settle while particles of diameter 10 5 mm require 6 3 years fig 12 shows a sharp increase in the dye removal rate from the 3rd minute of settling indeed a maximum value of dye removal rate is reached 98 16 after only 6 min of settling and this rate value remains stable beyond that this deduces in our case a better flocculation performance after 6 min of settling it is known that the settling speed depends on the size and nature of the flocs formed which consequently influences the settling speed it seemed obvious to us to set a settling time of 15 min for the rest of our work in addition similar values of settling time beyond 15 min or even 30 min have been found in the literature 17 21 3 6 6 effect of initial concentration the results in fig 13 show dye removal rates that increase with increasing mb concentration these rates reach a maximum of 98 99 at an initial mb concentration of 90 mg l and then decrease sharply above an initial mb concentration of 120 mg l according to some authors 50 a high concentration of the adsorbed substance leads to a decrease in the rate of dye removal in our case this decrease may be due to the accumulation of dye molecules on the surface of the coagulant which causes electrostatic repulsion between mb molecules of the same charge 3 7 comparative study using chemical reagents for the purpose of a comparative study coagulation flocculation tests of the mb solution were carried out using conventional reagents such as aluminum sulfate as coagulant and an anionic poly electrolyte chemifloc ah 20 p as flocculant the results are shown in fig 14 the removal rates increase until a maximum value for an optimum mass or dose and then decrease or remain stable for all curves the best efficiency 98 25 is obtained with the bentonite ofip couple with the masses 0 9 0 4 g respectively if ofip as a flocculant gives good results in association with the coagulant bentonite the opposite effect is observed with aluminum sulfate with the latter its efficiency decreases giving a removal rate of 58 04 for a dose of 10 mg l however the adverse environmental effects of chemifloc ah 20p anionic flocculant it gives an excellent removal rate result 97 77 for a dose of 0 04 mg l in combination with bentonite as biocoagulant the major difference in the efficiencies of the products used in this study will be based on the results of the dye removal and the cost estimate for the coagulation flocculation treatment which will only include the cost of the amount of product itself table 4 since the cost of energy and process labour are the same for all materials 4 conclusion in this work the mb removal by coagulation flocculation using bentonite as coagulant and ofip as flocculant was studied it is noted that in the comparative study between these biomaterials and conventional products the mb removal rate is better when aluminum sulfate is replaced by bentonite 58 04 98 25 the rate is almost similar 97 77 98 25 when polymer and then ofip were used as flocculants respectively in addition to these results bentonite and ofip are inexpensive materials and free of harmful effects on the environment which shows that the chemicals often applied for this process can be replaced by these natural materials the removal rate is 98 99 with an initial mb concentration of 90 mg l in a volume of 1 l and optimization of the coagulation flocculation process parameters as follows the mass of the coagulant bentonite which is equal to 0 9 g the mass of the flocculant ofip which is equal to 0 4 g the speed and stirring time of the coagulation step which are 180 rpm and 4 min respectively the stirring speed and time of the flocculation step which are 40 rpm and 15 min respectively the settling time which is 15 min a ph effect was also investigated and it was found that there was no influence on the coagulating capacity of the bentonite as well as on the flocculating capacity of the ofip the results of the current research should be considered under some limitations the first is that the production of large quantities of sludge which are less toxic than those produced by the conventional process however it could be addressed by regenerating this sludge for an eventual valorization in other uses the second limitation consists in that the results obtained in this work are based only on the basic dye methylene blue so the removal of other types of dyes or pollutants by biomaterials bentonite and ofip should be studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12799,the use of conventional chemical coagulants and flocculants to treat pollutant laden effluents generates residues with harmful effects on the environment this has led us to think through this study of their replacement by more ecological natural products the present work focuses on the use of a bentonite based coagulant and a cactus based flocculant opuntia ficus indica ofip in the elimination of a methylene blue mb a basic textile dye the biomaterials are characterized by ftir xrd sem and phpzc to estimate the performance of the biomaterials in the coagulation flocculation process jar test work was performed on the mb dye in aqueous solution the monitoring of the variation of mb removal rates was performed by uv visible spectroscopy the effect of biomaterial masses stirring time and speed and settling time on the dye removal process were studied in addition the effects of ph and initial mb concentration were also studied the results show that a mass of 0 9 g of bentonite and 0 4 g of ofip are the optimal quantities giving a dye removal rate of 98 29 during 19 min at a stirring speed of 180 rpm and 40 rpm for coagulation and flocculation respectively these optimum values are obtained with a settling time of 15 min however ph does not have a significant influence on the mb removal rates these biomaterials gave excellent results with 98 99 dye removal rates at an initial mb concentration of 90 mg l in addition for the purpose of testing the performance of the biomaterials a comparative study using conventional chemicals was performed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords opuntia ficus indica bentonite coagulation flocculation methylene blue wastewater 1 introduction the environmental ecosystem and human health are increasingly damaged by the pollution generated by the liquid discharges of the textile industries among the toxicity problems caused by these colored discharges are perceived odours sources of carcinogenic diseases and also the alteration of the natural balance of aquatic flora and fauna 1 dye aromatic structures especially nitrogenous dye aromatic compounds are complex as a result their degradation is not without difficulty 2 so far a variety of chemical 3 4 and physicochemical treatment procedures have been employed 5 6 the coagulation flocculation technique is one of the most widespread physicochemical processes for the removal of coloring substances from wastewater 7 9 the coagulation flocculation technique is effective because it completely eliminates the dye even present in large concentrations in wastewater 10 the coagulation flocculation technique can be divided into three steps coagulation flocculation and decantation the first step or rapid stage which can be achieved by adding a chemical coagulant aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride etc consists of a chemical process that aims to destabilize colloidal suspensions by neutralizing their charges the formation of flocs is realized by adding a synthetic anionic or cationic polymer flocculant in the second step also called the slow step in this step the small particles already destabilized during the first step are grouped by a physical process the flocs sediment and separate easily from the water during the third and final stage the coagulation flocculation technique is a simple and easy way to treat effluents from textile industries however the method has some drawbacks excessive usage of chemical coagulants in highly colored wastewater result in the creation of a large amount of harmful chemical sludge 11 12 to address this the literature reports that a variety of low cost abundant ecologically benign biomaterials are being considered as prospective alternative for these harmful compounds 7 9 10 13 recently the removal of textile dye by coagulation flocculation technique which has attracted the attention of several authors includes the use of the opuntia ficus indica plant called cactus 10 13 15 according to the literature opuntia ficus indica is a bioresource known to act as a bioflocculant and the molecules involved in the flocculation mechanism are macromolecular quercetin a flavonoid with polyphenol groups and water soluble polysaccharides starch 16 17 also bentonite clay is known for its high specific surface area negative surface charge density as well as its high cation exchange capacity and these properties show that it can contribute in the coagulation flocculation process 18 a lot of research has been published on the use of clay minerals as coagulants in textile dye removal 16 18 it is known that natural bentonite b which is an inexpensive and locally available natural material has a high affinity for the textile dye methylene blue mb 19 20 the main objectives of this study are listed as follow i to substitute the conventional chemicals regularly used in coagulation flocculation process with biomaterials ii to elucidate the mechanism of the synergistic

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis and scanning electron microscopy sem iii to test the properties of ofip as a flocculant in combination with b as a coagulant on the removal of the micropollutant of mb iv to study the effect of the most influential physicochemical parameters on the process of elimination of the mb substance present in aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used opuntia ficus indica cladodes were harvested during the autumn period in the region of akbou 60 km south of bejaia they were washed with

polymer chemifloc ah 20p were used for comparative study demineralized water was used for the preparation of all required solutions the ph of the solutions was measured by a ph meter hanna 2210 equipped with a combined glass electrode 2 2 methods a stock solution of mb 1 g l was prepared and stored away from light to avoid degradation solutions of fixed concentration c mg l were regularly prepared by dilution in distilled water the coagulation flocculation tests were carried out on a jar test apparatus selecta model flocumatic equipped with four 1 l beakers and a simultaneous stirring system the procedure adopted was in three stages described as follows see fig 2 step 1 called coagulation is carried out under rapid agitation where bentonite coagulant 0 3 to 2 4 g was added to 1 l of mb solution 10 to 360 mg l followed by an amount of ofip flocculant 0 05 to 2 4 g in the last minute of agitation the suspension is maintained under a rapid stirring speed v 1 100 to 200 rpm for a time t 1 1 to 5 min step 2 called flocculation where the suspension is kept under a slow stirring speed v 2 20 to 70 rpm for a time t 2 5 to 25 min step 3 called decantation where the suspension is kept without agitation to settle freely for a time t3 3 to 60 min after decantation samples taken from half the depth of the supernatant are analysed by spectrophotometry in the visible light at ʎmax 664 nm the dye removal rate is calculated according to the following equation 1 dye removal abs i abs f abs i 100 where absi and absf are the absorbance of the mb solution before and after the coagulation flocculation treatment respectively the study of the effect of ph 2 to12 and the comparative study using conventional chemical reagents were carried out using the same jar test procedure

associated with aloh and mgoh bond vibrations and the band at 3405 17 cm 1 is attributed to the oh bond stretching band of water molecules present in the interfoliar layer of montmorillonite 24 25 the band at 3618 13 cm 1 is typical of the presence of dioctahedral montmorillonite the band at 1623 07 cm 1 corresponds to deformation vibrations of the oh 5 26 the bands at 1500 1200 cm 1 region indicate the presence of calcite impurities 27 a stretching vibration in the plane of the sio bond is attributed to the band at 992 02 cm 1 20 the band at 777 89 cm 1 is attributed to vibrations of the sioal bond of quartz impurities 28 and the bands below 520 cm 1 are attributed to vibrations of sioal and or siosi 29 table 1 groups the main bands of bentonite for ofip a broad band is observed in the 3600 3000 cm 1 region corresponding to the vibration of the oh and nh bond fig 3 confirming the presence of glycoproteins in ofip according to some authors this glycoprotein substance promotes the flocculation mechanism 16 30 the peak at 2929 cm 1 corresponds to the ch stretching vibration of the methyl ester group of galacturonic acid 13 and that at 2850 cm 1 is due to the ch2 elongation

phenolic compounds respectively 32 the bands at 1050 42 cm 1 1073 58 cm 1 and 1145 02 cm 1 correspond to the coh and coc elongation vibrations characteristic of pectin polysaccharides 33 the pics observed in 900 400 cm 1 region is attributed to bond vibrations of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides 34 or nitrogen bioligands 32 table 2 groups the primary bands of ofip 3 2 xrd analysis xrd analysis was performed on bentonite and ofip and the diffractograms obtained are shown in fig 4 the diffractogram of bentonite b shows numerous 2θ peaks representative of montmorillonite the main 2θ peaks being characterized by reflections 001 at 12 71 å 100 at 4 49 å 110 at 2 58 å 210 at 1 67 å and 060 at 1 50 å in addition the high reflection intensity of d060 at 1 50 å would indicate the presence of dioctahedral smectite 35 it should be noted that these results are in agreement with previous studies carried out on maghnia bentonite 20 23 these authors reported that the proportion of bentonite from maghnia in montmorillonite is high 85 w w montmorillonite xrd peaks of b show that our material also contains illite and non clay minerals the latter present as impurities consist mainly of quartz d001 3 35 å calcite d001 3 22 å and albite feldspars d001 4 05 å for ofip the material would can contain crystalline substances such as whewellite calcium oxalate at 2ɵ 14 7 24 2 and

as potassium peroxyphosphate at 2ɵ 30 5 for a distance of 2 92 å dolomite at 2ɵ 31 3 corresponding to 2 85 å and periclase at 43 3 2 08 å 36 3 3 sem analysis sem microscopic observation allowed the visualization of the ground material surface morphology the sem image of the bentonite fig 5a shows a structure characterizing the presence of montmorillonite sheets aggregates impurities and a

particles of different sizes describing large pores of random shape 38 41 according to the literature these characteristics are very favourable to adsorption processes 38 3 4 adsorption desorption isotherms of n2 on ofip the adsorption desorption isotherm of n2 on the ofip is shown in fig 6 the cactus material shows a type iv isotherm with a slight hysteresis loop of type h3 according to the iupac classification confirming the mesoporous nature of the material the bet specific surface area value calculated in the relative pressure range p p0 from 0 060 to 0 249 is 25 10 m2 g furthermore we observed an increasing adsorption accentuated in the region of relative pressure p p0 0 8 confirming the presence of mesopores the average pore diameter and total pore volume of ofip were calculated from the bjh barret joyner halenda pore volume distribution analysis the results obtained show that the calculated average pore diameter and pore volume of ofip are 27 52 nm and 5 76 cm3 g respectively 3 5 determination of phpzc of biomaterials the point of zero charge phpzc is a point that defines a ph at which the net charge on the biomaterial surface is zero its value is deduced by projecting the point of intersection of the f phi curve and the phf phi 0 axis onto the x axis as shown in fig 7 the phpzc of bentonite is 5 7 and that of ofip is 7 09 for values of phsolution phpzc the surface of the biomaterials will be positively charged which can lead to anion attraction for phsolution phpzc the surface of the materials will be negatively charged therefore they are cation attractors 20 the ph conditions during the optimization of the coagulant and flocculant weights are set at 6 and during the optimization of the other parameters they are set between 6 and 7 neutral ph to this end maintaining the ph of the solution in the range 5 5 7 5 has beneficial effects with environmental and economic implications as the addition of polluting reagents to set an acidic or basic ph is not necessary under these working conditions the surfaces of the biomaterials have a net zero charge which explains why the reaction between these two biomaterials and mb is not an electrostatic attraction but rather a van der waals interaction which took place at the interface of the two reactive entities the rest of our work will be strictly carried out without any adjustment of the ph of the medium 6 5 7 5 3 6 optimization of coagulation flocculation parameters 3 6 1 optimization of coagulant and flocculant mass the curve representing the rate of dye removal as a function of the mass of coagulant increases up to a value of 0 9 g and then decreases this shows that the mass of coagulant that gives the highest dye removal rate 97 65 is 0 9 g see fig 8 the curve representing the rate of dye removal as a function of the mass of flocculant increases up to a value of 0 4 g and then decreases slightly to finally stabilize this shows that the mass of flocculant that gives the highest dye removal rate 98 25 is 0 4 g fig 8 the mechanism of the coagulation flocculation phenomenon is a charge neutralization during the coagulation step followed immediately by a bridging during the flocculation step 8 indeed mb is a cationic dye and the addition of bentonite with its colloidal properties due to negative surface charges and a high specific surface produces an attraction phenomenon by adsorption effect 29 this leads to a neutralization of the charges and the formation of small agglomerations the flocculant brings these small agglomerations together thanks to van der waals bonds by forming bridges between them 8 the low removal rate values for sub optimal doses can be attributed to low charge neutralization and low bridging 42 in other words there are insufficient particles to ensure good flocculation the decrease of dye removal rate for doses above the optimal dose of coagulant and flocculant is due to a re stabilization of the particles by repulsion between the biomaterials and the pollutant which prevents the formation of flocs 32 42 after optimizing the coagulant and flocculant masses we were interested to investigate the removal rate using each material alone to distinguish the most efficient step between coagulation and flocculation the results are shown in table 3 the removal rate is low when using bentonite and ofip alone however the rate is better when bentonite is used alone which proves that coagulation is more efficient in this case these results also show that the addition of the flocculant is necessary to have an even better dye removal efficiency 3 6 2 influence of ph on dye removal to study the influence of ph on the rate of dye removal we keep the same values of stirring speed and time and the decantation time used previously fig 9 the greatest dye removal rate is observed at ph 2 reaching 99 31 as shown in fig 9 however the removal rate remains high for each ph value 99 31 98 08 this suggests that the influence of ph on the removal rate of mb is not too great this can be explained by the fact that bentonite being a buffer material is not affected by changes in the ph of the solution and the latter does not affect the flocculating power of ofip towards mb 43 the mechanism of coagulation flocculation could be an adsorption mechanism associated with a bridging effect moreover we worked with a ph close to phpzc which means that the external charge of the biomaterials is zero which modified the electrostatic attraction mechanism that is a mechanism commonly used in coagulation in our case it is possible that the presence of the adsorption and bridging mechanism gave a weak influence of ph on the phenomenon of elimination of mb 21 44 for economic reasons and to minimize the amount of chemicals used we have worked with a medium at a ph close to neutrality ph 6 to 7 i e without any adjustment of the ph of the solution 3 6 3 optimization of the parameters of step 1 stirring speed and time for better coagulation efficiency the study of the variation of the rapid stirring speed is more than necessary its role is to disperse the coagulant in the solution to be treated in order to neutralize the repulsion charges between the coagulant particles and the pollutant thus destabilizing the phenomenon 45 the stirring speed of the coagulation step is fixed between 100 rpm and 200 rpm as shown in the results of fig 10 an increase in the dye removal rate with the stirring speed is observed up to a maximum value 98 34 corresponding to a speed of 180 rpm in the same figure we followed the variation of the dye removal rate of mb as a function of the stirring time of the coagulation step the results obtained show a similar pattern of the curve i e an increase in the dye removal rate with increasing stirring time until a maximum dye removal rate of 98 09 was reached see fig 9 after a stirring time of 4 min beyond 4 min stirring has a negative effect on the performance of dye removal rate for the rest of our work the experiments will be carried out with fixed values of speed and stirring time of 180 rpm and 4 min respectively 3 6 4 optimization of the parameters of step 2 stirring speed and time slow stirring is an essential part of the process of bringing together and forming larger and larger flocs this increase in size allows free settling according to stokes law 46 also stirring speed and time would be important parameters to evaluate the performance of the flocculation treatment 47 these must be sufficient to avoid floc rupture by maintaining the stability of the polluting particles 48 the results in fig 11 show that the stirring speed increases up to an optimum value of 40 rpm corresponding to a dye removal rate of 97 93 and then decreases and remains stable beyond 50 rpm for the evolution of the stirring time fig 11 also shows a similar evolution of increase until a value of 15 min corresponding to a mb removal rate of 98 19 then registers a decrease beyond this maximum according to the literature the mechanism of micropollutant removal by the coagulation flocculation technique is governed by charge neutralization which destabilizes the colloidal substances by the coagulant this would facilitate the collision between the particles by promoting the formation of microflocs and then larger flocs around the flocculant as a result the rate of agglomeration between particles is improved leading to faster settling according to the known stokes law 18 slower and slower mixing time and speed improve the removal efficiency of the micropollutant through the neutralization agglomeration of more and more colloids in our case an increase in mixing time and speed beyond a certain limit can cause the breakdown of self agglomerating flocs affecting the dye removal rate of mb in conclusion the removal of mb by bentonite ofip required sufficient mixing time 15 min and stirring speed 40 rpm to reach the optimum necessary for maximum agglomeration to occur and beyond these two values the phenomenon would lead to floc breakage and a decrease in the rate of dye removal 3 6 5 optimization of the settling time step 3 the efficiency of the coagulation flocculation process is dependent on the settling speed of the flocs 6 according to some authors 49 a particle of diameter 0 1 mm requires 38 s to settle while particles of diameter 10 5 mm require 6 3 years fig 12 shows a sharp increase in the dye removal rate from the 3rd minute of settling indeed a maximum value of dye removal rate is reached 98 16 after only 6 min of settling and this rate value remains stable beyond that this deduces in our case a better flocculation performance after 6 min of settling it is known that the settling speed depends on the size and nature of the flocs formed which consequently influences the settling speed it seemed obvious to us to set a settling time of 15 min for the rest of our work in addition similar values of settling time beyond 15 min or even 30 min have been found in the literature 17 21 3 6 6 effect of initial concentration the results in fig 13 show dye removal rates that increase with increasing mb concentration these rates reach a maximum of 98 99 at an initial mb concentration of 90 mg l and then decrease sharply above an initial mb concentration of 120 mg l according to some authors 50 a high concentration of the adsorbed substance leads to a decrease in the rate of dye removal in our case this decrease may be due to the accumulation of dye molecules on the surface of the coagulant which causes electrostatic repulsion between mb molecules of the same charge 3 7 comparative study using chemical reagents for the purpose of a comparative study coagulation flocculation tests of the mb solution were carried out using conventional reagents such as aluminum sulfate as coagulant and an anionic poly electrolyte chemifloc ah 20 p as flocculant the results are shown in fig 14 the removal rates increase until a maximum value for an optimum mass or dose and then decrease or remain stable for all curves the best efficiency 98 25 is obtained with the bentonite ofip couple with the masses 0 9 0 4 g respectively if ofip as a flocculant gives good results in association with the coagulant bentonite the opposite effect is observed with aluminum sulfate with the latter its efficiency decreases giving a removal rate of 58 04 for a dose of 10 mg l however the adverse environmental effects of chemifloc ah 20p anionic flocculant it gives an excellent removal rate result 97 77 for a dose of 0 04 mg l in combination with bentonite as biocoagulant the major difference in the efficiencies of the products used in this study will be based on the results of the dye removal and the cost estimate for the coagulation flocculation treatment which will only include the cost of the amount of product itself table 4 since the cost of energy and process labour are the same for all materials 4 conclusion in this work the mb removal by coagulation flocculation using bentonite as coagulant and ofip as flocculant was studied it is noted that in the comparative study between these biomaterials and conventional products the mb removal rate is better when aluminum sulfate is replaced by bentonite 58 04 98 25 the rate is almost similar 97 77 98 25 when polymer and then ofip were used as flocculants respectively in addition to these results bentonite and ofip are inexpensive materials and free of harmful effects on the environment which shows that the chemicals often applied for this process can be replaced by these natural materials the removal rate is 98 99 with an initial mb concentration of 90 mg l in a volume of 1 l and optimization of the coagulation flocculation process parameters as follows the mass of the coagulant bentonite which is equal to 0 9 g the mass of the flocculant ofip which is equal to 0 4 g the speed and stirring time of the coagulation step which are 180 rpm and 4 min respectively the stirring speed and time of the flocculation step which are 40 rpm and 15 min respectively the settling time which is 15 min a ph effect was also investigated and it was found that there was no influence on the coagulating capacity of the bentonite as well as on the flocculating capacity of the ofip the results of the current research should be considered under some limitations the first is that the production of large quantities of sludge which are less toxic than those produced by the conventional process however it could be addressed by regenerating this sludge for an eventual valorization in other uses the second limitation consists in that the results obtained in this work are based only on the basic dye methylene blue so the removal of other types of dyes or pollutants by biomaterials bentonite and ofip should be studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
