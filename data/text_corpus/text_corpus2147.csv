10735,variable rate irrigation vri considers spatial variability in soil and plant characteristics to optimize irrigation management in agricultural fields the advent of unmanned aircraft systems uas creates an opportunity to utilize high resolution spatial and temporal imagery into irrigation management due to decreasing costs ease of operation and reduction of regulatory constraints this research aimed to evaluate the use of uas data for vri and to quantify the potential of vri in terms of relative crop and water response irrigation treatments were 1 vri using landsat imagery vri l 2 vri using uas imagery vri u 3 uniform u and 4 rainfed r an updated remote sensing based evapotranspiration and water balance model incorporating soil water measurements was used to make prescriptions for the vri treatments at a field site in eastern nebraska in 2017 the mean prescribed seasonal irrigation depth ip for vri l was significantly greater Î± 0 05 than the ip for u for soybean in 2018 ip for soybean was greatest for vri u treatment followed by the u and vri l treatments with all being significantly different from each other no significant differences in ip for maize were observed in 2017 or 2018 in all crop year combinations the vri and u treatments had significantly greater evapotranspiration et than the r treatment yield differences among treatments were not significant except for rainfed maize compared to vri l in 2017 for maize in 2017 iwue for vri l was comparable to the u treatment the uas imagery was a better match for the scale of crop management than landsat imagery particularly for thermal data the multispectral uas data was successfully used in the crop coefficient et model for real time irrigation but using uas to determine accurate canopy temperatures for surface energy balance modeling remains a challenge keywords variable rate irrigation evapotranspiration unmanned aircraft systems remote sensing spatial variability soil water content 1 introduction irrigated agriculture constitutes the largest freshwater usage in united states using approximately 80 of freshwater schaible and aillery 2015 agricultural production is becoming more intensified and more yield can be obtained per unit of land and per unit of water than in the past over the years new efficient irrigation systems have been introduced to increase water productivity yield produced per unit of water diverted for irrigation and farm profitability center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems are one of the most efficient irrigation systems o shaughnessy et al 2016 center pivots are also widely adopted constituting about 80 of total irrigated acreage in nebraska johnson et al 2011 conventionally irrigation is applied uniformly intending to apply an equal depth of water to all parts of a field uniform irrigation is often managed according to a soil in the field having low available water capacity awc daccache et al 2015 consequently uniform irrigation may lead to various water losses which may be in the form of runoff and deep percolation dp production of high yields throughout a field with significant spatial variability in field characteristics may be difficult to achieve with uniform irrigation such variability may exist in terms of soil types topography pest attacks crop growth and nutrient availability o shaughnessy et al 2016 to account for spatial variability in crop water needs variable rate irrigation vri can be implemented to manage irrigation with spatial control and precision o shaughnessy et al 2019 vri systems can apply different amounts of irrigation to different parts of a field during a single irrigation prescription hedley and yule 2009 evans et al 2013 stone and sadler 2016 this ability could be used to match irrigation prescriptions with spatially varying crop water needs spatial management capabilities of vri systems range from relatively simple speed control systems to more complex zone control vri systems which can control individual or banks of sprinklers along the pivot evans et al 2013 o shaughnessy et al 2019 vri management may consider variability in multiple field characteristics to generate irrigation prescriptions vri can account for both spatial and temporal variation in crop water needs spatial variation in awc in fields having significant variability in soils can be used to inform vri and reduce water withdrawals lo et al 2016 predicted that mining undepleted soil water from areas of large awc in fields having significant soil variability can reduce pumpage for irrigation in nebraska spatial patterns in awc can be characterized with electrical conductivity hedley and yule 2009 evans et al 2013 vanella et al 2019 or other hydrogeophysical datasets finkenbiner et al 2018 differences in awc of a field could be used to compute vri prescriptions which may result in reductions in energy usage and water withdrawals miller et al 2017 spatial variability in irrigation requirements may be caused by more than just soil variability crop evapotranspiration etc is an important component of the soil water balance spatial etc estimates can improve the accuracy of computed spatial irrigation requirements studies have utilized models based on remote sensing inputs from satellite to compute spatial etc barker et al 2018a stone et al 2015 vanella et al 2019 models based on energy balance equation use remote sensing inputs to estimate et over large areas neale et al 2012 soil energy balance for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 are single source energy models which solve for energy balance using hot dry and cold wet pixels real time estimation and forecasting of spatial etc helps in computing real time dynamic vri prescription maps barker et al 2018b barker et al 2018b 2019 used a spatial et model called spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi geli and neale 2012 neale et al 2012 and landsat data to manage vri on fields in nebraska the model included a water balance model based on reflectance based crop coefficients neale et al 1989 and the two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 the tseb model estimates components of energy balance separately for soil and plant units the reflectance based crop coefficient model used vegetation indices to compute spatial alfalfa based crop coefficients kcr and spatial etc improvements in software capabilities center pivot vri systems communication advancements and better sensing instruments have enabled irrigation to be managed with more control and flexibility o shaughnessy et al 2016 discussed the potential of supervisory control and data acquisition systems for vri management precise models are helpful to estimate water balance components and manage vri efficiently and precisely presently farmers have a variety of data sets available that could be used for making irrigation decisions this could be challenging given the large size and complexity of data sets when collectively using them for effective irrigation management ongoing research is investigating the potential of fuzzy logic in decision support systems for vri mendes et al 2019 unmanned aircraft systems uas present an opportunity to collect crop canopy data at a finer temporal and spatial scale than satellite data woldt et al 2018 the uas have become more available due to decreasing costs ease of operation and reduction of regulatory constraints yet research has not yet utilized uas for real time vri management particularly with an et based model a number of field studies on vri have been conducted to quantify the benefits of vri stone et al 2015 stone and sadler 2016 barker et al 2018b sui and yan 2017 significant crop yield increases or reduction in water withdrawals resulting from vri adoption were not observed in most studies however sui and yan 2017 found reduction in water withdrawals with vri compared to a uniform irrigation method most of these studies except for barker et al 2018b have been conducted at smaller scales which may or may not be representative of commercial field scale agricultural production vri may be an expensive investment for a producer zone control vri in particular and management of a complex vri system requires a significant time commitment research is needed to document the benefits of vri at commercial farm scales and to study the economic viability of investing in vri systems the overall objective of this study was to assess the use of uas data with an et model for vri management and to quantify potential benefits in terms of yield increases and reduction in water withdrawals of vri management as compared to the u and r treatments in a commercial producer sized field setmi was implemented in the study using remote sensing inputs from satellite and uas this study also utilized differences in awc among management zones to manage irrigation treatments crop yield prescribed gross irrigation depth actual evapotranspiration eta and various irrigation efficiencies were compared among the treatments the specific objectives of the study included 1 quantifying and comparing crop yield and irrigation usage for different irrigation treatments 2 improving setmi as a decision support system using remote sensing inputs from uas and satellite and 3 estimating and comparing water balance response variables for different treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 study site a field site equipped with a center pivot irrigation system was used to conduct the experiment in 2017 and 2018 the field site was near mead nebraska 41 165 n 96 430 w and is property of the university of nebraska s eastern nebraska research and extension center enrec the field was irrigated with a lindsay corporation omaha nebraska zimmatic 8500 center pivot with lindsay s precision vri system allowing individual sprinkler control the field size was nearly 53 ha further details about the field can be found in miller et al 2017 and barker et al 2018b the north and south halves of the field were planted with maize and soybean respectively in 2017 and rotated for each half in 2018 the vri equipped center pivot was installed in 2014 the center pivot consisted of seven spans having a total lateral length of about 380 m with sprinklers fixed on top of the lateral pipe soils in the field were classified as silty clay loam and silt loam soil survey staff 2018 crops were planted in straight rows running roughly east to west the tillage practice was no till and the field was covered with residue from previous seasons a single crop was planted in each half every year uniform anhydrous ammonia injection applications were applied to half of the field in the autumn preceding maize planting for the next year 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was similar to barker et al 2018b the maize and soybean crops were managed as two different fields plots were designed along crop rows the design of the study plots was a generalized randomized complete block design rcbd the design included 108 plots 72 plots in the north and 36 plots in the south fig 1 the plots were rectangular with length of 61 m and width of 37 m blocking was based on the range of awc in each soil class awc of each plot was computed from estimated values of field capacity fc and wilting point wp for each plot plots were grouped into six blocks for the north half and three blocks for the south half of the field the number of blocks was dependent on the range of awc values in each block each final soil block had a similar range of awc of soils the maximum variability in awc values for a 1 2 m soil profile in each block was less than 40 mm treatments were randomly assigned to plots in each soil block and were randomized both years there were three treatments in 2017 variable rate irrigation using setmi and landsat vri l u based on neutron probe and r these were applied to plots in both the north and south halves of the field out of 108 plots in the field 81 plots were used for the study in 2017 this is because one of the original intended treatments was omitted after the experiment began these plots were excluded from the analysis for 2017 the 81 plots were equally divided among the three treatments to form a balanced design for both the north and south halves of the field in 2018 a new treatment vri using setmi and uas imagery vri u was added to the study in 2018 the north half had four treatments vri l vri u u and r the south half had three treatments excluding the vri l treatment only 54 plots in north half and 24 plots in south half were used in the 2018 analysis because some plots were used for testing a new proprietary treatment data not shown the design was balanced for south and unbalanced for north in the north more plots in each block were attributed to the new treatment vri u to gain more knowledge on this treatment irrigation was managed according to computed plot specific water balances for the plots in the vri treatments for the u treatment a single plot was chosen in each half of the field these plots had awc near the lower 10th percentile of awc for plots under the u treatment in the respective half of the field r plots were not irrigated throughout the season 2 3 acquired data 2 3 1 weather data weather data was acquired from the high plains regional climate center s hprcc automated weather data network data from the memphis 5 n 41 15 n 96 417 w hprcc weather station was used shulski et al 2018 this station was at a distance of approximately 1 km southeast of research field reference evapotranspiration etr was computed from the hourly and daily weather data from the station using the asce standardized tall reference evapotranspiration equation asce ewri 2005 etr was computed on hourly time step throughout the 24 h period and summed up to a daily time step negative values of etr during the night hours were also considered when the hourly values from a given day were added to compute daily etr for irrigation scheduling daily etr and growing degree days gdd were forecasted for the remainder of the season after the most recent data daily average values of maximum and minimum air temperature for gdds and etr were computed from 20 years of historic weather data historic data from years 1997 2016 and 1998 2017 were used in 2017 and 2018 respectively this data was obtained from the same weather station these forecasted values along with forecasted kcr values were then used to predict etc the method used for forecasting kcr is discussed below in section 2 4 2 finally irrigation needs were computed using forecasted etc values forecasted precipitation was not taken into account when irrigation prescriptions were designed consistent with barker et al 2018b four tipping bucket type rain gauges were installed in different locations around the field the rain gauges were isco model 764 teledyne isco lincoln nebraska in 2017 and tr 525 usw texas electronics dallas texas in 2018 multiple rain gauges were used to accurately capture mean rainfall received by the field rain gauges were calibrated before installation correction values calculated in the calibration process were applied to the data the arithmetic mean of all four rain gauges was used to represent rainfall for a given day data were excluded from the arithmetic mean during periods when a rain gauge was malfunctioning rainfall data was recorded on an event basis using hobo dataloggers onset bourne massachusetts and the sum of events was used to represent rainfall on a daily basis in 2018 rainfall data from the weather station was used until 11 may due to erroneous measurements resulting from improper installation of field rain gauges rain gauge data from the field was used for remainder of the season historic 1981 2010 average rainfall from may to october was about 540 mm near the research field ncei n d a this data was recorded by the national weather service global historical climate network s weather station mead 6s which was situated about 6 5 km southwest of the field the cumulative rainfall for months may to october recorded by the rain gauges at the field was 643 and 691 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively these two years could be considered wetter than normal years atmospheric pressure was obtained from neb field 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos station zreda n d pressure data was used as an input into the tseb model 2 3 2 remote sensing data remote sensing inputs from both satellite and uas were used in the model table 1 lists the landsat and uas imagery used in the model respectively in 2017 few landsat 7 images were usable for the field only one landsat 7 imagery each for the north and south halves of the field was considered good in 2018 no usable landsat image was acquired for the second half of the growing season a total of 14 uas image mosaics were used in 2018 for the vri u treatment satellite imagery from landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm landsat 8 operational land imager oli and landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor tirs were used in the model the level 1 raw and level 2 surface reflectance imagery were retrieved from u s geological survey the thermal infrared bands from level 1 imagery were used in tseb model and multispectral bands from level 2 imagery were used for computing vegetation index savi since a new landsat 8 image is collected after every 16 days landsat 7 imagery was used to increase the frequency of useful images potentially to every eight days however landsat 7 imagery is subject to missing data because of a scan line correction problem usgs 2018 if such were the case the image would not be used for the half of the field that was affected images with cloud cover above the field or close were not used in the study thermal infrared imagery acquired from a satellite could be calibrated using high resolution thermal infrared imagery captured from uas ramÃ­rez cuesta et al 2017 this calibration method utilizes the comparison of uas imagery acquired on the satellite overpass days with corresponding satellite imagery since there was only one uas imagery taken on a satellite overpass day in 2018 july 11 thermal infrared imagery from landsat was calibrated using an atmospheric correction method atmospheric corrections for thermal infrared images were based on parameters calculated using the atmospheric correction parameter calculator web application barsi et al 2003 and included emissivity calculations similar to brunsell and gilles 2002 as in barker et al 2018a b ground based weather data were used for obtaining parameters for atmospheric corrections thermal infrared images with low atmospheric transmission values 0 6 as calculated by the web application were not used thermal infrared corrections were applied using erdas imagine 2014 hexagon geospatial madison al software in 2017 and arcgis 10 4 esri redlands ca in 2018 in 2018 multispectral imagery from uass was collected using a micasense seattle washington rededge multispectral sensor the uas imagery was captured approximately once a week with the exception of fewer imagery towards end of the season due to logistical reasons the imagery was captured at a ground resolution of approximately 17 cm and then was processed and calibrated using pix4d san francisco california software it was reprocessed to a resolution of 1 m and georeferenced using arcgis esri redlands california software to input into setmi ortho imagery 60 cm resolution acquired from the national agriculture imagery program naip was used for georeferencing and root mean square error rmse of 1 5 m on an average was obtained during this process 2 3 3 soil water content data soil volumetric water content Î¸ was monitored using two neutron probes np model 503 elite hydroprobe cpn concord california referred to as probes e1 and e2 aluminum np access tubes having a diameter of 5 1 cm were used to monitor Î¸ at different depths the depths of measurement were 15 30 46 76 107 137 and 168 cm tubes were installed near the geometric center of each plot tubes were installed between two plants with an offset distance of 0 2 0 4 m from the crop row Î¸ was used to estimate root zone depletion dr Î¸ was monitored with a frequency of one to three weeks in 2017 thirty second neutron counts were used for Î¸ measurements the soil neutron count data obtained was then divided by average standard neutron count to obtain count ratio volumetric water content was obtained by using respective count ratios and the probe s calibration slope and intercept coefficients both nps were locally calibrated using 22 soil samples extracted during access tube installation in the field in 2017 the typical length of the soil samples used for calibration was about 10 cm with diameter of 4 1 cm 60 second neutron counts were taken during calibration to increase accuracy each measurement of Î¸ from the probe was correlated to volumetric water content obtained from the oven drying gravimetric method the slope and intercept from the field calibration were 0 3132 and 0 1632 m3 m 3 respectively with r2 0 73 for probe e1 and 0 2869 and 0 1135 m3 m 3 respectively with r2 0 70 for probe e2 the root mean square error rmse in the calibration process was 0 018 m3 m 3 for probe e1 and 0 019 m3 m 3 for probe e2 both probes needed firmware upgrades and maintenance after the 2017 season probe e1 needed new calibration coefficients in 2018 after probe was serviced probe e1 was cross calibrated with probe e2 the new slope and intercept for probe e1 were 0 2766 and 0 1189 m3 m 3 respectively with r2 0 96 2 3 4 soil sampling soil properties were determined for locations where access tubes were installed barker et al 2018b the fc and wp for access tube locations were assumed to represent the entire plot fc was estimated using Î¸ measurements from np observational fc wp was estimated using correlation with apparent electrical conductivity and laboratory measured wp from soil samples in 2018 fc values for plots were updated using Î¸ measurements taken in 2017 the Î¸ readings from june 19 2017 and may 12 2017 were used to update fc numbers for plots in the north and south halves of the field respectively these two days had Î¸ measurements 2 3 days after a considerable rainfall event which is suitable for field capacity estimation 2 4 water balance components the water balance was modeled similar to previous research barker et al 2018b in modeling for the vri l vri u and u treatments soil was assumed to be at fc at the start of each growing season this assumption was used due to off season recharge of the soil profile from precipitation at the field water balance calculations were computed at a daily time step with the end of the day occurring at midnight all measurements taken during a day were assumed to represent the end of that day for instance Î¸ measurements at noon were assumed to represent the midnight Î¸ at the end of that day the root zone was modeled to grow linearly with time from a specified minimum to a maximum value the minimum and maximum value of the root zone depth was assumed 0 1 m and 1 m for both crops respectively initiation of root growth started at the emergence date computed as the day that basal crop coefficient kcb first exceeded 0 12 and it was allowed to increase to its peak value when the kcb reached its peak value projection of kcb to its peak is discussed below in section 2 5 1 2 4 1 effective rainfall rainfall data from the installed rain gauges at the field site and the weather station were both used data from the rain gauges at the field were used if data from both sources were available since it was considered more representative of rainfall received by the field than values acquired from the weather station when recent data from these rain gauges were not downloaded the weather station data were used for irrigation scheduling purposes the field rain gauge data were primarily used in the final analysis the curve number method was used to compute runoff scs 1985 the curve number used for runoff calculations was 80 runoff was subtracted from rainfall depth to get effective rainfall 2 4 2 evapotranspiration for u plots single i e mean kcr were employed to compute crop evapotranspiration etc crop coefficients for maize were computed based on allen and wright 2002 for soybean the average daily value of the two single kcr relationships 2007 and 2008 of irmak et al 2013 was used these coefficients were originally developed for clay center nebraska which is approximately 160 km southwest of the field the offseason kcr was assumed to be 0 2 the day of year at which mean kcr peaks was estimated early in the season for irrigation forecasting this estimation was done using 20 year historic daily average values of gdd and the previous season s cumulative gdd from planting to effective full cover etc were computed following the united nations food and agricultural organization s irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 using equation e t c e t r k c r where etc is crop et etr is alfalfa based reference et and kcr is alfalfa based crop coefficient for vri treatments dual kcr were used in setmi to compute etc allen et al 1998 reflectance based basal crop coefficients kcbrf neale et al 2012 were computed based on the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 computed from remote sensing imagery kcbrf relationships for interpolation from campos et al 2017 were used to forecast and estimate kcb on days without remote sensing inputs in setmi dual kcr were computed using equation allen et al 1998 k c r k c b k s k e where kcb is basal crop coefficient ks is water stress coefficient and ke is soil evaporation coefficient soil evaporation in setmi was dampened by 25 for both crops to account for residue present in the field barker et al 2018b the amount of residue at field was estimated using the line transect method following shelton and jasa 2009 residue was estimated through multiple readings at different locations in the field with transects at about 45 angle to crop rows residue percentage was found to be 55 after taking average of 3 readings each from north and south halves of the field 2 4 3 stored soil water as mentioned in section 2 3 3 Î¸ was monitored at seven depths in the soil profile depth weighted average Î¸ was used to represent stored Î¸ in the modeled root zone measurements at 15 cm were assumed to represent 0 23 cm 30 cm to represent 23 38 cm 46 cm to represent 38 61 cm 76 cm to represent 61 91 cm 107 cm to represent 91 122 cm 137 cm to represent 122 152 cm and 168 cm to represent 152 183 cm however the weighted average of Î¸ included only the top 1 m similar to modeled root zone depth and was used to update the water balance 2 4 4 irrigation gross irrigation requirements were calculated from plot specific water balances a 9 1 m buffer zone inside the boundary of each plot was used to allow an area for transitions between varying application depths the irrigation requirements were computed for the inner portion of the plot excluding the buffer area management allowable depletion mad was the threshold used for irrigation management this was the soil water content threshold below which crop water stress was assumed to occur the mad used for maize was 50 of awc until reproductive stage r5 dent stage where kernels are partially dented was reached soybean was managed at 55 mad until reproductive stage r2 full flowering stage where an open flower is present at one of the two uppermost nodes after which mad was reduced to 50 considering recommendation of kranz and specht 2012 mad was increased to 60 for both crops late in the season yonts et al 2008 soils were not irrigated to reach fc irrigating less than fc level allowed water from rainfall events to be stored in the root zone irrigation was applied to maintain dr less than mad but not to exceed a specified depth 30 5 mm less than mad during real time irrigation management irrigation requirements were forecasted every week the maximum irrigation depth applied by the center pivot in a single pass was 30 5 mm irrigation depths were split into two or three prescriptions when irrigation requirements exceeded the maximum irrigation depth that could be applied by irrigation system in a single irrigation pass this methodology for irrigation management is described in detail by barker et al 2018b 2019 the pivot typically took more than one day to complete a single irrigation event for one half of the field for water balance calculations the day when a plot received irrigation was computed based on average pivot travel time if a plot received irrigation after midnight it was considered to be irrigated on the next day plots were considered to have been irrigated if the pivot passed over the neutron access tube location in the plot the pivot was assumed to run at a constant speed though actual speed varied somewhat due to variable application depths the speed was calculated using the start stop time and angular distance covered application efficiency was assumed to be 85 to account for losses such as evaporation and wind drift among others gross irrigation was assumed to be the depth of water which was intended to be applied net irrigation the depth which infiltrated into the soil and could be utilized by plants was the product of the gross irrigation and the application efficiency after the end of second season of the experiment the pressure of the pivot was observed to be low however we determined that this small change in pressure had a negligible impact on the experiment irrigation prescriptions were adjusted for rainfall if rainfall occurred after irrigation prescription development if rainfall occurred before applying an irrigation prescription the prescription was adjusted by reducing the rainfall amount from the prescribed depth in cases where rainfall happened during an irrigation event the prescription was not adjusted for rainfall in these cases the irrigation events were completed after a rain delay 2 4 5 deep percolation deep percolation was computed using different methods among the treatments for the u and vri l treatments an instantaneous dp method was used which drained all water in excess of fc at the end of the day allen et al 1998 this does not allow dr to go below 0 mm wetter than field capacity a decaying function for dp raes et al 2017 was used for the new vri u treatment in 2018 bhatti 2018 this allowed excess water to stay in the root zone to be used by plants for a few days dr could go below 0 mm negative value meaning that soil water could increase above field capacity temporarily this method was used during the final analysis for all treatments 2 5 setmi modeling for irrigation management setmi geli and neale 2012 was embedded in esri s redlands california geographic information system software arcgis v10 4 setmi was used to compute irrigation requirements for vri l and vri u plots refer to barker et al 2018a 2019 for current information on setmi in addition to the included water balance and tseb models maize and soybean were considered as different fields in the model 2 5 1 water balance model in setmi kcbrf values were forecasted using two different methods depending on crop development the first method was used if the crop development was before full cover in this method the kcb curve was projected forward to the day of the year at which kcbrf was expected to reach its peak value based on input imagery a limit on how late this day could occur was estimated using last season s gdd to reach full cover from planting at least two reflectance images were needed to project the kcb curve to the peak value the second method was followed after peak kcb the day when the crop was expected to mature reach an offseason savi value 0 099 campos et al 2017 was input in setmi this input helps lower kcb value at an appropriate rate after full cover the offseason kcb value was set to 0 12 2 5 2 two source energy balance adjustment thermal infrared imagery was input into the tseb norman et al 1995 within setmi the tseb computed etc using the priestly taylor equation to estimate canopy latent heat flux as in norman et al 1995 instantaneous et was calculated using tseb model and scaled up to daily value the tseb adjustment was not made for the vri u treatment since the tseb model was not adequately tested with uas thermal imagery the tseb was used to adjust etc and depletion neale et al 2012 for the vri l treatment in both years tseb et was included in setmi when the fraction of vegetation cover was above 20 for the majority of the field crop height and leaf area index modeled based on optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi rondeaux et al 1996 values following anderson et al 2004 were adjusted late in the season this adjustment was made to maintain crop height and leaf area index late in the season crop height and leaf area index images output from tseb model at full effective cover peak were input into model late in the season to maintain peak values for vri l tseb et was used to adjust the kcbrf computed etc on each day a thermal image was input into setmi the adjustment was weighted based on the kalman gain factor w the w can range from 0 to 1 to change the weight of tseb et in calculating the resulting etc after adjustment neale et al 2012 1 e t w b a e t w b b w e t t s e b e t w b b where e t w b a e t w b b are crop et from water balance with and without adjustment using tseb et respectively and e t t s e b is et calculated by tseb we used w of 0 56 in computing actual et barker et al 2018a the tseb et could also update the soil water balance by adjusting the modeled depletion through the ks in cases when the e t t s e b e t w b b the ks was recomputed and the depletion for the beginning of the day was also updated however in the case when e t t s e b e t w b b and ks 1 then no adjustment was made to the modeled depletion value 2 5 3 adjustment using measured soil water content the output depletion from setmi was adjusted using Î¸ measurements from np mean depletion adjustment was used to adjust modeled depletion in 2017 and 2018 four plots from the vri l and vri u treatments were selected for each of the two crop year combinations these plots had Î¸ values close to the 0th 33rd 66th and 100th percentiles of the range of Î¸ values on a measurement day among respective vri l and vri u plots the selected dates were the most recent dates at which Î¸ measurements were available at that time of selecting plots the model was updated as d a d j d m o d m s d m o where dadj is the adjusted depletion using measured soil water content from np dmo is modeled depletion d m s is mean of measured depletion for 4 plots and d m o is mean of modeled depletion for 4 plots this adjustment was made on each np measurement day in 2017 and 2018 2 6 data analysis the total prescribed gross irrigation depth was compared between treatments treatments were also compared using various response variables including eta crop yield dp change in soil water storage Î´sw irrigation water use efficiency iwue evapotranspiration water use efficiency etwue and crop water use efficiency cwue the various efficiencies were computed following djaman and irmak 2012 as i w u e y i y d i i e t w u e y i y d e t i e t d c w u e y e t a where iwue etwue and cwue are expressed in kg ha 1 mm 1 y is dry yield kg ha 2 i is applied irrigation depth mm and eta is actual crop evapotranspiration mm subscripts i and d represent variables corresponding to irrigation treatment i and dryland treatment d respectively 2 6 1 computation of response variables seasonal water balances were modeled for each plot to compute each of these variables analysis was performed between the first and last day of np measurements setmi was used to perform the water balance for the final analysis as well as in season management the measurement period in 2017 was from april 18 to september 22 for maize and from may 9 to september 29 for soybean the measurement period in 2018 was from april 23 to september 22 for maize and from may 8 to september 18 19 for soybean the last Î¸ measurements for soybean in 2018 were taken in two days due to a rainfall event happening later in the day on september 18 rainfall on september 18 was not included in the water balance calculations for plots with the last Î¸ readings on september 18 since Î¸ readings were taken before the rainfall event for these plots however this rainfall event was included for plots with last Î¸ readings on september 19 as discussed above a root zone depth of 1 m was used during irrigation management during final analysis the root zone depth was considered to be constant at 1 22 m for both crops weighted average of Î¸ readings down to 1 22 m depth were used to represent soil water status on measurement dates landsat 7 and 8 imagery was used in setmi for analysis in 2017 due to sparse landsat imagery in 2018 uas imagery was used in the final analysis to run seasonal water balances and compute response variables in 2018 peak savi values were based on imagery no forecasting for soybean no end of season forecasted savi value was input late in the 2017 fin l analysis projected end savi values were input for maize due to lack of imagery close to end of season in both years for soybean in 2018 projected end savi was also used the projected end savi was estimated based on visual observations of crop maturity close to the end of the season 2 6 2 yield processing crop yield was measured using yield monitoring equipment on harvesters yield data was filtered and cleaned using yield editor software version 2 0 agricultural research service united states department of agriculture the filtered clean data was checked using the mean yield weight per unit area reported for weighing grain carts plots were excluded from analysis if processed plot yield data points were less than 20 for maize and less than 25 for soybean within a 12 1 m buffer within each plot in 2017 threshold for excluding plots from 2018 analysis was less than 30 yield data points for both crops the yield analysis was done on the computed dry mass of crop grain yield mass of the moisture using yield monitor measured moisture present in grains during harvest was removed from grain mass while executing calculations for yield analysis 2 6 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that there will be no significant differences in yield and eta between treatments multivariate analysis of variance manova and univariate analysis of variance anova were performed to study treatment and blocking effects on the response variables wilks lambda statistic was used to study results from manova tests sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc software was used to compute statistical analyses on the data monova tests and partial correlations between response variables were performed using proc glm anova using proc glimmix was run and type iii sum of squares and cross products were calculated blocking was considered to be a fixed effect when these tests were performed analyses on applied seasonal irrigation and response variables were performed separately the least squares means were tested at a 5 significance level the correlations were tested at a significance level of 10 2 7 eliminated data in 2017 two plots in vri l and r treatments were not used in the analyses for maize the eliminated plot in vri l had an accidental spill of water on the neutron access tube which may have resulted in erroneous soil water status in that plot this plot was also used to correct the model using Î¸ measurements the spill of water occurred after irrigation prescriptions were applied in 2017 the excluded plot in r was due to low yield data points no plot was excluded for soybeans in 2018 five plots in soybean 1 2 in each treatment and one plot in maize in the u treatment were excluded from final analysis due to insufficient yield data points for these plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil properties estimates of fc and wp from barker et al 2018b were used for the 2017 growing season the range of fc values was from 0 37 to 0 43 m3 m 3 for north half and 0 37 to 0 41 m3 m 3 for south half wp values ranged from 0 17 to 0 21 m3 m 3 for north and 0 18 to 0 20 m3 m 3 for south as a result awc values ranged from 0 17 to 0 25 m3 m 3 for the north and 0 17 to 0 24 m3 m 3 for the south the new fc values used in 2018 ranged from 0 37 to 0 45 m3 m 3 for the north plots and 0 38 to 0 44 m3 m 3 for the south plots the new fc numbers in general were greater than the values used in 2017 this resulted in an increase in awc for most of the plots which had a small effect on soil water balance calculations 3 2 spatial variability in seasonal depletion fig 2 depicts spatial variability in soil water content by showing dr throughout the season for three plots in the soybean vri u treatment in 2018 these plots belong to different soil blocks from 6 blocks in north half mean mad shown in fig 2 was calculated as average value of respective mad values for these three plots plots 12 16 and 26 fig 2 were prescribed with a total gross irrigation of 117 91 and 107 mm and had mean dry yield of 3 8 3 1 and 3 1 mg ha 1 respectively plot 12 which had the highest seasonal irrigation tended to have the greatest depletion fig 2 during the dry portion of the season when irrigation was needed late july and early august 3 3 mean total gross prescribed irrigation depth in this section treatment differences for ip applied to the crop during the growing season are discussed in 2017 ip for plots under the vri l treatment ranged from 56 to 107 mm fig 3 plots under u treatment received equal ip table 2 for maize ip was 77 mm for vri l treatment and 76 mm for the u treatment treatment differences were not found to be significant contrary to these results barker et al 2018b found that ip applied for vri l treatment was significantly greater than the u treatment in maize for this site during their two year field study in 2015 and 2016 their study did not include Î¸ measurements in the model and a different value of w was used for incorporating tseb et in the model in our study model adjustments using measured Î¸ often decreased depletion in the model which likely decreased the irrigation requirements prescribed for soybean ip for the u treatment 51 mm was significantly lower than ip for the vri l 76 mm treatment the range of ip depth was 56 87 mm for plots under the vri l treatment for the 2018 maize crop ip for vri u 64 mm and u 66 mm treatments were not significantly different from each other for soybean ip was 98 mm for vri u 91 mm for u and 70 mm for vri l significant differences in soybean were observed between all treatments less water was prescribed to the vri l treatment signifying a reduction in water withdrawals over the u and vri u treatments a small difference in ip was observed between the vri u and u treatments we acknowledge this difference is small and not practically meaningful for soybean in 2018 vri u had larger ip than vri l vri u had larger estimated mean etc over vri l which may have led to increased irrigation requirements in vri u 3 4 correlation among response variables in 2017 we found significant correlation between Î´sw and eta for both crops p 0 0001 other significant correlations for maize included eta with yield p 0 003 eta with dp p 0 0001 and yield with dp p 0 013 other significant correlations for soybean were between Î´sw and dp p 0 016 and Î´sw and yield p 0 039 in 2018 significant correlations for maize were observed between eta with dp p 0 0001 Î´sw and eta p 0 0001 eta with yield p 0 002 and Î´sw yield p 0 0001 for soybean only significant correlation was observed between dp and eta p 0 0001 based upon these significant correlations manovas were computed 3 5 manova and univariate anova test results 3 5 1 manova test in the u treatment irrigation was managed based on soil with lower 10th percentile of awc hence most parts of the field were sufficiently irrigated to prevent yield reduction in years with normal rainfall amounts fields dependent solely on rainfall produce large yields in proximity to the study site the results of the tests for the 2017 and 2018 data are discussed below we found that treatments had a significant overall effect on response variables for both crops in 2017 and 2018 p 0 0001 hence the data provided enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there were no treatment differences the blocking effect was also significant for both crops in 2017 p 0 0001 for maize and p 0 0265 for soybean in 2017 univariate anovas were computed after manova results were found to be significant in 2018 the blocking effect was not significant for maize 3 5 2 univariate anova test individual univariate anovas for both crops were performed to study differences in response variables for all treatments results for four response variables eta dp Î´sw and yield are discussed all effects were tested at a 5 significance level overall the treatment had a significant effect on eta for both crops in 2017 p 0 0001 we were able to reject the null hypothesis when eta was compared for these cases significant differences were also found in Î´sw and yield due to treatment effect for maize in 2017 3 5 3 least squares means of response variables table 3 is a summary of estimated least squares means from the anovas for various response variables in each treatment for all crop year combinations for maize in 2017 mean yield ranged from 11 6 12 2 mg ha 1 the minimum and maximum plot yields were 8 3 and 13 4 mg ha 1 respectively the minimum yield was found in one of the r plots significantly greater maize yield was observed for vri l 12 2 mg ha 1 treatment than for the r 11 6 mg ha 1 treatment we may attribute increased yields as compared to r plots to be due to irrigation applied to the vri l treatment mean yield for the u 12 mg ha 1 treatment was greater than the r 11 6 mg ha 1 but it was not significantly different the mean yield for different treatments in soybean ranged between 4 and 4 1 mg ha 1 plot yield ranged from 3 4 to 4 4 mg ha 1 significant differences in soybean yield were not found among treatments this may be a result of having adequate water availability from rainfall for soybean thus more water in irrigated plots did not increase the yield for soybean in 2017 no significant differences in maize and soybean yield were observed in 2018 all treatments performed similar to each other for both crops converse to results observed in 2017 the r treatment performed similarly to the irrigated treatments this could be attributed to better distribution of rainfall events during the vegetative stages of crops in 2018 the range of mean maize yield was 12 0 to 12 2 mg ha 1 mean yield for the vri u and r treatments was 12 mg ha 1 and 12 1 mg ha 1 respectively rainfall in 2018 may have been adequate to keep the crop free from significant water stress and to produce adequate yield when compared to other irrigated treatments mean soybean yield in 2018 ranged from 3 3 to 3 4 mg ha 1 minimum mean soybean yield was found in the u treatment 3 3 mg ha 1 as discussed above there were treatment differences found in mean seasonal eta for both crops in 2017 the r 496 mm treatment had significantly lower mean eta than other treatments for maize as expected eta was correlated with yield for the maize crop in 2017 however eta and yield were not correlated for soybean in 2017 larger eta in the vri l and u treatments for soybean could be attributed to overestimation of eta possibly through under estimation of dp and runoff mean eta in soybean was largest for vri l 545 mm and smallest for r 477 mm in 2018 mean eta for maize was larger for irrigated treatments than for the r treatment however this trend was not observed in maize yield mean eta was not significantly different among the vri l 597 mm and u 595 mm treatments the r 531 mm had significantly lower mean eta than vri l and u for soybean mean eta for vri u and u was significantly greater than r and vri l mean eta was 565 mm for u and 567 mm for vri u the r had significantly less eta than the other treatments these et differences also did not result in differences in yield among treatments reasons could be attributed to overestimation of eta it was originally hypothesized that vri would result in reduced pumping for irrigation but would not reduce consumptive use etc since both vri and u would be managed for a full yield and yield is closely correlated to et however in the one crop year combination when vri reduced ip 2018 soybean there was a corresponding reduction in consumptive use 15 mm without a negative impact on yield table 3 this would result in a consumptive use ratio Î´eta Î´ip of 0 6 although the difference in eta was not statistically significant it is expected that if the u treatment had represented common practice instead of good irrigation scheduling ip for u would have been much higher than ip for vri and the consumptive use ratio would have been small future research should include additional treatments and sites to further explore the impact of vri on consumptive use computed mean dp was only significantly different for soybean in 2018 for soybean in 2018 mean dp was lowest for r 19 6 mm we did not find any significant reduction in dp with vri treatments in comparison to the u treatment mean Î´sw was different among treatments for maize in 2017 and soybean in 2018 in both cases r had the lowest Î´sw compared to other treatments this indicates that less water was available in the root zone soil layer at the end of the season for r in these cases three efficiencies were computed to compare the performance of the irrigation treatments table 4 in 2017 iwue for maize varied from 6 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 for u to 8 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri l treatment iwue and etwue for soybean in 2017 and for both crops in 2018 were small and were not presented since differences in yield were not significant in 2017 maize had etwue values of 11 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vri l and 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 for u cwue in 2017 ranged from 21 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the u treatment to 23 4 kg ha 1 mm 1for the r treatment for maize cwue ranged from 7 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri l treatment to 8 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the r treatment for soybean in 2018 r had the greatest cwue among treatments with 22 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 for maize and 6 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 for soybean 3 6 modeling differences using uas and landsat imagery 3 6 1 spatial resolution landsat 7 and 8 capture images at a 30 m ground resolution for multispectral imagery green red and near infrared bands and 100 m and 60 m resolution for thermal infrared imagery taken from landsat 8 and 7 respectively usgs 2018 2019 modeling water balance components using these resolutions may not be sufficient to study spatial variability at a sub field scale the spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery has significant impact on estimation of energy balance components using energy balance models such as metric especially in heterogeneous systems ramÃ­rez cuesta et al 2019 this can be observed in fig 4 a and b where a landsat thermal infrared image processed to 30 m resolution usgs 2019 is shown underlying the experimental plots the color in the plots depicts the values of savi fig 4 b is an image of modeled savi for 5 experimental plots additionally the resolution of landsat satellite imagery was coarse for the plot size used in the study this caused mixing of pixels introducing considerable interference effects from neighboring areas around a plot fig 4 c and d are images of savi values computed using uas imagery for the same set of plots as in fig 4 a and b the uas thermal infrared imagery in fig 4 c and d were processed to a ground resolution of 1 m the enhanced resolution was useful for closely studying spatial variability as depicted in fig 4 d the uas thermal infrared image clearly demarcates an area of high temperatures which crosses some parts of the plots this may identify field characteristics more precisely and consequently help in developing precise vri prescription maps the minimum savi value presented in fig 4 c and d was 0 3 which was much lower than the lowest savi value for the landsat case 0 57 as a consequence of pixel mixing the maximum computed savi values in both landsat and uas cases were similar 0 77 corresponding to well developed homogeneous areas the relatively coarse landsat resolution smooths the effect of high temperature low vegetation areas with adjacent cool areas high vegetation density making it more difficult to study variable field characteristics this comparison of mapping savi values was achieved using landsat and uas imagery taken on different days with only one overlap date between two datasets this did not affect the analysis because savi was interpolated between remote sensing inputs and savi from same date is shown for both landsat and uas cases in fig 4 3 6 2 temporal resolution landsat 7 and 8 pass over a location every 16 days with an offset of 8 days between the two satellites the frequency may be sufficient for irrigation scheduling purposes landsat images were not usable in the model on days with high cloud cover one uas image was taken on a landsat overpass day july 11 in 2018 in the study for year 2018 no cloud free landsat images were acquired from the mid to late season another issue with using landsat 7 is missing data strips in the imagery from the scan line correction problem usgs 2018 the problem of missing data could be addressed by using a uas to capture remote sensing images woldt et al 2018 the uas can be flown to capture imagery on sunny and low wind days maguire 2018 the uas data collection was successful for year 2018 and images were collected for most weeks during the growing season this promising aspect of uas imagery could be utilized for reliable vri management 3 7 challenges in using uas thermal infrared imagery in the tseb model 3 7 1 updated relations for computing tseb parameters setmi used relationships for computing parameters for tseb including fraction of cover li et al 2005 barker et al 2018a plant height and leaf area index anderson et al 2004 these coefficients are applicable for landsat imagery and are crop specific errors may be induced in estimation of et components if these landsat specific coefficients are used for tseb modeling using uas imagery these relationships must be updated before using uas imagery with tseb model this was the primary reason for exclusion of tseb model adjustments from the uas treatment new relationships have been developed for uas imagery maguire 2018 future work is required to validate tseb et using uas imagery with ground truth data from a direct et measurement such as eddy covariance flux et data 3 7 2 thermal infrared imagery calibration in this study point measurements of mounted apogee si 111 infrared thermometers apogee instruments inc logan utah usa were compared to respective pixels in the uas collected raw thermal infrared imagery the mounted infrared thermometers were installed in 12 locations in the field the comparison indicated that temperature from mounted sensors was lower than uas imagery temperature in a majority of cases raw thermal infrared imagery from uas resulted in an error larger than 4 k when atmospheric corrections were not applied to the imagery berni et al 2009 a few potential methods for calibration of uas thermal imagery are discussed in maguire 2018 ongoing work for calibration seems promising for use of thermal infrared imagery from uas in the setmi model in coming years 4 summary and conclusions a study of vri was conducted in a maize and soybean field in eastern nebraska using uas imagery as well as satellite imagery vri treatments were compared with u and r treatments in terms of crop yield and water response in 2017 significantly larger maize yield was observed in the vri l treatment than the r treatment with mean yields ranging from 11 6 to 12 2 mg ha 1 the increase in yield in vri l treatment versus r was attributed to irrigation for soybean 2017 mean yield ranged from 4 to 4 1 mg ha 1 with no significant yield increases due to irrigation applications in 2018 no significant yield differences were found among treatments for maize or soybean in the one crop year combination that had significant yield differences maize 2017 iwue for vri l 8 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 was larger than the u treatment 6 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 the ip was different among u and vri treatments for soybean in 2017 the ip for the vri l treatment 76 mm was significantly greater than the u treatment 51 mm significant differences were not found for maize in 2017 in 2018 vri l had lower ip than the other irrigated treatments in soybean the ip was not significantly different between u and vri u in maize in 2018 it is evident that the vri treatments were able to produce adequate yields as compared with the u treatment and vri l performed significantly better than the other treatments for maize in 2017 we found a significant reduction in ip for vri l treatment in soybean in 2018 hence significant water withdrawal reduction was observed for one case in the study one reason for the small differences in ip is that the u treatment represented good irrigation scheduling instead of common practice which often results in over irrigation the field research has led to the continued development of setmi as a decision support tool for making vri prescription maps the finer temporal and spatial resolution of uas imagery compared to landsat imagery was beneficial for modeling purposes the vri u treatment managed using multispectral uas imagery produced yield similar to other treatments and used similar mean ip compared to the u treatment this signifies that vri u could adequately manage irrigation similar to the vri l and u treatments and there is potential for improving modeling using uas imagery in the future while uas thermal imagery is often used to identify relative patterns in canopy temperature using uas to determine accurate temperatures for surface energy balance modeling remains a challenge overall vri using setmi could be adopted for irrigation management to produce adequate yields in sub humid climates with a reduction in water withdrawals in some scenarios further studies are required to implement vri more accurately and to evaluate the benefits of vri relative to the costs and labor

vri using uas imagery vri u 3 uniform u and 4 rainfed r an updated remote sensing based evapotranspiration and water balance model incorporating soil water measurements was used to make prescriptions for the vri treatments at a field site in eastern nebraska in 2017 the mean prescribed seasonal irrigation depth ip for vri l was significantly greater Î± 0 05 than the ip for u for soybean in 2018 ip for soybean was greatest for vri u treatment followed by the u and vri l treatments with all being significantly different from each other no significant differences in ip for maize were observed in 2017 or 2018 in all crop year combinations the vri and u treatments had significantly greater evapotranspiration et than the r treatment yield differences among treatments were not significant except for rainfed maize compared to vri l in 2017 for maize in 2017 iwue for vri l was comparable to the u treatment the uas imagery was a better match for the scale of crop management than landsat imagery particularly for thermal data the multispectral uas data was successfully used in the crop coefficient et model for real time irrigation but using uas to determine accurate canopy temperatures for surface energy balance modeling remains a challenge keywords variable rate irrigation evapotranspiration unmanned aircraft systems remote sensing spatial variability soil water content 1 introduction irrigated agriculture constitutes the largest freshwater usage in united states using approximately 80 of freshwater schaible and aillery 2015 agricultural production is becoming more intensified and more yield can be obtained per unit of land and per unit of water than in the past over the years new efficient irrigation systems have been introduced to increase water productivity yield produced per unit of water diverted for irrigation and farm profitability center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems are one of the most efficient irrigation systems o shaughnessy et al 2016 center pivots are also widely adopted constituting about 80 of total irrigated acreage in nebraska johnson et al 2011 conventionally irrigation is applied uniformly intending to apply an equal depth of water to all parts of a field uniform irrigation is often managed according to a soil in the field having low available water capacity awc daccache et al 2015 consequently uniform irrigation may lead to various water losses which may be in the form of runoff and deep percolation dp production of high yields throughout a field with significant spatial variability in field characteristics may be difficult to achieve with uniform irrigation such variability may exist in terms of soil types topography pest attacks crop growth and nutrient availability o shaughnessy et al 2016 to account for spatial variability in crop water needs variable rate irrigation vri can be implemented to manage irrigation with spatial control and precision o shaughnessy et al 2019 vri systems can apply different amounts of irrigation to different parts of a field during a single irrigation prescription hedley and yule 2009 evans et al 2013 stone and sadler 2016 this ability could be used to match irrigation prescriptions with spatially varying crop water needs spatial management capabilities of vri systems range from relatively simple speed control systems to more complex zone control vri systems which can control individual or banks of sprinklers along the pivot evans et al 2013 o shaughnessy et al 2019 vri management may consider variability in multiple field characteristics to generate irrigation prescriptions vri can account for both spatial and temporal variation in crop water needs spatial variation in awc in fields having significant variability in soils can be used to inform vri and reduce water withdrawals lo et al 2016 predicted that mining undepleted soil water from areas of large awc in fields having significant soil variability can reduce pumpage for irrigation in nebraska spatial patterns in awc can be characterized with electrical conductivity hedley and yule 2009 evans et al 2013 vanella et al 2019 or other hydrogeophysical datasets finkenbiner et al 2018 differences in awc of a field could be used to compute vri prescriptions which may result in reductions in energy usage and water withdrawals miller et al 2017 spatial variability in irrigation requirements may be caused by more than just soil variability crop evapotranspiration etc is an important component of the soil water balance spatial etc estimates can improve the accuracy of computed spatial

instruments have enabled irrigation to be managed with more control and flexibility o shaughnessy et al 2016 discussed the potential of supervisory control and data acquisition systems for vri management precise models are helpful to estimate water balance components and manage vri efficiently and precisely presently farmers have a variety of data sets available that could be used for making irrigation decisions this could be challenging given the large size and complexity of data sets when collectively using them for effective irrigation management ongoing research is investigating the potential of fuzzy logic in decision support systems for vri mendes et al 2019 unmanned aircraft systems uas present an opportunity to collect crop canopy data at a finer temporal and spatial scale than satellite data woldt et al 2018 the uas have become more available due to decreasing costs ease of operation and reduction of regulatory constraints yet research has not yet utilized uas for real time vri management particularly with an et based model a number of field studies on vri have been conducted to quantify the benefits of vri stone et al 2015 stone and sadler 2016 barker et al 2018b sui and yan 2017 significant crop yield increases or reduction in water withdrawals resulting from vri adoption were not observed in most studies however sui and yan 2017 found reduction in water withdrawals with vri compared to a uniform irrigation method most of these studies except for barker et al 2018b have been conducted at smaller scales which may or may not be representative of commercial field scale agricultural production vri may be an expensive investment for a producer zone control vri in particular and management of a complex vri system requires a significant time commitment research is needed to document the benefits of vri at commercial farm scales and to study the economic viability of investing in vri systems the overall objective of this study was to assess the use of uas data with an et model for vri management and to quantify potential benefits in terms of yield increases and reduction in water withdrawals of vri management as compared to the u and r treatments in a commercial producer sized field setmi was implemented in the study using remote sensing inputs from satellite and uas this study also utilized differences in awc among management zones to manage irrigation treatments crop yield prescribed gross irrigation depth actual evapotranspiration eta and various irrigation efficiencies were compared among the treatments the specific objectives of the study included 1 quantifying and comparing crop yield and irrigation usage for different irrigation treatments 2 improving setmi as a decision support system using remote sensing inputs from uas and satellite and 3 estimating and comparing water balance response variables for different treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 study site a field site equipped with a center pivot irrigation system was used to conduct the experiment in 2017 and 2018 the field site was near mead nebraska 41 165 n 96 430 w and is property of the university of nebraska s eastern nebraska research and extension center enrec the field was irrigated with a lindsay corporation omaha nebraska zimmatic 8500 center pivot with lindsay s precision vri system allowing individual sprinkler control the field size was nearly 53 ha further details about the field can be found in miller et al 2017 and barker et al 2018b the north and south halves of the field were planted with maize and soybean respectively in 2017 and rotated for each half in 2018 the vri equipped center pivot was installed in 2014 the center pivot consisted of seven spans having a total lateral length of about 380 m with sprinklers fixed on top of the lateral pipe soils in the field were classified as silty clay loam and silt loam soil survey staff 2018 crops were planted in straight rows running roughly east to west the tillage practice was no till and the field was covered with residue from previous seasons a single crop was planted in each half every year uniform anhydrous ammonia injection applications were applied to half of the field in the autumn preceding maize planting for the next year 2 2 experimental design the experimental design was similar to barker et al 2018b the maize and soybean crops were managed as two different fields plots were designed along crop rows the design of the study plots was a generalized randomized complete block design rcbd the design included 108 plots 72 plots in the north and 36 plots in the south fig 1 the plots were rectangular with length of 61 m and width of 37 m blocking was based on the range of awc in each soil class awc of each plot was computed from estimated values of field capacity fc and wilting point wp for each plot plots were grouped into six blocks for the north half and three blocks for the south half of the field the number of blocks was dependent on the range of awc values in each block each final soil block had a similar range of awc of soils the maximum variability in awc values for a 1 2 m soil profile in each block was less than 40 mm treatments were randomly assigned to plots in each soil block and were randomized both years there were three treatments in 2017 variable rate irrigation using setmi and landsat vri l u based on neutron probe and r these were applied to plots in both the north and south halves of the field out of 108 plots in the field 81 plots were used for the study in 2017 this is because one of the original intended treatments was omitted after the experiment began these plots were excluded from the analysis for 2017 the 81 plots were equally divided among the three treatments to form a balanced design for both the north and south halves of the field in 2018 a new treatment vri using setmi and uas imagery vri u was added to the study in 2018 the north half had four treatments vri l vri u u and r the south half had three treatments excluding the vri l treatment only 54 plots in north half and 24 plots in south half were used in the 2018 analysis because some plots were used for testing a new proprietary treatment data not shown the design was balanced for south and unbalanced for north in the north more plots in each block were attributed to the new treatment vri u to gain more knowledge on this treatment irrigation was managed according to computed plot specific water balances for the plots in the vri treatments for the u treatment a single plot was chosen in each half of the field these plots had awc near the lower 10th percentile of awc for plots under the u treatment in the respective half of the field r plots were not irrigated throughout the season 2 3 acquired data 2 3 1 weather data weather data was acquired from the high plains regional climate center s hprcc automated weather data network data from the memphis 5 n 41 15 n 96 417 w hprcc weather station was used shulski et al 2018 this station was at a distance of approximately 1 km southeast of research field reference evapotranspiration etr was computed from the hourly and daily weather data from the station using the asce standardized tall reference evapotranspiration equation asce ewri 2005 etr was computed on hourly time step throughout the 24 h period and summed up to a daily time step negative values of etr during the night hours were also considered when the hourly values from a given day were added to compute daily etr for irrigation scheduling daily etr and growing degree days gdd were forecasted for the remainder of the season after the most recent data daily average values of maximum and minimum air temperature for gdds and etr were computed from 20 years of historic weather data historic data from years 1997 2016 and 1998 2017 were used in 2017 and 2018 respectively this data was obtained from the same weather station these forecasted values along with forecasted kcr values were then used to predict etc the method used for forecasting kcr is discussed below in section 2 4 2 finally irrigation needs were computed using forecasted etc values forecasted precipitation was not taken into account when irrigation prescriptions were designed consistent with barker et al 2018b four tipping bucket type rain gauges were installed in different locations around the field the rain gauges were isco model 764 teledyne isco lincoln nebraska in 2017 and tr 525 usw texas electronics dallas texas in 2018 multiple rain gauges were used to accurately capture mean rainfall received by the field rain gauges were calibrated before installation correction values calculated in the calibration process were applied to the data the arithmetic mean of all four rain gauges was used to represent rainfall for a given day data were excluded from the arithmetic mean during periods when a rain gauge was malfunctioning rainfall data was recorded on an event basis using hobo dataloggers onset bourne massachusetts and the sum of events was used to represent rainfall on a daily basis in 2018 rainfall data from the weather station was used until 11 may due to erroneous measurements resulting from improper installation of field rain gauges rain gauge data from the field was used for remainder of the season historic 1981 2010 average rainfall from may to october was about 540 mm near the research field ncei n d a this data was recorded by the national weather service global historical climate network s weather station mead 6s which was situated about 6 5 km southwest of the field the cumulative rainfall for months may to october recorded by the rain gauges at the field was 643 and 691 mm in 2017 and 2018 respectively these two years could be considered wetter than normal years atmospheric pressure was obtained from neb field 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos station zreda n d pressure data was used as an input into the tseb model 2 3 2 remote sensing data remote sensing inputs from both satellite and uas were used in the model table 1 lists the landsat and uas imagery used in the model respectively in 2017 few landsat 7 images were usable for the field only one landsat 7 imagery each for the north and south halves of the field was considered good in 2018 no usable landsat image was acquired for the second half of the growing season a total of 14 uas image mosaics were used in 2018 for the vri u treatment satellite imagery from landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm landsat 8 operational land imager oli and landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor tirs were used in the model the level 1 raw and level 2 surface reflectance imagery were retrieved from u s geological survey the thermal infrared bands from level 1 imagery were used in tseb model and multispectral bands from level 2 imagery were used for computing vegetation index savi since a new landsat 8 image is collected after every 16 days landsat 7 imagery was used to increase the frequency of useful images potentially to every eight days however landsat 7 imagery is subject to missing data because of a scan line correction problem usgs 2018 if such were the case the image would not be used for the half of the field that was affected images with cloud cover above the field or close were not used in the study thermal infrared imagery acquired from a satellite could be calibrated using high resolution thermal infrared imagery captured from uas ramÃ­rez cuesta et al 2017 this calibration method utilizes the comparison of uas imagery acquired on the satellite overpass days with corresponding satellite imagery since there was only one uas imagery taken on a satellite overpass day in 2018 july 11 thermal infrared imagery from landsat was calibrated using an atmospheric correction method atmospheric corrections for thermal infrared images were based on parameters calculated using the atmospheric correction parameter calculator web application barsi et al 2003 and included emissivity calculations similar to brunsell and gilles 2002 as in barker et al 2018a b ground based weather data were used for obtaining parameters for atmospheric corrections thermal infrared images with low atmospheric transmission values 0 6 as calculated by the web application were not used thermal infrared corrections were applied using erdas imagine 2014 hexagon geospatial madison al software in 2017 and arcgis 10 4 esri redlands ca in 2018 in 2018 multispectral imagery from uass was collected using a micasense seattle washington rededge multispectral sensor the uas imagery was captured approximately once a week with the exception of fewer imagery towards end of the season due to logistical reasons the imagery was captured at a ground resolution of approximately 17 cm and then was processed and calibrated using pix4d san francisco california software it was reprocessed to a resolution of 1 m and georeferenced using arcgis esri redlands california software to input into setmi ortho imagery 60 cm resolution acquired from the national agriculture imagery program naip was used for georeferencing and root mean square error rmse of 1 5 m on an average was obtained during this process 2 3 3 soil water content data soil volumetric water content Î¸ was monitored using two neutron probes np model 503 elite hydroprobe cpn concord california referred to as probes e1 and e2 aluminum np access tubes having a diameter of 5 1 cm were used to monitor Î¸ at different depths the depths of measurement were 15 30 46 76 107 137 and 168 cm tubes were installed near the geometric center of each plot tubes were installed between two plants with an offset distance of 0 2 0 4 m from the crop row Î¸ was used to estimate root zone depletion dr Î¸ was monitored with a frequency of one to three weeks in 2017 thirty second neutron counts were used for Î¸ measurements the soil neutron count data obtained was then divided by average standard neutron count to obtain count ratio volumetric water content was obtained by using respective count ratios and the probe s calibration slope and intercept coefficients both nps were locally calibrated using 22 soil samples extracted during access tube installation in the field in 2017 the typical length of the soil samples used for calibration was about 10 cm with diameter of 4 1 cm 60 second neutron counts were taken during calibration to increase accuracy each measurement of Î¸ from the probe was correlated to volumetric water content obtained from the oven drying gravimetric method the slope and intercept from the field calibration were 0 3132 and 0 1632 m3 m 3 respectively with r2 0 73 for probe e1 and 0 2869 and 0 1135 m3 m 3 respectively with r2 0 70 for probe e2 the root mean square error rmse in the calibration process was 0 018 m3 m 3 for probe e1 and 0 019 m3 m 3 for probe e2 both probes needed firmware upgrades and maintenance after the 2017 season probe e1 needed new calibration coefficients in 2018 after probe was serviced probe e1 was cross calibrated with probe e2 the new slope and intercept for probe e1 were 0 2766 and 0 1189 m3 m 3 respectively with r2 0 96 2 3 4 soil sampling soil properties were determined for locations where access tubes were installed barker et al 2018b the fc and wp for access tube locations were assumed to represent the entire plot fc was estimated using Î¸ measurements from np observational fc wp was estimated using correlation with apparent electrical conductivity and laboratory measured wp from soil samples in 2018 fc values for plots were updated using Î¸ measurements taken in 2017 the Î¸ readings from june 19 2017 and may 12 2017 were used to update fc numbers for plots in the north and south halves of the field respectively these two days had Î¸ measurements 2 3 days after a considerable rainfall event which is suitable for field capacity estimation 2 4 water balance components the water balance was modeled similar to previous research barker et al 2018b in modeling for the vri l vri u and u treatments soil was assumed to be at fc at the start of each growing season this assumption was used due to off season recharge of the soil profile from precipitation at the field water balance calculations were computed at a daily time step with the end of the day occurring at midnight all measurements taken during a day were assumed to represent the end of that day for instance Î¸ measurements at noon were assumed to represent the midnight Î¸ at the end of that day the root zone was modeled to grow linearly with time from a specified minimum to a maximum value the minimum and maximum value of the root zone depth was assumed 0 1 m and 1 m for both crops respectively initiation of root growth started at the emergence date computed as the day that basal crop coefficient kcb first exceeded 0 12 and it was allowed to increase to its peak value when the kcb reached its peak value projection of kcb to its peak is discussed below in section 2 5 1 2 4 1 effective rainfall rainfall data from the installed rain gauges at the field site and the weather station were both used data from the rain gauges at the field were used if data from both sources were available since it was considered more representative of rainfall received by the field than values acquired from the weather station when recent data from these rain gauges were not downloaded the weather station data were used for irrigation scheduling purposes the field rain gauge data were primarily used in the final analysis the curve number method was used to compute runoff scs 1985 the curve number used for runoff calculations was 80 runoff was subtracted from rainfall depth to get effective rainfall 2 4 2 evapotranspiration for u plots single i e mean kcr were employed to compute crop evapotranspiration etc crop coefficients for maize were computed based on allen and wright 2002 for soybean the average daily value of the two single kcr relationships 2007 and 2008 of irmak et al 2013 was used these coefficients were originally developed for clay center nebraska which is approximately 160 km southwest of the field the offseason kcr was assumed to be 0 2 the day of year at which mean kcr peaks was estimated early in the season for irrigation forecasting this estimation was done using 20 year historic daily average values of gdd and the previous season s cumulative gdd from planting to effective full cover etc were computed following the united nations food and agricultural organization s irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 using equation e t c e t r k c r where etc is crop et etr is alfalfa based reference et and kcr is alfalfa based crop coefficient for vri treatments dual kcr were used in setmi to compute etc allen et al 1998 reflectance based basal crop coefficients kcbrf neale et al 2012 were computed based on the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 computed from remote sensing imagery kcbrf relationships for interpolation from campos et al 2017 were used to forecast and estimate kcb on days without remote sensing inputs in setmi dual kcr were computed using equation allen et al 1998 k c r k c b k s k e where kcb is basal crop coefficient ks is water stress coefficient and ke is soil evaporation coefficient soil evaporation in setmi was dampened by 25 for both crops to account for residue present in the field barker et al 2018b the amount of residue at field was estimated using the line transect method following shelton and jasa 2009 residue was estimated through multiple readings at different locations in the field with transects at about 45 angle to crop rows residue percentage was found to be 55 after taking average of 3 readings each from north and south halves of the field 2 4 3 stored soil water as mentioned in section 2 3 3 Î¸ was monitored at seven depths in the soil profile depth weighted average Î¸ was used to represent stored Î¸ in the modeled root zone measurements at 15 cm were assumed to represent 0 23 cm 30 cm to represent 23 38 cm 46 cm to represent 38 61 cm 76 cm to represent 61 91 cm 107 cm to represent 91 122 cm 137 cm to represent 122 152 cm and 168 cm to represent 152 183 cm however the weighted average of Î¸ included only the top 1 m similar to modeled root zone depth and was used to update the water balance 2 4 4 irrigation gross irrigation requirements were calculated from plot specific water balances a 9 1 m buffer zone inside the boundary of each plot was used to allow an area for transitions between varying application depths the irrigation requirements were computed for the inner portion of the plot excluding the buffer area management allowable depletion mad was the threshold used for irrigation management this was the soil water content threshold below which crop water stress was assumed to occur the mad used for maize was 50 of awc until reproductive stage r5 dent stage where kernels are partially dented was reached soybean was managed at 55 mad until reproductive stage r2 full flowering stage where an open flower is present at one of the two uppermost nodes after which mad was reduced to 50 considering recommendation of kranz and specht 2012 mad was increased to 60 for both crops late in the season yonts et al 2008 soils were not irrigated to reach fc irrigating less than fc level allowed water from rainfall events to be stored in the root zone irrigation was applied to maintain dr less than mad but not to exceed a specified depth 30 5 mm less than mad during real time irrigation management irrigation requirements were forecasted every week the maximum irrigation depth applied by the center pivot in a single pass was 30 5 mm irrigation depths were split into two or three prescriptions when irrigation requirements exceeded the maximum irrigation depth that could be applied by irrigation system in a single irrigation pass this methodology for irrigation management is described in detail by barker et al 2018b 2019 the pivot typically took more than one day to complete a single irrigation event for one half of the field for water balance calculations the day when a plot received irrigation was computed based on average pivot travel time if a plot received irrigation after midnight it was considered to be irrigated on the next day plots were considered to have been irrigated if the pivot passed over the neutron access tube location in the plot the pivot was assumed to run at a constant speed though actual speed varied somewhat due to variable application depths the speed was calculated using the start stop time and angular distance covered application efficiency was assumed to be 85 to account for losses such as evaporation and wind drift among others gross irrigation was assumed to be the depth of water which was intended to be applied net irrigation the depth which infiltrated into the soil and could be utilized by plants was the product of the gross irrigation and the application efficiency after the end of second season of the experiment the pressure of the pivot was observed to be low however we determined that this small change in pressure had a negligible impact on the experiment irrigation prescriptions were adjusted for rainfall if rainfall occurred after irrigation prescription development if rainfall occurred before applying an irrigation prescription the prescription was adjusted by reducing the rainfall amount from the prescribed depth in cases where rainfall happened during an irrigation event the prescription was not adjusted for rainfall in these cases the irrigation events were completed after a rain delay 2 4 5 deep percolation deep percolation was computed using different methods among the treatments for the u and vri l treatments an instantaneous dp method was used which drained all water in excess of fc at the end of the day allen et al 1998 this does not allow dr to go below 0 mm wetter than field capacity a decaying function for dp raes et al 2017 was used for the new vri u treatment in 2018 bhatti 2018 this allowed excess water to stay in the root zone to be used by plants for a few days dr could go below 0 mm negative value meaning that soil water could increase above field capacity temporarily this method was used during the final analysis for all treatments 2 5 setmi modeling for irrigation management setmi geli and neale 2012 was embedded in esri s redlands california geographic information system software arcgis v10 4 setmi was used to compute irrigation requirements for vri l and vri u plots refer to barker et al 2018a 2019 for current information on setmi in addition to the included water balance and tseb models maize and soybean were considered as different fields in the model 2 5 1 water balance model in setmi kcbrf values were forecasted using two different methods depending on crop development the first method was used if the crop development was before full cover in this method the kcb curve was projected forward to the day of the year at which kcbrf was expected to reach its peak value based on input imagery a limit on how late this day could occur was estimated using last season s gdd to reach full cover from planting at least two reflectance images were needed to project the kcb curve to the peak value the second method was followed after peak kcb the day when the crop was expected to mature reach an offseason savi value 0 099 campos et al 2017 was input in setmi this input helps lower kcb value at an appropriate rate after full cover the offseason kcb value was set to 0 12 2 5 2 two source energy balance adjustment thermal infrared imagery was input into the tseb norman et al 1995 within setmi the tseb computed etc using the priestly taylor equation to estimate canopy latent heat flux as in norman et al 1995 instantaneous et was calculated using tseb model and scaled up to daily value the tseb adjustment was not made for the vri u treatment since the tseb model was not adequately tested with uas thermal imagery the tseb was used to adjust etc and depletion neale et al 2012 for the vri l treatment in both years tseb et was included in setmi when the fraction of vegetation cover was above 20 for the majority of the field crop height and leaf area index modeled based on optimized soil adjusted vegetation index osavi rondeaux et al 1996 values following anderson et al 2004 were adjusted late in the season this adjustment was made to maintain crop height and leaf area index late in the season crop height and leaf area index images output from tseb model at full effective cover peak were input into model late in the season to maintain peak values for vri l tseb et was used to adjust the kcbrf computed etc on each day a thermal image was input into setmi the adjustment was weighted based on the kalman gain factor w the w can range from 0 to 1 to change the weight of tseb et in calculating the resulting etc after adjustment neale et al 2012 1 e t w b a e t w b b w e t t s e b e t w b b where e t w b a e t w b b are crop et from water balance with and without adjustment using tseb et respectively and e t t s e b is et calculated by tseb we used w of 0 56 in computing actual et barker et al 2018a the tseb et could also update the soil water balance by adjusting the modeled depletion through the ks in cases when the e t t s e b e t w b b the ks was recomputed and the depletion for the beginning of the day was also updated however in the case when e t t s e b e t w b b and ks 1 then no adjustment was made to the modeled depletion value 2 5 3 adjustment using measured soil water content the output depletion from setmi was adjusted using Î¸ measurements from np mean depletion adjustment was used to adjust modeled depletion in 2017 and 2018 four plots from the vri l and vri u treatments were selected for each of the two crop year combinations these plots had Î¸ values close to the 0th 33rd 66th and 100th percentiles of the range of Î¸ values on a measurement day among respective vri l and vri u plots the selected dates were the most recent dates at which Î¸ measurements were available at that time of selecting plots the model was updated as d a d j d m o d m s d m o where dadj is the adjusted depletion using measured soil water content from np dmo is modeled depletion d m s is mean of measured depletion for 4 plots and d m o is mean of modeled depletion for 4 plots this adjustment was made on each np measurement day in 2017 and 2018 2 6 data analysis the total prescribed gross irrigation depth was compared between treatments treatments were also compared using various response variables including eta crop yield dp change in soil water storage Î´sw irrigation water use efficiency iwue evapotranspiration water use efficiency etwue and crop water use efficiency cwue the various efficiencies were computed following djaman and irmak 2012 as i w u e y i y d i i e t w u e y i y d e t i e t d c w u e y e t a where iwue etwue and cwue are expressed in kg ha 1 mm 1 y is dry yield kg ha 2 i is applied irrigation depth mm and eta is actual crop evapotranspiration mm subscripts i and d represent variables corresponding to irrigation treatment i and dryland treatment d respectively 2 6 1 computation of response variables seasonal water balances were modeled for each plot to compute each of these variables analysis was performed between the first and last day of np measurements setmi was used to perform the water balance for the final analysis as well as in season management the measurement period in 2017 was from april 18 to september 22 for maize and from may 9 to september 29 for soybean the measurement period in 2018 was from april 23 to september 22 for maize and from may 8 to september 18 19 for soybean the last Î¸ measurements for soybean in 2018 were taken in two days due to a rainfall event happening later in the day on september 18 rainfall on september 18 was not included in the water balance calculations for plots with the last Î¸ readings on september 18 since Î¸ readings were taken before the rainfall event for these plots however this rainfall event was included for plots with last Î¸ readings on september 19 as discussed above a root zone depth of 1 m was used during irrigation management during final analysis the root zone depth was considered to be constant at 1 22 m for both crops weighted average of Î¸ readings down to 1 22 m depth were used to represent soil water status on measurement dates landsat 7 and 8 imagery was used in setmi for analysis in 2017 due to sparse landsat imagery in 2018 uas imagery was used in the final analysis to run seasonal water balances and compute response variables in 2018 peak savi values were based on imagery no forecasting for soybean no end of season forecasted savi value was input late in the 2017 fin l analysis projected end savi values were input for maize due to lack of imagery close to end of season in both years for soybean in 2018 projected end savi was also used the projected end savi was estimated based on visual observations of crop maturity close to the end of the season 2 6 2 yield processing crop yield was measured using yield monitoring equipment on harvesters yield data was filtered and cleaned using yield editor software version 2 0 agricultural research service united states department of agriculture the filtered clean data was checked using the mean yield weight per unit area reported for weighing grain carts plots were excluded from analysis if processed plot yield data points were less than 20 for maize and less than 25 for soybean within a 12 1 m buffer within each plot in 2017 threshold for excluding plots from 2018 analysis was less than 30 yield data points for both crops the yield analysis was done on the computed dry mass of crop grain yield mass of the moisture using yield monitor measured moisture present in grains during harvest was removed from grain mass while executing calculations for yield analysis 2 6 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that there will be no significant differences in yield and eta between treatments multivariate analysis of variance manova and univariate analysis of variance anova were performed to study treatment and blocking effects on the response variables wilks lambda statistic was used to study results from manova tests sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc software was used to compute statistical analyses on the data monova tests and partial correlations between response variables were performed using proc glm anova using proc glimmix was run and type iii sum of squares and cross products were calculated blocking was considered to be a fixed effect when these tests were performed analyses on applied seasonal irrigation and response variables were performed separately the least squares means were tested at a 5 significance level the correlations were tested at a significance level of 10 2 7 eliminated data in 2017 two plots in vri l and r treatments were not used in the analyses for maize the eliminated plot in vri l had an accidental spill of water on the neutron access tube which may have resulted in erroneous soil water status in that plot this plot was also used to correct the model using Î¸ measurements the spill of water occurred after irrigation prescriptions were applied in 2017 the excluded plot in r was due to low yield data points no plot was excluded for soybeans in 2018 five plots in soybean 1 2 in each treatment and one plot in maize in the u treatment were excluded from final analysis due to insufficient yield data points for these plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil properties estimates of fc and wp from barker et al 2018b were used for the 2017 growing season the range of fc values was from 0 37 to 0 43 m3 m 3 for north half and 0 37 to 0 41 m3 m 3 for south half wp values ranged from 0 17 to 0 21 m3 m 3 for north and 0 18 to 0 20 m3 m 3 for south as a result awc values ranged from 0 17 to 0 25 m3 m 3 for the north and 0 17 to 0 24 m3 m 3 for the south the new fc values used in 2018 ranged from 0 37 to 0 45 m3 m 3 for the north plots and 0 38 to 0 44 m3 m 3 for the south plots the new fc numbers in general were greater than the values used in 2017 this resulted in an increase in awc for most of the plots which had a small effect on soil water balance calculations 3 2 spatial variability in seasonal depletion fig 2 depicts spatial variability in soil water content by showing dr throughout the season for three plots in the soybean vri u treatment in 2018 these plots belong to different soil blocks from 6 blocks in north half mean mad shown in fig 2 was calculated as average value of respective mad values for these three plots plots 12 16 and 26 fig 2 were prescribed with a total gross irrigation of 117 91 and 107 mm and had mean dry yield of 3 8 3 1 and 3 1 mg ha 1 respectively plot 12 which had the highest seasonal irrigation tended to have the greatest depletion fig 2 during the dry portion of the season when irrigation was needed late july and early august 3 3 mean total gross prescribed irrigation depth in this section treatment differences for ip applied to the crop during the growing season are discussed in 2017 ip for plots under the vri l treatment ranged from 56 to 107 mm fig 3 plots under u treatment received equal ip table 2 for maize ip was 77 mm for vri l treatment and 76 mm for the u treatment treatment differences were not found to be significant contrary to these results barker et al 2018b found that ip applied for vri l treatment was significantly greater than the u treatment in maize for this site during their two year field study in 2015 and 2016 their study did not include Î¸ measurements in the model and a different value of w was used for incorporating tseb et in the model in our study model adjustments using measured Î¸ often decreased depletion in the model which likely decreased the irrigation requirements prescribed for soybean ip for the u treatment 51 mm was significantly lower than ip for the vri l 76 mm treatment the range of ip depth was 56 87 mm for plots under the vri l treatment for the 2018 maize crop ip for vri u 64 mm and u 66 mm treatments were not significantly different from each other for soybean ip was 98 mm for vri u 91 mm for u and 70 mm for vri l significant differences in soybean were observed between all treatments less water was prescribed to the vri l treatment signifying a reduction in water withdrawals over the u and vri u treatments a small difference in ip was observed between the vri u and u treatments we acknowledge this difference is small and not practically meaningful for soybean in 2018 vri u had larger ip than vri l vri u had larger estimated mean etc over vri l which may have led to increased irrigation requirements in vri u 3 4 correlation among response variables in 2017 we found significant correlation between Î´sw and eta for both crops p 0 0001 other significant correlations for maize included eta with yield p 0 003 eta with dp p 0 0001 and yield with dp p 0 013 other significant correlations for soybean were between Î´sw and dp p 0 016 and Î´sw and yield p 0 039 in 2018 significant correlations for maize were observed between eta with dp p 0 0001 Î´sw and eta p 0 0001 eta with yield p 0 002 and Î´sw yield p 0 0001 for soybean only significant correlation was observed between dp and eta p 0 0001 based upon these significant correlations manovas were computed 3 5 manova and univariate anova test results 3 5 1 manova test in the u treatment irrigation was managed based on soil with lower 10th percentile of awc hence most parts of the field were sufficiently irrigated to prevent yield reduction in years with normal rainfall amounts fields dependent solely on rainfall produce large yields in proximity to the study site the results of the tests for the 2017 and 2018 data are discussed below we found that treatments had a significant overall effect on response variables for both crops in 2017 and 2018 p 0 0001 hence the data provided enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there were no treatment differences the blocking effect was also significant for both crops in 2017 p 0 0001 for maize and p 0 0265 for soybean in 2017 univariate anovas were computed after manova results were found to be significant in 2018 the blocking effect was not significant for maize 3 5 2 univariate anova test individual univariate anovas for both crops were performed to study differences in response variables for all treatments results for four response variables eta dp Î´sw and yield are discussed all effects were tested at a 5 significance level overall the treatment had a significant effect on eta for both crops in 2017 p 0 0001 we were able to reject the null hypothesis when eta was compared for these cases significant differences were also found in Î´sw and yield due to treatment effect for maize in 2017 3 5 3 least squares means of response variables table 3 is a summary of estimated least squares means from the anovas for various response variables in each treatment for all crop year combinations for maize in 2017 mean yield ranged from 11 6 12 2 mg ha 1 the minimum and maximum plot yields were 8 3 and 13 4 mg ha 1 respectively the minimum yield was found in one of the r plots significantly greater maize yield was observed for vri l 12 2 mg ha 1 treatment than for the r 11 6 mg ha 1 treatment we may attribute increased yields as compared to r plots to be due to irrigation applied to the vri l treatment mean yield for the u 12 mg ha 1 treatment was greater than the r 11 6 mg ha 1 but it was not significantly different the mean yield for different treatments in soybean ranged between 4 and 4 1 mg ha 1 plot yield ranged from 3 4 to 4 4 mg ha 1 significant differences in soybean yield were not found among treatments this may be a result of having adequate water availability from rainfall for soybean thus more water in irrigated plots did not increase the yield for soybean in 2017 no significant differences in maize and soybean yield were observed in 2018 all treatments performed similar to each other for both crops converse to results observed in 2017 the r treatment performed similarly to the irrigated treatments this could be attributed to better distribution of rainfall events during the vegetative stages of crops in 2018 the range of mean maize yield was 12 0 to 12 2 mg ha 1 mean yield for the vri u and r treatments was 12 mg ha 1 and 12 1 mg ha 1 respectively rainfall in 2018 may have been adequate to keep the crop free from significant water stress and to produce adequate yield when compared to other irrigated treatments mean soybean yield in 2018 ranged from 3 3 to 3 4 mg ha 1 minimum mean soybean yield was found in the u treatment 3 3 mg ha 1 as discussed above there were treatment differences found in mean seasonal eta for both crops in 2017 the r 496 mm treatment had significantly lower mean eta than other treatments for maize as expected eta was correlated with yield for the maize crop in 2017 however eta and yield were not correlated for soybean in 2017 larger eta in the vri l and u treatments for soybean could be attributed to overestimation of eta possibly through under estimation of dp and runoff mean eta in soybean was largest for vri l 545 mm and smallest for r 477 mm in 2018 mean eta for maize was larger for irrigated treatments than for the r treatment however this trend was not observed in maize yield mean eta was not significantly different among the vri l 597 mm and u 595 mm treatments the r 531 mm had significantly lower mean eta than vri l and u for soybean mean eta for vri u and u was significantly greater than r and vri l mean eta was 565 mm for u and 567 mm for vri u the r had significantly less eta than the other treatments these et differences also did not result in differences in yield among treatments reasons could be attributed to overestimation of eta it was originally hypothesized that vri would result in reduced pumping for irrigation but would not reduce consumptive use etc since both vri and u would be managed for a full yield and yield is closely correlated to et however in the one crop year combination when vri reduced ip 2018 soybean there was a corresponding reduction in consumptive use 15 mm without a negative impact on yield table 3 this would result in a consumptive use ratio Î´eta Î´ip of 0 6 although the difference in eta was not statistically significant it is expected that if the u treatment had represented common practice instead of good irrigation scheduling ip for u would have been much higher than ip for vri and the consumptive use ratio would have been small future research should include additional treatments and sites to further explore the impact of vri on consumptive use computed mean dp was only significantly different for soybean in 2018 for soybean in 2018 mean dp was lowest for r 19 6 mm we did not find any significant reduction in dp with vri treatments in comparison to the u treatment mean Î´sw was different among treatments for maize in 2017 and soybean in 2018 in both cases r had the lowest Î´sw compared to other treatments this indicates that less water was available in the root zone soil layer at the end of the season for r in these cases three efficiencies were computed to compare the performance of the irrigation treatments table 4 in 2017 iwue for maize varied from 6 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 for u to 8 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri l treatment iwue and etwue for soybean in 2017 and for both crops in 2018 were small and were not presented since differences in yield were not significant in 2017 maize had etwue values of 11 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vri l and 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 for u cwue in 2017 ranged from 21 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the u treatment to 23 4 kg ha 1 mm 1for the r treatment for maize cwue ranged from 7 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri l treatment to 8 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the r treatment for soybean in 2018 r had the greatest cwue among treatments with 22 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 for maize and 6 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 for soybean 3 6 modeling differences using uas and landsat imagery 3 6 1 spatial resolution landsat 7 and 8 capture images at a 30 m ground resolution for multispectral imagery green red and near infrared bands and 100 m and 60 m resolution for thermal infrared imagery taken from landsat 8 and 7 respectively usgs 2018 2019 modeling water balance components using these resolutions may not be sufficient to study spatial variability at a sub field scale the spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery has significant impact on estimation of energy balance components using energy balance models such as metric especially in heterogeneous systems ramÃ­rez cuesta et al 2019 this can be observed in fig 4 a and b where a landsat thermal infrared image processed to 30 m resolution usgs 2019 is shown underlying the experimental plots the color in the plots depicts the values of savi fig 4 b is an image of modeled savi for 5 experimental plots additionally the resolution of landsat satellite imagery was coarse for the plot size used in the study this caused mixing of pixels introducing considerable interference effects from neighboring areas around a plot fig 4 c and d are images of savi values computed using uas imagery for the same set of plots as in fig 4 a and b the uas thermal infrared imagery in fig 4 c and d were processed to a ground resolution of 1 m the enhanced resolution was useful for closely studying spatial variability as depicted in fig 4 d the uas thermal infrared image clearly demarcates an area of high temperatures which crosses some parts of the plots this may identify field characteristics more precisely and consequently help in developing precise vri prescription maps the minimum savi value presented in fig 4 c and d was 0 3 which was much lower than the lowest savi value for the landsat case 0 57 as a consequence of pixel mixing the maximum computed savi values in both landsat and uas cases were similar 0 77 corresponding to well developed homogeneous areas the relatively coarse landsat resolution smooths the effect of high temperature low vegetation areas with adjacent cool areas high vegetation density making it more difficult to study variable field characteristics this comparison of mapping savi values was achieved using landsat and uas imagery taken on different days with only one overlap date between two datasets this did not affect the analysis because savi was interpolated between remote sensing inputs and savi from same date is shown for both landsat and uas cases in fig 4 3 6 2 temporal resolution landsat 7 and 8 pass over a location every 16 days with an offset of 8 days between the two satellites the frequency may be sufficient for irrigation scheduling purposes landsat images were not usable in the model on days with high cloud cover one uas image was taken on a landsat overpass day july 11 in 2018 in the study for year 2018 no cloud free landsat images were acquired from the mid to late season another issue with using landsat 7 is missing data strips in the imagery from the scan line correction problem usgs 2018 the problem of missing data could be addressed by using a uas to capture remote sensing images woldt et al 2018 the uas can be flown to capture imagery on sunny and low wind days maguire 2018 the uas data collection was successful for year 2018 and images were collected for most weeks during the growing season this promising aspect of uas imagery could be utilized for reliable vri management 3 7 challenges in using uas thermal infrared imagery in the tseb model 3 7 1 updated relations for computing tseb parameters setmi used relationships for computing parameters for tseb including fraction of cover li et al 2005 barker et al 2018a plant height and leaf area index anderson et al 2004 these coefficients are applicable for landsat imagery and are crop specific errors may be induced in estimation of et components if these landsat specific coefficients are used for tseb modeling using uas imagery these relationships must be updated before using uas imagery with tseb model this was the primary reason for exclusion of tseb model adjustments from the uas treatment new relationships have been developed for uas imagery maguire 2018 future work is required to validate tseb et using uas imagery with ground truth data from a direct et measurement such as eddy covariance flux et data 3 7 2 thermal infrared imagery calibration in this study point measurements of mounted apogee si 111 infrared thermometers apogee instruments inc logan utah usa were compared to respective pixels in the uas collected raw thermal infrared imagery the mounted infrared thermometers were installed in 12 locations in the field the comparison indicated that temperature from mounted sensors was lower than uas imagery temperature in a majority of cases raw thermal infrared imagery from uas resulted in an error larger than 4 k when atmospheric corrections were not applied to the imagery berni et al 2009 a few potential methods for calibration of uas thermal imagery are discussed in maguire 2018 ongoing work for calibration seems promising for use of thermal infrared imagery from uas in the setmi model in coming years 4 summary and conclusions a study of vri was conducted in a maize and soybean field in eastern nebraska using uas imagery as well as satellite imagery vri treatments were compared with u and r treatments in terms of crop yield and water response in 2017 significantly larger maize yield was observed in the vri l treatment than the r treatment with mean yields ranging from 11 6 to 12 2 mg ha 1 the increase in yield in vri l treatment versus r was attributed to irrigation for soybean 2017 mean yield ranged from 4 to 4 1 mg ha 1 with no significant yield increases due to irrigation applications in 2018 no significant yield differences were found among treatments for maize or soybean in the one crop year combination that had significant yield differences maize 2017 iwue for vri l 8 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 was larger than the u treatment 6 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 the ip was different among u and vri treatments for soybean in 2017 the ip for the vri l treatment 76 mm was significantly greater than the u treatment 51 mm significant differences were not found for maize in 2017 in 2018 vri l had lower ip than the other irrigated treatments in soybean the ip was not significantly different between u and vri u in maize in 2018 it is evident that the vri treatments were able to produce adequate yields as compared with the u treatment and vri l performed significantly better than the other treatments for maize in 2017 we found a significant reduction in ip for vri l treatment in soybean in 2018 hence significant water withdrawal reduction was observed for one case in the study one reason for the small differences in ip is that the u treatment represented good irrigation scheduling instead of common practice which often results in over irrigation the field research has led to the continued development of setmi as a decision support tool for making vri prescription maps the finer temporal and spatial resolution of uas imagery compared to landsat imagery was beneficial for modeling purposes the vri u treatment managed using multispectral uas imagery produced yield similar to other treatments and used similar mean ip compared to the u treatment this signifies that vri u could adequately manage irrigation similar to the vri l and u treatments and there is potential for improving modeling using uas imagery in the future while uas thermal imagery is often used to identify relative patterns in canopy temperature using uas to determine accurate temperatures for surface energy balance modeling remains a challenge overall vri using setmi could be adopted for irrigation management to produce adequate yields in sub humid climates with a reduction in water withdrawals in some scenarios further studies are required to implement vri more accurately and to evaluate the benefits of vri relative to the costs and labor

10736,water saving irrigation measures in arid areas affect evapotranspiration et processes while conserving water mulched drip irrigation is considered the most efficient irrigation method because it distributes water uniformly in the soil restricts deep percolation and minimizes unproductive evaporation from soil the effect of mulched drip irrigation on farmland et during the growing season at a landscape scale remains unclear despite being vital for developing optimal water resource management strategies in arid areas to compare the effects of mulched drip irrigation and mulched border irrigation on et based on landsat satellite imagery 2007 2009 with mulched border irrigation and 2014 2016 with mulched drip irrigation an improved surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model was used to evaluate et for the two periods of an oasis at sangong river basin in the arid region of northwest china the results show that daily et rates from farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation were on average 0 2 1 mm d 1 higher than under mulched border irrigation between june and august correspondingly the net radiation flux r increased 73 32 w m 2 on average and r was found to be the main determinant of the et differences meanwhile the average land surface albedo decreased by 20 and negatively correlated with r p 0 05 indicating that the land surface albedo was the main factor affecting r furthermore the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi exhibited a significant correlation with land surface albedo more importantly the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi under mulched drip irrigation was found to be approximately 21 lower than that under mulched border irrigation indicating that the soil moisture conditions of the farmland under mulched drip irrigation was significantly improved compared to mulched border irrigation namely less water stress resulted in better developed canopy of the crops which in turn captured more radiation and thus increased et in the end the observed increases in landscape scale et under mulched drip irrigation in arid area resulted from enhanced productivity of the crops due to lessened drought stress keywords mulched drip irrigation mulched border irrigation evapotranspiration sebal model temperature vegetation dryness index 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important process in terrestrial water and energy cycle as such quantifying et improves understanding of the water cycle and hydrological processes in terrestrial ecosystems stocker and raible 2005 the implementation of highly efficient agricultural water saving measures undoubtedly has a significant effect on the water cycle in agricultural regions compared to other hydrological processes in the land surface water cycle the relationship between et and agricultural water saving measures is arguably more sensitive and direct mccabe and wood 2006 methods for estimating et are mainly divided into two categories those using direct instrumentation and those using remote sensing the instrument based methods include the lysimeter method lopez urrea et al 2012 bowen ratio method holland et al 2013 eddy correlation method ding et al 2013 and scintillation flux meter method hoedjes et al 2002 watts et al 2000 the first three of these methods are widely used for et measurement at the field scale rana and katerji 2000 in comparison the scintillation flux meter is more suitable for et measurement at larger scales 10 km2 remote sensing measure et indirectly via various models such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998a b zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 surface energy balance system sebs model ma et al 2012 timmermans et al 2013 mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric model allen et al 2011 and three temperature model qiu 2015 compared to instrument based methods remote sensing provides an effective means of estimating et over larger spatial scales furthermore remote sensing can help determine spatial and temporal patterns in et the sebal model which is based on remote sensing data has been widely used for et estimation around the world for example rahimzadegan and janani 2019 used the sebal model to estimate et rates for pistachio crops in iran achieving a higher coefficient of determination r 2 0 8 than direct measurements bhattarai and liu 2019 tested the validity of the sebal model using flux sites in nebraska usa and found that the model could predict et with a high degree of accuracy the coefficient of determination between estimated et and measured values ranged between 0 78 and 0 89 ochege et al 2019 successfully estimated et in the aral sea basin using landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper etm data in the sebal model founding that estimated and directly measured et values were well correlated r 2 ranged from 0 94 to 0 98 thus previous research demonstrates that the sebal model performs well across a range of settings mulched drip irrigation combines the drip irrigation and mulching techniques which has been developed since the mid 1990s to become the predominant irrigation method in arid regions in china li et al 2019 xing et al 2019 drip irrigation is considered the most efficient irrigation method because it maintains a more uniform and stable distribution of water throughout the cropping cycle in accordance with crop water consumption and limits deep percolation in comparison with furrow and flood irrigation karlberg et al 2007 plastic mulching is an important element that helps improve the quality and efficiency of drip irrigation massatbayev et al 2016 compared to drip irrigation mulched drip irrigation greatly reduces evaporation from unproductive soil evaporation and significantly alters ecohydrological processes in agroecosystems z wang et al 2019 c wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 most existing studies have focused on crop yield and water use efficiency wue under mulched drip irrigation conditions the results of which show that this technique can increase crop yield and wue to varying degrees bai et al 2015 li et al 2018 h liu et al 2017 m liu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a b 2017c comparisons between et from mulched and non mulched croplands under furrow or flooding irrigation have also been documented zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 shukla and shrestha 2015 yang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 feng et al 2019 in general plastic film mulching has been shown to reduce et and alter et components as soil evaporation is decreased and crop transpiration is increased however the effect of plastic film mulching on et under drip irrigation has rarely been studied as this technology is not widely applied in many countries being most common in water scarce countries such as israel and china in the very few studies that have focused on the effect of mulched drip irrigation on et most have measured et without comparison with other irrigation methods for example et was estimated to be 538 mm during the entire cotton growing season under mulched drip irrigation from early april through mid october in 2009 at an oasis in northern xinjiang northwest china and the average daily et rate reached 4 3 4 7 mm in july zhou et al 2012 at the same oasis the mean cumulative et during the cotton growing season under mulched drip irrigation was estimated to be 501 mm between 2009 and 2013 and the peak daily et rate ranged between 5 9 and 6 5 mm bai et al 2015 experiments of mulched drip irrigation with brackish water in a cotton field in southern xinjiang showed that the et amount during the flowering and bolling irrigation stages accounted for 98 6 of the total et li et al 2016 a comparison of field scale maize et between mulched border irrigation and mulched drip irrigation indicated that total et over the entire cropping season was 10 lower under mulched drip irrigation while daily average et rates were almost equal qin et al 2016 however the transferability of these field scale observations to the landscape scale remains untested this study aimed to apply a modified sebal model to estimate et under different irrigation methods during different years and explore the possible mechanisms for any observed differences our specific objectives were to 1 compare et from the same farmland region for periods under mulched drip irrigation and mulched border irrigation management and 2 investigate the factors controlling et differences under these two irrigation methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region china s water resource is extremely scarce with a per capita resource only a quarter of the world average at the same time agriculture accounts for 80 of china s water resource uses furthermore the spatial distribution of water resources in china is unbalanced more than 80 of china s water resources are located in the south of the country xinjiang as the largest province is located in the northwest region of china and is the largest arid area in the country with the continuous development of the local economy the conflict between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent in xinjiang agriculture accounts for 95 of the total water use in xinjiang to relieve the problem of this water shortage a series of water saving irrigation measures have been applied in agricultural production with mulched drip irrigation being the most popular one ibragimov et al 2007 wang et al 2014 our study was carried out in the sangong river basin srb xinjiang nw china latitude 44 00 44 30 n longitude 87 40 88 20 e the sangong river originates from the northern slopes of the tianshan mountains the elevation along the basin decreases from 750 m in the southern region to 450 m in the northern region above sea level passing through plain oases in its middle reaches the river reaches the southern edge of the gurbantunggut desert and has a total length of around 80 km the basin is a mountain oasis desert landscape typical of the region li et al 2013 oases being more productive than the surrounding deserts are irrigated by water from the tianshan mountains fig 1 the climate is an arid continental climate based on 30 years 1980 2010 of climatology data from a meteorological dataset the mean annual temperature in this basin is 7 3 c and the annual precipitation is approximately 160 mm with an annual evaporation rate from a modified class a pan of approximately 1000 mm in this basin the agricultural mainly depends on irrigation due to limited precipitation and high evapotranspiration and the precipitation contributes vary little to the agricultural water use wang et al 2018 hence we can assume that the climatic conditions are similar between the two studying periods 2007 2009 and 2014 2016 farmland was digitally extracted to study the effects of different irrigation methods on et to ensure consistency between years unchanged farmland was selected as the study area as the main crop types in the study area are corn wheat and sunflowers and the phonological period of wheat is different from those main crops wheat fields were excluded from the analysis to eliminate the influence caused by the difference in crop types the distribution of farmland in the study area is shown in fig 1 the irrigation system in this region changed from mulched border irrigation to mulched drip irrigation in 2010 two bowen ratio observation stations were established in the region at 44 19 48 n 87 53 24 e in a sunflower field and 44 21 36 n 87 52 12 e in a corn field to measure daily et amounts during 2016 under mulched drip irrigation the observed parameters include net radiant flux soil heat flux temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and precipitation the cultivation stage of cropland is a significant factor affecting et based on the local statistical yearbooks the planting proportions of the major crop types corn wheat sunflowers and seed melon were calculated during the two irrigation periods during the mulched border irrigation period the planting proportions of corn wheat sunflowers and seed melon were 11 3 21 6 36 4 and 30 7 respectively compared to 11 5 22 1 34 1 and 32 3 respectively during the mulched drip irrigation period this demonstrated that the proportions of the main crop types were very similar between the two study periods the crop planning density was also comparable between the two irrigation periods in this region the influence of crop type on et was therefore negligible between the two irrigation periods and as such was not considered further the flowchart for comparing the farmland et between the mulched border irrigation period and mulched drip irrigation period was presented in fig 2 2 2 datasets landsat 5 thematic mapper and landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor oli tirs datasets were acquired from the u s geological survey https glovis usgs gov the spatial resolution of the image data was 30 m and the time resolution was 16 days landsat 5 t m data were obtained for 2007 2008 and 2009 when mulched border irrigation was the dominant irrigation method and landsat 8 oli tirs data were obtained for 2014 2015 and 2016 when mulched drip irrigation was the dominant method as the cloud cover percentage of the imagery needs to be sufficiently low 15 and consistent between years a total of nine images were used for each irrigation period since the resolution of the landsat 8 satellite data was 30 m which is well above the width of mulch strips approximately 0 8 m soil surface temperature could not be distinguished between under mulch and outside mulch such heterogeneity in soil surface characteristics is often disregarded in large scale studies cohen and justice 1999 gallego sala et al 2018 kramer and chadwick 2018 summary information for the imagery used in the study is provided in table 1 we also used aster gdem v2 data to generate a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m the dem data were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn of the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 sebal model the core element of the sebal model is the following surface energy balance equation 1 r g h Î» e t where r is the net radiation flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 Î» e t is the latent heat flux w m 2 Î» is the latent heat of vaporization of water usually 2 49 106 w m 2 mm 1 and e t is the evapotranspiration r equation reference goes herereflects the amount of incoming solar energy absorbed by the surface and could be calculated using the following equation liebe et al 1993 2 r 1 a r s d r l d r l u 1 k r l d where a is the land surface albedo r s d is the shortwave solar radiation w m 2 r l d is the solar long wave radiation w m 2 r l u is the land surface reflected long wave radiation w m 2 and k is the land surface emissivity soil heat flux g is the amount of soil heat exchange per unit time and per unit area which accounts for a small portion of the entire heat balance and can be calculated using the following equation bastiaanssen 2000 3 g t s 273 16 a 0 0032 a c 0 0074 a c 2 1 0 978 n d v i 4 r where t s is the land surface temperature k a is the land surface albedo c is the impact of the satellite transit time on the soil heat flux n d v i is the normalized difference vegetation index sensible heat flux h characterizes the heat exchange between the underlying surface and the atmosphere in a turbulent form and is calculated as following bastiaanssen 2000 4 h p a i r c p d t r a h where p a i r is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of the air pressure approximately 1004 j kg 1 k 1 d t is the temperature difference between height z1 and z2 z1 0 1 m z2 2 m and r a h is the aerodynamic impedance the selection of a hot spot and cold spot is a significant link in the calculation process of h the process of spot selection was improved by long and singh 2013 and bhattarai et al 2017 the following steps constitute the improved selection processes used in this study 1 a hot spot is a pixel with a high surface temperature in the top 1 of the t s histogram and no vegetation cover ndvi 0 1 and its latent heat flux is essentially zero 2 a cold spot is a pixel with a low surface temperature in the lowest 1 of the t s histogram and high vegetation cover ndvi 0 6 if ndvi fails to meet the selection requirements the homogeneous water body pixel in the area is selected as the cold spot 3 the hot spots and cold spots are selected in the area nearer the observation station and where the terrain is relatively flat i e where the slope of the pixel surface was less than 15 the estimated daily et e t i was determined by instantaneous et e t i n s t as follows 5 e t i n s t 3600 Î» e t Î» 6 e t i 2 n e t i n s t Ï sin Ï t n 2 where Î» e t is the latent heat flux w m 2 Î» is the latent heat of vaporization of water and n is sunshine duration hours 2 3 2 calculation of the mean daily et the irrigation method of the study region was dominated by the mulched border irrigation before 2010 and from 2014 on the mulched drip irrigation is the only irrigation method the mean daily et could be obtained by averaging the daily et values of all pixels of farmland it was calculated according to the following equation gautam and raman 2019 7 e t m e a n s u m e t p i x e l k where et mean is the mean daily et mm d 1 et pixel is the daily et value of each pixel of farmland mm d 1 k is the total number of pixels of farmland sum et pixel is the sum of the daily et of all pixels of farmland mm d 1 2 3 3 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi soil drought is a dominant factor restricting regional et a low level of soil drought or high soil moisture content increases et drought levels are quantified using various indices such as the palmer drought index sheffield et al 2012 standardized precipitation et index vicenteserrano et al 2010 and tvdi sandholt et al 2002 among these tvdi is an effective indicator reflecting the soil moisture at large scale sandholt et al 2002 has been widely applied at continental scale ali et al 2019 and regional scale dinh ngo et al 2019 holidi armanto et al 2019 hu et al 2018 ling et al 2019 z wang et al 2019 c wang et al 2019 thus we used the tvdi to compare soil drought levels between 2009 and 2016 tvdi was calculated according to the following equation 8 t s max t s t s min t s max t s min where t s is the land surface temperature of the pixel t s max is the maximum surface temperature corresponding to the pixel for the same vegetation index and comprising the dry edge of the t s ndvi eigenspace and t s min is the minimum surface temperature corresponding to the pixel for the same vegetation index and comprising the wet edge of the t s ndvi eigenspace the dry and wet edge equation can be expressed as follows 9 t s max a 1 b 1 ndvi 10 t s min a 2 b 2 ndvi where a 1 b 1 a 2 and b 2 are the undetermined coefficients of the dry and wet edge equation respectively the values of the tvdi range from 0 to 1 and the higher the value the higher the level of drought and the lower the soil moisture content furthermore a 1 b 1 a 2 and b 2 can be used in drought analysis based the following conditions 1 the smaller b 1 is the greater the drought interval in the study area the nearer b 1 b 2 is to 0 the more severe the drought is in the study area 2 the nearer the absolute value of b 1 is to 0 the less drought there is and the more water there is in the soil 3 the higher the value of b 1 b 2 the greater the difference in the degree of drought and the more uneven the distribution of water is in the study area 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution and temporal variation of daily et to validate the sebal model a total of eight measured daily et values etm from 2016 were compared with values from corresponding days estimated by the model eti fig 3 the coefficient of determination r 2 between et m and et i was higher than 0 9 indicating that the sebal model produced reliable estimates of et in the study region the spatial and frequency distributions of daily et during the mulched border irrigation period 2007 2009 and the mulched drip irrigation period 2014 2016 are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively daily et values range from 2 to 6 mm d 1 with higher rates occurring in the central part of the study region simultaneously the et frequency distribution revealed significant differences in daily et on the corresponding days between the mulched drip irrigation period and the mulched border irrigation period the average peak daily et values during the two periods are given in fig 4 which shows that the values for mulched drip irrigation period are almost always higher than the mulched border irrigation period mean daily et of each period also followed this trend table 2 the greatest differences in daily et between the two irrigation periods occurred in june a difference of approximately 1 06 mm d 1 followed by july 0 668 mm d 1 and august 0 36 mm d 1 all differences were statistically significant p 0 05 the multi year results reveal that et during the mulched drip irrigation period was higher than that during the mulched border irrigation period during the crop growing season june to august 3 2 r g h and Î»et under mulched border irrigation and mulched drip irrigation fig 6 shows distinct temporal changes in r g h and Î»et r increased between june and july and then decreased to a low level while g showed a decreasing trend over time h showed an upward trend over time and Î»et changed in a similar way to r indicating that r was the main factor affecting et bruemmer et al 2012 to verify this we calculated the correlation coefficient between each pair of the four surface fluxes r g h and Î»et during the different irrigation period fig 7 the correlation coefficient which is calculated by using the average value of each flux in corresponding days between the average values of r and Î»et was 0 96 during the mulched border irrigation period and 0 95 during the mulched drip irrigation period as such r was the main factor affecting et irrespective of the method of irrigation used furthermore fig 6 indicates that in general r g h and Î»et under mulched drip irrigation were higher than under mulched border irrigation this indicates that mulched drip irrigation increased these fluxes to varying degrees during the main crop growing season r was 15 higher 73 32 w m 2 g was 17 higher 17 88 w m 2 and h was 18 higher 12 44 w m 2 since r was the dominant factor affecting et and it showed the greatest difference between the irrigation periods the average Î»et and daily et of farmland with mulched drip irrigation were generally higher than with mulched border irrigation 3 3 factors contributing to difference in r between irrigation methods the amount of r was identified as the main factor controlling the difference in et between the two irrigation methods the higher the r is the more solar energy is available for photosynthesis and transpiration land surface albedo which indicates the amount of solar energy reflects back to the atmosphere from the land surface blonquist et al 2010 samarasinghe 2003 singh et al 2016 is also closely related to r higher land surface albedo results in lower r this is demonstrated by a significant negative correlation between r mean and the average land surface albedo p 0 05 fig 8 a the average land surface albedo during the mulched border irrigation period was 0 329 which is 20 higher than during the mulched drip irrigation period 0 263 farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation can therefore absorb relatively more solar energy which results in higher r values in addition land surface albedo is affected by surface characteristics as our study focused on the crop growing season the farmland surface was mainly covered by the crop canopy thus we speculated that surface albedo should be correlated with ndvi which is an indicator of vegetation cover indeed surface albedo was significantly negatively correlated with ndvi p 0 05 fig 8b this indicates that ndvi values obtained during the mulched drip irrigation period were higher than during the mulched border irrigation period generally crop growth is enhanced under mulched drip irrigation comparing to mulched border irrigation which reduces land surface albedo and increases r and subsequently results in higher daily et 3 4 soil drought levels under different irrigation methods table 3 shows that the average tvdi values for the farmland under mulched drip irrigation were appropriately 0 05 to 0 2 lower than that under mulched border irrigation this indicates that mulched drip irrigation reduced drought stress in crops in comparison to mulched border irrigation simultaneously the ts ndvi eigenspaces plotted in fig 9 further indicate a lower level of drought under mulched drip irrigation first the dry edge undetermined coefficient b 1 during the mulched drip irrigation period was greater than that during the mulched border irrigation period b 1 during the mulched border irrigation period 22 26 19 13 08 21 78 14 09 18 91 and 19 57 b 1 during the mulched drip irrigation period 14 19 22 09 15 69 22 54 17 64 18 19 21 55 18 29 and 14 06 second the values of b 1 b 2 during the mulched drip irrigation period were lower than during the mulched border irrigation period b 1 b 2 during the mulched border irrigation period 10 20 16 6 59 8 59 37 54 6 77 and 11 41 b 1 b 2 during the mulched drip irrigation period 3 92 10 67 5 35 1 49 6 37 6 81 2 77 0 88 and 8 97 this illustrates that the distribution of soil water in the farmland under mulched drip irrigation was more uniform than under mulched border irrigation drip irrigation supplies water at high frequencies directly to the root zone in a restricted volume of soil so that the soil moisture conditions for crops were generally better than under border irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to compare the climatic conditions affecting et during the different irrigation periods local meteorology station data were used to summarize the evaporative demand evaporation from a modified class a pan and precipitation between june and august table 4 the average total potential evapotranspiration etp during the period of mulched border irrigation was 525 8 mm for the growing season which was slightly higher than the period under mulched drip irrigation 488 3 mm for the growing season although the etp of the farmland was slightly lower for the period under drip irrigation management et was higher during this period than the period under mulched border irrigation this indicates that the difference in et between the two periods was not caused by etp but by crop growth as indicated by ndvi yue et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 zou et al 2018 on the other hand table 4 shows that the average total precipitation between june and august during the mulched border irrigation period was 63 27 mm comparing to 50 33 mm during the mulched drip irrigation period despite this the mean daily et during the mulched drip irrigation period were higher implying that precipitation was not the primary driver of et in this irrigated farmland 4 2 the effects of irrigation methods on et the details of the irrigation applied between june and august during the two periods are shown in table 5 mulched border irrigation consumed much more water than mulched drip irrigation 134 mm however previous studies indicated that the water loss rate via leaching and soil evaporation for mulched border irrigation in this region can exceed 50 compared to 10 under mulched drip irrigation h liu et al 2017 m liu et al 2017 therefore a larger proportion of irrigation water couldn t be used by crops on mulched border irrigated farmland compared to farmland irrigated using mulched drip irrigation grebenyukov 2002 moavenshahidi et al 2016 this results in less available water for et in border irrigated farmland furthermore between june and august the crop canopy is fully closed and the evaporation from the soil surface is very limited naveen et al 2019 mulched drip irrigation can only limit the loss of water via evaporation from the soil while transpiration can be enhanced due to improved crop growth liu et al 2015 thus et rates during the main crop growing season were typically higher under mulched drip irrigation than mulched border irrigation 4 3 sustainability of mulched drip irrigation it is clear that mulched drip irrigation is an effective strategy for conserving water when compared to the more commonly applied border irrigation on the one hand mulched drip irrigation improves the crop growth which results in a higher et rate while on the other hand it improves the water use efficiency of farmland by limiting water loss some studies show that the proportion of water lost under mulched border irrigation can exceed 40 zheng et al 2017 compared to 13 or lower under mulched drip irrigation umair et al 2019 this means that a greater proportion of available water is taken up by crops under mulched drip irrigation which enhanced crop growth thus higher et under mulched drip irrigation during the main crop growing season does not contradict the sustainability of this irrigation strategy with respect to water conservation 5 conclusion to compare the farmland et between mulched border irrigation period and mulched drip irrigation period we used sebal model to evaluate et for the two periods of the farmland in sangong river basin in northern xinjiang northwest china daily et values for farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation were higher than the same farmland managed under mulched border irrigation with differences ranging from 0 36 to 1 06 mm d 1 an increase in net radiation flux increased the daily et rates during the mulched drip irrigation period at the same time ndvi showed a significant negative correlation with land surface albedo r 2 0 877 the ndvi values of farmland under mulched drip irrigation were higher than that under mulched border irrigation which resulted in a lower land surface albedo and increased r values the tvdi and ts ndvi eigenspace results indicated that crops under mulched drip irrigation experienced on average lower levels of water stress compared to crops under mulched border irrigation this improved water conditions and crop growth resulted in a denser and higher canopy with correspondingly high ndvi values that in turn captured more energy for transpiration thus mulched drip irrigation can reduce unproductive water consumption by leaching and soil evaporation and increases effective water use such as crop transpiration as an advanced technology drip irrigation creates more favorable soil water conditions enhances crop growth and thereby increases et rates declaration of conflict interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgments this study was funded by the national natural science foundation of china no u1503182 31470708 41501205 41271202 
10736,water saving irrigation measures in arid areas affect evapotranspiration et processes while conserving water mulched drip irrigation is considered the most efficient irrigation method because it distributes water uniformly in the soil restricts deep percolation and minimizes unproductive evaporation from soil the effect of mulched drip irrigation on farmland et during the growing season at a landscape scale remains unclear despite being vital for developing optimal water resource management strategies in arid areas to compare the effects of mulched drip irrigation and mulched border irrigation on et based on landsat satellite imagery 2007 2009 with mulched border irrigation and 2014 2016 with mulched drip irrigation an improved surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model was used to evaluate et for the two periods of an oasis at sangong river basin in the arid region of northwest china the results show that daily et rates from farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation were on average 0 2 1 mm d 1 higher than under mulched border irrigation between june and august correspondingly the net radiation flux r increased 73 32 w m 2 on average and r was found to be the main determinant of the et differences meanwhile the average land surface albedo decreased by 20 and negatively correlated with r p 0 05 indicating that the land surface albedo was the main factor affecting r furthermore the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi exhibited a significant correlation with land surface albedo more importantly the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi under mulched drip irrigation was found to be approximately 21 lower than that under mulched border irrigation indicating that the soil moisture conditions of the farmland under mulched drip irrigation was significantly improved compared to mulched border irrigation namely less water stress resulted in better developed canopy of the crops which in turn captured more radiation and thus increased et in the end the observed increases in landscape scale et under mulched drip irrigation in arid area resulted from enhanced productivity of the crops due to lessened drought stress keywords mulched drip irrigation mulched border irrigation evapotranspiration sebal model temperature vegetation dryness index 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important process in terrestrial water and energy cycle as such quantifying et improves understanding of the water cycle and hydrological processes in terrestrial ecosystems stocker and raible 2005 the implementation of highly efficient agricultural water saving measures undoubtedly has a significant effect on the water cycle in agricultural regions compared to other hydrological processes in the land surface water cycle the relationship between et and agricultural water saving measures is arguably more sensitive and direct mccabe and wood 2006 methods for estimating et are mainly divided into two categories those using direct instrumentation and those using remote sensing the instrument based methods include the lysimeter method lopez urrea et al 2012 bowen ratio method holland et al 2013 eddy correlation method ding et al 2013 and scintillation flux meter method hoedjes et al 2002 watts et al 2000 the first three of these methods are widely used for et measurement at the field scale rana and katerji 2000 in comparison the scintillation flux meter is more suitable for et measurement at larger scales 10 km2 remote sensing measure et indirectly via various models such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998a b zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 surface energy balance system sebs model ma et al 2012 timmermans et al 2013 mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric model allen et al 2011 and three temperature model qiu 2015 compared to instrument based methods remote sensing provides an effective means of estimating et over larger spatial scales furthermore remote sensing can help determine spatial and temporal patterns in et the sebal model which is based on remote sensing data has been widely used for et estimation around the world for example rahimzadegan and janani 2019 used the sebal model to estimate et rates for pistachio crops in iran achieving a higher coefficient of determination r 2 0 8 than direct measurements bhattarai and liu 2019 tested the validity of the sebal model using flux sites in nebraska usa and found that the model could predict et with a high degree of accuracy the coefficient of determination between estimated et and measured values ranged between 0 78 and 0 89 ochege et al 2019 successfully estimated et in the aral sea basin using landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper etm data in the sebal model founding that estimated and directly measured et values were well correlated r 2 ranged from 0 94 to 0 98 thus previous research demonstrates that the sebal model performs well across a range of settings mulched drip irrigation combines the drip irrigation and mulching techniques which has been developed since the mid 1990s to become the predominant irrigation method in arid regions in china li et al 2019 xing et al 2019 drip irrigation is considered the most efficient irrigation method because it maintains a more uniform and stable distribution of water throughout the cropping cycle in accordance with crop water consumption and limits deep percolation in comparison with furrow and flood irrigation karlberg et al 2007 plastic mulching is an important element that helps improve the quality and efficiency of drip irrigation massatbayev et al 2016 compared to drip irrigation mulched drip irrigation greatly reduces evaporation from unproductive soil evaporation and significantly alters ecohydrological processes in agroecosystems z wang et al 2019 c wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 most existing studies have focused on crop yield and water use efficiency wue under mulched drip irrigation conditions the results of which show that this technique can increase crop yield and wue to varying degrees bai et al 2015 li et al 2018 h liu et al 2017 m liu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a b 2017c comparisons between et from mulched and non mulched croplands under furrow or flooding irrigation have also been documented zegada lizarazu and berliner 2011 shukla and shrestha 2015 yang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 feng et al 2019 in general plastic film mulching has been shown to reduce et and alter et components as soil evaporation is decreased and crop transpiration is increased however the effect of plastic film mulching on et under drip irrigation has rarely been studied as this technology is not widely applied in many countries being most common in water scarce countries such as israel and china in the very few studies that have focused on the effect of mulched drip irrigation on et most have measured et without comparison with other irrigation methods for example et was estimated to be 538 mm during the entire cotton growing season under mulched drip irrigation from early april through mid october in 2009 at an oasis in northern xinjiang northwest china and the average daily et rate reached 4 3 4 7 mm in july zhou et al 2012 at the same oasis the mean cumulative et during the cotton growing season under mulched drip irrigation was estimated to be 501 mm between 2009 and 2013 and the peak daily et rate ranged between 5 9 and 6 5 mm bai et al 2015 experiments of mulched drip irrigation with brackish water in a cotton field in southern xinjiang showed that the et amount during the flowering and bolling irrigation stages accounted for 98 6 of the total et li et al 2016 a comparison of field scale maize et between mulched border irrigation and mulched drip irrigation indicated that total et over the entire cropping season was 10 lower under mulched drip irrigation while daily average et rates were almost equal qin et al 2016 however the transferability of these field scale observations to the landscape scale remains untested this study aimed to apply a modified sebal model to estimate et under different irrigation methods during different years and explore the possible mechanisms for any observed differences our specific objectives were to 1 compare et from the same farmland region for periods under mulched drip irrigation and mulched border irrigation management and 2 investigate the factors controlling et differences under these two irrigation methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region china s water resource is extremely scarce with a per capita resource only a quarter of the world average at the same time agriculture accounts for 80 of china s water resource uses furthermore the spatial distribution of water resources in china is unbalanced more than 80 of china s water resources are located in the south of the country xinjiang as the largest province is located in the northwest region of china and is the largest arid area in the country with the continuous development of the local economy the conflict between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent in xinjiang agriculture accounts for 95 of the total water use in xinjiang to relieve the problem of this water shortage a series of water saving irrigation measures have been applied in agricultural production with mulched drip irrigation being the most popular one ibragimov et al 2007 wang et al 2014 our study was carried out in the sangong river basin srb xinjiang nw china latitude 44 00 44 30 n longitude 87 40 88 20 e the sangong river originates from the northern slopes of the tianshan mountains the elevation along the basin decreases from 750 m in the southern region to 450 m in the northern region above sea level passing through plain oases in its middle reaches the river reaches the southern edge of the gurbantunggut desert and has a total length of around 80 km the basin is a mountain oasis desert landscape typical of the region li et al 2013 oases being more productive than the surrounding deserts are irrigated by water from the tianshan mountains fig 1 the climate is an arid continental climate based on 30 years 1980 2010 of climatology data from a meteorological dataset the mean annual temperature in this basin is 7 3 c and the annual precipitation is approximately 160 mm with an annual evaporation rate from a modified class a pan of approximately 1000 mm in this basin the agricultural mainly depends on irrigation due to limited precipitation and high evapotranspiration and the precipitation contributes vary little to the agricultural water use wang et al 2018 hence we can assume that the climatic conditions are similar between the two studying periods 2007 2009 and 2014 2016 farmland was digitally extracted to study the effects of different irrigation methods on et to ensure consistency between years unchanged farmland was selected as the study area as the main crop types in the study area are corn wheat and sunflowers and the phonological period of wheat is different from those main crops wheat fields were excluded from the analysis to eliminate the influence caused by the difference in crop types the distribution of farmland in the study area is shown in fig 1 the irrigation system in this region changed from mulched border irrigation to mulched drip irrigation in 2010 two bowen ratio observation stations were established in the region at 44 19 48 n 87 53 24 e in a sunflower field and 44 21 36 n 87 52 12 e in a corn field to measure daily et amounts during 2016 under mulched drip irrigation the observed parameters include net radiant flux soil heat flux temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and precipitation the cultivation stage of cropland is a significant factor affecting et based on the local statistical yearbooks the planting proportions of the major crop types corn wheat sunflowers and seed melon were calculated during the two irrigation periods during the mulched border irrigation period the planting proportions of corn wheat sunflowers and seed melon were 11 3 21 6 36 4 and 30 7 respectively compared to 11 5 22 1 34 1 and 32 3 respectively during the mulched drip irrigation period this demonstrated that the proportions of the main crop types were very similar between the two study periods the crop planning density was also comparable between the two irrigation periods in this region the influence of crop type on et was therefore negligible between the two irrigation periods and as such was not considered further the flowchart for comparing the farmland et between the mulched border irrigation period and mulched drip irrigation period was presented in fig 2 2 2 datasets landsat 5 thematic mapper and landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor oli tirs datasets were acquired from the u s geological survey https glovis usgs gov the spatial resolution of the image data was 30 m and the time resolution was 16 days landsat 5 t m data were obtained for 2007 2008 and 2009 when mulched border irrigation was the dominant irrigation method and landsat 8 oli tirs data were obtained for 2014 2015 and 2016 when mulched drip irrigation was the dominant method as the cloud cover percentage of the imagery needs to be sufficiently low 15 and consistent between years a total of nine images were used for each irrigation period since the resolution of the landsat 8 satellite data was 30 m which is well above the width of mulch strips approximately 0 8 m soil surface temperature could not be distinguished between under mulch and outside mulch such heterogeneity in soil surface characteristics is often disregarded in large scale studies cohen and justice 1999 gallego sala et al 2018 kramer and chadwick 2018 summary information for the imagery used in the study is provided in table 1 we also used aster gdem v2 data to generate a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m the dem data were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn of the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 sebal model the core element of the sebal model is the following surface energy balance equation 1 r g h Î» e t where r is the net radiation flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 Î» e t is the latent heat flux w m 2 Î» is the latent heat of vaporization of water usually 2 49 106 w m 2 mm 1 and e t is the evapotranspiration r equation reference goes herereflects the amount of incoming solar energy absorbed by the surface and could be calculated using the following equation liebe et al 1993 2 r 1 a r s d r l d r l u 1 k r l d where a is the land surface albedo r s d is the shortwave solar radiation w m 2 r l d is the solar long wave radiation w m 2 r l u is the land surface reflected long wave radiation w m 2 and k is the land surface emissivity soil heat flux g is the amount of soil heat exchange per unit time and per unit area which accounts for a small portion of the entire heat balance and can be calculated using the following equation bastiaanssen 2000 3 g t s 273 16 a 0 0032 a c 0 0074 a c 2 1 0 978 n d v i 4 r where t s is the land surface temperature k a is the land surface albedo c is the impact of the satellite transit time on the soil heat flux n d v i is the normalized difference vegetation index sensible heat flux h characterizes the heat exchange between the underlying surface and the atmosphere in a turbulent form and is calculated as following bastiaanssen 2000 4 h p a i r c p d t r a h where p a i r is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of the air pressure approximately 1004 j kg 1 k 1 d t is the temperature difference between height z1 and z2 z1 0 1 m z2 2 m and r a h is the aerodynamic impedance the selection of a hot spot and cold spot is a significant link in the calculation process of h the process of spot selection was improved by long and singh 2013 and bhattarai et al 2017 the following steps constitute the improved selection processes used in this study 1 a hot spot is a pixel with a high surface temperature in the top 1 of the t s histogram and no vegetation cover ndvi 0 1 and its latent heat flux is essentially zero 2 a cold spot is a pixel with a low surface temperature in the lowest 1 of the t s histogram and high vegetation cover ndvi 0 6 if ndvi fails to meet the selection requirements the homogeneous water body pixel in the area is selected as the cold spot 3 the hot spots and cold spots are selected in the area nearer the observation station and where the terrain is relatively flat i e where the slope of the pixel surface was less than 15 the estimated daily et e t i was determined by instantaneous et e t i n s t as follows 5 e t i n s t 3600 Î» e t Î» 6 e t i 2 n e t i n s t Ï sin Ï t n 2 where Î» e t is the latent heat flux w m 2 Î» is the latent heat of vaporization of water and n is sunshine duration hours 2 3 2 calculation of the mean daily et the irrigation method of the study region was dominated by the mulched border irrigation before 2010 and from 2014 on the mulched drip irrigation is the only irrigation method the mean daily et could be obtained by averaging the daily et values of all pixels of farmland it was calculated according to the following equation gautam and raman 2019 7 e t m e a n s u m e t p i x e l k where et mean is the mean daily et mm d 1 et pixel is the daily et value of each pixel of farmland mm d 1 k is the total number of pixels of farmland sum et pixel is the sum of the daily et of all pixels of farmland mm d 1 2 3 3 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi soil drought is a dominant factor restricting regional et a low level of soil drought or high soil moisture content increases et drought levels are quantified using various indices such as the palmer drought index sheffield et al 2012 standardized precipitation et index vicenteserrano et al 2010 and tvdi sandholt et al 2002 among these tvdi is an effective indicator reflecting the soil moisture at large scale sandholt et al 2002 has been widely applied at continental scale ali et al 2019 and regional scale dinh ngo et al 2019 holidi armanto et al 2019 hu et al 2018 ling et al 2019 z wang et al 2019 c wang et al 2019 thus we used the tvdi to compare soil drought levels between 2009 and 2016 tvdi was calculated according to the following equation 8 t s max t s t s min t s max t s min where t s is the land surface temperature of the pixel t s max is the maximum surface temperature corresponding to the pixel for the same vegetation index and comprising the dry edge of the t s ndvi eigenspace and t s min is the minimum surface temperature corresponding to the pixel for the same vegetation index and comprising the wet edge of the t s ndvi eigenspace the dry and wet edge equation can be expressed as follows 9 t s max a 1 b 1 ndvi 10 t s min a 2 b 2 ndvi where a 1 b 1 a 2 and b 2 are the undetermined coefficients of the dry and wet edge equation respectively the values of the tvdi range from 0 to 1 and the higher the value the higher the level of drought and the lower the soil moisture content furthermore a 1 b 1 a 2 and b 2 can be used in drought analysis based the following conditions 1 the smaller b 1 is the greater the drought interval in the study area the nearer b 1 b 2 is to 0 the more severe the drought is in the study area 2 the nearer the absolute value of b 1 is to 0 the less drought there is and the more water there is in the soil 3 the higher the value of b 1 b 2 the greater the difference in the degree of drought and the more uneven the distribution of water is in the study area 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution and temporal variation of daily et to validate the sebal model a total of eight measured daily et values etm from 2016 were compared with values from corresponding days estimated by the model eti fig 3 the coefficient of determination r 2 between et m and et i was higher than 0 9 indicating that the sebal model produced reliable estimates of et in the study region the spatial and frequency distributions of daily et during the mulched border irrigation period 2007 2009 and the mulched drip irrigation period 2014 2016 are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively daily et values range from 2 to 6 mm d 1 with higher rates occurring in the central part of the study region simultaneously the et frequency distribution revealed significant differences in daily et on the corresponding days between the mulched drip irrigation period and the mulched border irrigation period the average peak daily et values during the two periods are given in fig 4 which shows that the values for mulched drip irrigation period are almost always higher than the mulched border irrigation period mean daily et of each period also followed this trend table 2 the greatest differences in daily et between the two irrigation periods occurred in june a difference of approximately 1 06 mm d 1 followed by july 0 668 mm d 1 and august 0 36 mm d 1 all differences were statistically significant p 0 05 the multi year results reveal that et during the mulched drip irrigation period was higher than that during the mulched border irrigation period during the crop growing season june to august 3 2 r g h and Î»et under mulched border irrigation and mulched drip irrigation fig 6 shows distinct temporal changes in r g h and Î»et r increased between june and july and then decreased to a low level while g showed a decreasing trend over time h showed an upward trend over time and Î»et changed in a similar way to r indicating that r was the main factor affecting et bruemmer et al 2012 to verify this we calculated the correlation coefficient between each pair of the four surface fluxes r g h and Î»et during the different irrigation period fig 7 the correlation coefficient which is calculated by using the average value of each flux in corresponding days between the average values of r and Î»et was 0 96 during the mulched border irrigation period and 0 95 during the mulched drip irrigation period as such r was the main factor affecting et irrespective of the method of irrigation used furthermore fig 6 indicates that in general r g h and Î»et under mulched drip irrigation were higher than under mulched border irrigation this indicates that mulched drip irrigation increased these fluxes to varying degrees during the main crop growing season r was 15 higher 73 32 w m 2 g was 17 higher 17 88 w m 2 and h was 18 higher 12 44 w m 2 since r was the dominant factor affecting et and it showed the greatest difference between the irrigation periods the average Î»et and daily et of farmland with mulched drip irrigation were generally higher than with mulched border irrigation 3 3 factors contributing to difference in r between irrigation methods the amount of r was identified as the main factor controlling the difference in et between the two irrigation methods the higher the r is the more solar energy is available for photosynthesis and transpiration land surface albedo which indicates the amount of solar energy reflects back to the atmosphere from the land surface blonquist et al 2010 samarasinghe 2003 singh et al 2016 is also closely related to r higher land surface albedo results in lower r this is demonstrated by a significant negative correlation between r mean and the average land surface albedo p 0 05 fig 8 a the average land surface albedo during the mulched border irrigation period was 0 329 which is 20 higher than during the mulched drip irrigation period 0 263 farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation can therefore absorb relatively more solar energy which results in higher r values in addition land surface albedo is affected by surface characteristics as our study focused on the crop growing season the farmland surface was mainly covered by the crop canopy thus we speculated that surface albedo should be correlated with ndvi which is an indicator of vegetation cover indeed surface albedo was significantly negatively correlated with ndvi p 0 05 fig 8b this indicates that ndvi values obtained during the mulched drip irrigation period were higher than during the mulched border irrigation period generally crop growth is enhanced under mulched drip irrigation comparing to mulched border irrigation which reduces land surface albedo and increases r and subsequently results in higher daily et 3 4 soil drought levels under different irrigation methods table 3 shows that the average tvdi values for the farmland under mulched drip irrigation were appropriately 0 05 to 0 2 lower than that under mulched border irrigation this indicates that mulched drip irrigation reduced drought stress in crops in comparison to mulched border irrigation simultaneously the ts ndvi eigenspaces plotted in fig 9 further indicate a lower level of drought under mulched drip irrigation first the dry edge undetermined coefficient b 1 during the mulched drip irrigation period was greater than that during the mulched border irrigation period b 1 during the mulched border irrigation period 22 26 19 13 08 21 78 14 09 18 91 and 19 57 b 1 during the mulched drip irrigation period 14 19 22 09 15 69 22 54 17 64 18 19 21 55 18 29 and 14 06 second the values of b 1 b 2 during the mulched drip irrigation period were lower than during the mulched border irrigation period b 1 b 2 during the mulched border irrigation period 10 20 16 6 59 8 59 37 54 6 77 and 11 41 b 1 b 2 during the mulched drip irrigation period 3 92 10 67 5 35 1 49 6 37 6 81 2 77 0 88 and 8 97 this illustrates that the distribution of soil water in the farmland under mulched drip irrigation was more uniform than under mulched border irrigation drip irrigation supplies water at high frequencies directly to the root zone in a restricted volume of soil so that the soil moisture conditions for crops were generally better than under border irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to compare the climatic conditions affecting et during the different irrigation periods local meteorology station data were used to summarize the evaporative demand evaporation from a modified class a pan and precipitation between june and august table 4 the average total potential evapotranspiration etp during the period of mulched border irrigation was 525 8 mm for the growing season which was slightly higher than the period under mulched drip irrigation 488 3 mm for the growing season although the etp of the farmland was slightly lower for the period under drip irrigation management et was higher during this period than the period under mulched border irrigation this indicates that the difference in et between the two periods was not caused by etp but by crop growth as indicated by ndvi yue et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 zou et al 2018 on the other hand table 4 shows that the average total precipitation between june and august during the mulched border irrigation period was 63 27 mm comparing to 50 33 mm during the mulched drip irrigation period despite this the mean daily et during the mulched drip irrigation period were higher implying that precipitation was not the primary driver of et in this irrigated farmland 4 2 the effects of irrigation methods on et the details of the irrigation applied between june and august during the two periods are shown in table 5 mulched border irrigation consumed much more water than mulched drip irrigation 134 mm however previous studies indicated that the water loss rate via leaching and soil evaporation for mulched border irrigation in this region can exceed 50 compared to 10 under mulched drip irrigation h liu et al 2017 m liu et al 2017 therefore a larger proportion of irrigation water couldn t be used by crops on mulched border irrigated farmland compared to farmland irrigated using mulched drip irrigation grebenyukov 2002 moavenshahidi et al 2016 this results in less available water for et in border irrigated farmland furthermore between june and august the crop canopy is fully closed and the evaporation from the soil surface is very limited naveen et al 2019 mulched drip irrigation can only limit the loss of water via evaporation from the soil while transpiration can be enhanced due to improved crop growth liu et al 2015 thus et rates during the main crop growing season were typically higher under mulched drip irrigation than mulched border irrigation 4 3 sustainability of mulched drip irrigation it is clear that mulched drip irrigation is an effective strategy for conserving water when compared to the more commonly applied border irrigation on the one hand mulched drip irrigation improves the crop growth which results in a higher et rate while on the other hand it improves the water use efficiency of farmland by limiting water loss some studies show that the proportion of water lost under mulched border irrigation can exceed 40 zheng et al 2017 compared to 13 or lower under mulched drip irrigation umair et al 2019 this means that a greater proportion of available water is taken up by crops under mulched drip irrigation which enhanced crop growth thus higher et under mulched drip irrigation during the main crop growing season does not contradict the sustainability of this irrigation strategy with respect to water conservation 5 conclusion to compare the farmland et between mulched border irrigation period and mulched drip irrigation period we used sebal model to evaluate et for the two periods of the farmland in sangong river basin in northern xinjiang northwest china daily et values for farmland managed under mulched drip irrigation were higher than the same farmland managed under mulched border irrigation with differences ranging from 0 36 to 1 06 mm d 1 an increase in net radiation flux increased the daily et rates during the mulched drip irrigation period at the same time ndvi showed a significant negative correlation with land surface albedo r 2 0 877 the ndvi values of farmland under mulched drip irrigation were higher than that under mulched border irrigation which resulted in a lower land surface albedo and increased r values the tvdi and ts ndvi eigenspace results indicated that crops under mulched drip irrigation experienced on average lower levels of water stress compared to crops under mulched border irrigation this improved water conditions and crop growth resulted in a denser and higher canopy with correspondingly high ndvi values that in turn captured more energy for transpiration thus mulched drip irrigation can reduce unproductive water consumption by leaching and soil evaporation and increases effective water use such as crop transpiration as an advanced technology drip irrigation creates more favorable soil water conditions enhances crop growth and thereby increases et rates declaration of conflict interest there are

10737,this study describes the processes of calibration and validation of aquacrop the fao water productivity model and mopeco economic optimization model of irrigation water for the simulation of a barley crop cv cierzo we compare the complexity of implementing this process in the two models and the accuracy of the results a 3 year field experiment conducted during the period from 2011 to 2013 in a semi arid region located in southeast spain was used for this purpose six irrigation treatments were applied combining different levels of water deficit depending on the phenological stage both models were suitable for the simulation of yield and soil moisture evolution in addition aquacrop correctly simulated the harvest index the evolution of canopy cover and aboveground biomass the comparison between the two models showed that aquacrop is a better model for assessing the effect of a particular irrigation schedule on a crop i e biomass and canopy cover development soil water balance than mopeco nevertheless if the objective is to estimate yield depending on the irrigation schedule applied mopeco is easier to calibrate and furnishes results as valid as those provided by aquacrop keywords deficit irrigation water productivity water scarcity decision support system crop simulation semi arid environment 1 introduction society demands highly efficient use of natural resources in order to reduce negative impacts on the environment agriculture accounts for 70 of global freshwater withdrawals and more than 90 of its consumptive use bruinsma 2009 icid 2009 in this sense all cropping areas and in particular irrigated areas require suitable governance of natural water resources where both useful tools and management strategies are key in addressing the current challenges to satisfying the increasingly high worldwide demand for food these challenges include climate change salinization of agricultural soils freshwater scarcity and overexploitation of water resources one way to achieve this aim is through the development of irrigation strategies that improve water productivity and which can be tested through crop simulation models csms there are currently a large number of csms such as cropsyst cropping system simulation model stÃ¶ckle et al 2003 dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 aquacrop the fao crop model to simulate yield response to water steduto et al 2009 and mopeco economic optimization model of irrigation water ortega et al 2004 among others which simulate the key physiological and hydrologic processes of the soil plant atmosphere system models like aquacrop and mopeco do not consider the nitrogen phosphorus and carbon cycle as it happen with cropsyst or dssat consequently these last models often require a large number of input variables and parameter values that are not easily available to end users vanuytrech et al 2014 the authors describe aquacrop and mopeco as crop water driven models and focus on promoting their use in the productive sector to improve the crop water productivity and efficient use of irrigation water ortega et al 2004 steduto et al 2009 aquacrop is a crop water productivity model developed by fao to assess the effect of environment and management on crop production the model simulates yield response to water of herbaceous crops and is particularly suited to addressing conditions where water is a key limiting factor in crop production vanuytrech et al 2014 this model has been calibrated for many crops across the world by and is widely used for research wheat andarzian et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 sunflower garcÃ­a vila et al 2009 maize hsiao et al 2009 rice maniruzzaman et al 2015 potato montoya et al 2016 cabbage wellens et al 2013 mopeco was conceived to maximize the profitability of irrigated farms through a more efficient use of irrigable area lÃ³pez mata et al 2016 and irrigation water domÃ­nguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015a the model is based on fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and fao 56 allen et al 1998 methodologies and has been calibrated for different annual crops carrot carvalho et al 2014 potato domÃ­nguez et al 2011 maize domÃ­nguez et al 2012c onion domÃ­nguez et al 2012b garlic domÃ­nguez et al 2013 melon leite et al 2015b final crop yield root depth evolution and daily actual evapotranspiration eta are the only crop parameters simulated by mopeco domÃ­nguez et al 2011 aquacrop however differentiates between evaporation and transpiration and also simulates biomass yield root depth and canopy cover evolution among other processes steduto et al 2009 in consequence the number of crop parameters required by mopeco to simulate yield is much lower than that required by aquacrop barley hordeum vulgare l is the eleventh most produced crop in the world and the fifth in harvested area with 147 million mg and 47 million hectares respectively europe accounts for more than 61 of the world production with 49 of the global area faostat 2018 in spain barley is the most cultivated crop with a total area of nearly 2 6 million hectares and a production of 9 2 million mg per year due to its extensive root system barley is highly resistant to drought fischer and maurer 1978 furthermore stress tolerance in barley is related to gas exchange in the leaves stomatal closure causes a decrease in the rate of co2 assimilation in this way the plant is able to maintain relative maximum water content in the leaves gonzÃ¡lez et al 1999 thameur et al 2012 however yields can be highly compromised when severe stress occurs day et al 1987 and francia et al 2011 concluded that the impact of water deficit on barley yields depends upon its intensity and on the crop growth stage when it is imposed with flowering being the stage most sensitive to water deficit the low profitability of this crop and the low availability of irrigation water in many areas where this species is cultivated is causing farmers to demand irrigation strategies that increase the efficiency in the use of irrigation water by this crop aquacrop and mopeco models can be two useful tools to achieve this goal the two objectives of this paper are 1 to calibrate and validate aquacrop and mopeco models with the aim of parameterizing a barley crop cierzo cultivar and 2 to compare the complexity of carrying out this process in both models assess the accuracy of the results and evaluate their ability for advising farmers and technicians in irrigation scheduling this work is the first stage towards using and evaluating the irrigation strategy tools provided by both models to apply full and deficit irrigation to improve irrigation water productivity in a barley crop which will be analyzed in a subsequent paper 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the agricultural area of castilla la mancha clm comprises 3 773 029 ha of which 557 851 ha are irrigated land mapama 2018 the region of clm cultivates 0 78 million hectares of barley which represents 28 of national production mapama 2018 the use of irrigation in the area is the result of low average annual precipitation of about 400 mm year 1 ces 2006 however reference evapotranspiration values surpass 1100 mm characterizing the agricultural area as semi arid domÃ­nguez and de juan 2008 for this reason 1655 hm3 of water was used for irrigation in 2016 ine 2019 making up more than 82 of regional water consumption moreover around 64 of total is groundwater being two regional aquifers declared overexploited ces 2006 this provides insight into the importance of achieving high water productivity in this sector in the case of barley average irrigation water requirements in the area are stated in 2500 m3 ha 1 jcrmo 2019 being solid set and center pivot the most common systems used for irrigating this crop 2 2 study site the data set used in this study was obtained in a field experiment conducted over three cropping seasons from 2011 to 2013 at las tiesas farm located near albacete spain fig 1 2 5 longitude west 39 3 latitude north and 695 m a s l elevation the climate is semi arid temperate mediterranean with 314 mm of average annual precipitation mainly concentrated in spring and autumn and more than 1200 mm of average annual reference evapotranspiration average mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 13 7 24 0 and 4 5 c respectively description of the climate of the area is provided in lÃ³pez urrea et al 2006 meteorological variables over the three seasons were measured with an automated weather station located over a reference grass surface less than 150 m from the field test all sensors were installed between 1 5 and 2 m above the grass surface and meteorological data were registered in 15 min hourly and daily time steps variables measured were as follows air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction short and longwave radiation and rainfall all data were stored in two dataloggers cr10x campbell scientific reference evapotranspiration eto values were estimated with the daily time step fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for a description of the weather station see lÃ³pez urrea et al 2016 according to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 the experimental field soil is classified as petrocalcic calcixerepts the average depth of soil is 0 4 m which is limited by a petrocalcic horizon the texture of the soil is silt clay loam table 1 with basic ph 8 1 and low organic matter content 1 5 the average slope soil of the plot is around 1 2 the physical and hydraulic soil properties were obtained from texture class by means of pedotransfer functions table 1 saxton and rawls 2006 2 3 experimental design and crop management over the three experimental years barley hordeum vulgare l cv cierzo was sown in rows 0 15 m apart with a density at harvest of about 400 plants m 2 the experiment used a complete randomized block design with four replicates of six irrigation levels irrigation treatments supplied different levels of crop water requirement as follows t1 50 of potential crop evapotranspiration etm over the whole growing season t2 75 etm t3 100 etm t4 50 etm from sowing to maximum canopy cover cc phase i and 100 etm from maximum cc to harvest phase ii t5 75 etm in phase i and full irrigated in phase ii t6 100 etm in phase i and 75 etm in phase ii table 2 individual plot size was 10 m long by 2 5 m wide and the experimental area was located in the center of a 50 m 50 m barley plot a drip irrigation system was installed with four drip lines per experimental plot and 3 5 l h 1 emitters placed 0 5 cm apart the system was designed to apply 11 2 mm h 1 of water with an average pressure in the lateral pipe of 100 kpa allowing 100 of the soil surface area to be wetted the irrigation depth applied to each treatment during the irrigation events was controlled by flow meters in all treatments fertilizers were applied before sowing at a rate of 15 59 37 kg ha 1 of n p k respectively additionally liquid fertilizer was applied during the vegetative phase for a total of 50 kg ha 1 of n traditional pest and disease management practices were used to avoid effects on the final crop yield crop coefficient values used for the reference treatment t3 were as follows kc ini 0 3 during crop establishment from sowing to reach 10 15 of canopy cover kc mid 1 15 for the reproductive stage from 80 to 85 of cc to pasture grain and kc end 0 45 for the crop ripening allen et al 1998 itap 2004 to reach the percentage of etm for the deficit treatments kc values were multiplied by 0 75 and 0 50 according to the irrigation strategy considered for the different treatments full irrigation depth was then computed in order to maintain the soil water content in the root zone between field capacity and readily available water allen et al 1998 while deficit irrigation treatments received a percentage of this amount of water table 2 2 4 crop growth and soil moisture monitoring over the three experimental seasons barley crop phenology of t3 control was monitored weekly following the bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 this information was used in the simulation of barley with both models table 3 additionally canopy cover cc evolution was monitored during the three cropping seasons obtaining 12 measurements for the first two seasons and 10 for the last experimental year using digital images cc was estimated following the methodology proposed by cihlar et al 1987 every 7 10 days a digital picture of each repetition was taken at midday and vertically from an approximate height of 2 m above ground for a more comprehensive description of this methodology see lÃ³pez urrea et al 2014 biomass evolution was monitored every 15 20 days only during the first experimental year thus seven 0 25 m2 samples of barley plants were analyzed per treatment to obtain the total dry matter evolution samples were oven dried at 60 c until they reached a constant weight soil water content was monitored from sowing date until the beginning of irrigation using gravimetry technique thus 3 2 and 1 soil samples for the first 0 40 m depth were collected in the control treatment in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively samples were oven dried at 105 c until reaching constant weight these values were transformed into volumetric soil water content using bulk density table 1 the experimental plots were harvested after the crop had reached the fully ripe stage and yields were corrected to 12 of grain moisture content table 2 the aboveground biomass and yield obtained in the three experimental seasons were similar depending on the total amount of water received by the crop during the three experimental years t1 treatment reached the lowest biomass and yield values according to tukey s test t1 showed significant differences with respect to the rest of the treatments excepting biomass for the second experimental year where all treatments showed a high standard deviation broadly speaking average yields ranged between 6275 and 9000 kg ha 1 for the most deficit and the non deficit treatments respectively table 2 finally the variability of the observed biomass and yield data in the three experimental seasons could partially explain that the harvest index did not show a clear tendency with respect to the irrigation treatments table 2 being 0 52 the average value 2 5 aquacrop model version 5 0 aquacrop is a model of crop water productivity wp that simulates the yield response of herbaceous crops to water with a daily time step steduto et al 2012 the model simulates the biomass b evolution using the daily soil water and salt balance certain atmospheric parameters temperature rainfall eto and atmospheric co2 concentration and the physiological characteristics i e water productivity thermal time crop coefficient etc and management i e irrigation schedule type of irrigation system soil fertility surface mulches etc of the crop the effect of extreme temperatures affecting the crop phenology and biomass accumulation as well as the harvest index hi of grain crops is also considered the soil water balance in combination with particular key crop parameters canopy development ability stomatal control of transpiration canopy senescence and hi allow the effect of water stress on the development of the crop to be simulated steduto et al 2009 thus water stress has a major impact on productivity and yield depending on timing severity and duration abrha et al 2012 the curve number method usda nrcs 2006 is used to compute the effective precipitation pe the daily b production is computed by aquacrop using the normalized water productivity wp and the accumulative ratio of daily transpiration and the daily evaporative demand of the atmosphere raes et al 2012 steduto et al 2009 1 b w p tr e t 0 where b is the biomass g m 2 wp is the normalized water productivity g m 2 tr is the crop transpiration mm and eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm then crop yield is calculated by multiplying biomass times hi starting from flowering aquacrop uses the reference hi hi0 target end point of the crop under unstressed conditions which is adjusted in response of the crop to water deficits during the crop cycle steduto et al 2012 for the simulation of crops the model differentiates between two types of crop parameters conservative and non conservative the conservative parameters are crop specific but do not change with time management practices geographic location or climate while non conservative parameters are affected by planting field management conditions in the soil profile or the weather hsiao et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2 6 mopeco model the aim of mopeco is to maximize gross margin gm of farms through the efficient use of irrigation water and cultivable area domÃ­nguez et al 2012a lÃ³pez mata et al 2016 ortega et al 2004 mopeco uses the model proposed by stewart et al 1977 for estimating crop yield as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etm in the different growth stages daily etm is calculated by multiplying daily crop coefficient kc by daily reference evapotranspiration eto values allen et al 1998 while daily eta requires a daily balance of soil water content for its calculation domÃ­nguez et al 2011 doorenbos and kassam 1979 considered several growth stages according to the different sensitiveness of crops to water deficit the crop yield response factor ky expresses how sensitive the crop is to water deficit at each growth stage when eta etm the plant suffers from water deficit stress which may cause a loss in yield 2 y a y m k 1 4 1 k y k 1 e t a k e t m k where ya and ym are the actual and maximum crop yields

in the case of barley eta and etm are the accumulated actual and maximum crop evapotranspiration in each ky growth stage mm 2 7 calibration and validation models the calibration of both models was carried out by using the observed data for the six treatments conducted during the second experimental season 2012 because they showed a wider range of stress levels while data for years 2011 and 2013 were used for validation 2 7 1 parameterization of aquacrop model the crop development stages under non deficit conditions table 3 were used to generate a crop file whereby crop development was represented in growing degree days gdd where the conservative parameters were constants for the three experimental years maximum rooting depth was established at 1 0 m allen et al 1998 although its development was conditioned by a root restrictive layer 0 40 m table 1 canopy growth cgc decline coefficients cdc water stress coefficients and shape factors affecting leaf expansion stomatal closure and early canopy senescence were calibrated in an iterative process simulating the development crop canopy in order to find the best fit between observed and simulated cc for the six treatments moreover the date and the measured value for both the maximum cc cc and the onset of decline of cc were used to parameterize aquacrop with the reference treatment t3 being used for to that end on the other hand wp was also calibrated with the previously mentioned method to find the best match between simulated and observed biomass at harvest by the six treatments finally the selected hio value was taken from the t3 treatment of the calibration year table 2 both hio and water stress coefficients affecting hi were adjusted through a trial and error procedure until the best match between simulated and observed yield at harvest using all experimental treatments as well as the data obtained in the field experiments the conservative crop parameters were determined using data from other researchers abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 pereira et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2015 and data included in the reference manual raes et al 2012 table 4 finally the model parameterization was evaluated with the observed crop data during 2011 and 2013 cropping seasons using the measured biomass evolution during 2011 as well as canopy cover evolution soil moisture and harvest biomass yield and harvest index data set from both experimental years to be compared with the simulation model table 4 shows the preliminary conservative values for the simulation of barley by aquacrop under the semi arid conditions in clm 2 7 2 parameterization of mopeco model in the case of mopeco the calibration and validation processes followed the steps described in domÃ­nguez et al 2012a b a set the ym value according to the results of the field tests b set the crop coefficients kc allen et al 1998 by using the values in the bibliography or calibrating them by using experimental data c obtain the eta etm rates for

methodology and avoid excessive stress in the less sensitive stage domÃ­nguez et al 2012a in the simulation of barley kc values used in the simulations were those proposed by the irrigation scheduling service of albacete initial 0 3 mid season 1 15 late season 0 45 montoro et al 2011 which are similar to those proposed by allen et al 1998 table 5 therefore the calibration of the kc values was unnecessary according to danuso et al 1995 barley corresponds to et group number 3 table 5 the lower and upper developmental threshold temperatures were stablished as 2 c and 28 c respectively pardo 2018 being both of them used to obtain the duration of barley growth stages in terms of accumulated gdd throughout the double triangulation method sevacherian et al 1977 2 8 statistical analysis a set of statistical indicators were used to evaluate the model performance being the root mean square error rmse the mean bias error mbe the index of agreement d willmott 1982 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r2 4 rmse n 1 s i o i 2 1 2 where rmse is the root mean square error n is the number of observations si and oi are the simulated and observed values respectively 5 mbe n 1 i 1 n s i o i where mbe is the mean bias error 6 ef 1 s i o i 2 s i o av 2 where ef is the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient if ef 1 there is a perfect match between the model and the observations oav is the average value of the variable observed 7 d 1 s i o i 2 s i o av o i o av 2 where d is the index of agreement if d 1 there is perfect agreement between s and o determination coefficient r2 close to 1 indicates that most of the variance of the observed values is explained by the model rmse was used to analyze the variance of the error this statistic was minimized to keep that close to 0 during the calibration and validation processes the mbe expresses the average size of the estimated errors and it was used to indicate the under or overestimations of the model finally the d and ef statistic non dimensional were used as indicators of model quality where values close to 1 mean there is a good agreement ef can range from minus infinity to 1 while d index ranges between 0 and 1 these statistics were computed using the number of independent observations for each treatment for canopy cover and biomass progression however those statistics were calculated for final biomass yield and harvest index with the data set obtained from the six treatments finally the model performance analysis for soil moisture was carried out with all data set collected during the three experimental years since this data set was quite scarce moreover both models were considered to have an adequate goodness of fit when the differences between observed and simulated biomass and yield at harvest and hi were equal to or lower than 10 and when the percentage of simulated yields satisfying the preceding requirement was equal to or higher than 70 domÃ­nguez et al 2012c farahani et al 2009 heng et al 2009 2 9 comparison of models according to the authors of both models aquacrop steduto et al 2009 and mopeco ortega et al 2004 were designed to be used by farmers and technicians from this perspective the most interesting characteristics for these types of users are the simplicity in the use of the models the accuracy of the yield forecast and the use of both models for determining the most suitable irrigation scheduling and the most profitable distribution of crops in the case of mopeco in addition to climatic and other specific data concerning the area farm management irrigation system and economic data depending on the model aquacrop requires a higher number of crop parameters 28 conservative and 15 non conservative than mopeco 9 to carry out simulations naturally the majority of these values are not available for farmers and technicians and many of them must be calibrated and provided by an external institution that should preferably be located in the area this handicap increases with the language used by the software which should be that of the end users aquacrop is available in english and french and mopeco in spanish consequently in practice neither of the models in their current state can be used by farmers or a great number of technicians despite the final aim of both models being to improve irrigation water productivity in agricultural systems for this reason both models were compared from the point of view of researchers aiming to calibrate both models for experimental use the comparison focused on the number and complexity of the required data for simulating a certain crop and the results provided by each model and their accuracy this comparison is valid only for barley and maybe other determined crops like wheat or maize which exhibit almost a linear relationship between irrigation and yield while this comparison would not be valid for crops like cotton where a regulated deficit irrigation may lead to an increased yield a statistical analyze was performed with the measured variables at field and simulated by both models in this case soil moisture and yield were the only two variables which could be analyzed in this research analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate variables obtained with both models during the 3 simulated years tukey s test was used to compare the means of each group not significant p 0 05 significant 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 highly significant finally the evaluation of the irrigation and other strategy tools provided by both models are not analyzed in this work this will be done in a subsequent paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of aquacrop 3 1 1 canopy cover the simulated and the observed evolution of the canopy cover cc for the 6 treatments in the calibration and validation years showed an adequate agreement during both the crop growth stage and over the maximum cc period fig 1 the crop growth coefficient cgc was properly calibrated table 4 during the second experimental season since the difference between simulated and observed values was between 2 6 and 6 5 with tendency to underestimate this growth stage in t5 and t6 treatments fig 1a f with respect to the period when the crop reached the maximum cc for the calibration year from 88 to 120 days after sowing fig 1a f the maximum simulated cc values with aquacrop were found to be slightly lower than the observed ones with differences lower than 8 2 in all treatments excepting the t3 treatment average overestimation of 4 5 fig 1c and whose standard deviation from the observed data included the simulated values fig 1a f finally the onset of canopy cover decline and the final cc were properly simulated during the calibration year differences lower than 13 7 with the last cc data being properly simulated in all treatments fig 1a f the mean bias error values showed the model slightly overestimated cc during all the crop cycle between 0 32 and 6 96 table 6 excepting the t5 treatment which one was underestimated 0 44 table 6 the simulated cc evolution for the two validation years 2011 and 2013 showed a similar one to the observed dataset from each experimental year fig 1g l cc during crop growing stage from sowing to 80 days after sowing fig 1g l was well fitted by aquacrop during the first experimental year average differences between simulated and observed data around 0 6 while these average differences were somewhat large for the last experimental season around 12 5 however the maximum cc period was slightly overestimated by aquacrop during 2013 differences around 3 2 and underestimated in 2011 cropping season between 9 2 and 12 8 with respect to the late season stage between 115 days after sowing and physiological maturity fig 1g l cc was overestimated during both experimental seasons with minimum and maximum differences of 5 4 and 16 respectively overall aquacrop model underestimated the cc evolution for all irrigation treatments during the first cropping season minimum and maximum mbe of 0 02 and 1 49 respectively table 6 due to the large differences obtained during the mid season stage while the crop cycle during the last cropping season was overestimated since the computed mbe was between 8 77 and 15 10 table 6 in general the model performance was very similar during the three experimental years where low estimation errors rmse and a high goodness of fit r2 ef and d index between simulated and observed data was achieved according to the statistical parameters used thus rmse took values between 8 8 and 15 1 with a strong linear relationship r2 0 87 and high agreement d 0 93 and ef between 0 67 and 0 94 for all treatments table 6 other authors using the aquacrop model with cereal crops barley wheat or maize have reported similar rmse r2 d index and ef values abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 pereira et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2015 toumi et al 2016 the value of the conservative parameters that describe the cc evolution canopy growth and decline coefficients the canopy size of average seedling at 90 emergence the water threshold stress for canopy expansion and senescence together with their shape factors are similar to those reported in the aquacrop manual raes et al 2012 and other papers simulating barley with aquacrop abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 pereira et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2015 with the exception of the upper threshold for early canopy senescence table 4 this last parameter was significantly different from the references already cited 0 85 vs 0 55 because this cultivar is tolerant to water deficit as shown by the observed cc evolution for most of the deficit treatments over the three experimental years fig 2 a b 3 1 2 soil moisture the simulated soil water content swc showed a suitable agreement with the observed data fig 2a reaching a high linear correlation r2 0 88 and a strong goodness of fit d 0 96 ef 0 87 the largest difference between observed and simulated data was reached in 2011 only one point fig 2a due to a significant rainfall event on the day before soil sampling nevertheless errors were low rmse 6 32 mm tending towards overestimation mbe 1 43 mm although the compared soil moisture dataset may be considered somewhat scarce the statistical results are similar to those reported by other authors abrha et al 2012 pereira et al 2015 3 1 3 aboveground biomass independently of the treatment aboveground biomass progression during the first cropping season model validation was properly simulated with respect to the observed data fig 3 the large differences between simulated and observed data were obtained during the first growing stages between 1 28 103 kg ha 1 and 1 89 103 kg ha 1 while that differences were lower from mid season stage to maturity around 0 58 103 kg ha 1 fig 3 thus the computed estimations errors for this variable were somewhat large around 1 74 103 kg ha 1 as average value with the result that all treatments were overestimated by the model mbe ranged from 0 38 103 kg ha 1 to 1 80 103 kg ha 1 table 5 nevertheless observed and simulated values had a strong linear correlation r2 0 91 and model efficiency and goodness of fit were high ef 0 79 d 0 95 table 5 abrha et al 2012 simulated the biomass evolution of barley crop and reported mean rmse values of around 1 5 103 kg ha 1 with variations between 0 6 and 6 3 103 kg ha 1 similar rmse results have been reported by other authors when simulating this variable for crops such as maize abedinpour et al 2012 heng et al 2009 katerji et al 2013 wheat andarzian et al 2011 or barley abi saab et al 2015 the model parameters that had a significant influence on the simulated biomass evolution as the crop transpiration coefficient the thresholds for stomatal closure their shape factor and the cold stress were similar to those reported in the manual raes et al 2012 table 4 and to the findings of other authors in studies on barley abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 however the normalized water productivity wp calibrated as 18 5 g m 2 table 4 was significantly higher than those parameterized in other works between 12 and 15 g m 2 abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 pereira et al 2015 this may be justified by the higher carbon assimilating rate of the cultivar used in this study table 2 nevertheless the wp value obtained is within the range proposed by raes et al 2012 15 20 g m 2 3 1 4 biomass yield and harvest index during the calibration year biomass yield and harvest index were adequately simulated showing estimation errors of 0 73 103 kg ha 1 0 30 103 kg ha 1 and 0 02 respectively in addition the calibration model showed a well goodness of fit for the three analyzed variables ef and d index 0 90 table 7 although the attained ef statistic for biomass and harvest index was moderate 0 65 and 0 70 respectively table 7 nevertheless the model showed a slight tendency to underestimate yield and harvest index with a strong linear correlation between observed and simulated data r2 0 90 table 7 the obtained deviations between simulated and observed data for all the irrigation treatments were lower than 10 in three analyzed variables being t6 at that limit table 2 statistical indicators obtained for the validation process showed an adequate performance with the yield variable low estimated errors and high index of agreement table 7 in addition total biomass and harvest index attained moderate and poor goodness of fit for 2013 0 78 and 0 43 for d index and 0 39 and 0 14 for ef respectively table 7 and a poor d index and ef at harvest during 2011 d 0 18 and ef 12 28 table 7 with low or no linear correlation r2 0 20 table 7 although there was a lack of linear adjustment the statistical errors obtained were low for both variables showing a good fit with each other these errors are similar to those reported by other authors abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 with respect to the deviations between simulated and observed harvest data during the two validation years it is highlighted that almost all irrigation treatments computed values lower than 10 only t1 in 2011 and t6 in 2013 were outside this criterion for the simulated yield and biomass respectively table 2 the deviation results are similar to those reported by pereira et al 2015 using aquacrop for barley in general the biomass and yield results of aquacrop model during the three experimental seasons showed that an underestimation of biomass implies a similar result for yield while this trend was not found for the harvest index table 2 furthermore the standard deviation of the observed data showed that the simulated values were included within their range in addition the number of treatments whose results showed deviations lower than 10 was higher than 75 of the total table 2 on the basis of these results aquacrop was considered calibrated and validated for simulating a barley crop cierzo cultivar under the semi arid conditions of clm 3 2 calibration and validation of mopeco 3 2 1 soil moisture the simulated soil water content swc showed an adequate goodness of fit to the observed data fig 2b achieving a good linear correlation and good agreement r2 0 73 d 0 87 ef 0 55 estimation errors were slightly high rmse 11 50 mm tending towards overestimation mbe 7 34 mm but similar to those reported by other authors abrha et al 2012 pereira et al 2015 3 2 2 maximum yield ym the average yield of the non deficit treatments was 9 000 103 kg ha 1 table 2 which was considered as ym during the simulations table 5 this potential yield is lower than that observed by jamieson et al 1995 for a triumph cultivar cropped in new zealand 9 670 103 kg ha 1 and similar to the yields obtained by domÃ­nguez et al 2017 in clm for the scarlett cultivar 9 236 103 kg ha 1 in addition it was within the range of the values reached by cossani et al 2009 in agramunt spain for three cultivars under non deficit conditions between 3 800 and 10 200 103 kg ha 1 and higher than the yield obtained by abrha et al 2012 in 5 different mediterranean areas cropping 5 cultivars under no water deficit conditions between 2 000 and 6 000 103 kg ha 1 3 2 3 yield response factor ky by using the soil water and evapotranspiration balance simulation module of mopeco as well as the data collected by the weather station at the experimental plots the eta etm rates were calculated for each ky stage fig 4 treatments achieved the lowest global eta etm rates in 2012 fig 4b nevertheless in none of the three years was the crop under water deficit conditions eta etm 1 during the first ky stage conditioning the calibration of the ky value for this stage fig 4 this finding is common for the majority of the crops sown in winter in the area because it is a rainy season and the evapotranspiration demand of the atmosphere is low domÃ­nguez et al 2012b 2013 moreover treatments in 2012 showed a higher variability in the eta etm values reached at each ky stages suffering water deficit conditions at least during two ky stages for that reason this year was selected for the calibration of the model in 2011 and 2013 fig 4a and c the maximum water deficit occurred during ky iii while in 2012 it was during ky ii fig 4b for the ky values fitted during the calibration table 5 the difference between simulated and observed average yields was equal or lower than 10 in the 18 simulations fig 5 the fit to the model in the yield simulation rmse 0 33 103 kg ha 1 and high goodness of fit d and ef 0 82 table 7 was better than that achieved by rÃ¶tter et al 2012 using nine crop models for simulating 44 growing seasons of spring barley at seven different study sites in europe czech republic denmark finland and slovakia and by abi saab et al 2015 using cropsyst and aquacrop to simulate barley cv ponente in southern italy in contrast abrha et al 2012 found a slightly higher goodness of fit simulating 5 different cultivars of spring barley birguda ponente arabi abiad beecher and maris badger at different locations in ethiopia italy syria and montana usa according to the ky values obtained in the calibration and validation process ky ii flowering was the most sensitive stage to water deficit table 5 hence the yield of t4 in 2013 decreased by 18 with regards to t3 when a 28 deficit eta etm 0 72 was applied in ky ii fig 4c this result coincides with the conclusions of other authors in research on cereals doorenbos and kassam 1979 farrÃ© and faci 2006 to the best of our knowledge no studies have been conducted using the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to simulate barley consequently it was not possible to compare the ky values obtained in this study with those proposed by other authors according to albrizio et al 2010 the response of this crop to water deficit is similar to that of spring wheat moreover ky values proposed by several authors for wheat day et al 1987 doorenbos and kassam 1979 francia et al 2011 are similar to those determined for barley in the present research as it was not possible to calibrate ky i fig 4 we assumed the value recommended by doorenbos and kassam 1979 mopeco uses global ky to simulate the response of crops under salinity conditions domÃ­nguez et al 2011 the value obtained in the calibration and validation process was 1 10 table 5 which is slightly lower than the one stated by pereira et al 2015 for the whole growing period 1 25 on the basis of these results mopeco was considered to be calibrated and validated for simulating a barley crop cierzo cultivar under the semi arid conditions in clm up to global deficit levels of eta etm 0 73 therefore the calibrated values must be applied with caution under more restrictive conditions mainly if stress is caused during the ky i stage not calibrated 3 2 4 maximum eta etm difference between consecutive ky stages for ordi methodology the ordi methodology requires stating the maximum difference e in terms of deficit eta etm between two consecutive ky stages domÃ­nguez et al 2012a instead of the average values fig 5 we compared the results of all the repetitions with the simulations thus differences higher than 0 25 increased the percentage of non fitting cases fig 6 for this reason e 0 25 was stated for the ordi methodology table 5 this value is lower than those determined for other annual crops in the area such as maize 0 3 onion 0 4 and garlic 0 4 domÃ­nguez et al 2012a b 2013 therefore in barley it is important to accurately control the deficit in the different stages in order to avoid excessive values in certain ky stages that may notably affect the final yield 3 3 comparison of models in terms of crop simulation aquacrop provides more information than mopeco as the objective of the two models is different consequently compared to mopeco aquacrop facilitates a more in depth study of the effect of the irrigation schedules on different physiological and growth parameters of the crop table 8 the simulated soil moisture and yield data by both models showed that there were no differences between aquacrop and mopeco with respect to the observed data table 9 soil moisture was overestimated between 1 8 and 8 8 by aquacrop and mopeco respectively in other hand differences between simulated and observed yields were similar around 1 6 being over and underestimated by both of them respectively table 9 among experimental years there were significant differences for soil moisture which could be due to randomly while crop yield was no affected table 9 the parameters not used in the calibration and validation of both models were compared infiltration percolation from root area etm and eta table 10 for both models the amount of infiltrated water was practically the same differences may be attributed to the fact that mopeco considers the decimal values of the amount of rainfall and irrigation while aquacrop uses entire numbers nevertheless mopeco systematically simulated higher volumes of percolated water than aquacrop at both treatment level and across experimental years this difference is a result of the different methodologies used by the models when simulating the movement of water in the soil aquacrop uses the drainage function raes et al 2012 which is more precise and requires a higher number of parameters table 2 than that used by mopeco when the amount of water in the root area is higher than field capacity the difference is considered as percolation domÃ­nguez et al 2011 in the simulations aquacrop reduced the amount of percolated water with respect to mopeco by between 30 and 70 mm which may also justify the higher values of eta achieved by all the treatments when using the former model table 10 the simplicity of mopeco in terms of algorithms used in the soil water balance domÃ­nguez et al 2011 as well as the use of the single kc instead of the dual kc procedure allen et al 1998 generates larger errors in the swc estimation than aquacrop fig 2 in this study mopeco overestimated swc determining higher volumes of percolated water as a consequence of the previous results the values of etm simulated by both models show large differences over the three experimental years around 95 136 and 78 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 10 analyzing the reference treatment t3 mopeco simulated similar values of eta and etm differences between 0 and 9 mm table 10 which implies that t3 reached the maximum yield ym as this treatment did not undergo water deficit stress eq 2 however eta and etm values simulated by aquacrop for the same treatment were notably different in the three years 43 86 and 53 mm in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 10 according to the results aquacrop considered that the irrigation management in t3 reduced the potential evaporation from the bare soil around 55 and during the first stages of the canopy develops until reaching the 60 of maximum cc which were lower than those considered as maximum by the model 70 56 and 78 of the maximum evaporation in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively in this sense it is worth noting that the maximum soil evaporation coefficient kex used for the calibration and validation of aquacrop was 1 10 allen et al 1998 moreover torres and calera 2010 in a study carried out in an area with similar soil properties to those in this research stated that fao 56 methodology overestimates evaporation from bare soil consequently also during the beginning of the crop development which may justify the differences between the maximum and real evaporation simulations when using aquacrop table 9 nevertheless the water requirements of the crop in t3 were fully satisfied during the three years as considered by mopeco table 10 the great results obtained by both models highlight the importance of adapting these tools to the knowledge and necessities of the productive sector in this sense the supromed project ga 1813 funded by prima and coordinated by the uclm group aims to adapt and transfer mopeco and other tools to the productive sector through an online platform the objective is to improve the resilience of mediterranean agricultural systems to global warming using existing methods and technologies not yet available for the productive sector 4 conclusions the aquacrop and mopeco models were calibrated and validated for a barley crop cultivated in the semi arid conditions of southeast spain the results of aquacrop for evolution of canopy cover biomass crop yield and soil water content showed high goodness of fit between simulated and observed values in the case of mopeco similar results were obtained for the final yield and for the evolution of soil moisture the calibrated values of ky for mopeco will allow simulations of barley in this area and will serve as a reference in others given the lack of information about ky parameters for this crop in the literature moreover the calibration of this model will facilitate the implementation of optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi strategies in order to achieve higher productivity of the irrigation water supplied to this crop the comparison between the two models showed that aquacrop is a better model for simulating and analyzing the effect of a particular irrigation schedule on a crop compared to mopeco nevertheless if the objective is to estimate yield mopeco is also valid and simpler to calibrate in the present study the use of both models improves the simulation of the effects of deficit irrigation strategies declaration of competing interest the

10737,this study describes the processes of calibration and validation of aquacrop the fao water productivity model and mopeco economic optimization model of irrigation water for the simulation of a barley crop cv cierzo we compare the complexity of implementing this process in the two models and the accuracy of the results a 3 year field experiment conducted during the period from 2011 to 2013 in a semi arid region located in southeast spain was used for this purpose six irrigation treatments were applied combining different levels of water deficit depending on the phenological stage both models were suitable for the simulation of yield and soil moisture evolution in addition aquacrop correctly simulated the harvest index the evolution of canopy cover and aboveground biomass the comparison between the two models showed that aquacrop is a better model for assessing the effect of a particular irrigation schedule on a crop i e biomass and canopy cover development soil water balance than mopeco nevertheless if the objective is to estimate yield depending on the irrigation schedule applied mopeco is easier to calibrate and furnishes results as valid as those provided by aquacrop keywords deficit irrigation water productivity water scarcity decision support system crop simulation semi arid environment 1 introduction society demands highly efficient use of natural resources in order to reduce negative impacts on the environment agriculture accounts for 70 of global freshwater withdrawals and more than 90 of its consumptive use bruinsma 2009 icid 2009 in this sense all cropping areas and in particular irrigated areas require suitable governance of natural water resources where both useful tools and management strategies are key in addressing the current challenges to satisfying the increasingly high worldwide demand for food these challenges include climate change salinization of agricultural soils freshwater scarcity and overexploitation of water resources one way to achieve this aim is through the development of irrigation strategies that improve water productivity and which can be tested through crop simulation models csms there are currently a large number of csms such as cropsyst cropping system simulation model stÃ¶ckle et al 2003 dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 aquacrop the fao crop model to simulate yield response to water steduto et al 2009 and mopeco economic optimization model of irrigation water ortega et al 2004 among others which simulate the key physiological and hydrologic processes of the soil plant atmosphere system models like aquacrop and mopeco do not consider the nitrogen phosphorus and carbon cycle as it happen with cropsyst or dssat consequently these last models often require a large number of input variables and parameter values that are not easily available to end users vanuytrech et al 2014 the authors describe aquacrop and mopeco as crop water driven models and focus on promoting their use in the productive sector to improve the crop water productivity and efficient use of irrigation water ortega et al 2004 steduto et al 2009 aquacrop is a crop water productivity model developed by fao to assess the effect of environment and management on crop production the model simulates yield response to water of herbaceous crops and is particularly suited to addressing conditions where water is a key limiting factor in crop production vanuytrech et al 2014 this model has been calibrated for many crops across the world by and is widely used for research wheat andarzian et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 sunflower garcÃ­a vila et al 2009 maize hsiao et al 2009 rice maniruzzaman et al 2015 potato montoya et al 2016 cabbage wellens et al 2013 mopeco was conceived to maximize the profitability of irrigated farms through a more efficient use of irrigable area lÃ³pez mata et al 2016 and irrigation water domÃ­nguez et al 2012a leite et al 2015a the model is based on fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 and fao 56 allen et al 1998 methodologies and has been calibrated for different annual crops carrot carvalho et al 2014 potato domÃ­nguez et al 2011 maize domÃ­nguez et al 2012c onion domÃ­nguez et al 2012b garlic domÃ­nguez et al 2013 melon leite et al 2015b final crop yield root depth evolution and daily actual evapotranspiration eta are the only crop parameters simulated by mopeco domÃ­nguez et al 2011 aquacrop however differentiates between evaporation and transpiration and also simulates biomass yield root depth and canopy cover evolution among other processes steduto et al 2009 in consequence the number of crop parameters required by mopeco to simulate yield is much lower than that required by aquacrop barley hordeum vulgare l is the eleventh most produced crop in the world and the fifth in harvested area with 147 million mg and 47 million hectares respectively europe accounts for more than 61 of the world production with 49 of the global area faostat 2018 in spain barley is the most cultivated crop with a total area of nearly 2 6 million hectares and a production of 9 2 million mg per year due to its extensive root system barley is highly resistant to drought fischer and maurer 1978 furthermore stress tolerance in barley is related to gas exchange in the leaves stomatal closure causes a decrease in the rate of co2 assimilation in this way the plant is able to maintain relative maximum water content in the leaves gonzÃ¡lez et al 1999 thameur et al 2012 however yields can be highly compromised when severe stress occurs day et al 1987 and francia et al 2011 concluded that the impact of water deficit on barley yields depends upon its intensity and on the crop growth stage when it is imposed with flowering being the stage most sensitive to water deficit the low profitability of this crop and the low availability of irrigation water in many areas where this species is cultivated is causing farmers to demand irrigation strategies that increase the efficiency in the use of irrigation water by this crop aquacrop and mopeco models can be two useful tools to achieve this goal the two objectives of this paper are 1 to calibrate and validate aquacrop and mopeco models with the aim of parameterizing a barley crop cierzo cultivar and 2 to compare the complexity of carrying out this process in both models assess the accuracy of the results and evaluate their ability for advising farmers and technicians in irrigation scheduling this work is the first stage towards using and evaluating the irrigation strategy tools provided by both models to apply full and deficit irrigation to improve irrigation water productivity in a barley crop which will be analyzed in a subsequent paper 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the agricultural area of castilla la mancha clm comprises 3 773 029 ha of which 557 851 ha are irrigated land mapama 2018 the region of clm cultivates 0 78 million hectares of barley which represents 28 of national production mapama 2018 the use of irrigation in the area is the result of low average annual precipitation of about 400 mm year 1 ces 2006 however reference evapotranspiration values surpass 1100 mm characterizing the agricultural area as semi arid domÃ­nguez and de juan 2008 for this reason 1655 hm3 of water was used for irrigation in 2016 ine 2019 making up more than 82 of regional water consumption moreover around 64 of total is groundwater being two regional aquifers declared overexploited ces 2006 this provides insight into the importance of achieving high water productivity in this sector in the case of barley average irrigation water requirements in the area are stated in 2500 m3 ha 1 jcrmo 2019 being solid set and center pivot the most common systems used for irrigating this crop 2 2 study site the data set used in this study was obtained in a field experiment conducted over three cropping seasons from 2011 to 2013 at las tiesas farm located near albacete spain fig 1 2 5 longitude west 39 3 latitude north and 695 m a s l elevation the climate is semi arid temperate mediterranean with 314 mm of average

respectively description of the climate of the area is provided in lÃ³pez urrea et al 2006 meteorological variables over the three seasons were measured with an automated weather station located over a reference grass surface less than 150 m from the field test all sensors were installed between 1 5 and 2 m above the grass surface and meteorological data were registered in 15 min hourly and daily time steps variables measured were as follows air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction short and longwave radiation and rainfall all data were stored in two dataloggers cr10x campbell scientific reference evapotranspiration eto values were estimated with the daily time step fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for a description of the weather station see lÃ³pez urrea et al 2016 according to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 the experimental field soil is classified as petrocalcic calcixerepts the average depth of soil is 0 4 m which is limited by a petrocalcic horizon the texture of the soil is silt clay loam table 1 with basic ph 8 1 and low organic matter content 1 5 the average slope soil of the plot is around 1 2 the physical and hydraulic soil properties were obtained from texture class by means of pedotransfer functions table 1 saxton and rawls 2006 2 3 experimental design and crop management over the three experimental years barley hordeum vulgare l cv cierzo was sown in rows 0 15 m apart with a density at harvest of about 400 plants m 2 the experiment used a complete randomized block design with four replicates of six irrigation levels irrigation treatments supplied different levels of crop water requirement as follows t1 50 of potential crop evapotranspiration etm over the whole growing season t2 75 etm t3 100 etm t4 50 etm from sowing to maximum canopy cover cc phase i and 100 etm from maximum cc to harvest phase ii t5 75 etm in phase i and full irrigated in phase ii t6 100 etm in phase i and 75 etm in phase ii table 2 individual plot size was 10 m long by 2 5 m wide and the experimental area was located in the center of a 50 m 50 m barley plot a drip irrigation system was installed with four drip lines per experimental plot and 3 5 l h 1 emitters placed 0 5 cm apart the system was designed to apply 11 2 mm h 1 of water with an average pressure in the lateral pipe of 100 kpa allowing 100 of the soil surface area to be wetted the irrigation depth applied to each treatment during the irrigation events was controlled by flow meters in all treatments fertilizers were applied before sowing at a rate of 15 59 37 kg ha 1 of n p k respectively additionally liquid fertilizer was applied during the vegetative phase for a total of 50 kg ha 1 of n traditional pest and disease management practices were used to avoid effects on the final crop yield crop coefficient values used for the reference treatment t3 were as follows kc ini 0 3 during crop establishment from sowing to reach 10 15 of canopy cover kc mid 1 15 for the reproductive stage from 80 to 85 of cc to pasture grain and kc end 0 45 for the crop ripening allen et al 1998 itap 2004 to reach the percentage of etm for the deficit treatments kc values were multiplied by 0 75 and 0 50 according to the irrigation strategy considered for the different treatments full irrigation depth was then computed in order to maintain the soil water content in the root zone between field capacity and readily available water allen et al 1998 while deficit irrigation treatments received a percentage of this amount of water table 2 2 4 crop growth and soil moisture monitoring over the three experimental seasons barley crop phenology of t3 control was monitored weekly following the bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 this information was used in the simulation of barley with both models table 3 additionally canopy cover cc evolution was monitored during the three cropping seasons obtaining 12 measurements for the first two seasons and 10 for the last experimental year using digital images cc was estimated following the methodology proposed by cihlar et al 1987 every 7 10 days a digital picture of each repetition was taken at midday and vertically from an approximate height of 2 m above ground for a more comprehensive description of this methodology see lÃ³pez urrea et al 2014 biomass evolution was monitored every 15 20 days only during the first experimental year thus seven 0 25 m2 samples of barley plants were analyzed per treatment to obtain the total dry matter evolution samples were oven dried at 60 c until they reached a constant weight soil water content was monitored from sowing date until the beginning of irrigation using gravimetry technique thus 3 2 and 1 soil samples for the first 0 40 m depth were collected in the control treatment in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively samples were oven dried at 105 c until reaching constant weight these values were transformed into volumetric soil water content using bulk density table 1 the experimental plots were harvested after the crop had reached the fully ripe stage and yields were corrected to 12 of grain moisture content table 2 the aboveground biomass and yield obtained in the three experimental seasons were similar depending on the total amount of water received by the crop during the three experimental years t1 treatment reached the lowest biomass and yield values according to tukey s test t1 showed significant differences with respect to the rest of the treatments excepting biomass for the second experimental year where all treatments showed a high standard deviation broadly speaking average yields ranged between 6275 and 9000 kg ha 1 for the most deficit and the non deficit treatments respectively table 2 finally the variability of the observed biomass and yield data in the three experimental seasons could partially explain that the harvest index did not show a clear tendency with respect to the irrigation treatments table 2 being 0

particular key crop parameters canopy development ability stomatal control of transpiration canopy senescence and hi allow the effect of water stress on the development of the crop to be simulated steduto et al 2009 thus water stress has a major impact on productivity and yield depending on timing severity and duration abrha et al 2012 the curve number method usda nrcs 2006 is used to compute the effective precipitation pe the daily b production is computed by aquacrop using the normalized water productivity wp and the accumulative ratio of daily transpiration and the daily evaporative demand of the atmosphere raes et al 2012 steduto et al 2009 1 b w p tr e t 0 where b is the biomass g m 2 wp is the normalized water productivity g m 2 tr is the crop transpiration mm and eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm then crop yield is calculated by multiplying biomass times hi starting from flowering aquacrop uses the reference hi hi0 target end point of the crop under unstressed conditions which is adjusted in response of the crop to water deficits during the crop cycle steduto et al 2012 for the simulation of crops the model differentiates between two types of crop parameters conservative and non conservative the conservative parameters are crop specific but do not change with time management practices geographic location or climate while non conservative parameters are affected by planting field management conditions in the soil profile or the weather hsiao et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2 6 mopeco model the aim of mopeco is to maximize gross margin gm of farms through the efficient use of irrigation water and cultivable area domÃ­nguez et al 2012a lÃ³pez mata et al 2016 ortega et al 2004 mopeco uses the model proposed by stewart et al 1977 for estimating crop yield as a function of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio eta etm in the different growth stages daily etm is calculated by multiplying daily crop coefficient kc by daily reference evapotranspiration eto values allen et al 1998 while daily eta requires a daily balance of soil water content for its calculation domÃ­nguez et al 2011 doorenbos and kassam 1979 considered several growth stages according to the different sensitiveness of crops to water deficit the crop yield response factor ky expresses how sensitive the crop is to water deficit at each

carried out by using the observed data for the six treatments conducted during the second experimental season 2012 because they showed a wider range of stress levels while data for years 2011 and 2013 were used for validation 2 7 1 parameterization of aquacrop model the crop development stages under non deficit conditions table 3 were used to generate a crop file whereby crop development was represented in growing degree days gdd where the conservative parameters were constants for the three experimental years maximum rooting depth was established at 1 0 m allen et al 1998 although its development was conditioned by a root restrictive layer 0 40 m table 1 canopy growth cgc decline coefficients cdc water stress coefficients and shape factors affecting leaf expansion stomatal closure and early canopy senescence were calibrated in an iterative process simulating the development crop canopy in order to find the best fit between observed and simulated cc for the six treatments moreover the date and the measured value for both the maximum cc cc and the onset of decline of cc were used to parameterize aquacrop with the reference treatment t3 being used for to that end on the other hand wp was also calibrated with the previously mentioned method to find the best match between simulated and observed biomass at harvest by the six treatments finally the selected hio value was taken from the t3 treatment of the calibration year table 2 both hio and water stress coefficients affecting hi were adjusted through a trial and error procedure until the best match between simulated and observed yield at harvest using all experimental treatments as well as the data obtained in the field experiments the conservative crop parameters were determined using data from other researchers abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 pereira et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2015 and data included in the reference manual raes et al 2012 table 4 finally the model parameterization was evaluated with the observed crop data during 2011 and 2013 cropping seasons using the measured biomass evolution during 2011 as well as canopy cover evolution soil moisture and harvest biomass yield and harvest index data set from both experimental years to be compared with the simulation model table 4 shows the preliminary conservative values for the simulation of barley by aquacrop under the semi arid conditions

the results of the field tests b set the crop coefficients kc allen et al 1998 by using the values in the bibliography or calibrating them by using experimental data c obtain the eta etm rates for

methodology and avoid excessive stress in the less sensitive stage domÃ­nguez et al 2012a in the simulation of barley kc values used in the simulations were those proposed by the irrigation scheduling service of albacete initial 0 3 mid season 1 15 late season 0 45 montoro et al 2011 which are similar to those proposed by allen et al 1998 table 5 therefore the calibration of the kc values was unnecessary according to danuso et al 1995 barley corresponds to et group number 3 table 5 the lower and upper developmental threshold temperatures were stablished as 2 c and 28 c respectively pardo 2018 being both of them used to obtain the duration of barley growth stages in terms of accumulated gdd throughout the double triangulation method sevacherian et al 1977 2 8 statistical analysis a set of statistical indicators were used to evaluate the model performance being the root mean square error rmse the mean bias error mbe the index of agreement d willmott 1982 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r2 4 rmse n 1 s i o i 2 1 2 where rmse is the root mean square error n is the number of observations si and oi are the simulated and observed values respectively 5 mbe n 1 i 1 n s i o i where mbe is the mean bias error 6 ef 1 s i o i 2 s i o av 2 where ef is the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient if ef 1 there is a perfect match between the model and the observations oav is the average value of the variable observed 7 d 1 s i o i 2 s i o av o i o av 2 where d is the index of agreement if d 1 there is perfect agreement between s and o determination coefficient r2 close to 1 indicates that most of the variance of the observed values is explained by the model rmse was used to analyze the variance of the error this statistic was minimized to keep that close to 0 during the calibration and validation processes the mbe expresses the average size of the estimated errors and it was used to indicate the under or overestimations of the model finally the d and ef statistic non dimensional were used as indicators of model quality where values close to 1 mean there is a good agreement ef can range from minus infinity to 1 while d index ranges between 0 and 1 these statistics were computed using the number of independent observations for each treatment for canopy cover and biomass progression however those statistics were calculated for final biomass yield and harvest index with the data set obtained from the six treatments finally the model performance analysis for soil moisture was carried out with all data set collected during the three experimental years since this data set was quite scarce moreover both models were considered to have an adequate goodness of fit when the differences between observed and simulated biomass and yield at harvest and hi were equal to or lower than 10 and when the percentage of simulated yields satisfying the preceding requirement was equal to or higher than 70 domÃ­nguez et al 2012c farahani et al 2009 heng et al 2009 2 9 comparison of models according to the authors of both models aquacrop steduto et al 2009 and mopeco ortega et al 2004 were designed to be used by farmers and technicians from this perspective the most interesting characteristics for these types of users are the simplicity in the use of the models the accuracy of the yield forecast and the use of both models for determining the most suitable irrigation scheduling and the most profitable distribution of crops in the case of mopeco in addition to climatic and other specific data concerning the area farm management irrigation system and economic data depending on the model aquacrop requires a higher number of crop parameters 28 conservative and 15 non conservative than mopeco 9 to carry out simulations naturally the majority of these values are not available for farmers and technicians and many of them must be calibrated and provided by an external institution that should preferably be located in the area this handicap increases with the language used by the software which should be that of the end users aquacrop is available in english and french and mopeco in spanish consequently in practice neither of the models in their current state can be used by farmers or a great number of technicians despite the final aim of both models being to improve irrigation water productivity in agricultural systems for this reason both models were compared from the point of view of researchers aiming to calibrate both models for experimental use the comparison focused on the number and complexity of the required data for simulating a certain crop and the results provided by each model and their accuracy this comparison is valid only for barley and maybe other determined crops like wheat or maize which exhibit almost a linear relationship between irrigation and yield while this comparison would not be valid for crops like cotton where a regulated deficit irrigation may lead to an increased yield a statistical analyze was performed with the measured variables at field and simulated by both models in this case soil moisture and yield were the only two variables which could be analyzed in this research analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate variables obtained with both models during the 3 simulated years tukey s test was used to compare the means of each group not significant p 0 05 significant 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 01 highly significant finally the evaluation of the irrigation and other strategy tools provided by both models are not analyzed in this work this will be done in a subsequent paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of aquacrop 3 1 1 canopy cover the simulated and the observed evolution of the canopy cover cc for the 6 treatments in the calibration and validation years showed an adequate agreement during both the crop growth stage and over the maximum cc period fig 1 the crop growth coefficient cgc was properly calibrated table 4 during the second experimental season since the difference between simulated and observed values was between 2 6 and 6 5 with tendency to underestimate this growth stage in t5 and t6 treatments fig 1a f with respect to the period when the crop reached the maximum cc for the calibration year from 88 to 120 days after sowing fig 1a f the maximum simulated cc values with aquacrop were found to be slightly lower than the observed ones with differences lower than 8 2 in all treatments excepting the t3 treatment average overestimation of 4 5 fig 1c and whose standard deviation from the observed data included the simulated values fig 1a f finally the onset of canopy cover decline and the final cc were properly simulated during the calibration year differences lower than 13 7 with the last cc data being properly simulated in all treatments fig 1a f the mean bias error values showed the model slightly overestimated cc during all the crop cycle between 0 32 and 6 96 table 6 excepting the t5 treatment which one was underestimated 0 44 table 6 the simulated cc evolution for the two validation years 2011 and 2013 showed a similar one to the observed dataset from each experimental year fig 1g l cc during crop growing stage from sowing to 80 days after sowing fig 1g l was well fitted by aquacrop during the first experimental year average differences between simulated and observed data around 0 6 while these average differences were somewhat large for the last experimental season around 12 5 however the maximum cc period was slightly overestimated by aquacrop during 2013 differences around 3 2 and underestimated in 2011 cropping season between 9 2 and 12 8 with respect to the late season stage between 115 days after sowing and physiological maturity fig 1g l cc was overestimated during both experimental seasons with minimum and maximum differences of 5 4 and 16 respectively overall aquacrop model underestimated the cc evolution for all irrigation treatments during the first cropping season minimum and maximum mbe of 0 02 and 1 49 respectively table 6 due to the large differences obtained during the mid season stage while the crop cycle during the last cropping season was overestimated since the computed mbe was between 8 77 and 15 10 table 6 in general the model performance was very similar during the three experimental years where low estimation errors rmse and a high goodness of fit r2 ef and d index between simulated and observed data was achieved according to the statistical parameters used thus rmse took values between 8 8 and 15 1 with a strong linear relationship r2 0 87 and high agreement d 0 93 and ef between 0 67 and 0 94 for all treatments table 6 other authors using the aquacrop model with cereal crops barley wheat or maize have reported similar rmse r2 d index and ef values abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 pereira et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2015 toumi et al 2016 the value of the conservative parameters that describe the cc evolution canopy growth and decline coefficients the canopy size of average seedling at 90 emergence the water threshold stress for canopy expansion and senescence together with their shape factors are similar to those reported in the aquacrop manual raes et al 2012 and other papers simulating barley with aquacrop abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 pereira et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2015 with the exception of the upper threshold for early canopy senescence table 4 this last parameter was significantly different from the references already cited 0 85 vs 0 55 because this cultivar is tolerant to water deficit as shown by the observed cc evolution for most of the deficit treatments over the three experimental years fig 2 a b 3 1 2 soil moisture the simulated soil water content swc showed a suitable agreement with the observed data fig 2a reaching a high linear correlation r2 0 88 and a strong goodness of fit d 0 96 ef 0 87 the largest difference between observed and simulated data was reached in 2011 only one point fig 2a due to a significant rainfall event on the day before soil sampling nevertheless errors were low rmse 6 32 mm tending towards overestimation mbe 1 43 mm although the compared soil moisture dataset may be considered somewhat scarce the statistical results are similar to those reported by other authors abrha et al 2012 pereira et al 2015 3 1 3 aboveground biomass independently of the treatment aboveground biomass progression during the first cropping season model validation was properly simulated with respect to the observed data fig 3 the large differences between simulated and observed data were obtained during the first growing stages between 1 28 103 kg ha 1 and 1 89 103 kg ha 1 while that differences were lower from mid season stage to maturity around 0 58 103 kg ha 1 fig 3 thus the computed estimations errors for this variable were somewhat large around 1 74 103 kg ha 1 as average value with the result that all treatments were overestimated by the model mbe ranged from 0 38 103 kg ha 1 to 1 80 103 kg ha 1 table 5 nevertheless observed and simulated values had a strong linear correlation r2 0 91 and model efficiency and goodness of fit were high ef 0 79 d 0 95 table 5 abrha et al 2012 simulated the biomass evolution of barley crop and reported mean rmse values of around 1 5 103 kg ha 1 with variations between 0 6 and 6 3 103 kg ha 1 similar rmse results have been reported by other authors when simulating this variable for crops such as maize abedinpour et al 2012 heng et al 2009 katerji et al 2013 wheat andarzian et al 2011 or barley abi saab et al 2015 the model parameters that had a significant influence on the simulated biomass evolution as the crop transpiration coefficient the thresholds for stomatal closure their shape factor and the cold stress were similar to those reported in the manual raes et al 2012 table 4 and to the findings of other authors in studies on barley abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 however the normalized water productivity wp calibrated as 18 5 g m 2 table 4 was significantly higher than those parameterized in other works between 12 and 15 g m 2 abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 pereira et al 2015 this may be justified by the higher carbon assimilating rate of the cultivar used in this study table 2 nevertheless the wp value obtained is within the range proposed by raes et al 2012 15 20 g m 2 3 1 4 biomass yield and harvest index during the calibration year biomass yield and harvest index were adequately simulated showing estimation errors of 0 73 103 kg ha 1 0 30 103 kg ha 1 and 0 02 respectively in addition the calibration model showed a well goodness of fit for the three analyzed variables ef and d index 0 90 table 7 although the attained ef statistic for biomass and harvest index was moderate 0 65 and 0 70 respectively table 7 nevertheless the model showed a slight tendency to underestimate yield and harvest index with a strong linear correlation between observed and simulated data r2 0 90 table 7 the obtained deviations between simulated and observed data for all the irrigation treatments were lower than 10 in three analyzed variables being t6 at that limit table 2 statistical indicators obtained for the validation process showed an adequate performance with the yield variable low estimated errors and high index of agreement table 7 in addition total biomass and harvest index attained moderate and poor goodness of fit for 2013 0 78 and 0 43 for d index and 0 39 and 0 14 for ef respectively table 7 and a poor d index and ef at harvest during 2011 d 0 18 and ef 12 28 table 7 with low or no linear correlation r2 0 20 table 7 although there was a lack of linear adjustment the statistical errors obtained were low for both variables showing a good fit with each other these errors are similar to those reported by other authors abi saab et al 2015 abrha et al 2012 araya et al 2010 with respect to the deviations between simulated and observed harvest data during the two validation years it is highlighted that almost all irrigation treatments computed values lower than 10 only t1 in 2011 and t6 in 2013 were outside this criterion for the simulated yield and biomass respectively table 2 the deviation results are similar to those reported by pereira et al 2015 using aquacrop for barley in general the biomass and yield results of aquacrop model during the three experimental seasons showed that an underestimation of biomass implies a similar result for yield while this trend was not found for the harvest index table 2 furthermore the standard deviation of the observed data showed that the simulated values were included within their range in addition the number of treatments whose results showed deviations lower than 10 was higher than 75 of the total table 2 on the basis of these results aquacrop was considered calibrated and validated for simulating a barley crop cierzo cultivar under the semi arid conditions of clm 3 2 calibration and validation of mopeco 3 2 1 soil moisture the simulated soil water content swc showed an adequate goodness of fit to the observed data fig 2b achieving a good linear correlation and good agreement r2 0 73 d 0 87 ef 0 55 estimation errors were slightly high rmse 11 50 mm tending towards overestimation mbe 7 34 mm but similar to those reported by other authors abrha et al 2012 pereira et al 2015 3 2 2 maximum yield ym the average yield of the non deficit treatments was 9 000 103 kg ha 1 table 2 which was considered as ym during the simulations table 5 this potential yield is lower than that observed by jamieson et al 1995 for a triumph cultivar cropped in new zealand 9 670 103 kg ha 1 and similar to the yields obtained by domÃ­nguez et al 2017 in clm for the scarlett cultivar 9 236 103 kg ha 1 in addition it was within the range of the values reached by cossani et al 2009 in agramunt spain for three cultivars under non deficit conditions between 3 800 and 10 200 103 kg ha 1 and higher than the yield obtained by abrha et al 2012 in 5 different mediterranean areas cropping 5 cultivars under no water deficit conditions between 2 000 and 6 000 103 kg ha 1 3 2 3 yield response factor ky by using the soil water and evapotranspiration balance simulation module of mopeco as well as the data collected by the weather station at the experimental plots the eta etm rates were calculated for each ky stage fig 4 treatments achieved the lowest global eta etm rates in 2012 fig 4b nevertheless in none of the three years was the crop under water deficit conditions eta etm 1 during the first ky stage conditioning the calibration of the ky value for this stage fig 4 this finding is common for the majority of the crops sown in winter in the area because it is a rainy season and the evapotranspiration demand of the atmosphere is low domÃ­nguez et al 2012b 2013 moreover treatments in 2012 showed a higher variability in the eta etm values reached at each ky stages suffering water deficit conditions at least during two ky stages for that reason this year was selected for the calibration of the model in 2011 and 2013 fig 4a and c the maximum water deficit occurred during ky iii while in 2012 it was during ky ii fig 4b for the ky values fitted during the calibration table 5 the difference between simulated and observed average yields was equal or lower than 10 in the 18 simulations fig 5 the fit to the model in the yield simulation rmse 0 33 103 kg ha 1 and high goodness of fit d and ef 0 82 table 7 was better than that achieved by rÃ¶tter et al 2012 using nine crop models for simulating 44 growing seasons of spring barley at seven different study sites in europe czech republic denmark finland and slovakia and by abi saab et al 2015 using cropsyst and aquacrop to simulate barley cv ponente in southern italy in contrast abrha et al 2012 found a slightly higher goodness of fit simulating 5 different cultivars of spring barley birguda ponente arabi abiad beecher and maris badger at different locations in ethiopia italy syria and montana usa according to the ky values obtained in the calibration and validation process ky ii flowering was the most sensitive stage to water deficit table 5 hence the yield of t4 in 2013 decreased by 18 with regards to t3 when a 28 deficit eta etm 0 72 was applied in ky ii fig 4c this result coincides with the conclusions of other authors in research on cereals doorenbos and kassam 1979 farrÃ© and faci 2006 to the best of our knowledge no studies have been conducted using the equation proposed by stewart et al 1977 to simulate barley consequently it was not possible to compare the ky values obtained in this study with those proposed by other authors according to albrizio et al 2010 the response of this crop to water deficit is similar to that of spring wheat moreover ky values proposed by several authors for wheat day et al 1987 doorenbos and kassam 1979 francia et al 2011 are similar to those determined for barley in the present research as it was not possible to calibrate ky i fig 4 we assumed the value recommended by doorenbos and kassam 1979 mopeco uses global ky to simulate the response of crops under salinity conditions domÃ­nguez et al 2011 the value obtained in the calibration and validation process was 1 10 table 5 which is slightly lower than the one stated by pereira et al 2015 for the whole growing period 1 25 on the basis of these results mopeco was considered to be calibrated and validated for simulating a barley crop cierzo cultivar under the semi arid conditions in clm up to global deficit levels of eta etm 0 73 therefore the calibrated values must be applied with caution under more restrictive conditions mainly if stress is caused during the ky i stage not calibrated 3 2 4 maximum eta etm difference between consecutive ky stages for ordi methodology the ordi methodology requires stating the maximum difference e in terms of deficit eta etm between two consecutive ky stages domÃ­nguez et al 2012a instead of the average values fig 5 we compared the results of all the repetitions with the simulations thus differences higher than 0 25 increased the percentage of non fitting cases fig 6 for this reason e 0 25 was stated for the ordi methodology table 5 this value is lower than those determined for other annual crops in the area such as maize 0 3 onion 0 4 and garlic 0 4 domÃ­nguez et al 2012a b 2013 therefore in barley it is important to accurately control the deficit in the different stages in order to avoid excessive values in certain ky stages that may notably affect the final yield 3 3 comparison of models in terms of crop simulation aquacrop provides more information than mopeco as the objective of the two models is different consequently compared to mopeco aquacrop facilitates a more in depth study of the effect of the irrigation schedules on different physiological and growth parameters of the crop table 8 the simulated soil moisture and yield data by both models showed that there were no differences between aquacrop and mopeco with respect to the observed data table 9 soil moisture was overestimated between 1 8 and 8 8 by aquacrop and mopeco respectively in other hand differences between simulated and observed yields were similar around 1 6 being over and underestimated by both of them respectively table 9 among experimental years there were significant differences for soil moisture which could be due to randomly while crop yield was no affected table 9 the parameters not used in the calibration and validation of both models were compared infiltration percolation from root area etm and eta table 10 for both models the amount of infiltrated water was practically the same differences may be attributed to the fact that mopeco considers the decimal values of the amount of rainfall and irrigation while aquacrop uses entire numbers nevertheless mopeco systematically simulated higher volumes of percolated water than aquacrop at both treatment level and across experimental years this difference is a result of the different methodologies used by the models when simulating the movement of water in the soil aquacrop uses the drainage function raes et al 2012 which is more precise and requires a higher number of parameters table 2 than that used by mopeco when the amount of water in the root area is higher than field capacity the difference is considered as percolation domÃ­nguez et al 2011 in the simulations aquacrop reduced the amount of percolated water with respect to mopeco by between 30 and 70 mm which may also justify the higher values of eta achieved by all the treatments when using the former model table 10 the simplicity of mopeco in terms of algorithms used in the soil water balance domÃ­nguez et al 2011 as well as the use of the single kc instead of the dual kc procedure allen et al 1998 generates larger errors in the swc estimation than aquacrop fig 2 in this study mopeco overestimated swc determining higher volumes of percolated water as a consequence of the previous results the values of etm simulated by both models show large differences over the three experimental years around 95 136 and 78 mm for 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 10 analyzing the reference treatment t3 mopeco simulated similar values of eta and etm differences between 0 and 9 mm table 10 which implies that t3 reached the maximum yield ym as this treatment did not undergo water deficit stress eq 2 however eta and etm values simulated by aquacrop for the same treatment were notably different in the three years 43 86 and 53 mm in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 10 according to the results aquacrop considered that the irrigation management in t3 reduced the potential evaporation from the bare soil around 55 and during the first stages of the canopy develops until reaching the 60 of maximum cc which were lower than those considered as maximum by the model 70 56 and 78 of the maximum evaporation in 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively in this sense it is worth noting that the maximum soil evaporation coefficient kex used for the calibration and validation of aquacrop was 1 10 allen et al 1998 moreover torres and calera 2010 in a study carried out in an area with similar soil properties to those in this research stated that fao 56 methodology overestimates evaporation from bare soil consequently also during the beginning of the crop development which may justify the differences between the maximum and real evaporation simulations when using aquacrop table 9 nevertheless the water requirements of the crop in t3 were fully satisfied during the three years as considered by mopeco table 10 the great results obtained by both models highlight the importance of adapting these tools to the knowledge and necessities of the productive sector in this sense the supromed project ga 1813 funded by prima and coordinated by the uclm group aims to adapt and transfer mopeco and other tools to the productive sector through an online platform the objective is to improve the resilience of mediterranean agricultural systems to global warming using existing methods and technologies not yet available for the productive sector 4 conclusions the aquacrop and mopeco models were calibrated and validated for a barley crop cultivated in the semi arid conditions of southeast spain the results of aquacrop for evolution of canopy cover biomass crop yield and soil water content showed high goodness of fit between simulated and observed values in the case of mopeco similar results were obtained for the final yield and for the evolution of soil moisture the calibrated values of ky for mopeco will allow simulations of barley in this area and will serve as a reference in others given the lack of information about ky parameters for this crop in the literature moreover the calibration of this model will facilitate the implementation of optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi strategies in order to achieve higher productivity of the irrigation water supplied to this crop the comparison between the two models showed that aquacrop is a better model for simulating and analyzing the effect of a particular irrigation schedule on a crop compared to mopeco nevertheless if the objective is to estimate yield mopeco is also valid and simpler to calibrate in the present study the use of both models improves the simulation of the effects of deficit irrigation strategies declaration of competing interest the

10738,with a rapidly growing global population increased agricultural productivity is required to achieve future food security efficient use of water and other agricultural inputs such as nutrients and pesticides must underpin agronomic practices to improve crop establishment and increase crop yields a glasshouse study was conducted to explore the potential of a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm applied in bands to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature thus improving germination emergence and crop establishment the aims were two fold i to evaluate the effectiveness of the sbpm in reducing seedbed water loss and its effect on seedling emergence and ii to determine an effective band width 100 vs 150 mm and application rate of sbpm to conserve seedbed water our study demonstrated that a high application rate 1 kg m 2 is effective at reducing soil water loss but it reduces crop emergence cotton sunflower sorghum mung bean carrot capsicum and rockmelon all three sbpm application rates 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 showed increased soil water content compared to the control plot bare soil surface the applied bands 100 and 150 mm width

al 2015 also removing and disposing of pe films is laborious time consuming and expensive velandia et al 2018 consequently the expanding use of nondegradable plastic has led to environmental pollution that will have long term consequences on soil and water quality the environment and human health chen et al 2013 these negative environmental effects of plastic mulch film have resulted in more scientific and industrial efforts to develop more sustainable biodegradable mulch products current biodegradable mulch films are produced from natural polymers such as starch cellulose polysaccharides chitosan and alginate santagata et al 2014 in order for mulch to be considered biodegradable its physical and mechanical integrity must not be compromised while in use according to en 17033 2018en 3 2018en 17033 2018 and astm d 5988 18 at the end of its lifespan the biodegradable mulch should break down into natural elements carbon dioxide or methane water and microbial biomass schettini et al 2007 briassoulis et al 2010 sintim et al 2019 the lifetime and properties of biodegradable mulches can be customised by varying its thickness in relation with the selected crop growth duration ideally biodegradation will result in the complete transformation or mineralization of organic substances to inorganic products as micro organisms break down complex polymer chains malinconico et al 2008 recently a biodegradable spray on mulch based on sodium alginate was developed as an alternative for thin plastic mulch film for potential use in horticulture e g vaicekauskaite et al 2019 sartore et al 2018 tested polymeric protein based biodegradable spray coatings in greenhouse trials which showed agronomic performances comparable with commercial low density polyethylene mulch film protein hydrolysates were derived from waste products of the leather industry while poly ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and epoxidized soybean oil were used to make the biodegradable spray coatings the study showed that 2 months after tillage at the end of the cultivation amount of coating residues present in the soil was 5 of the initial weight of the biodegradable coatings with the results comparable to the low density polyethylene mulching films preferably the formulation of sprayable biodegradable polymers used in agriculture will enable water to infiltrate into the rhizosphere while simultaneously forming a barrier to prevent water evaporation from the soil surface johnston et al 2017 a field trial using a polysiloxane polymer aqueous spray conducted by al kalbani et al 2003 resulted in water savings of 25 50 and increased yields by 10 80 adhikari et al 2015a 2015b reported a new water dispersible sprayable biodegradable polymer sbpm that forms a membrane on the soil surface to minimize soil evaporation limited field trials demonstrated 28 less irrigation water was able to sustain the same crop yields compared to control plot under controlled laboratory conditions the results were even more pronounced with the biodegradable spray on polymer reducing soil evaporation by more than 60 compared with a bare soil control preformed polymer films can be applied before or after planting seeds with holes made to allow seedling emergence however with a sprayable polymer in some management practices seedlings are required to penetrate the membrane to emerge if the spraying occurred before crop emergence vox et al 2013 the inclusion of carbon black in sprayable polymers to inhibit weed growth santagata et al 2014 vox et al 2013 may also compromise crop emergence by reducing photosynthetically active radiation thus there is a need to investigate efficiency of crop emergence and water use efficiency when using sprayable polymer technology this study explores the potential of a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm adhikari et al 2015b 2016 to increase soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation to improve crop productivity the sbpm is designed to improve crop germination and establishment where the surface soil dries rapidly by providing a barrier that will moderate soil surface temperature and reduce soil water evaporation the aims of the present study were i to evaluate the effectiveness of the sbpm in reducing seedbed water loss and its effect on seedling emergence and ii to determine an effective band width 100 vs 150 mm and application rate of sbpm to conserve seedbed water the hypothesis tested was that higher rates of sbpm application will reduce soil water loss but may also reduce the success of seedling emergence 2 materials and methods 2 1 glasshouse experiment set up glasshouse pot tray experiments were conducted during december 2016 and january 2017 at the australian cotton research institute acri

3 three seeds were sown in a triangular pattern at a depth of 10 mm with the sbpm applied at three rates 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 using a spray bottle with the control being bare soil on 2 december 2016 seven species of crops were utilised in this study cotton gossypium hirsutum sicot 746b3f sunflower helianthus annuus ausigold sorghum sorghum sp pioneer g22 mung bean vigna radiata satin ii carrot daucus carota subsp savitus nantes capsicum capsicum sp chinese giant and rockmelon cucumis melo caribbean gold specified germination percentage by crop producers for each crop used were in a range from 90 to 95 pots were weighed daily over eight days with soil water loss determined by the change in pot weight all pots had identical weight at the start of the experiment the number of emerged seedlings and sbpm condition was recorded daily until no further seedlings emerged after nine days additional information are presented in the next section 2 3 experiment 2 soil water conservation for the second experiment the same pots were used after seedlings from the first experiment were removed by cutting stems at the soil surface pots were re wetted with fine spray on 12 december 2016 and weighed daily over eight days volumetric soil water content was also measured using a ml3 thetaprobe soil moisture water content sensor delta t https www delta t co uk product ml3 probe length 5 5 cm the four probes were placed in pre existing holes for subsequent readings to avoid further damage to the sbpm for both experiments the pots were placed on a plastic lined glasshouse bench containing a 2 cm depth of water overnight to allow water to wick up into the pots through capillary suction upward flux the next day water was drained from the bench and the initial pot weights were measured the pots were not irrigated during both experiments to simulate a dryland cropping system four replicates were prepared for each treatment and arranged in a randomised complete block design 2 4 experiment 3 alternating sbpm band width a additional glasshouse experiment was conducted where the same soil was sieved to 4 mm and packed in trays 320 mm by 270 mm by 35 mm to a bulk density of 1 1 g m 3 a bare control soil was compared with the sbpm applied in band widths of 100 and 150 mm at two application rates of 0 25 kg m Â² and 0 5 kg m Â² the sbpm application of 1 kg m 2 rate was not tested as it was seen that this rate prevents seedling emergence additionally the experiments were set up to assess decreasing amounts application rates of polymer which limits the cost four seeds of cotton sicot 746b3f and sorghum pioneer g22 were planted centrally in the individual trays on 5 december 2016 prior to the application of sbpm soil temperature c and water potential kpa were logged every 30 min with em50 loggers using mps 2 sensors consisting of ceramic discs and a thermistor decagon instruments meter group buried mid depth app 2 cm below the surface in the soil beneath the band of polymer and under the band of bare soil soil water potential data was shown to 1500 kpa which corresponds to the plant wilting point the sbpm was manually sprayed onto the soil surface using a template for each bandwidth i e 100 and 150 mm bands there were three replicates for each treatment trays were randomised on a plastic covered bench filled with 2 cm of water that allowed water to wick up through holes in the base of the trays over 28 h excess water was then drained from the bench when the soil reached field capacity 10 kpa trays were subsequently irrigated with a fine spray from above to uniformly wet the soil on two occasions when soil water potential reached 60 kpa to ensure germination and emergence of cotton and sorghum seedlings and to have uniform conditions in entire experiment irrigation was discontinued at this point as the aim of the experiment was to compare soil water loss from the different treatments trays were inspected daily for seedling and or weed emergence on termination of the experiment soil samples were taken from beneath the sbpm band and bare soil from both sides of the band for gravimetric analysis by oven drying at 105 c 2 5 statistical analysis data for the first two experiments were analysed using anova and tukey s honest significant difference test Î± 0 05 to test for significant differences with r version 3 3 2 r core

effect on soil water status pots treated with sbpm reduced soil water loss compared to the control in both experiments bare soil treatment fig 2 weight measurements showed that pots treated with sbpm reduced average water loss ranging from 4 0 13 5 in experiment 1 fig 2a and 2 8 15 5 in experiment 2 fig 2b depending on the application rate generally the average water conservation trend between treatments was control 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 except during day five and eight of the second experiment in experiment 1 the water conserving capabilities of the sbpm was most effective on first four days sbpm treatments showed significant differences in water conservation less evaporation when compared to the control and to each other p 0 05 fig 2a however its effectiveness decreased with time as the soil became drier while sbpm application significantly reduced water loss p 0 05 applications at 1 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 did not affect water conserved after day 5 the same was observed when comparing applications at 0 25 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 after day 6 soil water dynamics based on the volumetric soil water content sensors also showed an identical trend for water conservation control 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 fig 2c however unlike the weight data sbpm only made a significant difference in soil water content at the highest rate applied 1 kg m 2 p 0 01 3 2 experiment 3 trays sbpm effect on soil water and thermal status soil beneath the sbpm retained more water gravimetric than bare soil in all treatments table 2 the least effective treatment was the highest spray rate 0 5 kg m 2 applied in a 150 mm band 6 28 table 2 however the differences between band widths were not significant the soil water content was averaged daily for each treatment and position beneath the sbpm mid position or strip of bare soil edge position the soil water content was higher under both sbpm bands 100 and 150 mm and at each application rate 0 25 0 5 kg m 2 compared with the control bare soil water potential shows large differences corresponding to placement positions in the trays e g mid position of sbpm band and edge position of bare soil in the tray fig 3 soil water potential under the two bands was higher wetter soil than that under the bare soil at each rate of sbpm application a similar result to the gravimetric measurement on completion of the experiment during the first three days of the experiment all trays were at field capacity 10 kpa and it was only after the soil began drying day 4 that differences between treatments became evident this was confirmed gravimetrically after seven days when the experiment was terminated fig 3 a time series plot of water potential indicate that the 100 mm bandwidth was more effective than 150 mm at retaining soil water during drying out periods fig 3 similar patterns are observed for water potential by spray rate this time showing the 0 5 kg m Â² rate to be more effective than 0 25 kg m Â² at retaining soil water the 150 mm band recorded the highest temperature with a maximum of 46 6 c 0 8 c higher than the bare soil control maximum fig 3 the wider band also recorded the lowest temperature by 0 1 c although there was little variation between treatments in minimum daily temperature fig 3 the higher application rate of sbpm 0 5 kg m 2 also had the highest maximum and lowest minimum temperature of all the treatments in addition soil temperature beneath the polymer band was slightly warmer on average compared to adjacent bare soil strips in all treatments 0 3 and 0 1 c for 100 150 mm bands it was noted that the glasshouse maximum and minimum temperatures were frequently higher that those outside fig 1a which possibly elevated the soil temperature as well 3 3 seedling emergence under sbpm seedling emergence was very low in all treatments with several pots having no seedling emerged fig 4 the control had the highest number of emerged seedlings 1 of 3 seeds sown regardless of species followed by pots with 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 and 1 kg m 2 of sbpm application fig 4a the only treatment that showed significant difference was emergence at applications of 1 kg m 2 which was 85 lower than the control p 0 05 weeds species unidentified were present in all treatments during both experiments fig 4b while we had not intended to examine weed dynamics under different sbpm rates the number of emerged weeds was recorded opportunistically showing a similar trend to that of crop seedling emergence weed numbers were highest in the control decreasing in the following order control 0 25 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 fig 4b statistically the control and pots with 0 25 kg m 2 of sbpm had a similar number of weeds which were significantly higher than pots with 0 5 kg m 2 and 1 kg m 2of sbpm applied p 0 05 emergence was highly variable between species and across treatments fig 5 a and b sbpm rates of 0 5 kg m 2 and 0 25 kg m 2 reduced the number of emerged cotton seedlings by 60 no cotton seedlings emerged at the highest sbpm rate 1 kg m 2 the same trend was observed for mung beans interestingly there were 33 more seedlings in pots with 0 5 kg m 2 of sbpm applied than the control though this was not statistically significant generally mung beans showed relatively good emergence success under the lower sbpm rates 0 5 kg m 2 and 0 25 kg m 2 as one to two seedlings emerged out of the three sown sorghum and rockmelon emerged in all treatments the highest number of sorghum seedlings occurred in the control two seedlings out of the three sown but declined with increasing sbpm application rates at 1 kg m 2 of sbpm only one in nine seeds successfully emerged similarly rock melon performed relatively well under all treatments though less so in pots with 1 kg m 2 of sbpm no sunflower seedlings except for one in a low sbpm rate pot 0 25 kg m 2 emerged throughout the experiment no carrot or capsicum seedlings emerged in the control or any of the sbpm treatments fig 5 the narrow band of polymer 100 mm had the lowest seedling emergence at 38 for both polymer application rates fig 6 a the lowest spray rate combined with the widest bandwidth was the only treatment exhibiting improved emergence by 24 compared with the bare soil control fig 5a despite observable differences between treatments there was no significant interaction where p 0 05 between species application rate or bandwidth for emergence the lower application rate resulted in seedling weed emergence fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 soil water and temperature mulching has been a long practiced method to improve crop productivity with soil water conservation as one of its most important advantages kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a polyurethane based sbpm in reducing soil water loss in a controlled glasshouse experiments interestingly in our experiments we did not observe water conservation of up to 28 and 60 found in field trials and controlled laboratory conditions respectively as reported previously by adhikari et al 2015a 2016 our highest rate of sbpm application 1 kg m 2 resulted in a saving of 13 5 15 5 compared with the control pots the differences may be due to the fact that this experiment was conducted in a glasshouse in contrast to a controlled laboratory environment which can lead to different environmental conditions with high average temperatures fig 1a furthermore the application rates were not specified in adhikari et al 2015a 2016 also the glasshouse experiment was subjected to a range of environmental factors including daily variations in solar radiation which can alter the ambient temperature of the glasshouse and lead to higher evaporative rates and greater soil water loss fig 2 the results also indicate the need to better understand the water transmissivity and porosity of the sbpm once it has adhered to the soil and dried previous studies using different sp sprayable polymer formulations have reported improvements in soil water conservation compared with a bare soil control yang et al 2004 adhikari et al 2015a but this was not always the case when evaluating the efficiency of different mulch types ramakrishna et al 2006 identified na 1 sp polymer unspecified as the least effective material in increasing soil temperature and soil water content statistically na 1 application had no effect on soil temperature or soil water a similar four year dryland experiment conducted in semi arid china also reported no significant changes in soil water content after the application of sp supplied by beijing jinshanghe bio tech co ltd beijing china polymer unspecified li et al 2012 2013 2016 in contrast these studies highlighted a significant benefit of using polyethylene pe and biodegradable films on soil temperature and crop yield while our experiments did not utilise the same formulation the lack of a mulching effect on soil evaporation in these previous experiments could also be explained through the different rates of sp applied the rates applied in presented experiments resulted in significant water conservation and were higher than the rates applied in ramakrishma et al 2006 1 kg ha 1 and li et al 2012 2013 2016 450 l ha 1 biochemical fulvic acid 1 5 product to water dilution experiments furthermore application rates of the same sp utilised by li et al 2012 achieved adequate soil water retention yang et al 2004 yield yang et al 2008 and weed control wang et al 2013 when applied at higher rates 112 250 kg ha 1 these observations regarding water retention in soil fit well with the trend observed in our experiments where higher rates of sbpm application increased soil water conservation measurements from the mps 2 sensors and of gravimetric soil water content for different treatments show that the soil below sbpm bands 100 and 150 mm retained more water compared to the bare soil control as expected there was no clear evidence on the application rate and spray rate the assumption was that a high spray rate would produce a more effective water retention barrier as the membrane is more continuous and less likely to have porosity allowing soil water to evaporate in experiments using a transparent spray mulch coating little cracks appeared on the soil surface in the first month after application but had no discernible effect on its mulching ability schettini et al 2007 cracks on the surface of the soil and polymer coating were evident in our experiment as a result of the high evaporative demand environment in the glasshouse the effects of cracks in the polymer membrane were not quantified in this study future research should focus towards refining the application methods to enhance tensile strength and consistency of the polymer membrane sartore et al 2018 reported that their biodegradable spray coatings showed that the mulching effect lasted for 2 months however cracks in the polymer were present at the soil surface the results shown in saglam et al 2017 that both biodegradable paper and biodegradable plastic mulches reduced evaporation by restricting water and vapor flow across the soil atmosphere interface and thereby conserved water in the root zone however the water conservation effect of biodegradable paper and biodegradable plastic mulch will depend on their degradation rates during the growing season the wider bandwidth sbpm generated higher average and maximum soil temperatures as it covered a larger surface area the dark colour of the polymer due to the addition of 2 carbon black as a pigment more efficiently absorbs and converts solar radiation to heat sartore et al 2018 immirzi et al 2009 tested different biodegradable spray coatings that showed a good capacity to reduce weed growth even with different par transmissivity coefficients similarly it is speculated that a thicker polymer coating increases absorption of incoming solar radiation the higher temperatures observed in soil beneath polymer bands especially daily maximums may have compromised germination and emergence in this glasshouse experiment due to extremely high outside temperatures 35 37 c in cooler climates or during winter for example the warming effect of the sbpm can be more beneficial studies have shown crop development can begin earlier in the season resulting in higher yields when soil temperatures are warmer and conducive to earlier and more successful crop establishment dong et al 2009 4 2 sbpm effect on seedling emergence increased soil temperature under sp and pe mulches has led to improved seed germination and better crop establishment schettini et al 2007 anzalone et al 2010 nevertheless there is a scarcity of information on seedling growth under applications of sbpm our results show that successful emergence decreased with increasing sbpm application rates although there was no significant difference between application rates of 0 25 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 emergence was 85 lower under the 1 kg m 2 application rate crops such as capsicum and carrot did not emerge at all in performed experiment other crops such as sorghum cotton and mung bean emerged in all treatments except that with 1 kg m 2 of sbpm applied the crops with small seeds size exhibited lower germination and emergence compared with the crops with larger seeds which was also observed by ambika et al 2014 also the measured maximum soil temperatures were considerably higher 35 40 c than the optimum for seedling germination and emergence for the period after seed placement fig 1a the main factor in performed experiments for limiting or promoting seedling emergence was the thickness of the applied sbpm and not the temperature in the method of sowing the seeds before sbpm application resulted in lack of slits and openings require seedlings to successfully penetrate the sbpm layer to fully emerge however it is possible that the tensile strength of the sbpm was too large for seedlings to overcome at higher application rates the sbpm will be thicker and more difficult to penetrate similar to the observations of chase et al 1998 using plastic mulch of varying thickness this was also supported by observations in which seedlings had successfully germinated but lifted the sbpm layer upwards instead of penetrating through it a similar phenomenon was described by warnick et al 2006 where weedy purple nutsedges cyperus rotundus were growing underneath the paper based liquid mulch which dried into a membrane lifting it by several centimetres off the soil surface the separation between the sbpm and soil surface should be minimised as much as possible because soil water evaporation will likely increase if the sbpm layer does not adhere to the soil surface and emerging shoots may bend thus losing ability to penetrate the sbpm adhikari et al 2019 assessed a range of polymer viscosity sbpm formulations in order to prevent wicking and poor membrane formulation the chosen viscosity modifiers have resulted in better mechanical integrity of the sbpm cover even at lower polymer application rates the lack of slits and openings may prevent sunlight from reaching seeds in the soil at higher application rates the greater thickness and better cover of the black coloured gelatine based sp on the soil surface reduced the amount of par penetrating the soil and triggered weed germination sartore et al 2013 while the aim of utilising carbon black in the sbpm formulation was to suppress weeds it can also have a similar inhibitory effect on crop seeds if planted before polymer application our results support this because both crops and weeds showed declining emergence with increasing rates of sbpm application while the exact par transmissivity coefficient of the sbpm is not yet known immirzi et al 2009 and sartore et al 2013 found that their alginate and gelatine based sp formulations allowed a greater proportion of par to penetrate through than the recommended quality necessary for weed suppression in plastic films 0 01 regardless they demonstrated that sp was effective in weed control though its effect on crop emergence was not specified in slotted plastic mulch films this presents less of an issue as slits and holes enable par to penetrate the soils at the locations where crop seedlings seeds have been sown and weeds will also be able to emerge 4 3 emergence of seedlings crop and weeds and band width generally the sbpm reduced seedling emergence compared to the bare control this may be attributed to the physical properties of the sprayable polymer coatings as suspended particles tend to spread on the soil surface and make a tight seal malinconico et al 2008 adhikari et al 2016 the only treatment with a rate of emergence higher than the bare soil control was a combination of the wide bandwidth 150 mm and low spray rate 0 25 kg m 2 this result may signify the potential benefit of a larger spray area in increasing soil temperature under the black coating promoting germination and emergence the reason why the lower spray rate was more effective at the 150 mm bandwidth may also be related to the thickness of the polymer membrane as it would be more likely for a seedling to penetrate a thinner weaker polymer coating one solution would be to plant seeds and apply sbpm at the same time either side of the plant line or to apply the sbpm ahead of the planter where the seed seedling is placed in a hole slot formed in the sbpm unsterilized soil used to fill trays was a repository for weed seeds that were triggered to germinate following wetting resulting in high occurrence of spontaneous weeds most weeds emerged from the bare soil compared to the sbpm band results from this experiment demonstrated that trays with 150 mm polymer bands had a lower occurrence of weeds than those with 100 mm bands the en 13655 2002 standard for weed suppression by black ldpe mulching films is 0 01 total transmissivity in the par range another biodegradable spray coating mixed with carbon black and glycerol tested by malinconico et al 2008 exhibited the lowest total transmissivity of biodegradable mulches involved in the experiment at 0 1 though still well above the 0 01 threshold par was unable to be measured in these experiments further the only treatments exhibiting fewer weeds than the bare soil control were those with sbpm applied in a 150 mm band at an application rate of 0 25 kg m 2 this can be a consequence of lower soil water content exhibited at this rate with less water available for weeds to germinate the results may also be partially explained in the difficulty of applying the sbpm evenly and completely across the soil surface owing to its heterogeneous particle sizes the addition of carbon black in the emulsion has contributed to inconsistent thickness of the sbpm 5 conclusions the results of controlled glasshouse experiments indicate that the higher the rate of sbpm application the greater the amount of soil water conserved ideally application at a rate of 1 kg m 2 would be recommended due to the high levels of water conservation observed however the application of sbpm at this rate resulted in low seedling emergence our findings suggest there is a trade off between water conservation and successful crop emergence if sbpm is applied after the seeds have been planted all three sbpm application rates 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 showed increased soil water content compared to the control plot the sbpm applied in bands 100 and 150 mm width limited evaporation and increased soil water potential and temperature compared to the control with no significant differences between the two bandwidths crop emergence was proportional to the application rate i e it decreased with increasing spray rate while only the application of 1 kg m 2 showed significant decrease the sbpm also limited the weed growth similar to conventional plastic mulch films a wide bandwidth 150 mm and low spray rate 0 25 kg m 2 resulted in the highest seedling emergence through the sbpm while suppressing more weeds than the bare soil control the application of sbpm is just as important as its formulation in terms of efficiency affordability and viability in commercial agricultural practice the results of these experiments are promising demonstrating the ability of the sbpm to reduce soil evaporation the findings also highlight the need for scaled up field trials focusing on the sbpm properties application and field management acknowledgments a zaja

10738,with a rapidly growing global population increased agricultural productivity is required to achieve future food security efficient use of water and other agricultural inputs such as nutrients and pesticides must underpin agronomic practices to improve crop establishment and increase crop yields a glasshouse study was conducted to explore the potential of a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm applied in bands to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature thus improving germination emergence and crop establishment the aims were two fold i to evaluate the effectiveness of the sbpm in reducing seedbed water loss and its effect on seedling emergence and ii to determine an effective band width 100 vs 150 mm and application rate of sbpm to conserve seedbed water our study demonstrated that a high application rate 1 kg m 2 is effective at reducing soil water loss but it reduces crop emergence cotton sunflower sorghum mung bean carrot capsicum and rockmelon all three sbpm application rates 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 showed increased soil water content compared to the control plot bare soil surface the applied bands 100 and 150 mm width

application rate and decreased with increasing application rate i e control 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 the sbpm suppressed weed growth similar to conventional mulch film and was most effective at 0 5 kg m 2 and 150 mm width future research should focus on the field sbpm application management with an emphasis on crop emergence zones biodegradability and comparing its effectiveness with other

population farmers need to use water and nutrients more efficiently to maintain and preferably increase crop productivity from a decreasing area of arable land minimising soil evaporation and increasing crop transpiration will enhance crop productivity i e increase biomass production and yield this can be achieved by using various surface mulch covers and or with improved irrigation technologies plastic mulch application is a common agricultural practice due to variety of benefits to the crop production through soil temperature increase and evaporation decrease fritz 2012 additional advantages of plastic mulch film developed through the years include earlier crop maturation pest control and high quality products as the film protects products from soil splash during rainfall and minimises soil erosion and diseases malinconico et al 2008 sintim and flury 2017 beside the multiple benefits provided by plastic mulch film there are negative impacts of using these

2018en 17033 2018 and astm d 5988 18 at the end of its lifespan the biodegradable mulch should break down into natural elements carbon dioxide or methane water and microbial biomass schettini et al 2007 briassoulis et al 2010 sintim et al 2019 the lifetime and properties of biodegradable mulches can be customised by varying its thickness in relation with the selected crop growth duration ideally biodegradation will result in the complete transformation or mineralization of organic substances to inorganic products as micro organisms break down complex polymer chains malinconico et al 2008 recently a biodegradable spray on mulch based on sodium alginate was developed as an alternative for thin plastic mulch film for potential use in horticulture e g vaicekauskaite et al 2019 sartore et al 2018 tested polymeric protein based biodegradable spray coatings in greenhouse trials which showed agronomic performances comparable with commercial low density polyethylene mulch film protein hydrolysates were derived from waste products of the leather industry while poly ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and epoxidized soybean oil were used to make the biodegradable spray coatings the study showed that 2 months after tillage at the end of the cultivation amount of coating residues present in the soil was 5 of the initial weight of the biodegradable coatings with the results comparable to the low density polyethylene mulching films preferably the formulation of sprayable biodegradable polymers used in agriculture will enable water to infiltrate into the rhizosphere while simultaneously forming a barrier to prevent water evaporation from the soil surface johnston et al 2017 a field trial using a polysiloxane polymer aqueous spray conducted by al kalbani et al 2003 resulted in water savings of 25 50 and increased yields by 10 80 adhikari et al 2015a 2015b reported a new water dispersible sprayable biodegradable polymer sbpm that forms a membrane on the soil surface to minimize soil evaporation limited field trials demonstrated 28 less irrigation water was able to sustain the same crop yields compared to control plot under controlled laboratory conditions the results were even more pronounced with the biodegradable spray on polymer reducing soil evaporation by more than 60 compared with a bare soil control preformed polymer films can be applied before or after planting seeds with holes made to allow seedling emergence however with a sprayable polymer in some management practices seedlings are required to penetrate the membrane to emerge if the spraying occurred before crop emergence vox et al 2013 the inclusion of carbon black in sprayable polymers to inhibit weed growth santagata et al 2014 vox et al 2013 may also compromise crop emergence by reducing photosynthetically active radiation thus there is a need to investigate efficiency of crop emergence and water use efficiency when using sprayable polymer technology this study explores the potential of a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm adhikari et al 2015b 2016 to increase soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation to improve crop productivity the sbpm is designed to improve crop germination and establishment where the surface soil dries rapidly by providing a barrier that will moderate soil surface temperature and reduce soil water evaporation the aims of the present study were i to evaluate the effectiveness of the sbpm in reducing seedbed water loss and its effect on seedling emergence and ii to determine an effective band width 100 vs 150 mm and application rate of sbpm to conserve seedbed water the hypothesis tested was that higher rates of sbpm application will reduce soil water loss but may also reduce the success of seedling emergence 2 materials and methods 2 1 glasshouse experiment set up glasshouse pot tray experiments were conducted during december 2016 and january 2017 at the australian cotton research institute acri

3 three seeds were sown in a triangular pattern at a depth of 10 mm with the sbpm applied at three rates 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 using a spray bottle with the control being bare soil on 2 december 2016 seven species of crops were utilised in this study cotton gossypium hirsutum sicot 746b3f sunflower helianthus annuus ausigold sorghum sorghum sp pioneer g22 mung bean vigna radiata satin ii carrot daucus carota subsp savitus nantes capsicum capsicum sp chinese giant and rockmelon cucumis melo caribbean gold specified germination percentage by crop producers for each crop used were in a range from 90 to 95 pots were weighed daily over eight days with soil water loss determined by the change in pot weight all pots had identical weight at the start of the experiment the number of emerged seedlings and sbpm condition was recorded daily until no further seedlings emerged after nine days additional information are presented in the next section 2 3 experiment 2 soil water conservation for the second experiment the same pots were used after seedlings from the first experiment were removed by cutting stems at the soil surface pots were re wetted with fine spray on 12 december 2016 and weighed daily over eight days volumetric soil water content was also measured using a ml3 thetaprobe soil moisture water content sensor delta t https www delta t co uk product ml3 probe length 5 5 cm the four probes were placed in pre existing holes for subsequent readings to avoid further damage to the sbpm for both experiments the pots were placed on a plastic lined glasshouse bench containing a 2 cm depth of water overnight to allow water to wick up into the pots through capillary suction upward flux the next day water was drained from the bench and the initial pot weights were measured the pots were not irrigated during both experiments to simulate a dryland cropping system four replicates were prepared for each treatment and arranged in a randomised complete block design 2 4 experiment 3 alternating sbpm band width a additional glasshouse experiment was conducted where the same soil was sieved to 4 mm and packed in trays 320 mm by 270 mm by 35 mm to a bulk density of 1 1 g m 3 a bare control soil was compared with the sbpm applied in band widths of 100 and 150 mm at two application rates of 0 25 kg m Â² and 0 5 kg m Â² the sbpm application of 1 kg m 2 rate was not tested as it was seen that this rate prevents seedling emergence additionally the experiments were set up to assess decreasing amounts application rates of polymer which limits the cost four seeds of cotton sicot 746b3f and sorghum pioneer g22 were planted centrally in the individual trays on 5 december 2016 prior to the application of sbpm soil temperature c and water potential kpa were logged every 30 min with em50 loggers using mps 2 sensors consisting of ceramic discs and a thermistor decagon instruments meter group buried mid depth app 2 cm below the surface in the soil beneath the band of polymer and under the band of bare soil soil water potential data was shown to 1500 kpa which corresponds to the plant wilting point the sbpm was manually sprayed onto the soil surface using a template for each bandwidth i e 100 and 150 mm bands there were three replicates for each treatment trays were randomised on a plastic covered bench filled with 2 cm of water that allowed water to wick up through holes in the base of the trays over 28 h excess water was then drained from the bench when the soil reached field capacity 10 kpa trays were subsequently irrigated with a fine spray from above to uniformly wet the soil on two occasions when soil water potential reached 60 kpa to ensure germination and emergence of cotton and sorghum seedlings and to have uniform conditions in entire experiment irrigation was discontinued at this point as the aim of the experiment was to compare soil water loss from the different treatments trays were inspected daily for seedling and or weed emergence on termination of the experiment soil samples were taken from beneath the sbpm band and bare soil from both sides of the band for gravimetric analysis by oven drying at 105 c 2 5

effect on soil water status pots treated with sbpm reduced soil water loss compared to the control in both experiments bare soil treatment fig 2 weight measurements showed that pots treated with sbpm reduced average water loss ranging from 4 0 13 5 in experiment 1 fig 2a and 2 8 15 5 in experiment 2 fig 2b depending on the application rate generally the average water conservation trend between treatments was control 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 except during day five and eight of the second experiment in experiment 1 the water conserving capabilities of the sbpm was most effective on first four days sbpm treatments showed significant differences in water conservation less evaporation when compared to the control and to each other p 0 05 fig 2a however its effectiveness decreased with time as the soil became drier while sbpm application significantly reduced water loss p 0 05 applications at 1 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 did not affect water conserved after day 5 the same was observed when comparing applications at 0 25 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 after day 6 soil water dynamics based on the volumetric soil water content sensors also showed an identical trend for water conservation control 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 fig 2c however unlike the weight data sbpm only made a significant difference in soil water content at the highest rate applied 1 kg m 2 p 0 01 3 2 experiment 3 trays sbpm effect on soil water and thermal status soil beneath the sbpm retained more water gravimetric than bare soil in all treatments table 2 the least effective treatment was the highest spray rate 0 5 kg m 2 applied in a 150 mm band 6 28 table 2 however the differences between band widths were not significant the soil water content was averaged daily for each treatment and position beneath the sbpm mid position or strip of bare soil edge position the soil water content was higher under both sbpm bands 100 and 150 mm and at each application rate 0 25 0 5 kg m 2 compared with the control bare soil water potential shows large differences corresponding to placement positions in the trays e g mid position of sbpm band and edge position of bare soil in the tray fig 3 soil water potential under the two bands was higher wetter soil than that under the bare soil at each rate of sbpm application a similar result to the gravimetric measurement on completion of the experiment during the first three days of the experiment all trays were at field capacity 10 kpa and it was only after the soil began drying day 4 that differences between treatments became evident this was confirmed gravimetrically after seven days when the experiment was terminated fig 3 a time series plot of water potential indicate that the 100 mm bandwidth was more effective than 150 mm at retaining soil water during drying out periods fig 3 similar patterns are observed for water potential by spray rate this time showing the 0 5 kg m Â² rate to be more effective than 0 25 kg m Â² at retaining soil water the 150 mm band recorded the highest temperature with a maximum of 46 6 c 0 8 c higher than the bare soil control maximum fig 3 the wider band also recorded the lowest temperature by 0 1 c although there was little variation between treatments in minimum daily temperature fig 3 the higher application rate of sbpm 0 5 kg m 2 also had the highest maximum and lowest minimum temperature of all the treatments in addition soil temperature beneath the polymer band was slightly warmer on average compared to adjacent bare soil strips in all treatments 0 3 and 0 1 c for 100 150 mm bands it was noted that the glasshouse maximum and minimum temperatures were frequently higher that those outside fig 1a which possibly elevated the soil temperature as well 3 3 seedling emergence under sbpm seedling emergence was very low in all treatments with several pots having no seedling emerged fig 4 the control had the highest number of emerged seedlings 1 of 3 seeds sown regardless of species followed by pots with 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 and 1 kg m 2 of sbpm application fig 4a the only treatment that showed significant difference was emergence at applications of 1 kg m 2 which was 85 lower than the control p 0 05 weeds species unidentified were present in all treatments during both experiments fig 4b while we had not intended to examine weed dynamics under different sbpm rates the number of emerged weeds was recorded opportunistically showing a similar trend to that of crop seedling emergence weed numbers were highest in the control decreasing in the following order control 0 25 kg m 2 1 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 fig 4b statistically the control and pots with 0 25 kg m 2 of sbpm had a similar number of weeds which were significantly higher than pots with 0 5 kg m 2 and 1 kg m 2of sbpm applied p 0 05 emergence was highly variable between species and across treatments fig 5 a and b sbpm rates of 0 5 kg m 2 and 0 25 kg m 2 reduced the number of emerged cotton seedlings by 60 no cotton seedlings emerged at the highest sbpm rate 1 kg m 2 the same trend was observed for mung beans interestingly there were 33 more seedlings in pots with 0 5 kg m 2 of sbpm applied than the control though this was not statistically significant generally mung beans showed relatively good emergence success under the lower sbpm rates 0 5 kg m 2 and 0 25 kg m 2 as one to two seedlings emerged out of the three sown sorghum and rockmelon emerged in all treatments the highest number of sorghum seedlings occurred in the control two seedlings out of the three sown but declined with increasing sbpm application rates at 1 kg m 2 of sbpm only one in nine seeds successfully emerged similarly rock melon performed relatively well under all treatments though less so in pots with 1 kg m 2 of sbpm no sunflower seedlings except for one in a low sbpm rate pot 0 25 kg m 2 emerged throughout the experiment no carrot or capsicum seedlings emerged in the control or any of the sbpm treatments fig 5 the narrow band of polymer 100 mm had the lowest seedling emergence at 38 for both polymer application rates fig 6 a the lowest spray rate combined with the widest bandwidth was the only treatment exhibiting improved emergence by 24 compared with the bare soil control fig 5a despite observable differences between treatments there was no significant interaction where p 0 05 between species application rate or bandwidth for emergence the lower application rate resulted in seedling weed emergence fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 soil water and temperature mulching has been a long practiced method to improve crop productivity with soil water conservation as one of its most important advantages kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a polyurethane based sbpm in reducing soil water loss in a controlled glasshouse experiments interestingly in our experiments we did not observe water conservation of up to 28 and 60 found in field trials and controlled laboratory conditions respectively as reported previously by adhikari et al 2015a 2016 our highest rate of sbpm application 1 kg m 2 resulted in a saving of 13 5 15 5 compared with the control pots the differences may be due to the fact that this experiment was conducted in a glasshouse in contrast to a controlled laboratory environment which can lead to different environmental conditions with high average temperatures fig 1a furthermore the application rates were not specified in adhikari et al 2015a 2016 also the glasshouse experiment was subjected to a range of environmental factors including daily variations in solar radiation which can alter the ambient temperature of the glasshouse and lead to higher evaporative rates and greater soil water loss fig 2 the results also indicate the need to better understand the water transmissivity and porosity of the sbpm once it has adhered to the soil and dried previous studies using different sp sprayable polymer formulations have reported improvements in soil water conservation compared with a bare soil control yang et al 2004 adhikari et al 2015a but this was not always the case when evaluating the efficiency of different mulch types ramakrishna et al 2006 identified na 1 sp polymer unspecified as the least effective material in increasing soil temperature and soil water content statistically na 1 application had no effect on soil temperature or soil water a similar four year dryland experiment conducted in semi arid china also reported no significant changes in soil water content after the application of sp supplied by beijing jinshanghe bio tech co ltd beijing china polymer unspecified li et al 2012 2013 2016 in contrast these studies highlighted a significant benefit of using polyethylene pe and biodegradable films on soil temperature and crop yield while our experiments did not utilise the same formulation the lack of a mulching effect on soil evaporation in these previous experiments could also be explained through the different rates of sp applied the rates applied in presented experiments resulted in significant water conservation and were higher than the rates applied in ramakrishma et al 2006 1 kg ha 1 and li et al 2012 2013 2016 450 l ha 1 biochemical fulvic acid 1 5 product to water dilution experiments furthermore application rates of the same sp utilised by li et al 2012 achieved adequate soil water retention yang et al 2004 yield yang et al 2008 and weed control wang et al 2013 when applied at higher rates 112 250 kg ha 1 these observations regarding water retention in soil fit well with the trend observed in our experiments where higher rates of sbpm application increased soil water conservation measurements from the mps 2 sensors and of gravimetric soil water content for different treatments show that the soil below sbpm bands 100 and 150 mm retained more water compared to the bare soil control as expected there was no clear evidence on the application rate and spray rate the assumption was that a high spray rate would produce a more effective water retention barrier as the membrane is more continuous and less likely to have porosity allowing soil water to evaporate in experiments using a transparent spray mulch coating little cracks appeared on the soil surface in the first month after application but had no discernible effect on its mulching ability schettini et al 2007 cracks on the surface of the soil and polymer coating were evident in our experiment as a result of the high evaporative demand environment in the glasshouse the effects of cracks in the polymer membrane were not quantified in this study future research should focus towards refining the application methods to enhance tensile strength and consistency of the polymer membrane sartore et al 2018 reported that their biodegradable spray coatings showed that the mulching effect lasted for 2 months however cracks in the polymer were present at the soil surface the results shown in saglam et al 2017 that both biodegradable paper and biodegradable plastic mulches reduced evaporation by restricting water and vapor flow across the soil atmosphere interface and thereby conserved water in the root zone however the water conservation effect of biodegradable paper and biodegradable plastic mulch will depend on their degradation rates during the growing season the wider bandwidth sbpm generated higher average and maximum soil temperatures as it covered a larger surface area the dark colour of the polymer due to the addition of 2 carbon black as a pigment more efficiently absorbs and converts solar radiation to heat sartore et al 2018 immirzi et al 2009 tested different biodegradable spray coatings that showed a good capacity to reduce weed growth even with different par transmissivity coefficients similarly it is speculated that a thicker polymer coating increases absorption of incoming solar radiation the higher temperatures observed in soil beneath polymer bands especially daily maximums may have compromised germination and emergence in this glasshouse experiment due to extremely high outside temperatures 35 37 c in cooler climates or during winter for example the warming effect of the sbpm can be more beneficial studies have shown crop development can begin earlier in the season resulting in higher yields when soil temperatures are warmer and conducive to earlier and more successful crop establishment dong et al 2009 4 2 sbpm effect on seedling emergence increased soil temperature under sp and pe mulches has led to improved seed germination and better crop establishment schettini et al 2007 anzalone et al 2010 nevertheless there is a scarcity of information on seedling growth under applications of sbpm our results show that successful emergence decreased with increasing sbpm application rates although there was no significant difference between application rates of 0 25 kg m 2 and 0 5 kg m 2 emergence was 85 lower under the 1 kg m 2 application rate crops such as capsicum and carrot did not emerge at all in performed experiment other crops such as sorghum cotton and mung bean emerged in all treatments except that with 1 kg m 2 of sbpm applied the crops with small seeds size exhibited lower germination and emergence compared with the crops with larger seeds which was also observed by ambika et al 2014 also the measured maximum soil temperatures were considerably higher 35 40 c than the optimum for seedling germination and emergence for the period after seed placement fig 1a the main factor in performed experiments for limiting or promoting seedling emergence was the thickness of the applied sbpm and not the temperature in the method of sowing the seeds before sbpm application resulted in lack of slits and openings require seedlings to successfully penetrate the sbpm layer to fully emerge however it is possible that the tensile strength of the sbpm was too large for seedlings to overcome at higher application rates the sbpm will be thicker and more difficult to penetrate similar to the observations of chase et al 1998 using plastic mulch of varying thickness this was also supported by observations in which seedlings had successfully germinated but lifted the sbpm layer upwards instead of penetrating through it a similar phenomenon was described by warnick et al 2006 where weedy purple nutsedges cyperus rotundus were growing underneath the paper based liquid mulch which dried into a membrane lifting it by several centimetres off the soil surface the separation between the sbpm and soil surface should be minimised as much as possible because soil water evaporation will likely increase if the sbpm layer does not adhere to the soil surface and emerging shoots may bend thus losing ability to penetrate the sbpm adhikari et al 2019 assessed a range of polymer viscosity sbpm formulations in order to prevent wicking and poor membrane formulation the chosen viscosity modifiers have resulted in better mechanical integrity of the sbpm cover even at lower polymer application rates the lack of slits and openings may prevent sunlight from reaching seeds in the soil at higher application rates the greater thickness and better cover of the black coloured gelatine based sp on the soil surface reduced the amount of par penetrating the soil and triggered weed germination sartore et al 2013 while the aim of utilising carbon black in the sbpm formulation was to suppress weeds it can also have a similar inhibitory effect on crop seeds if planted before polymer application our results support this because both crops and weeds showed declining emergence with increasing rates of sbpm application while the exact par transmissivity coefficient of the sbpm is not yet known immirzi et al 2009 and sartore et al 2013 found that their alginate and gelatine based sp formulations allowed a greater proportion of par to penetrate through than the recommended quality necessary for weed suppression in plastic films 0 01 regardless they demonstrated that sp was effective in weed control though its effect on crop emergence was not specified in slotted plastic mulch films this presents less of an issue as slits and holes enable par to penetrate the soils at the locations where crop seedlings seeds have been sown and weeds will also be able to emerge 4 3 emergence of seedlings crop and weeds and band width generally the sbpm reduced seedling emergence compared to the bare control this may be attributed to the physical properties of the sprayable polymer coatings as suspended particles tend to spread on the soil surface and make a tight seal malinconico et al 2008 adhikari et al 2016 the only treatment with a rate of emergence higher than the bare soil control was a combination of the wide bandwidth 150 mm and low spray rate 0 25 kg m 2 this result may signify the potential benefit of a larger spray area in increasing soil temperature under the black coating promoting germination and emergence the reason why the lower spray rate was more effective at the 150 mm bandwidth may also be related to the thickness of the polymer membrane as it would be more likely for a seedling to penetrate a thinner weaker polymer coating one solution would be to plant seeds and apply sbpm at the same time either side of the plant line or to apply the sbpm ahead of the planter where the seed seedling is placed in a hole slot formed in the sbpm unsterilized soil used to fill trays was a repository for weed seeds that were triggered to germinate following wetting resulting in high occurrence of spontaneous weeds most weeds emerged from the bare soil compared to the sbpm band results from this experiment demonstrated that trays with 150 mm polymer bands had a lower occurrence of weeds than those with 100 mm bands the en 13655 2002 standard for weed suppression by black ldpe mulching films is 0 01 total transmissivity in the par range another biodegradable spray coating mixed with carbon black and glycerol tested by malinconico et al 2008 exhibited the lowest total transmissivity of biodegradable mulches involved in the experiment at 0 1 though still well above the 0 01 threshold par was unable to be measured in these experiments further the only treatments exhibiting fewer weeds than the bare soil control were those with sbpm applied in a 150 mm band at an application rate of 0 25 kg m 2 this can be a consequence of lower soil water content exhibited at this rate with less water available for weeds to germinate the results may also be partially explained in the difficulty of applying the sbpm evenly and completely across the soil surface owing to its heterogeneous particle sizes the addition of carbon black in the emulsion has contributed to inconsistent thickness of the sbpm 5 conclusions the results of controlled glasshouse experiments indicate that the higher the rate of sbpm application the greater the amount of soil water conserved ideally application at a rate of 1 kg m 2 would be recommended due to the high levels of water conservation observed however the application of sbpm at this rate resulted in low seedling emergence our findings suggest there is a trade off between water conservation and successful crop emergence if sbpm is applied after the seeds have been planted all three sbpm application rates 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 showed increased soil water content compared to the control plot the sbpm applied in bands 100 and 150 mm width limited evaporation and increased soil water potential and temperature compared to the control with no significant differences between the two bandwidths crop emergence was proportional to the application rate i e it decreased with increasing spray rate while only the application of 1 kg m 2 showed significant decrease the sbpm also limited the weed growth similar to conventional plastic mulch films a wide bandwidth 150 mm and low spray rate 0 25 kg m 2 resulted in the highest seedling emergence through the sbpm while suppressing more weeds than the bare soil control the application of sbpm is just as important as its formulation in terms of efficiency affordability and viability in commercial agricultural practice the results of these experiments are promising demonstrating the ability of the sbpm to reduce soil evaporation the findings also highlight the need for scaled up field trials focusing on the sbpm properties application and field management acknowledgments a zaja

include not only satellite and aerial sensors but also ground sensors hand held or tractor mounted mulla 2013 the alternative of using field spectroradiometers on individual plants to mimic aerial evaluations is still limited by the cost of the equipment and rates of throughput in that sense the use of conventional rgb from red green blue images may allow formulation of a wide range of vegetation indices based on the color properties of the images casadesÃºs et al 2007 this is a very affordable technique because the processing software needed is open access more importantly the indices derived from rgb images may have a similar or even better performance than the multispectral derived indices when assessing the effect of growing conditions and genotypic variability of different crop species vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 gracia romero et al 2017 2018 kefauver et al 2017 however the use of this remote sensing approach on single trees has scarcely been tested and to the best of our understanding has not yet been applied to date palms a decrease in stomatal conductance as water salinity increases has been reported in date palm sperling et al 2014a for that reason the use of aerial thermal images has been proposed as a methodology to assess irrigation and water status of date palm trees cohen et al 2012 however the relatively low resolution of thermal images compared to multispectral cameras makes it even less feasible to use this technology from satellites or aerial platforms and then extrapolate this type of information to the single tree level for this reason the evaluation of canopy temperature at the individual tree level may become an alternative particularly if infrared thermometers are used given their very low cost compared to thermal cameras even if the cost of the latter has decreased significantly in recent years in that sense measuring canopy temperature at ground level using infrared thermometers to monitor water status and the effect of salinity has been proposed for decades although the focus has been on herbaceous crops howell et al 1984 kluitenberg and biggar 1992 however in the case of tree orchards the density of the plantings may affect the temperature readings for example by inter shading belsky et al 1993 an additional limitation of this approach particularly when the aim of phenotyping is to evaluate a large number of plants is the potential disturbing effect of daily variations in environmental conditions nevertheless analyzing the stable carbon isotope signature in plant dry matter may provide a time integrated indicator of plant performance in terms of water stress and stomatal conductance farquhar and richards 1984 farquhar et al 1989 conditions that induce stomatal closure such as water deficit or salinity restrict the co2 supply to carboxylation sites which then increases the Î´13c or decreases the carbon isotope discrimination Î´13c of plant matter farquhar et al 1989 thus increases in Î´13c or decreases in Î´13c in response to salinity have been observed not only in herbaceous crops arslan et al 1999 yousfi et al 2009 2010 2012 but also in woody plants including different tree species li and sternberg 1992 poss et al 2000 hokmabadi et al 2005 moreover the stable carbon isotope signature has also been applied as a phenotyping technique to look for genotypic variability in water use efficiency in trees gonzÃ¡lez martÃ­nez et al 2008 in addition the environmental conditions prevailing in arabian deserts where precipitation is minimal and evapotranspiration very high makes it feasible to set constant cultivation conditions i e reproducible across years providing that irrigation is available and is kept constant in other words a single sample i e from one year may reflect the long term growing conditions moreover assimilates that contribute to the development of date palm leaves are accumulated during the previous season in the trunk chao et al 2007 cohen et al 2013 therefore the temporal time span representativeness of the stable isotope analysis of a leaf in date palm is larger than expected for a similar analysis in a leaf from an annual crop species the stable nitrogen isotope composition Î´15n in its natural abundance has been used less frequently than Î´13c for crop monitoring of nitrogen sources and phenotyping genotypic variability in nitrogen metabolism due to a number of factors including fractionation processes that are not understood sufficiently handley and raven 1992 however salinity and water stress besides inducing stomatal closure and therefore increasing Î´13c also affect processes related to n uptake assimilation release and internal recycling consequently affecting Î´15n in plants see yousfi et al 2012 and references herein including tree species cernusak et al 2009 it has been proposed that variability in the Î´15n of plants might originate from changes in stomatal conductance which in turn modify the rubisco catalyzed oxygenation rate tcherkez and hodges 2008 tcherkez 2010 therefore and given a uniform nitrogen source the Î´15n and total nitrogen concentration in plant matter gives an insight into the effect of salinity and genotype on the nitrogen metabolism of the plant it has been reported for herbaceous plants like barley handley et al 1997 and wheat yousfi et al 2009 that salinity decreases the Î´15n and nitrogen concentration in tissues indeed in the case of wheat a positive relationship of Î´15n and nitrogen concentration with biomass yield has been reported yousfi et al 2009 2012 to the best of our knowledge no studies on the effect of salinity and even of water stress in the Î´13c and Î´15n of date palm have been published and therefore the potential application of these isotopes to assess plant growth yield and genotypic variability remains to be confirmed the main objective of this study was to investigate what kind of indicators may be used at the single tree level to assess the performance in terms of biomass and fruit yield of date palms under salinity with regard to the remote sensing approaches emphasis is given to low cost easy to handle approaches including rgb vegetation indices and canopy temperature measured with an infrared thermometer in addition Î´13c and Î´15n together with the total n concentration were measured in different plant tissues a set of 16 varieties from the arabian peninsula representing the diversity of economically important varieties in the region and with different growth and productivity potentials were tested under three different levels of salinity the trial is a long term field experiment of the international center for biosaline agriculture icba located in the united arab emirates uae the secondary objective was to develop single physiological models based on the above indicators to help define the ideotype characteristics that contribute to genotypic performance of date palm under salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the study was performed in a long term date palm phoenix dactylifera l trial established on nearly 2 5 ha at the experimental station 25 13 n and 55 17 e of the icba dubai uae the experimental station is located in an arid desert climate total annual precipitation is below 60 mm while the annual eto is higher than 1900 mm where temperatures are high and rainfall is negligible from april to november karim and dakheel 2006 supplemental fig s1 the soil is fine sand in texture non saline moderately alkaline and strongly calcareous carbonatic hyperthermic typic torripsamment organic matter is very low 0 5 and the munsell soil colour dry gretagmacbeth 2000 is 10yr 6 4 pale brown which is a composite reflection from the dominance of carbonates and sand with insignificant contribution of organic matter to the color composition more details about soil characteristics of the icba can be found in shahid et al 2009 during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons uniform seedlings of 18 date palm varieties were planted the set of date palms tested includes varieties from the uae and from the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa prior to planting the site was harrowed to ensure an even seedbed each variety was planted in a row and includes 15 individual plants that are separated into three sub plots of five plants for each of the 3 salinity treatments each plant represents one replication with 5 replicates per variety per treatment plants within the sub plots of five replicates are separated by 8 m and a gap of 20 m containing olive trees exists between each sub plot of five plants see the field layout in fig 1 once the trial was established organic composted manure was applied at the rate of 20 kg per tree per year during the last two weeks of october and npk fertilizer was applied annually during early october and december according to the normal agronomical practice in the uae the trees of each variety were hand pollinated from high quality male trees pollination extended from early february to late march and the harvest occurred generally during the summer season july september depending on the maturity of the individual variety the agronomical measurements were made on all the trees per treatment and averaged two of the original varieties were not included in the study because several of the trees died in the years prior to the study the name and provenance of the remaining 16 varieties are detailed in table 1 three saline irrigation treatments of 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 were established and were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 5 replicates per treatment mentioned above the three salinity levels were selected to represent conditions that lead to substantial yield reduction and to include the 50 yield reduction thresholds which have been reported as being around 17 ds m 1 maas and hoffman 1977 the 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 irrigation salinities were accomplished by mixing highly saline groundwater with ecw up to 25 ds m 1 sar 26 mmol l with na and cl concentrations higher than 190 meq l 1 and ph 7 6 with low salinity municipal water of less than 2 ds m 1 which was the water with the lowest salinity available sar 4 mmol l 1 with na and cl concentrations lower than 11 meq l 1 and ph 8 5 the three salinity levels were maintained constantly throughout the cropping season and during all the years of growth each salinity level was monitored twice a week using a portable ec meter tetracon 325 cond 197i wtw brand xylem analytics rye brook new york usa irrigation was applied at rates equivalent to et0 plus 50 for leaching requirements trees were irrigated using a drip system twice a day for 20 min each during the low demand periods and 3 times a day under the high water demand of summer according to the targeted amounts of irrigation described above a recent study on the same date palm trial concluded that there was no trend in salt build up and the use of irrigation at 1 5 etc represented a sustainable rate of irrigation with regard to effective leaching of salts following daily root water uptake by date palm al muaini et al 2019 the following growth parameters were recorded prior sampling for each individual tree plant trunk height cm diameter cm and number of branches per plant in addition total fruit yield per tree kg at maturity from the last harvest was measured 2 2 ground remote sensing evaluation vegetation indices vi derived from red green blue rgb images were evaluated at the single tree level field evaluation was performed during late january 2017 pictures were taken under natural light conditions of sunny days around noon having the sun at the back for each tree an rgb picture was taken at approximately 6 m from the trunk tree with an olympus e m10 16 megapixel resolution camera with a 17 3 13 0 mm sensor using a 14 mm lens triggered at a speed of 1 400 s with the aperture programmed in automatic mode and native resolution of 4608 3072 pixels images were stored in jpg format using the srgb color standard images were acquired from the ground holding the camera by hand images were trimmed to 1364 908 pixels as a way to discard the background mostly sky other than the palm tree leaves using the crop function and a recursive algorithm implemented in imagej schneider et al 2012 in addition to ensure that the effect of background was negligible the images were also trimmed to 1000 1000 pixels manually subsequently images were analysed with the open source breedpix software casadesÃºs et al 2007 vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 through its most recent version cimmyt maize scanner v1 15 https integrativecropecophysiology com software development maizescanner developed by our team gracia romero et al 2017 this software enables calculation of several rgb vegetation indices based on the different properties of color inherent in rgb images rgb vis were obtained either from the average color of the whole image or from the histogram in each image breedpix converts the original rgb image to other color spaces i e each model which numerically represents the color in terms of new color space coordinates thus the indices calculated from breedpix were intensity hue saturation lightness a b u v the relative green area ga and the relative greener area gga casadesus et al 2007 on the one hand for the indices from hue to v the software obtains the average values of each color space coordinate and on the other hand for the ga and gga indices the software obtains the green and greener canopy cover area for each one of the processed images except for ga and gga all these vis belong to cie from the french abbreviation of the international commission on illumination color spaces the software requires the use of java advanced imaging jai for the conversion of rgb color space to cie xyz color space and the resulting coordinates are subsequently converted to other color spaces like ihs from intensity hue and saturation intensity is a measure of brightness and represents the amount of white light reflected hue refers to the color itself and represents the average wavelength of the color spectrum and saturation defines the color purity from white to its primary color thus the saturation of a color is determined by a combination of light intensity and the spectral distribution of the wavelengths that makes up the color purity considering that the light intensity is similar for all the images a decrease in saturation is only the result of the presence of different wavelengths hue describes the color itself in the form of an angle between 0 and 360 where 0 means red 60 means yellow 120 means green and 180 means cyan derived from hue the green area ga index is defined as the percentage of pixels with colors from yellow to blue hue range from 60 to 180 that is the proportion of yellow to blueish green pixels in the image the greener area gga is a more restrictive index in terms of only retaining green pixels hue range from 80 to 180 while excluding yellowish green tones and therefore it more accurately describes the photosynthetically active biomass and leaf greenness fig 2 the vis a and b belong to the cielab cooler space with l being the lightness dimension and a and b the color opponent coordinates red green opponent colors are represented along the a axis whereas the b axis represents the yellow blue opponent colors therefore in the cielab model the b component defines the blue to yellow range where more positive values are closer to a pure yellow and more negative ones are closer to pure blue while the a component represents the green to red range with a more positive value representing a purer red and a more negative value indicating a greener color similarly the u and v indices represent the axis in the chromaticity diagram of cie luv color space thus in the cieluv model the color space is represented as a three coordinate system l u and v with l being the lightness dimension and u and v the chromaticity diagram the components of cielab and cieluv color spaces are calculated as described in trussell et al 2005 the hue component is calculated using the jai functions which employ the formulae described in seul et al 2000 finally the ga and gga are based on the sum of frequencies of the histogram classes included in a certain range of hue in the image casadesus et al 2007 the equations from which the different rgb vegetation indices used here derive are included as supplemental information supplemental table 1 in the present study only the values of the rgb indices calculated from the images trimmed with the standard procedure are shown as this represents the easiest to handle format for use by farmers the canopy temperature ct of each single tree was measured at noon 12 14 h on the same day as for the rgb images using an infrared thermometer phototemptmmxstmtd raytek santa cruz california usa measurements were taken from the same position as the rgb images holding the sensor by hand 2 3 nitrogen concentration and stable isotope analyses two leaflets from the central part of a young previous year fully expanded leaf referred to in the manuscript as a branch were sampled from 3 of the 5 trees per variety and treatment after sampling leaves were washed with tap and distilled water dried and finely ground at the same time the seed stones of the last two years of three varieties shahlah lulu and khalas which exhibit contrasting performance under salinity were dried and then finely ground then the total nitrogen concentration and the stable carbon 13c 12c ratio and nitrogen 15n 14n ratio isotope signatures of these samples were analyzed at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona samples of 1 mg were weighed into tin capsules and analyses were performed using an elemental analyser flash 1112 ea thermofinnigan san jose california usa coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta c irms thermofinnigan operating in continuous flow mode the 13c 12c ratios r of plant material were expressed in Î´ notation coplen 2008 as carbon isotope composition Î´13c Î´ 13 c r s a m p l e r s t a n d

foil iaea ch6 sucrose usgs 40 l glutamic acid were used with an analytical precision of 0 1 the same Î´ notation was used for the 15n 14n ratio expression but with the standard referring to n2 in air for nitrogen international isotope secondary standards iaea n1 iaean2 iaeano3 and usgs40 were used with a precision of 0 3 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to factorial anova to test the effects of salinity genotype and their interaction mean comparisons were performed using tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test a bivariate correlation procedure was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficients between the date palm growth traits and fruit yield on the one hand and the rgb vegetation indices together with Î´13c ct Î´15n and the total nitrogen concentration n on the other multiple linear regression analysis stepwise was used to analyze the criterion included to explain variation in fruit yield under different growing conditions data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistics 24 package spss inc chicago il usa figures were created using the sigma plot 11 0 program for windows systat software inc point richmond ca usa finally we performed path analyses li 1975 aimed at understanding genotypic differences in fruit yield and biomass under different levels of salinity 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 this methodology offers the possibility of building associations between variables on prior knowledge the objective was to discern the potential mechanisms that contribute to fruit yield and biomass variation across genotypes while identifying the traits that may inform about such mechanisms specifically these conceptual models were designed to assess the relative contributions of direct and indirect effects of water status through ct Î´13c nitrogen metabolism through n concentration and Î´15n and the degree of leaf greenness through the rgb index ga on fruit yield and biomass specifically number of branches a model with a comparative fit index cfi arbuckle 2012 with values 0 9 was taken as indicative of a good fit data were analysed using the amos graphics package spss 3 results 3 1 effect of salinity on plant biomass productivity remote sensing and stable isotope indices an increase in the salinity level of the irrigation water significantly decreased trunk height and diameter as well as the total number of branches and the date fruit yield table 2 the genotypic effect was also significant for yield see also supplemental fig s1 and for the three biomass traits the genotype by treatment the salinity of the irrigation water interaction gxs was only significant for trunk height increasing salinity of the irrigation water also affected the water status indices with both carbon isotope composition Î´13c of the leaflets and canopy temperature ct increasing as salinity increased table 3 the vegetation indices derived from rgb images were also significantly affected by the salinity except for hue which decreased and intensity which did not follow a clear pattern all the other traits saturation lightness a b v u ga and gga increased in response to a higher salinity in the irrigation water table 3 concerning the nitrogen indices the nitrogen isotope composition Î´15n was higher under the mid range medium salinity compared to the other two levels while the total nitrogen concentration increased from the lowest to the medium salinity and did not change at the highest level genotypic effects were significant for all the traits in table 3 except intensity see also supplemental fig s2 for the genotypic values of date yield and the water status traits while the gxs interaction was significant for all the traits except Î´13c hue ga and gga an increase in salinity also affected Î´13c which increased and Î´15n which decreased in the date seeds stones while the total nitrogen concentration of the stones was unaffected supplemental table s1 on the other hand Î´13c values were higher and Î´15n and n lower in the stones compared to the leaves 3 2 correlation of remote sensing and stable isotope indices against biomass and fruit yield the relationships of the three biomass traits trunk height and diameter and total number of branches and the date yield per palm with the different rgb indices were investigated to that end the genotypic values of the set of varieties across the three levels of saline irrigation were combined fig 3 hue correlated positively p 0 01 with the biomass traits and date yield while saturation b u and v correlated negatively p 0 01 with the four traits biomass traits correlated better than date yield with these rgb indices the a and ga indexes only correlated negatively p 0 05 with trunk height while lightness correlated negatively with trunk height and the number of branches intensity also correlated negatively with the number of branches and there was no correlation between gga and any of the four traits considered supplemental table s2 carbon isotope composition and canopy temperature correlated negatively with the three biomass traits p 0 01 and date yield p 0 05 the number of branches and trunk height had the best correlation with Î´13c while trunk diameter and trunk height were best correlated with ct fig 4 by contrast no correlation existed between the total n concentration and Î´15n with date yield or any of the biomass parameters across growing conditions data not shown phenotypic correlations i e across the set of varieties studied within a given irrigation condition between the different remote sensing traits and the stable isotope signatures with date yield and biomass were also studied trunk height was only correlated negatively with b r 0 46 p 0 05 and v r 51 p 0 01 at the highest salinity level and with ga r 58 p 0 01 and gga r 61 p 0 01 at the lowest salinity level trunk diameter only correlated positively with gga r 0 47 p 0 05 at the lowest salinity level whereas the number of branches and date yield did not correlate with any of the rgb indices data not shown concerning leaf Î´13c it correlated negatively with the number of branches at medium salinity r 51 p 0 01 while at the other two salinity levels the relationships did not reach the significance p 0 05 threshold moreover no correlations of leaf Î´13c with fruit yield and any of the other biomass parameters were recorded data not shown finally no correlations existed between leaf Î´15n and leaf n concentration with any of the biomass traits however leaf Î´15n correlated positively with date yield at the highest salinity while total n concentration also correlated positively with date yield but at the lowest and highest salinity levels fig 5 3 3 genotypic response model a conceptual model based on a path analysis was proposed displaying the genotypic responses within a given growing condition in fruit yield fig 6 a and number of branches per tree fig 6b explained in terms of water status Î´13c ct nitrogen metabolism n Î´15n and actual greenness of leaves ga the six path models provided an acceptable fit to the data comparative fit index cfi 0 9 and p 0 05 as the objective here is to develop models that fit the data well under the lowest salinity level genotypic differences in fruit yield were associated with direct effects of nitrogen metabolism n and Î´15n and water status Î´13c fig 6c while differences in the number of branches were basically associated with the water status Î´13c fig 6d under medium salinity genotypic differences in fruit yield were mostly associated with a direct effect of leaf greenness ga together with an indirect i e through ga effect of water status ct fig 6e while differences in the number of branches were associated with an effect of photosynthetic area ga moreover water status had not only a direct effect through ct and Î´13c on the number of branches but ct also had an indirect effect through ga fig 6f at the highest salinity level genotypic differences in fruit yield were associated with direct effects of nitrogen metabolism n and Î´15n and actual leaf photosynthetic status ga together with an indirect effect of water status ct on ga fig 6g while variability in the number of branches was associated with a direct effect of nitrogen metabolism Î´15n and water status Î´13c fig 6h moreover water status ct also had a rather indirect effect through ga and nitrogen metabolism traits 4 discussion date palms are very salt tolerant and can tolerate high water salinity levels of up to 34 0 ds m 1 even when the excessive salinity reduces growth and will result in fruits of low quality zohary and hopf 2000 chao and krueger 2007 irrigation with saline water even in the sandy soil conditions of our experiment which prevent salt accumulation had a significant effect on the different growth traits and fruit yield nevertheless after 15 years of imposing irrigation with different salinity levels the effects were rather moderate thus moving from the lowest 5 ds m 1 to the highest 15 ds m 1 salinity level only decreased trunk height and diameter by 38 and 13 respectively while the number of branches decreased by 28 and fruit yield by 44 in addition salinity during irrigation significantly affected all the remote sensing and analytical traits evaluated in our study on the other hand in agreement with previous results we found genotypic variability in growth parameters such as plant height collar girth and production of leaves kurup et al 2009 moreover apart from intensity all the other tested traits remote sensing and analytical exhibited genotypic differences remote sensing evaluation of date palm performance under salinity has been quite extensively investigated but mostly from satellite and aerial platforms however the results are not always encouraging given different factors such as a lack of resolution or atmospheric interference for example ndvi assessed from satellite has been poorly correlated with salinity performance of date palm aldakheel 2011 for this reason proximal i e at ground level remote sensing of individual trees may represent an alternative in terms of resolution and may be amenable for both irrigation management and phenotyping this study compared different remote sensing approaches for screening date palm performance under salinity at the single tree level with emphasis on low cost solutions 4 1 monitoring the effect of salinity canopy leaf color and rgb indices three different models hue cielab and cieluv detailed in the materials and methods were used to represent the color space and derive the corresponding rgb indices hue strongly decreased in response to increasing salinity and it was positively correlated with biomass and fruit yield for a number of different species including woody plants and combining leaves at varying stages of greenness it has been reported that hue was significantly linearly correlated with chlorophyll content majer et al 2010 junker and ensminger 2016 however in our study hue is probably indicating the total amount of green biomass of the tree canopy rather than the degree of greenness of individual leaves in fact calculation of hue only accounts for the green pixels without taking into consideration the background in agreement with this the correlation of hue against biomass and yield did not change substantially when background was removed manually from the images suggesting that background did not affect the response of hue data not shown in accordance with an effect of salinity decreasing chlorophyll content at the whole canopy tree b strongly increased as salinity in the irrigation water increased indicating that salinity is increasing the proportion of dry yellow leaflets in the tree canopy consequently b correlated negatively across salinities with biomass and fruit yield nevertheless changes in pigments other than chlorophyll may also affect b in general the level of carotenoids increases under salinity borghesi et al 2011 which may increase the yellow appearance of the leaf moreover the negative correlation of b with biomass and fruit yield also suggests that more blueish cyan leaves is a positive trait in support of that v and u were also negatively correlated with biomass and fruit yield also indicating that leaves with more cyan i e greenish blue color are indicative of better plant performance cyan is a greenish blue color with predominant wavelengths between 490 520 nm it is also defined as a light blue or saturated blue color the visible spectrum starts with blue at the bottom of the space moving through green in the upper left and to red in the upper right in fact v was the rgb vegetation index best correlated with date yield and all the biomass traits on the other hand saturation was also negatively correlated with biomass and fruit yield saturation here is an indicator of the purity of the color therefore the best performing trees were those exhibiting a combination of cyan toned leaves together with other complementary colors rather than having a single color as in the case of hue to discard the effect of background white sandy soil or blue sky in this case on the values of these indices background was removed manually and values recalculated the strength of the relationships of b v u and saturation against biomass and fruit yield did not change significantly with regard to the initial images where background was not removed data not shown the more blueish appearance of the leaves of the better performing palms may have different explanations anthocyanin is a flavonoid whose accumulation in plants exposed to salt stress has been documented extensively gupta and huang 2014 accumulation of anthocyanins and carotenoids is a widely reported response to drought and other abiotic stress because it may palliate the negative environmental effects on photosynthesis of excess visible radiation occurring concurrently with an abiotic stress chalker scott 1999 while contributing towards salt detoxification chutipaijit et al 2011 chunthaburee et al 2016 in fact accumulation of soluble phenolics anthocyanins and flavones following exposure to salinity has been associated with increased salt tolerance in sugarcane wahid and ghazanfar 2006 thus the presence within the epidermis of uv b absorbing pigments primarily flavonoids provides a major protective barrier to photoxidation damage liakoura et al 2001 however these pigments have a minimal absorption of photosynthetic active radiation therefore it is not expected that flavonoids will strongly affect leaf color in palm leaves despite this species being characterized by a double layer of epidermal cells with an upper epidermis plus a hypodermis doaigey et al 2013 moreover even though purple leaf color has been reported in rice as a response to accumulation of anthocyanin triggered by salinity chunthaburee et al 2016 the amount accumulated in non herbaceous species is probably not enough to markedly affect the color of the leaves in date palm other factors that may affect the leaf color are at the leaf surface including the cuticular waxes and the presence of trichomes however date palm is characterized by glabrous leaves and trichomes are scarce khelil et al 2016 alternatively the pale grey or blueish green appearance of the leaves is probably related to the glaucous or waxy nature of the leaf surfaces which in date palm seems to be related to the presence of epicuticular waxes khelil et al 2016 in fact the accessions evaluated in this study possess glaucous leaves khelil et al 2016 al dakheel personal communication which aligns with the very xeric conditions of the desert together with high temperatures and intense light and uv radiation shepherd and griffiths 2006 in date palm the majority of the waxes constituting the epicuticle are polygonal rodlets that form rings around the stomata corresponding to the strelitzia type in the absence of a waxy surface date palm leaves exhibit yellowish to dark green leaves which is also a characteristic related to variety ribera et al 2006 however the effects of intense erosion of surface waxes are usually observed on the oldest leaves khelil et al 2016 therefore the leaf color may be influenced by the degree of erosion of epicuticular waxes which may reflect leaf age in other words better growing conditions increase the rate of appearance of new leaves therefore increasing the overall degree of glaucousness the increases in ga and a in response to salinity seem at first surprising nevertheless the leaf nitrogen concentration showed a similar pattern of increase as irrigation salinity increased ga and even a have been reported to be reliable estimators of the nitrogen concentration at canopy and leaf levels vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 gracia romero et al 2017 kefauver et al 2017 however in the present study ga and a were not the rgb indices that best correlated with biomass and fruit yield across salinity levels accordingly the leaf n concentration also did not correlate with biomass traits or fruit yield which agrees with previous studies chao and krueger 2007 moreover gga which is an indicator of leaf greenness did not decrease as salinity increased and lacked any correlation with biomass and fruit yield the lack of change in the ga and gaa indices may be explained at least in part because their formulation unlike the other rgb indices discussed above ga and gga are formulated as ratios of green pixels relative to the entire set of pixels present in the image therefore this includes the background the negative effect of salinity in the content of photosynthetic pigments such as leaf chlorophyll has been widely reported in plants romero et al 1997 including date palm al abdoulhadi et al 2012 however the effect of salinity on the anatomy of the new developed leaves e g increasing in leaf succulence may offset an eventual decrease in chlorophyll concentration as a consequence frequently chlorophyll content is not a good indicator of performance to salinity yousfi et al 2009 2010 in the case of woody species with long lived leaves the effect of salinity on chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration may be even more complex 4 2 monitoring the effect of salinity water status it is well known that the first effect of salinity is to induce water stress through a subsequent decrease in stomatal conductance munns and tester 2008 raising the salinity of the irrigation water increased the carbon isotope composition Î´13c in the palm leaflets which regardless of the growing conditions exhibited values typical of c3 species the effect of salinity on the Î´13c of the plant has been reported in different species e g isla et al 1998 yousfi et al 2009 2010 2013 as in the case of water stress farquhar and richards 1984 the increase in Î´13c is mediated through stomatal closure and a subsequent decrease in the intercellular versus the atmospheric co2 concentration ratio farquhar et al 1982 1989 as a consequence Î´13c correlated negatively with biomass traits and fruit yield across genotypes and growing conditions even though this effect of salinity has been reported mostly in herbaceous plants it also applies to other c3 species such as trees lin and sternberg 1992 poss et al 2000 hokmabadi et al 2005 the present study does not support the analysis of Î´13c in the stones to assess growing conditions because differences in Î´13c between extreme irrigation salinities were much smaller in stones compared to leaflets this may be the consequence of different patterns of carbon allocation and isotopic fractionation between leaves and seeds brugnoli and lauteri 1991 a linear decrease has been reported in date palm for both yield and transpiration under increased soil salinity tripler et al 2007 canopy temperature is a well established proxy for transpiration which is mediated by stomatal conductance along with the atmospheric vapor demand thus the cooler the canopy the more the plant transpires this technique has long been used to monitor water status blum 2011 and references herein including the effects of irrigation with saline water howell et al 1984 kluitenberg and biggar 1992 thermal imaging from aerial platforms has been deployed previously for scheduling irrigation in date palms cohen et al 2012 in the current work canopy temperature increased in response to irrigation with saline water as a consequence ct was negatively correlated with biomass and fruit yield to summarize the negative correlations of Î´13c and ct with biomass and fruit yield indicate that plants that maintain a better water status in terms of stomatal aperture i e more negative Î´13c and subsequent higher transpiration cooler canopies are those that exhibit greater growth and productivity however Î´13c correlated in a consistently stronger manner than ct with biomass characteristics the methodological limitations of measuring the canopy temperature of each palm tree individually rather than simultaneously e g from an aerial platform is a factor to consider araus and cairns 2014 however except for predicting numbers of branches the rgb indices performed even better than Î´13c at predicting biomass trunk height and diameter and fruit yield across salinities and genotypes even so the combination of both categories rgb indices plus Î´13c through a multilinear approach clearly improved the capacity to predict biomass but not fruit yield with determination coefficients above 0 50 data not shown the different nature of the combined traits reporting water status in the case of Î´13c and canopy characteristics with the rgb indices may contribute to their complementarity in explaining biomass 4 3 assessing genotyping variability munns and james 2003 suggested that screening for high stomatal conductance might be the most effective way to assess the effect of salinity and select genotypes that will perform better under such stress conditions however the modest performance of Î´13c as a phenotypic trait for salinity has been reported before in durum wheat yousfi et al 2009 2013 in the case of pistachio trees carbon isotope composition or discrimination was a useful indicator of cumulative salinity history but was not a suitable indicator for pre screening of pistachio rootstocks for salinity resistance hokmabadi et al 2005 the effect of salinity on nitrogen metabolism appears to play a role in the genotypic differences in tolerance to salinity the natural variation in the plant n isotope signature again commonly expressed as the composition Î´15n has been proposed for genotypic screening for salinity handley et al 1997 yousfi et al 2009 2010 because it is linked to n metabolism yousfi et al 2012 but to date only herbaceous crops wheat and barley have been evaluated in an experiment with beech seedlings Î´13c values were affected more by the actual environmental conditions of the study variations in drought in this case whereas Î´15n values were affected more by the genetic factor provenance peuke et al 2006 moreover the most drought tolerant provenances had the highest Î´15n the differences in Î´15n between tolerant and susceptible genotypes suggest that genotypic tolerance to salinity is mediated via greater n uptake and or assimilation handley et al 1997 ellis et al 2002 yousfi et al 2012 2013 as in herbaceous plants yousfi et al 2012 2013 the limited results reported from tree species mangrove in this case mckee et al 2002 suggest that the slower growth and lower n demand associated with any stress results in lower Î´15n values in our results the positive relationships across genotypes of n concentration and Î´15n with fruit yield at the highest salinity level support the positive link between Î´15n and n accumulation nevertheless most of the available literature on date palm indicates that while there are no consistent correlations of leaf n levels with yield this probably depends upon cultivar chao and krueger 2007 ezz et al 2010 in fact date palm is characterized by low n concentrations compared to other perennial crops chao and krueger 2007 therefore cultivar related differences in n availability may play a clear role in date yield a positive effect of a high leaf n concentration on fruit yield may be mediated through extended fruit development and increased fruit capacity saenz et al 1997 such differences may be more or less constitutive or the consequence of salinity conditions in the current results both the leaf n concentration and Î´15n exhibited strongly significant genotype by irrigation interactions rgb indices failed to correlate with fruit yield across genotypes within a given salinity level they only tracked differences in biomass particularly trunk height in the two extreme salinities tested at the highest salinity v was the rgb index with the best correlation interestingly v was also the best index negatively correlated across salinities and genotypes combined the blueish appearance of the leaves seems to be a positive genotypic trait at the highest salinity level in the case of the lowest salinity ga and gga were negatively correlated across genotypes with trunk height although the pattern of these relationships is at first surprising suggesting that genotypes with greener leaves have less trunk biomass it is in line with the decrease we found in ga and gga as irrigation salinity increased even though most of the traits evaluated failed to show a direct relationship with genotypic variability in biomass and fruit yield within a given salinity level they may still be useful to develop conceptual models aimed at explaining the combination of physiological traits associated with genotypic tolerance to salinity the statistical approach assayed was a path analysis which has already been tested in durum wheat under different salinity levels yousfi et al 2012 in terms of biomass and irrespective of the salinity level a lower more negative Î´13c was directly associated with a higher biomass at the three salinity levels this means that the maintenance of a higher stomatal conductance is a positive genotypic trait in terms of photosynthesis and growth isla et al 1998 munns and james 2003 munns and tester 2008 yousfi et al 2009 the maintenance of greener leaves higher ga also seems to have had a positive effect on palm growth even if that only occurred at the intermediate salinity assayed in this study a higher ga not only reflects higher leaf chlorophyll content but also larger leaf n content vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 kefauver et al 2017 the importance of nitrogen metabolism was reinforced at the highest salinity assayed where a higher leaf n concentration together with a higher Î´15n appears to have been directly related to more tolerant genotypes in terms of branch number when fruit yield was considered as the indicator of genotypic tolerance to salinity the role of maintaining a higher stomatal conductance more negative Î´13c was only evidenced at the lowest salinity level while the maintenance of higher leaf greenness higher ga was a positive trait at the two higher salinity levels moreover a more active nitrogen metabolism higher nitrogen concentration and Î´15n had a positive role at the two extreme salinity levels these results support the central role of stored assimilates including nitrogen content in contributing to fruit yield 5 conclusions rgb vegetation indices measured at ground level offer a fast low cost high throughput monitoring system for date palm performance under different salinity levels this system may be deployed directly by farmers using their smartphone cameras with open source applications allowing compilation and processing of data via a remotely managed aggregate server araus and kefauver 2018 in the experimental conditions of our study rgb indices informing on the total canopy greenness yellowness along with the cyan color of the leaf seem to be the best suited rgb indices for evaluation the water status trait leaf Î´13c is also a good indicator of date palm biomass across salinity levels but it does not work as well for assessing fruit yield moreover this is a higher cost approach usually not far below 10 euros per sample and it requires advanced lab facilities or outsourcing the service ct the other water status trait was not as effective as Î´13c for predicting biomass the capacity to monitor the effect of salinity on the biomass level may be further improved if a trait reporting the time integrated water status and photosynthetic performance such as Î´13c from leaves is combined with traits reporting the canopy leaf color rgb indices moreover this present study also highlights the importance of n metabolism as a key component of genotypic performance under salinity stress in this situation Î´15n and even more importantly the total nitrogen concentration of the leaf given its comparatively low cost and performance under different salinity levels represent alternatives for selecting traits however the application of rgb indices and Î´13c for phenotyping remains a little out of reach particularly when fruit yield rather than biomass is the target while this study evaluated the performance of rgb indices for monitoring the effect of salinity on growth and yield further exploration of these rgb images to detect and quantify the effect of biotic stresses such as pests and diseases on date palm el juhany 2010 is warranted this would

10739,date palm is frequently irrigated with brackish water developing tools to monitor salinity effects at the single tree level may assist agronomy and phenotyping sixteen elite varieties were grown for 15 years under irrigation with three levels of saline water 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 at the international center for biosaline agriculture uae trunk length and diameter number of branches and fruit yield per tree were recorded different vegetation indices were calculated from single tree top images taken from the ground with an rgb red green blue camera these included indices derived from cie commission internationale de l eclairage color space models lightness together with a and b dimensions cielab and u and v coordinates cieluv and the hsi color space referring to the components hue saturation and intensity moreover green area ga and the greener area gga were also formulated also canopy temperature ct was measured as an indicator of canopy water status with an infrared thermometer the carbon isotope composition Î´13c as a time integrated indicator of water status and the nitrogen isotope composition Î´15n and total nitrogen concentration n as nitrogen metabolism indicators were analyzed in leaflet dry matter irrigation conditions and genotypes exhibited significant effects for biomass fruit yield and all the remote sensing and stable isotope traits evaluated hue correlated positively whereas most of the other rgb vegetation indices along with Î´13c and ct correlated negatively with biomass and fruit yield across salinities leaf n concentration and Î´15n did not correlate with biomass and fruit yield across salinities but were the only traits correlated with genotypic variability in fruit yield within a given salinity level traits that describe canopy

genotypic variability keywords date palm irrigation rgb images salinity stable isotope composition vegetation index 1 introduction the date palm phoenix dactylifera l is a major fruit crop in most arab countries where 70 of the world s 120 million date palms are located el juhany 2010 dates are a key food and income source for many local populations in the middle east and north africa and play significant roles in the economy society and environment in these areas chao and krueger 2007 increased water and soil salinity are two serious threats across the arab countries al yahyai and al khanjari 2008 bouhoun et al 2011 the date palm is traditionally considered to be relatively salt tolerant maas and hoffman 1977 carr 2013 the threshold electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract above which fruit yield was reduced is 4 0 ds m 1 with a percent yield decrease per unit salinity ds m 1 increase of 3 6 maas and hoffman 1977 carr 2013 but other evidences suggest that this view may not be correct tripler et al 2011 this last study raises questions regarding the nature of mechanisms for salinity tolerance in date palms and is an incentive to irrigate dates with higher rather than lower quality water tripler et al 2011 however the availability of good quality water for mediterranean agriculture is expected to decrease in the coming decades as increases in demography and other socioeconomic factors will compete for this resource araus 2004 moreover irrigation will become even more important for date palm cultivation in the coming decades given the climate change predictions for the middle east and north africa meda region lobell et al 2008 in this scenario the use of low quality i e brackish water is unavoidable increasing soil salinity levels adversely impact growth and biomass of date palm in addition to causing leaf injury al abdoulhadi et al 2011 parameters that usually characterize the response of date palm growth to salinity are plant height collar girth and production of leaves and genotypic variability seems to exist for these as well as factors like the levels of photosynthetic pigments kurup et al 2009 remote sensing techniques particularly digital imagery at the satellite level offer very useful information for irrigation and soil salinity management in date palm groves allbed et al 2014 the technique depends on the implementation of vegetation indices vi obtained from multispectral imagery such as the soil adjusted vegetation index savi allbed et al 2014 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi peÃ±uelas et al 1997 aldakheel 2011 the normalized differential salinity index ndsi or the salinity index si t among others alhammadi and glenn 2008 however canopy structure and variations in tree spacing alhammadi and glenn 2008 alhammadi and kurup 2012 may affect the information derived from satellite or aerial images therefore the satellite and aerial applications of remote sensing techniques are mostly amenable for land classification to detect the impact of salinity e g afrasinei et al 2017 or to use in models to calculate water balance and irrigation requirements e g sperling et al 2014b but lack enough resolution to be used at a small scale or even as a phenotypic tool where resolution at the single tree level is needed the use of unmanned aerial vehicles flying at low altitude may be a feasible alternative providing that national regulations allow their use which is not always the case stÃ¶cker et al 2017 in this event ground evaluation may also become an alternative in date palm the intensity of leaf injury caused by salinity or other forms of stress is frequently estimated on leaflets of fully expanded leaves according a visual scale al abdoulhadi et al 2011 however visual scales have a high level of subjectivity that prevents full standardization and comparability of results remote sensing applications in precision agriculture have diversified in recent years to include not only satellite and aerial sensors but also ground sensors hand held or tractor mounted mulla 2013 the alternative of using field spectroradiometers on individual plants to mimic aerial evaluations is still limited by the cost of the equipment and rates of throughput in that sense the use of conventional rgb from red green blue images may allow formulation of a wide range of vegetation indices based on the color properties of the images casadesÃºs et al 2007 this is a very affordable technique because the processing software needed is open access more importantly the indices derived from rgb images may have a similar or even better performance than the multispectral derived indices when assessing the effect of growing conditions and genotypic variability of different crop species vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 gracia romero et al 2017 2018 kefauver et al 2017 however the use of this remote sensing approach on single trees has scarcely been tested and to the best of our understanding has not yet been applied to date palms a decrease in stomatal conductance as water salinity increases has been reported in date palm sperling et al 2014a for that reason the use of aerial thermal images has been proposed as a methodology to assess irrigation and water status of date palm trees cohen et al 2012 however the relatively low resolution of thermal images compared to multispectral cameras makes it even less feasible to use this technology from satellites or aerial platforms and then extrapolate this type of information to the single tree level for this reason the evaluation of canopy temperature at the individual tree level may become an alternative particularly if infrared thermometers are used given their very low cost compared to thermal cameras even if the cost of the latter has decreased significantly in recent years in that sense measuring canopy temperature at ground level using infrared thermometers to monitor water status and the effect of salinity has been proposed for decades although the focus has been on herbaceous crops howell et al 1984 kluitenberg and biggar 1992 however in the case of tree orchards the density of the plantings may affect the temperature readings for example by inter shading belsky et al 1993 an additional limitation of this approach particularly when the aim of phenotyping is to evaluate a large number of plants is the potential disturbing effect of daily variations in environmental conditions nevertheless analyzing the stable carbon isotope signature in plant dry matter may provide a time integrated indicator of plant performance in terms of water stress and stomatal conductance farquhar and richards 1984 farquhar et al 1989 conditions that induce stomatal closure such as water deficit or salinity restrict the co2 supply to carboxylation sites which then increases the Î´13c or decreases the carbon isotope discrimination Î´13c of plant matter farquhar et al 1989 thus increases in Î´13c or decreases in Î´13c in response to salinity have been observed not only in herbaceous crops arslan et al 1999 yousfi et al 2009 2010 2012 but also in woody plants including different tree species li and sternberg 1992 poss et al 2000 hokmabadi et al 2005 moreover the stable carbon isotope signature has also been applied as a phenotyping technique to look for genotypic variability in water use efficiency in trees gonzÃ¡lez martÃ­nez et al 2008 in addition the environmental conditions prevailing in arabian deserts where precipitation is minimal and evapotranspiration very high makes it feasible to set constant cultivation conditions i e reproducible across years providing that irrigation is available and is kept constant in other words a single sample i e from one year may reflect the long term growing conditions moreover assimilates that contribute to the development of date palm leaves are accumulated during the previous season in the trunk chao et al 2007 cohen et al 2013 therefore the temporal time span representativeness of the stable isotope analysis of a leaf in date palm is larger than expected for a similar analysis in a leaf from an annual crop species the stable nitrogen isotope composition Î´15n in its natural abundance has been used less frequently than Î´13c for crop monitoring of nitrogen sources and phenotyping genotypic variability in nitrogen metabolism due to a number of factors including fractionation processes that are not understood sufficiently handley and raven 1992 however salinity and water stress besides inducing stomatal closure and therefore increasing Î´13c also affect processes related to n uptake assimilation release and internal recycling consequently affecting Î´15n in plants see yousfi et al 2012 and references herein including tree species cernusak et al 2009 it has been proposed that variability in the Î´15n of plants might originate from changes in stomatal conductance which in turn modify the rubisco catalyzed oxygenation rate tcherkez and hodges 2008 tcherkez 2010 therefore and given a uniform nitrogen source the Î´15n and total nitrogen concentration in plant matter gives an insight into the effect of salinity and genotype on the nitrogen metabolism of the plant it has been reported for herbaceous plants like barley handley et al 1997 and wheat yousfi et al 2009 that salinity decreases the Î´15n and nitrogen concentration in tissues indeed in the case of wheat a positive relationship of Î´15n and nitrogen concentration with biomass yield has been reported yousfi et al 2009 2012 to the best of our knowledge no studies on the effect of salinity and even of water stress in the Î´13c and Î´15n of date palm have been published and therefore the potential application of these isotopes to assess plant growth yield and genotypic variability remains to be confirmed the main objective of this study was to investigate what kind of indicators may be used at the single tree level to assess the performance in terms of biomass and fruit yield of date palms under salinity with regard to the remote sensing approaches emphasis is given to low cost easy to handle approaches including rgb vegetation indices and canopy temperature measured with an infrared thermometer in addition Î´13c and Î´15n together with the total n concentration were measured in different plant tissues a set of 16 varieties from the arabian peninsula representing the diversity of economically important varieties in the region and with different growth and productivity potentials were tested under three different levels of salinity the trial is a long term field experiment of the international center for biosaline agriculture icba located in the united arab emirates uae the secondary objective was to develop single physiological models based on the above indicators to help define the ideotype characteristics that contribute to genotypic performance of date palm under salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the study was performed in a long term date palm phoenix dactylifera l trial established on nearly 2 5 ha at the experimental station 25 13 n and 55 17 e of the icba dubai uae the experimental station is located in an arid desert climate total annual precipitation is below 60 mm while the annual eto is higher than 1900 mm where temperatures are high and rainfall is negligible from april to november karim and dakheel 2006 supplemental fig s1 the soil is fine sand in texture non saline moderately alkaline and strongly calcareous carbonatic hyperthermic typic torripsamment organic matter is very low 0 5 and the munsell soil colour dry gretagmacbeth 2000 is 10yr 6 4 pale brown which is a composite reflection from the dominance of carbonates and sand with insignificant contribution of organic matter to the color composition more details about soil characteristics of the icba can be found in shahid et al 2009 during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons uniform seedlings of 18 date palm varieties were planted the set of date palms tested includes varieties from the uae and from the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa prior to planting the site was harrowed to ensure an even seedbed each variety was planted in a row and includes 15 individual plants that are separated into three sub plots of five plants for each of the 3 salinity treatments each plant represents one replication with 5 replicates per variety per treatment plants within the sub plots of five replicates are separated by 8 m and a gap of 20 m containing olive trees exists between each sub plot of five plants see the field layout in fig 1 once the trial was established organic composted manure was applied at the rate of 20 kg per tree per year during the last two weeks of october and npk fertilizer was applied annually during early october and december according to the normal agronomical practice in the uae the trees of each variety were hand pollinated from high quality male trees pollination extended from early february to late march and the harvest occurred generally during the summer season july september depending on the maturity of the individual variety the agronomical measurements were made on all the trees per treatment and averaged two of the original varieties were not included in the study because several of the trees died in the years prior to the study the name and provenance of the remaining 16 varieties are detailed in table 1 three saline irrigation treatments of 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 were established and were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 5 replicates per treatment mentioned above the three salinity levels were selected to represent conditions that lead to substantial yield reduction and to include the 50 yield reduction thresholds which have been reported as being around 17 ds m 1 maas and hoffman 1977 the 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 irrigation salinities were accomplished by mixing highly saline groundwater with ecw up to 25 ds m 1 sar 26 mmol l with na and cl concentrations higher than 190 meq l 1 and ph 7 6 with low salinity municipal water of less than 2 ds m 1 which was the water with the lowest salinity available sar 4 mmol l 1 with na and cl concentrations lower than 11 meq l 1 and ph 8 5 the three salinity levels were maintained constantly throughout the cropping season and during all the years of growth each salinity level was monitored twice a week using a portable ec meter tetracon 325 cond 197i wtw brand xylem analytics rye brook new york usa irrigation was applied at rates equivalent to et0 plus 50 for leaching requirements trees were irrigated using a drip system twice a day for 20 min each during the low demand periods and 3 times a day under the high water demand of summer according to the targeted amounts of irrigation described above a recent study on the same date palm trial concluded that there was no trend in salt build up and the use of irrigation at 1 5 etc represented a sustainable rate of irrigation with regard to effective leaching of salts following daily root water uptake by date palm al muaini et al 2019 the following growth parameters were recorded prior sampling for each individual tree plant trunk height cm diameter cm and number of branches per plant in addition total fruit yield per tree kg at maturity from the last harvest was measured 2 2 ground remote sensing evaluation vegetation indices vi derived from red green blue rgb images were evaluated at the single tree level field evaluation was performed during late january 2017 pictures were taken under natural light conditions of sunny days around noon having the sun at the back for each tree an rgb picture was taken at approximately 6 m from the trunk tree with an olympus e m10 16 megapixel resolution camera with a 17 3 13 0 mm sensor using a 14 mm lens triggered at a speed of 1 400 s with the aperture programmed in automatic mode and native resolution of 4608 3072 pixels images were stored in jpg format using the srgb color standard images were acquired from the ground holding the camera by hand images were trimmed to 1364 908 pixels as a way to discard the background mostly sky other than the palm tree leaves using the crop function and a recursive algorithm implemented in imagej schneider et al 2012 in addition to ensure that the effect of background was negligible the images were also trimmed to 1000 1000 pixels manually subsequently images were analysed with the open source breedpix software casadesÃºs et al 2007 vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 through its most recent version cimmyt maize scanner v1 15 https integrativecropecophysiology com software development maizescanner developed by our team gracia romero et al 2017 this software enables calculation of several rgb vegetation indices based on the different properties of color inherent in rgb images rgb vis were obtained either from the average color of the whole image or from the histogram in each image breedpix converts the original rgb image to other color spaces i e each model which numerically represents the color in terms of new color space coordinates thus the indices calculated from breedpix were intensity hue saturation lightness a b u v the relative green area ga and the relative greener area gga casadesus et al 2007 on the one hand for the indices from hue to v the software obtains the average values of each color space coordinate and on the other hand for the ga and gga indices the software obtains the green and greener canopy cover area for each one of the processed images except for ga and gga all these vis belong to cie from the french abbreviation of the international commission on illumination color spaces the software requires the use of java advanced imaging jai for the conversion of rgb color space to cie xyz color space and the resulting coordinates are subsequently converted to other color spaces like ihs from intensity hue and saturation intensity is a measure of brightness and represents the amount of white light reflected hue refers to the color itself and represents the average wavelength of the color spectrum and saturation defines the color purity from white to its primary color thus the saturation of a color is determined by a combination of light intensity and the spectral distribution of the wavelengths that makes up the color purity considering that the light intensity is similar for all the images a decrease in saturation is only the result of the presence of different wavelengths hue describes the color itself in the form of an angle between 0 and 360 where 0 means red 60 means yellow 120 means green and 180 means cyan derived from hue the green area ga index is defined as the percentage of pixels with colors from yellow to blue hue range from 60 to 180 that is the proportion of yellow to blueish green pixels in the image the greener area gga is a more restrictive index in terms of only retaining green pixels hue range from 80 to 180 while excluding yellowish green tones and therefore it more accurately describes the photosynthetically active biomass and leaf greenness fig 2 the vis a and b belong to the cielab cooler space with l being the lightness dimension and a and b the color opponent coordinates red green opponent colors are represented along the a axis whereas the b axis represents the yellow blue opponent colors therefore in the cielab model the b component defines the blue to yellow range where more positive values are closer to a pure yellow and more negative ones are closer to pure blue while the a component represents the green to red range with a more positive value representing a purer red and a more negative value indicating a greener color similarly the u and v indices represent the axis in the chromaticity diagram of cie luv color space thus in the cieluv model the color space is represented as a three coordinate system l u and v with l being the lightness dimension and u and v the chromaticity diagram the components of cielab and cieluv color spaces are calculated as described in trussell et al 2005 the hue component is calculated using the jai functions which employ the formulae described in seul et al 2000 finally the ga and gga are based on the sum of frequencies of the histogram classes included in a certain range of hue in the image casadesus et al 2007 the equations from which the different rgb vegetation indices used here derive are included as supplemental information supplemental table 1 in the present study only the values of the rgb indices calculated from the images trimmed with the standard procedure are shown as this represents the easiest to handle format for use by farmers the canopy temperature ct of each single tree was measured at noon 12 14 h on the same day as for the rgb images using an infrared thermometer phototemptmmxstmtd raytek santa cruz california usa measurements were taken from the same position as the rgb images holding the sensor by hand 2 3 nitrogen concentration and stable isotope analyses two leaflets from the central part of a young previous year fully expanded leaf referred to in the manuscript as a branch were sampled from 3 of the 5 trees per variety and treatment after sampling leaves were washed with tap and distilled water dried and finely ground at the same time the seed stones of the last two years of three varieties shahlah lulu and khalas which exhibit contrasting performance under salinity were dried and then finely ground then the total nitrogen concentration and the stable carbon 13c 12c ratio and nitrogen 15n 14n ratio isotope signatures of these samples were analyzed at the scientific facilities of the university of barcelona samples of 1 mg were weighed into tin capsules and analyses were performed using an elemental analyser flash 1112 ea thermofinnigan san jose california usa coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta c irms thermofinnigan operating in continuous flow mode the 13c 12c ratios r of plant material were expressed in Î´ notation coplen 2008 as carbon isotope composition Î´13c Î´ 13 c r s a m p l e r s t a n d

effects of salinity genotype and their interaction mean comparisons were performed using tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test a bivariate correlation procedure was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficients between the date palm growth traits and fruit yield on the one hand and the rgb vegetation indices together with Î´13c ct Î´15n and the total nitrogen concentration n on the other multiple linear regression analysis stepwise was used to analyze the criterion included to explain variation in fruit yield under different growing conditions data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistics 24 package spss inc chicago il usa figures were created using the sigma plot 11 0 program for windows systat software inc point richmond ca usa finally we performed path analyses li 1975 aimed at understanding genotypic differences in fruit yield and biomass under different levels of salinity 5 10 and 15 ds m 1 this methodology offers the possibility of building associations between variables on prior knowledge the objective was to discern the potential mechanisms that contribute to fruit yield and biomass variation across genotypes while identifying the traits that may inform about such mechanisms specifically these conceptual models were designed to assess the relative contributions of direct and indirect effects of water status through ct Î´13c nitrogen metabolism through n concentration and Î´15n and the degree of leaf greenness through the rgb index ga on fruit yield and biomass specifically number of branches a model with a comparative fit index cfi arbuckle 2012 with values 0 9 was taken as indicative of a good fit data were analysed using the amos graphics package spss 3 results 3 1 effect of salinity on plant biomass productivity remote sensing and stable isotope indices an increase in the salinity level of the irrigation water significantly decreased trunk height and diameter as well as the total number of branches and the date fruit yield table 2 the genotypic effect was also significant for yield see also supplemental fig s1 and for the three biomass traits the genotype by treatment the salinity of the irrigation water interaction gxs was only significant for trunk height increasing salinity of the irrigation water also affected the water status indices with both carbon isotope composition Î´13c of the leaflets and canopy temperature ct increasing as salinity increased table 3 the vegetation indices derived from rgb images were also significantly affected by the salinity except for hue which decreased and intensity which did not follow a clear pattern all the other traits saturation lightness a b v u ga and gga increased in response to a higher salinity in the irrigation water table 3 concerning the nitrogen indices the nitrogen isotope composition Î´15n was higher under the mid range medium salinity compared to the other two levels while the total nitrogen concentration increased from the lowest to the medium salinity and did not change at the highest level genotypic effects were significant for all the traits in table 3 except intensity see also supplemental fig s2 for the genotypic values of date yield and the water status traits while the gxs interaction was significant for all the traits except Î´13c hue ga and gga an increase in salinity also affected Î´13c which increased and Î´15n which decreased in the date seeds stones while the total nitrogen concentration of the stones was unaffected supplemental table s1 on the other hand Î´13c values were higher and Î´15n and n lower in the stones compared to the leaves 3 2 correlation of remote sensing and stable isotope indices against biomass and fruit yield the relationships of the three biomass traits trunk height and diameter and total number of branches and the date yield per palm with the different rgb indices were investigated to that end the genotypic values of the set of varieties across the three levels of saline irrigation were combined fig 3 hue correlated positively p 0 01 with the biomass traits and date yield while saturation b u and v correlated negatively p 0 01 with the four traits biomass traits correlated better than date yield with these rgb indices the a and ga indexes only correlated negatively p 0 05 with trunk height while lightness correlated negatively with trunk height and the number of branches intensity also correlated negatively with the number of branches and there was no correlation between gga and any of the four traits considered supplemental table s2 carbon isotope composition and canopy temperature correlated negatively with the three biomass traits p 0 01 and date yield p 0 05 the number of branches and trunk height had the best correlation with Î´13c while trunk diameter and trunk height were best correlated with ct fig 4 by contrast no correlation existed between the total n concentration and Î´15n with date yield or any of the biomass parameters across growing conditions data not shown phenotypic correlations i e across the set of varieties studied within a given irrigation condition between the different remote sensing traits and the stable isotope signatures with date yield and biomass were also studied trunk height was only correlated negatively with b r 0 46 p 0 05 and v r 51 p 0 01 at the highest salinity level and with ga r 58 p 0 01 and gga r 61 p 0 01 at the lowest salinity level trunk diameter only correlated positively with gga r 0 47 p 0 05 at the lowest salinity level whereas the number of branches and date yield did not correlate with any of the rgb indices data not shown concerning leaf Î´13c it correlated negatively with the number of branches at medium salinity r 51 p 0 01 while at the other two salinity levels the relationships did not reach the significance p 0 05 threshold moreover no correlations of leaf Î´13c with fruit yield and any of the other biomass parameters were recorded data not shown finally no correlations existed between leaf Î´15n and leaf n concentration with any of the biomass traits however leaf Î´15n correlated positively with date yield at the highest salinity while total n concentration also correlated positively with date yield but at the lowest and highest salinity levels fig 5 3 3 genotypic response model a conceptual model based on a path analysis was proposed displaying the genotypic responses within a given growing condition in fruit yield fig 6 a and number of branches per tree fig 6b explained in terms of water status Î´13c ct nitrogen metabolism n Î´15n and actual greenness of leaves ga the six path models provided an acceptable fit to the data comparative fit index cfi 0 9 and p 0 05 as the objective here is to develop models that fit the data well under the lowest salinity level genotypic differences in fruit yield were associated with direct effects of nitrogen metabolism n and Î´15n and water status Î´13c fig 6c while differences in the number of branches were basically associated with the water status Î´13c fig 6d under medium salinity genotypic differences in fruit yield were mostly associated with a direct effect of leaf greenness ga together with an indirect i e through ga effect of water status ct fig 6e while differences in the number of branches were associated with an effect of photosynthetic area ga moreover water status had not only a direct effect through ct and Î´13c on the number of branches but ct also had an indirect effect through ga fig 6f at the highest salinity level genotypic differences in fruit yield were associated with direct effects of nitrogen metabolism n and Î´15n and actual leaf photosynthetic status ga together with an indirect effect of water status ct on ga fig 6g while variability in the number of branches was associated with a direct effect of nitrogen metabolism Î´15n and water status Î´13c fig 6h moreover water status ct also had a rather indirect effect through ga and nitrogen metabolism traits 4 discussion date palms are very salt tolerant and can tolerate high water salinity levels of up to 34 0 ds m 1 even when the excessive salinity reduces growth and will result in fruits of low quality zohary and hopf 2000 chao and krueger 2007 irrigation with saline water even in the sandy soil conditions of our experiment which prevent salt accumulation had a significant effect on the different growth traits and fruit yield nevertheless after 15 years of imposing irrigation with different salinity levels the effects were rather moderate thus moving from the lowest 5 ds m 1 to the highest 15 ds m 1 salinity level only decreased trunk height and diameter by 38 and 13 respectively while the number of branches decreased by 28 and fruit yield by 44 in addition salinity during irrigation significantly affected all the remote sensing and analytical traits evaluated in our study on the other hand in agreement with previous results we found genotypic variability in growth parameters such as plant height collar girth and production of leaves kurup et al 2009 moreover apart from intensity all the other tested traits remote sensing and analytical exhibited genotypic differences remote sensing evaluation of date palm performance under salinity has been quite extensively investigated but mostly from satellite and aerial platforms however the results are not always encouraging given different factors such as a lack of resolution or atmospheric interference for example ndvi assessed from satellite has been poorly correlated with salinity performance of date palm aldakheel 2011 for this reason proximal i e at ground level remote sensing of individual trees may represent an alternative in terms of resolution and may be amenable for both irrigation management and phenotyping this study compared different remote sensing approaches for screening date palm performance under salinity at the single tree level with emphasis on low cost solutions 4 1 monitoring the effect of salinity canopy leaf color and rgb indices three different models hue cielab and cieluv detailed in the materials and methods were used to represent the color space and derive the corresponding rgb indices hue strongly decreased in response to increasing salinity and it was positively correlated with biomass and fruit yield for a number of different species including woody plants and combining leaves at varying stages of greenness it has been reported that hue was significantly linearly correlated with chlorophyll content majer et al 2010 junker and ensminger 2016 however in our study hue is probably indicating the total amount of green biomass of the tree canopy rather than the degree of greenness of individual leaves in fact calculation of hue only accounts for the green pixels without taking into consideration the background in agreement with this the correlation of hue against biomass and yield did not change substantially when background was removed manually from the images suggesting that background did not affect the response of hue data not shown in accordance with an effect of salinity decreasing chlorophyll content at the whole canopy tree b strongly increased as salinity in the irrigation water increased indicating that salinity is increasing the proportion of dry yellow leaflets in the tree canopy consequently b correlated negatively across salinities with biomass and fruit yield nevertheless changes in pigments other than chlorophyll may also affect b in general the level of carotenoids increases under salinity borghesi et al 2011 which may increase the yellow appearance of the leaf moreover the negative correlation of b with biomass and fruit yield also suggests that more blueish cyan leaves is a positive trait in support of that v and u were also negatively correlated with biomass and fruit yield also indicating that leaves with more cyan i e greenish blue color are indicative of better plant performance cyan is a greenish blue color with predominant wavelengths between 490 520 nm it is also defined as a light blue or saturated blue color the visible spectrum starts with blue at the bottom of the space moving through green in the upper left and to red in the upper right in fact v was the rgb vegetation index best correlated with date yield and all the biomass traits on the other hand saturation was also negatively correlated with biomass and fruit yield saturation here is an indicator of the purity of the color therefore the best performing trees were those exhibiting a combination of cyan toned leaves together with other complementary colors rather than having a single color as in the case of hue to discard the effect of background white sandy soil or blue sky in this case on the values of these indices background was removed manually and values recalculated the strength of the relationships of b v u and saturation against biomass and fruit yield did not change significantly with regard to the initial images where background was not removed data not shown the more blueish appearance of the leaves of the better performing palms may have different explanations anthocyanin is a flavonoid whose accumulation in plants exposed to salt stress has been documented extensively gupta and huang 2014 accumulation of anthocyanins and carotenoids is a widely reported response to drought and other abiotic stress because it may palliate the negative environmental effects on photosynthesis of excess visible radiation occurring concurrently with an abiotic stress chalker scott 1999 while contributing towards salt detoxification chutipaijit et al 2011 chunthaburee et al 2016 in fact accumulation of soluble phenolics anthocyanins and flavones following exposure to salinity has been associated with increased salt tolerance in sugarcane wahid and ghazanfar 2006 thus the presence within the epidermis of uv b absorbing pigments primarily flavonoids provides a major protective barrier to photoxidation damage liakoura et al 2001 however these pigments have a minimal absorption of photosynthetic active radiation therefore it is not expected that flavonoids will strongly affect leaf color in palm leaves despite this species being characterized by a double layer of epidermal cells with an upper epidermis plus a hypodermis doaigey et al 2013 moreover even though purple leaf color has been reported in rice as a response to accumulation of anthocyanin triggered by salinity chunthaburee et al 2016 the amount accumulated in non herbaceous species is probably not enough to markedly affect the color of the leaves in date palm other factors that may affect the leaf color are at the leaf surface including the cuticular waxes and the presence of trichomes however date palm is characterized by glabrous leaves and trichomes are scarce khelil et al 2016 alternatively the pale grey or blueish green appearance of the leaves is probably related to the glaucous or waxy nature of the leaf surfaces which in date palm seems to be related to the presence of epicuticular waxes khelil et al 2016 in fact the accessions evaluated in this study possess glaucous leaves khelil et al 2016 al dakheel personal communication which aligns with the very xeric conditions of the desert together with high temperatures and intense light and uv radiation shepherd and griffiths 2006 in date palm the majority of the waxes constituting the epicuticle are polygonal rodlets that form rings around the stomata corresponding to the strelitzia type in the absence of a waxy surface date palm leaves exhibit yellowish to dark green leaves which is also a characteristic related to variety ribera et al 2006 however the effects of intense erosion of surface waxes are usually observed on the oldest leaves khelil et al 2016 therefore the leaf color may be influenced by the degree of erosion of epicuticular waxes which may reflect leaf age in other words better growing conditions increase the rate of appearance of new leaves therefore increasing the overall degree of glaucousness the increases in ga and a in response to salinity seem at first surprising nevertheless the leaf nitrogen concentration showed a similar pattern of increase as irrigation salinity increased ga and even a have been reported to be reliable estimators of the nitrogen concentration at canopy and leaf levels vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 gracia romero et al 2017 kefauver et al 2017 however in the present study ga and a were not the rgb indices that best correlated with biomass and fruit yield across salinity levels accordingly the leaf n concentration also did not correlate with biomass traits or fruit yield which agrees with previous studies chao and krueger 2007 moreover gga which is an indicator of leaf greenness did not decrease as salinity increased and lacked any correlation with biomass and fruit yield the lack of change in the ga and gaa indices may be explained at least in part because their formulation unlike the other rgb indices discussed above ga and gga are formulated as ratios of green pixels relative to the entire set of pixels present in the image therefore this includes the background the negative effect of salinity in the content of photosynthetic pigments such as leaf chlorophyll has been widely reported in plants romero et al 1997 including date palm al abdoulhadi et al 2012 however the effect of salinity on the anatomy of the new developed leaves e g increasing in leaf succulence may offset an eventual decrease in chlorophyll concentration as a consequence frequently chlorophyll content is not a good indicator of performance to salinity yousfi et al 2009 2010 in the case of woody species with long lived leaves the effect of salinity on chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration may be even more complex 4 2 monitoring the effect of salinity water status it is well known that the first effect of salinity is to induce water stress through a subsequent decrease in stomatal conductance munns and tester 2008 raising the salinity of the irrigation water increased the carbon isotope composition Î´13c in the palm leaflets which regardless of the growing conditions exhibited values typical of c3 species the effect of salinity on the Î´13c of the plant has been reported in different species e g isla et al 1998 yousfi et al 2009 2010 2013 as in the case of water stress farquhar and richards 1984 the increase in Î´13c is mediated through stomatal closure and a subsequent decrease in the intercellular versus the atmospheric co2 concentration ratio farquhar et al 1982 1989 as a consequence Î´13c correlated negatively with biomass traits and fruit yield across genotypes and growing conditions even though this effect of salinity has been reported mostly in herbaceous plants it also applies to other c3 species such as trees lin and sternberg 1992 poss et al 2000 hokmabadi et al 2005 the present study does not support the analysis of Î´13c in the stones to assess growing conditions because differences in Î´13c between extreme irrigation salinities were much smaller in stones compared to leaflets this may be the consequence of different patterns of carbon allocation and isotopic fractionation between leaves and seeds brugnoli and lauteri 1991 a linear decrease has been reported in date palm for both yield and transpiration under increased soil salinity tripler et al 2007 canopy temperature is a well established proxy for transpiration which is mediated by stomatal conductance along with the atmospheric vapor demand thus the cooler the canopy the more the plant transpires this technique has long been used to monitor water status blum 2011 and references herein including the effects of irrigation with saline water howell et al 1984 kluitenberg and biggar 1992 thermal imaging from aerial platforms has been deployed previously for scheduling irrigation in date palms cohen et al 2012 in the current work canopy temperature increased in response to irrigation with saline water as a consequence ct was negatively correlated with biomass and fruit yield to summarize the negative correlations of Î´13c and ct with biomass and fruit yield indicate that plants that maintain a better water status in terms of stomatal aperture i e more negative Î´13c and subsequent higher transpiration cooler canopies are those that exhibit greater growth and productivity however Î´13c correlated in a consistently stronger manner than ct with biomass characteristics the methodological limitations of measuring the canopy temperature of each palm tree individually rather than simultaneously e g from an aerial platform is a factor to consider araus and cairns 2014 however except for predicting numbers of branches the rgb indices performed even better than Î´13c at predicting biomass trunk height and diameter and fruit yield across salinities and genotypes even so the combination of both categories rgb indices plus Î´13c through a multilinear approach clearly improved the capacity to predict biomass but not fruit yield with determination coefficients above 0 50 data not shown the different nature of the combined traits reporting water status in the case of Î´13c and canopy characteristics with the rgb indices may contribute to their complementarity in explaining biomass 4 3 assessing genotyping variability munns and james 2003 suggested that screening for high stomatal conductance might be the most effective way to assess the effect of salinity and select genotypes that will perform better under such stress conditions however the modest performance of Î´13c as a phenotypic trait for salinity has been reported before in durum wheat yousfi et al 2009 2013 in the case of pistachio trees carbon isotope composition or discrimination was a useful indicator of cumulative salinity history but was not a suitable indicator for pre screening of pistachio rootstocks for salinity resistance hokmabadi et al 2005 the effect of salinity on nitrogen metabolism appears to play a role in the genotypic differences in tolerance to salinity the natural variation in the plant n isotope signature again commonly expressed as the composition Î´15n has been proposed for genotypic screening for salinity handley et al 1997 yousfi et al 2009 2010 because it is linked to n metabolism yousfi et al 2012 but to date only herbaceous crops wheat and barley have been evaluated in an experiment with beech seedlings Î´13c values were affected more by the actual environmental conditions of the study variations in drought in this case whereas Î´15n values were affected more by the genetic factor provenance peuke et al 2006 moreover the most drought tolerant provenances had the highest Î´15n the differences in Î´15n between tolerant and susceptible genotypes suggest that genotypic tolerance to salinity is mediated via greater n uptake and or assimilation handley et al 1997 ellis et al 2002 yousfi et al 2012 2013 as in herbaceous plants yousfi et al 2012 2013 the limited results reported from tree species mangrove in this case mckee et al 2002 suggest that the slower growth and lower n demand associated with any stress results in lower Î´15n values in our results the positive relationships across genotypes of n concentration and Î´15n with fruit yield at the highest salinity level support the positive link between Î´15n and n accumulation nevertheless most of the available literature on date palm indicates that while there are no consistent correlations of leaf n levels with yield this probably depends upon cultivar chao and krueger 2007 ezz et al 2010 in fact date palm is characterized by low n concentrations compared to other perennial crops chao and krueger 2007 therefore cultivar related differences in n availability may play a clear role in date yield a positive effect of a high leaf n concentration on fruit yield may be mediated through extended fruit development and increased fruit capacity saenz et al 1997 such differences may be more or less constitutive or the consequence of salinity conditions in the current results both the leaf n concentration and Î´15n exhibited strongly significant genotype by irrigation interactions rgb indices failed to correlate with fruit yield across genotypes within a given salinity level they only tracked differences in biomass particularly trunk height in the two extreme salinities tested at the highest salinity v was the rgb index with the best correlation interestingly v was also the best index negatively correlated across salinities and genotypes combined the blueish appearance of the leaves seems to be a positive genotypic trait at the highest salinity level in the case of the lowest salinity ga and gga were negatively correlated across genotypes with trunk height although the pattern of these relationships is at first surprising suggesting that genotypes with greener leaves have less trunk biomass it is in line with the decrease we found in ga and gga as irrigation salinity increased even though most of the traits evaluated failed to show a direct relationship with genotypic variability in biomass and fruit yield within a given salinity level they may still be useful to develop conceptual models aimed at explaining the combination of physiological traits associated with genotypic tolerance to salinity the statistical approach assayed was a path analysis which has already been tested in durum wheat under different salinity levels yousfi et al 2012 in terms of biomass and irrespective of the salinity level a lower more negative Î´13c was directly associated with a higher biomass at the three salinity levels this means that the maintenance of a higher stomatal conductance is a positive genotypic trait in terms of photosynthesis and growth isla et al 1998 munns and james 2003 munns and tester 2008 yousfi et al 2009 the maintenance of greener leaves higher ga also seems to have had a positive effect on palm growth even if that only occurred at the intermediate salinity assayed in this study a higher ga not only reflects higher leaf chlorophyll content but also larger leaf n content vergara dÃ­az et al 2016 kefauver et al 2017 the importance of nitrogen metabolism was reinforced at the highest salinity assayed where a higher leaf n concentration together with a higher Î´15n appears to have been directly related to more tolerant genotypes in terms of branch number when fruit yield was considered as the indicator of genotypic tolerance to salinity the role of maintaining a higher stomatal conductance more negative Î´13c was only evidenced at the lowest salinity level while the maintenance of higher leaf greenness higher ga was a positive trait at the two higher salinity levels moreover a more active nitrogen metabolism higher nitrogen concentration and Î´15n had a positive role at the two extreme salinity levels these results support the central role of stored assimilates including nitrogen content in contributing to fruit yield 5 conclusions rgb vegetation indices measured at ground level offer a fast low cost high throughput monitoring system for date palm performance under different salinity levels this system may be deployed directly by farmers using their smartphone cameras with open source applications allowing compilation and processing of data via a remotely managed aggregate server araus and kefauver 2018 in the experimental conditions of our study rgb indices informing on the total canopy greenness yellowness along with the cyan color of the leaf seem to be the best suited rgb indices for evaluation the water status trait leaf Î´13c is also a good indicator of date palm biomass across salinity levels but it does not work as well for assessing fruit yield moreover this is a higher cost approach usually not far below 10 euros per sample and it requires advanced lab facilities or outsourcing the service ct the other water status trait was not as effective as Î´13c for predicting biomass the capacity to monitor the effect of salinity on the biomass level may be further improved if a trait reporting the time integrated water status and photosynthetic performance such as Î´13c from leaves is combined with traits reporting the canopy leaf color rgb indices moreover this present study also highlights the importance of n metabolism as a key component of genotypic performance under salinity stress in this situation Î´15n and even more importantly the total nitrogen concentration of the leaf given its comparatively low cost and performance under different salinity levels represent alternatives for selecting traits however the application of rgb indices and Î´13c for phenotyping remains a little out of reach particularly when fruit yield rather than biomass is the target while this study evaluated the performance of rgb indices for monitoring the effect of salinity on growth and yield further exploration of these rgb images to detect and quantify the effect of biotic stresses such as pests and diseases on date palm el juhany 2010 is warranted this would
