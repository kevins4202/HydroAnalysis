1585,although the technology of coal mine underground reservoirs has been widely applied in the western china little is known about the variation of water quality induced by the removal transformation of nitrogen and dissolved organic matter dom rich in mine water during its storage and transport in a coal mine underground reservoir column experiments were carried out at 30 c and at darcy fluxes ranging from 0 32 cm h to 0 64 cm h to investigate the transport parameters and dynamic changes of nitrogen and dom in a simulated underground reservoir filled with coal gangue which was composed of sandstone and mudstone results showed that chloride transport could be described by the convection dispersion equation cde well at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h wherein the dispersion role was obvious despite the high level of nitrite in the influent the effluent concentrations of nitrite and nitrate fluctuated around the background values through complete denitrification and the removal of total nitrogen tn with efficiencies between 55 1 and 76 were highly correlated with nitrite denitrification ammonification of organic nitrogen got weakened over time and the content of ammonium ion tended to be stable at the level of that in the input mine water the delayed breakthrough curves of chemical oxygen demand cod and dissolved organic carbon doc at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h could be attributed to their adsorption onto the coal gangue during their transport through the simulated underground reservoir due to the variations of microbial and compositions of the input mine water the removal efficiencies of cod and doc increased slightly from 62 to 68 56 to 63 respectively when the darcy flux increased from 0 32 cm h to 0 62 cm h the findings would be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of post treatment of mine water during its storage in an underground reservoir in coal mine areas of western china keywords coal mine underground reservoir coal gangue dissolved organic matter nitrogen mine water denitrification ammonification 1 introduction among coal oil and natural gas supplies coal accounts for approximately 70 of chinese primary energy consumption in a long term as the world s largest coal producer and consumer china records mine drainage amounts of 8 billion tons of mine water every year and only 25 of it could be utilized li et al 2015 nejat et al 2015 zhao and chen 2015 the unutilized amount of mine drainage is approximately 60 of industrial and living water scarcity in china mine water utilization should be deemed of great importance and motivate the effective management and comprehensive utilization of mine water during resource exploitation notably the coal production in shanxi shaanxi inner mongolia ningxia and gansu is approximately 840 billion tons and it constituted 65 70 of china s total coal production by the end of 2010 although coal resources are abundant in these areas of western china the surface evaporation capacity is six times higher than the amount of rainfall thus mine water evaporates quickly if it is discharged to the ground directly serious water resource shortage exists in these areas to utilize mine drainage effectively and avoid water loss through evaporation during water treatment and reservation in these areas of western china scholars have proposed a technical approach to the storage and utilization of mine water by using coal mine underground reservoirs wu and liu 2011 gu 2014 2015 cao et al 2016 artificial dams were constructed to form underground reservoirs in the abandoned goafs the technical system of coal mine underground reservoirs involves reservoir site selection water quantity prediction reservoir volume calculation dam construction safety guarantees and water quality protection gu 2014 2015 the technology of coal mine underground reservoirs has been widely applied in the western mining areas of china such as shendong baotou and xinjie among these mining areas 35 coal mine underground reservoirs were established in the shendong mining area by the end of 2015 the total maximum storage capacity of mine water for these coal mine underground reservoirs amounted to 31 million m3 in 2013 and 2014 these coal mine underground reservoirs supplied 95 4 and 95 1 of the total amount of water needed for mining activities in the shendong mining area respectively consequently approximately 123 47 million m3 of water was saved in the span of two years generating an income of approximately 2 billion yuan because of mine water utilization although the technology has been advocated in coal mine areas by the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china little is known about the variation of water quality during the storage and transport of mine water in a coal mine underground reservoir with regard to the derivation of aquifers and manufacturing activities during underground mining mine water may include complicated components such as organic compounds heavy metals h no3 no2 nh4 ca2 mg2 na so4 2 hco3 2 fe and s2 ions etc the removal of p so4 2 and metals including as zn fe mn co cu mg and ni in mine water through physical chemical and biochemical methods has been widely reported ňancucheo and johnson 2014 sapsford et al 2015 iakovleva et al 2016 rakotonimaro et al 2017 in addition the purification and neutralization of acid mine drainage have been studied thoroughly sun et al 2012 jenk et al 2014 shim et al 2015 masindi et al 2017 shabalala et al 2017 containing clay mineral contents such as illite and kaolinite the coal gangue packed in underground reservoirs could act as a useful adsorbent to reduce the contents of organic compounds and nitrogen in mine water gao et al 2015 jabłońska et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 although the removal and transformation of organic pollutants and nitrogen from domestic agriculture and industrial sewage have been extensively reported mook et al 2012 ji et al 2014 li et al 2016 hamid et al 2017 li et al 2018 little is known about the removal of these compounds in mine water during its storage and transport in coal mine underground reservoirs packed with coal gangue wu et al 2015 pujades et al 2017 qian et al 2017 ji et al 2017 álvarez et al 2018 and nitrogen mineralization has been extensively explored in soil and sludge whereas its potential under anaerobic conditions in a coal mine underground reservoir has yet to be reported hernández et al 2002 feichtinger et al 2004 widowati et al 2012 gomez muñoz et al 2017 therefore efforts should be made to explore the dynamic changes of nitrogen and dom of mine water so as to enrich our understanding of the removal mechanisms of these matters during their transport in a coal mine underground reservoir in western china and the variation of water quality induced by nitrogen and dom biological transformation are also worth investigating in the study area the research would be significant to evaluate the feasibility of the coal mine underground reservoirs technology in western china the current study aims to 1 evaluate the transport mechanism of non reactive tracer in a simulated coal mine underground reservoir through column experiments 2 investigate the transformation mechanism of nitrogen at different darcy flux under the simulated coal mine underground reservoir conditions and 3 quantify the dynamic changes of dom through the determination of doc cod and organic nitrogen during the transport of mine water at darcy fluxes of 0 32 cm h and 0 62 cm h 2 study area as a major coal mine in the shendong mining area the bulianta coal mine is located northwest of ulanmulun town yinjinhuoluo county ordos city inner mongolia province china the study area belongs to the semi arid and semi desert plateau continental climate zone the precipitation ranges from 194 7 mm year 1 to 531 6 mm year 1 with the average value being 357 3 mm year 1 the evapotranspiration ranges from 2 297 4 mm year 1 to 2 833 7 mm year 1 with the average value being 2 457 4 mm year 1 in the last 30 years thus the evapotranspiration is 5 11 times the precipitation in the study area the bulianta coal mine with a mining area of 106 34 km2 ranging from 39 17 22 n 109 58 03 e to 39 23 32 n 110 10 18 e was established in 1987 the coal bearing strata of the coal mine comprise middle lower yanan formation of jurassic the nos 1 2 2 2 and 3 1 coal seams mainly mined in the area have the average coal thicknesses of 3 18 m 6 65 m and 3 27 m respectively the burial depth of the coal bed is 177 257 m with 50 2 years as the remaining service life the approved production capacity of coal for the study area in 2015 was 28 million tons year the average water inflow to the coal mine is 431 5 m3 h with the maximum value being 677 m3 h three underground reservoirs have been established since 2010 to store and purify mine water in the pores of filled rocks in the abandoned goaf the actual water total storage has amounted to 536 000 m3 according to information provided by the technical staff of the mining company the average porosity for the reservoirs is 0 25 the water storage in no 1 underground reservoir established by using abandoned goaf in 22 301 22 306 working face is 85 000 m3 before the water was pumped into the underground reservoir it was stored in a coal mine sump the discharge rate pumped to the reservoir is between 220 and 240 m3 h and the hydraulic residence time in the underground reservoir is 354 386 h 3 materials and methods 3 1 column material the coal gangue composed of sandstone and mudstone was collected from the strata of middle lower yanan formation of jurassic in the 22 308 working face of the bulianta coal mine located northwest of ulanmulun town yinjinhuoluo county ordos city inner mongolia province china 39 17 36 n 110 12 13 e zhao et al 2017 before use all samples were air dried crushed and ground to pass through a 5 mm screen the carbon content in the coal gangue was 1 85 zhao et al 2017 an xrf 1800 x ray fluorescence xrf shimadzu corporation kyoto japan was used to obtain other chemical components 59 23 sio2 20 11 al2o3 5 99 fe2o3 3 1 k2o 1 96 mgo 1 65 na2o 0 73 tio2

2018a 3 2 characterization of coal mine water from 15 october 2015 to 22 august 2017 the coal mine water has been collected for 6 times at the outlet of an underground coal mine sump which was used to store mine water from the 22 308 working face of the bulianta coal mine the average pump flow from the 22 308 working face was 50 m3 h the coal mine water was comprised of 10 30 groundwater and 70 90 sewage involving cooling cleaning operation of equipment during mining etc after being filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane within 24 h they were kept at 4 c in the dark before determination according to the chemical analysis results of 6 samples at the same place the concentrations of no2 n no3 n doc and ec of the mine water varied from 13 23 32 52 mg l 0 42 9 08 mg l 86 1 174 mg l and 3558 5548 μs cm respectively since the collected water was mainly sewage during coal mining their high contents of no2 n might be due to nitrate incomplete denitrification during water flow and storage in the sump before the water was pumped into no 1 underground reservoir and the lack of nitrite reducing bacteria in the mine water rich in salinity would induce accumulation of nitrite despite high contents of organic carbon in the water rivett et al 2008 wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 also found the obvious nitrite accumulation during nitrate transportation in a loose pore geothermal reservoir and the production of nitrite increased with temperature 20 c 65 c despite the instability of nitrite in water the coal mine water used in this work was collected at the same place on 22 august 2017 its characteristics during phase i 0 1016 h and phase ii 1016 1352 h of subsequent column experiments sections 3 3 and 4 are listed in table 1 the average values of all chemical and physical parameters of the mine water mentioned in table 1 during phase ii were 6 26 higher than that during phase i the differences in water quality could be due to the heterogeneity of mine water and the preserving time of the studied mine water before determination and using could also affect the water quality 3 3 column design the used experimental setup is shown in fig 1 two identical acrylic columns 0 11 m i d and 0 9 m height were prepared for the hand packing of the air dried coal gangue as described in section 3 1 the structure of the column and the method of packing the matrix were the same as those used in our previous studies zhao et al 2014 2017 2018a 2018b the bulk density value of the packed matrix in the column was 1 7 g cm3 the column setups were placed in darkness inside an incubator as described previously to simulate the temperature environment of the studied underground reservoir wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2018b although zhao et al 2018a have reported the removal of dom and ammonium from coal mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir through column experiments the removal and transformation mechanisms of dom and nitrogen were not understood clearly within the short test period 6 44 pore volumes pv moreover the transport mechanism of a non reactive tracer chloride is helpful for enriching our understanding of adsorption and biological transformation of dom and nitrogen in the studied underground reservoir matrix referring to the in situ hydraulic residence time 354 386 h column experiments were carried out here at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h with a hydraulic residence time of 81 h for 12 5 pore volumes pv of column effluents about 1016 h at 30 c firstly phase i after saturation and the values of doc and electrical conductivity of the outflow less than 5 mg l and 110 μs cm respectively wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 2018a thereafter the darcy flux was increased to 0 62 cm h for 8 pv of column effluents about 336 h at 30 c phase ii to analyze the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on the removal efficiencies of nitrogen and dom from the studied coal mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir lei et al 2007 during phase i and phase ii columns were operated in a vertical position with rising flow from the coal mine drainage vessel in order to expel the atmosphere in the input mine water and gaseous nitrogen compounds i e no n2o n2 or co2 produced through nitrogen no3 n and no2 n reduction from the outlet top of the column during experiments as described in the literature muñoz leoz et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018a 3 4 sampling and analysis samples including the influent and effluent of columns were collected by using a sampling bottle at pre set time intervals the oxidation reduction potential orp was simultaneously determined for part of the eluted liquid in order to study the dynamic changes of dom and nitrogen during the transport of mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane stored at 4 c and measured for the chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn no3 n no2 n nh4 n ph and electrical conductivity ec in no more than 24 h after sampling matilainen et al 2011 part of the samples were measured for cl so4 2 total fe na k mg2 and ca2 in no more than 7 d a toc lcsh shimadzu corporation japan with a detector for the content of total nitrogen tn was used to determine the concentrations of doc and tn cod was measured by closed reflux method using potassium dichromate no3 n no2 n so4 2 and cl concentrations were determined by using ion exchange chromatography ics 3000 dionex co united states nh4 n concentrations were determined by performing conventional nesslerization uv 2600 420 nm k ca2 mg2 fe3 and na were measured by using atomic adsorption spectrometry tas 990 deionized water was used for the blank sample to make up reagents and clean the quartz cell between samples all data in this specific study were the averaged values of the two sequential samples which had an error within 5 3 5 transport model as a non reactive tracer the vertical 1d transport of chloride in the packed matrix could be described by the convection dispersion equation cde as toride et al 1995 florido et al 2010 wang et al 2013 1 c t q θ c x d 2 c x 2 where c g cm3 is the solute concentration in the liquid phase q cm h is the darcy s flux θ is the porosity saturated water content t h is time x cm is depth d cm2 h is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient also termed as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient longitudinal dispersivity λ is given by florido et al 2010 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 2 λ d ν dθ q 3 6 parameter estimation and data processing the model parameter d was estimated by using the the computer program cxtfit2 1 toride et al 1995 the program was based on a nonlinear least squares fit of the laboratory measurements obtained from the chloride displacement experiments to the simulated values under flux type boundary conditions the number of pore volumes pv for the column effluents could be calculated by 3 pv vc v 0 where v0 is the pore volume of the saturated matrix column cm3 and vc is the cumulative volume of column effluent cm3 because the dissolution of formed no n2o and n2 in the effluent solution could be neglected during column experiments the concentration of organic nitrogen mg l in the liquid with curtain volume could usually be calculated by the formula presented below

and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the liquid phase respectively cno3 n mg l cno2 n mg l and cnh4 n mg l are the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the liquid phase respectively the differences between the effluent and influent values for the concentrations of nh4 n c nh4 n organic nitrogen c orgn nitrite nitrogen c no2 n and tn nitrogen c tn could be calculated by the formula

effluent respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of transport parameters fig 2 shows chloride dynamics for the effluent and influent over time during phase i and phase ii as shown in the figure cl concentrations at the outlet of the column accounted for more than 98 of the injected one 351 9 372 9 mg l after the water in the columns was entirely displaced by the input solution considering the constant chloride concentration in the influent c0 351 9 mg l at the first 200 h of phase i 0 2 47pv fig 3 shows the fitted and observed breakthrough curves btcs of chloride at this period the observed chloride btcs were plotted according to its relative concentrations c c0 and pore volume pv as shown in fig 3 hollow symbols as shown in fig 3 the observed chloride btc at 0 200 h of phase i was almost symmetrical indicating that the packing of the coal gangue column was uniform and chloride moved through the coal gangue column with minimal preferential flow assuming that the retardation factor r was equal to 1 and q being fixed to 0 32 cm h the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d was estimated by using the cde model as defined in cxtfit 2 1 toride et al 1995 through analyzing the observed chloride btcs the fitted result at 30 c is presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the chloride transport in the packed matrix column at 30 c at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h can all be well fitted by the cde model with r 2 of 0 996 thus the vertical 1d transport of chloride through the studied coal mine underground reservoir matrix could follow cde model well suggesting that chloride is not reactive with the packed matrix the calculated values of molecular diffusion coefficient d f mechanical dispersion coefficient d h peclet number represented by p porosity θ and dispersivity λ are presented in table 2 as shown in the table the calculated porosity value of the packed matrix was 0 22 close to the in situ average porosity of 0 25 the calculated pe was much lower than the reported values meng and li 2004 ye et al 2004 wang et al 2013 bryant et al 2003 reported that the effect of dispersion was much more pronounced at lower values 1 100 of pe thus the role of dispersion for the transport of chloride was obvious in the packed coal gangue column which could also be confirmed by the simulated and computed high values of d d f d h and λ the higher value of λ than the reported values ranging from 0 1 to 2 6 cm could be highly correlated with temperature grain size and characteristics of the packed matrix in the current work bolshov et al 2008 jellali et al 2010 wang et al 2013 toride et al 2003 zhao et al 2016 recently jin et al 2017 proposed a triple effect model to characterize mass flow in self affine rough fractures considering the scale and size effects however it is hard to obtain detailed surface geometries in practice 4 2 variations in no3 n no2 n nh4 n and organic nitrogen concentrations fig 4 a b shows no3 n and no2 n concentrations of the influent and effluent solution over time during phase i and phase ii as illustrated in fig 4 a b the effluent concentrations of nitrite and nitrate were around the background values during phase i and phase ii despite the high content of nitrite in the input solution indicating the complete removal of nitrite and nitrate during experiments according to the literatures the lower orp values 15 118 mv and higher carbon to nitrogen c n ratio in the input mine water 2 04 6 25 than the reported values of 250 mv and 1 25 respectively were favourable for heterotrophic denitrification to proceed to molecular nitrogen as the flowing equation expresses her and huang 1995 majumder et al 2008 thayalakumaran et al 2008 qian et al 2011 sahinkaya et al 2011 ge et al 2012 9 5 c h 2 o 4 n o 3 2 n 2 4 hc o 3 h 2 c o 3 2 h 2 o under different conditions such as nitrate concentration c n ratio ph types of electron donors and denitrifier etc the intermediates of no and n2o might be formed although n2 was the ultimate production of denitrification as the flowing equation describes moteith et al 1980 clement et al 1997 su and puls 2007 rivett et al 2008 liu et al 2013 10 n o 3 n o 2 no n 2 o n 2 in addition the removal of tn in the effluent during column experiments as described in sections 4 3 and 4 4 could also confirm the formation of gaseous nitrogen compounds i e no n2o or n2 which were not determined in this study because the increasing of nitrate content in the effluent was not observed during the whole experiments the oxidization of nitrite to nitrate in the simulated underground reservoir with low content of dissolved oxygen could not be affirmative as the following equation describes 11 n o 2 o 2 n o 3 fig 4 c shows the nh4 n and organic nitrogen concentrations in the column influent and effluent during phase i and phase ii as illustrated by fig 4 c the ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the effluent ranged from 1 66 to 12 11 mg l most of which were higher than the values of the influent ranging from 1 97 mg l to 5 74 mg l during the whole test duration table 1 on the contrary the organic nitrogen concentrations in the effluent ranged from 0 04 to 11 58 mg l most of which were lower than the values of the influent between 8 8 and 12 82 mg l during the experiments additionally the organic nitrogen concentration decreased while the ammonium nitrogen concentration increased gradually after the breakthrough point of chloride 128 h 1 58pv during phase i thereafter the organic nitrogen concentration reached the minimum value of 2 4 mg l whereas the ammonium nitrogen reached the maximum value of 12 11 mg l at the same time 200h fig 4 d shows the variation trends of c nh4 n and c orgn over time during phase i and phase ii as shown in fig 4 d the value of c nh4 n was close to that of c orgn at the same sampling point after the breakthrough point of chloride during phase i thus ammonification which describes the release of ammonium ion from organic n compounds through enzymatically catalysed microbial processes occurred under the anoxic environment in the simulated underground reservoir during the column experiments brunet et al 2008 dempster et al 2012 nádudvari and fabiańska 2015 carswell et al 2016 the initial step during its process is the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen to their monomeric components for example proteins could be hydrolysed by proteinases and peptidases to their constituent amino acids which in turn are deaminated to release ammonium the general reaction could be summarized as 12 protein proteinases peptides peptidases amino acids deamination organic acid nh 4 the deamination of organic acids in the above equation can be expressed as 13 r ch cooh nh 2 3 h 2 e deamination r ch 2 cooh nh 4 and the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea induced by the enzymatically catalysed microbial process of nucleic acids could also release ammonium as the following equation describes 14 nh 2 co nh 2 3 h 2 o hydrolysis nh 4 2 oh co 2 notably the values of c nh4 n and c orgn increased firstly and reached the maximum at the same time 200 h thereafter they decreased with time during phase i and tended to be stable combining with the formation of stable microbial environment in the studied coal mine underground reservoir during phase ii according to the measured results during the whole test duration the concentrations of fe3 of the most effluent samples 4 3 11 76 mg l were higher than that of the influent 3 87 5 32 mg l suggesting the releasing of fe3 from the packed coal gangue in addition the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 of the influent were between 79 12 95 43 mg l and 56 12 84 84 mg l table 1 respectively thus the adsorption of ammonium could be inhibited by fe3 ca2 and mg2 in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir in addition when the input solution was displaced by deionized water at the end of experiments the concentrations of ammonium ion in the effluent were between 1 69 3 61 mg l without obvious increasing trend the result could also confirm that the adsorption ammonium ion onto the packed matrix could be neglected hence the values of c nh4 n could present the levels of ammonification production during column experiments 4 3 variations in tn concentrations fig 5 shows the variations of tn over time during phase i and phase ii as shown in fig 5 the tn concentrations in the effluent increased gradually with time and reached the maximum value of 17 69 mg l at 248 h during phase i thereafter the values of tn concentration in the effluent during phase i were between 13 28 and 17 69 mg l accounting for 28 5 42 7 of the input values when the darcy flux increased from 0 32 cm h to 0 62 cm h during phase ii the values of tn concentration in the effluent ranged between 12 09 and 15 91 mg l amounting to 24 44 9 of the input values thus the removal efficiencies of tn during phase i 57 3 71 5 were close to the values obtained during phase ii 55 1 76 the result indicated that the effect of the darcy flux ranging from 0 32 cm h to 0 62 cm h on the removal efficiency of tn could be negligible during the transport of mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir fig 6 shows the variation trends of c no2 n and c tn over time during phase i and phase ii as illustrated by the figure the value of c no2 n was close to that of c tn after the breakthrough point of chloride during the elution experiments thus the removal of tn in the effluent mine water was mainly due to the nitrite biological denitrification 4 4 nitrogen mass balance calculations table 3 shows the nitrogen tn no2 n no3 n and orgn removal and their total mass in the inlet and outlet during phase i and phase ii as illustrated in table 3 the removal efficiency of no2 n during the whole test duration is 99 95 confirming the complete denitrification of nitrite as described in section 4 2 considering the fractional nitrate released from the packed coal gangue and the low content of nitrate in the input mine water 0 42 0 66 mg l the calculated total removal efficiencies of no3 n during 2 phases were between 79 09 79 99 which were lower than that of no2 n the removal of organic nitrogen was almost equal to the production of nh4 n as shown in table 3 during phase i indicating the removal of organic nitrogen could be completely attributed to ammonification during the period given the weakening of ammonification during phase ii the removal efficiency of organic nitrogen was obvious lower during phase ii than that during phase i while the variation trend of tn removal efficiency was opposite during 2 phases since the elevated removal efficiencies of cod and doc during phase ii section 4 5 the organic nitrogen in the studied mine water was less suitable for acting as electron donor participating in denitrification than the other organic matter during the transport of mine water through the packed coal gangue during phase ii according to the variation trends of nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn and nitrogen mass balance calculation result as described in table 3 it is difficult to confirm the occurrence of dnra in the current work despite the suitable ph value and high organic carbon contents in the studied mine water as described in section 4 5 decatanzaro et al 1987 yin et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 4 5 variations in cod and doc concentrations fig 7 a b shows the variations of cod and doc over time at 30 c during phase i and phase ii in the column experiments the variations of normalized concentrations c c 0 of cod and doc during phase i and phase ii are shown in fig 7 c as illustrated by fig 7 a c the variation trends of cod and doc with time were similar during phase i and phase ii moreover the breakthrough points of the effluent concentrations of cod and doc were all 72 h later than that of chloride 128 h during phase i as shown in fig 7 a c and fig 3 the delayed breakthrough curves of cod and doc during phase i could be attributed to the adsorption of dom onto the coal gangue during its transport through the simulated coal mine underground reservoir according to the x ray diffraction xrd analysis the content of clay minerals including illite kaolinite chlorite in the studied matrix was 43 3 the strong adsorption capacity of these clay minerals contributed to the delayed breakthrough of cod and doc in the current work gao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 jabłońska et al 2017 wu et al 2017 after 200 h the measured values of cod and doc in the effluent were 32 42 and 34 51 of the input values table 1 during phase i respectively the corresponding removal efficiencies of cod and doc were individually 58 68 and 49 66 with the average value of 62 and 56 respectively which were correlated with the exhaustion and biodegradation of organic pollutants through ammonification denitrification etc as shown in fig 7 a c when the darcy flux during phase ii increased almost 2 times of the value during phase i the concentrations and c c 0 of cod and doc in the effluent decreased and increased alternately considering the altering of microbial environment induced by the increasing of hrt and the unstable composition of the input mine water according to the literatures velocity of water flow usually has a negative effect on the adsorption and biodegradation capacity of inorganic and organic pollutants in water jellali et al 2010 however the removal efficiencies of cod and doc during phase ii were 60 76 average 68 and 54 72 average 63 respectively which were still a slightly higher than the values as described during phase i as shown in table 1 the average values of cod doc nh4 n no2 n tn cl so4 2 fe3 na k mg2 ca2 and ec during phase i are higher than those measured during phase ii thus the opposite results obtained in the current work could be correlated with the changes of microbial not measured in the current work physical and chemical compositions of the input mine water table 1 4 6 ec and ph the temporal variations of ec and ph during phase i and phase ii of the effluent and influent are shown in fig 8 a b as illustrated by fig 8 a the effluent ec increased sharply from 108 to 3248 μs cm before the breakthrough point of chloride 128 h during phase i thereafter it increased gradually and fluctuated between 82 and 98 of the input values during phase i during phase ii the values of ec in the effluent decreased and increased alternately in accordance with the variation trends of cod doc and tn fig 5 and fig 8 a c thus the values of ec were easily affected by the contents of dom and nitrogen in the studied coal mine underground reservoir the temporal variations of ph during phase i and phase ii are shown in fig 8 b as illustrated in fig 8 b the lowest ph occurred at 247 h which was 47 h later than the time that the maximum concentration of ammonium nitrogen 12 11 mg l reached during experiments although the effluent ph increased gradually during the whole test duration it was still below the value of the influent during the ammonification process as described in section 4 2 the released ammonium ion in the water could be hydrolysed to produce h which could induce a decrease of ph value in the effluent 15 nh 4 h 2 o n h 3 h 2 o h in addition high content of bicarbonate ion and low content of ca2 in the input solution as shown in table 1 would result in the formation of calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide hussein et al 2012 qin et al 2013 16 2 hc o 3 c a 2 ca hc o 3 2 17 2 ca hc o 3 2 2 cac o 3 h 2 o 2 c o 2 the formed soluble carbon dioxide during the above process and the microbial biodegradation of dom through denitrification mineralization etc as described in sections 4 2 and 4 4 could affect the carbonate balance in the studied underground reservoir reaction 18 majumder et al 2008 mook et al 2012 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2018b then hydrogen ion was produced through reaction 19 gurugnanam et al 2010

also induce the drop of ph in the effluent consequently the value of ph in the solution eluted from the column was lower than that in the input solution 5 conclusion the chloride breakthrough curve at a darcy s flux of 0 32 cm h at 30 c in a studied coal mine underground reservoir could be well simulated by using the convection dispersion equation in the cxtfit2 1 low level of pe and high levels of d d f d h and λ indicated an obvious role of dispersion for the chloride transport in the packed coal gangue column considering the biological transformation of nitrate and nitrite through denitrification the effluent concentrations of these ions fluctuated around the background values despite the extremely high level of nitrite in the influent mine water ammonification of organic nitrogen induced a sharp increase of ammonium ion content in the effluent initially then the mineralization of organic nitrogen got weakened over time and the content of ammonium ion tended to be stable at the level of that in the input solution the removal efficiencies of tn were between 55 1 and 76 which were highly correlated with nitrite denitrification the delayed breakthrough curves of cod and doc at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h at 30 c could be attributed to their adsorption onto the coal gangue during their transport through the studied underground reservoir the average removal efficiencies of cod and doc at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h at 30 c were 62 and 56 respectively when the darcy flux increased to 0 62 cm h the average removal efficiencies of cod and doc increased to 68 and 63 respectively higher removal efficiencies of cod and doc at an higher darcy flux could be due to the change of microbial physical and chemical compositions of the input mine water considering the production of ammonium ion hydrogen ion and low molecular weight organic acid through ammonification and hydrolysis the ph value was lower than that in the influent during the experiments the variation trend of ec was similar to that of doc cod and nitrogen observed under the same experimental condition in general mine water could be purified through the removal of nitrite nitrate tn and dom by biological transformation during its storage and transport in a simulated coal mine underground reservoir packed with coal gangue however the releasing of metals such as fe3 from the packed coal gangue could inhibit the adsorption of ammonium ion onto the packed coal gangue and ammonification could induce an increase of ammonium ion content in the effluent mine water from the studied coal mine underground reservoir considering the high level of electronic conductivity of the effluent from the simulated coal mine underground reservoir the outlet from the coal mine underground reservoir should be desalted and treated further before it was discharged to a river or recycling in the coal mine area the findings would be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of mine water post

1585,although the technology of coal mine underground reservoirs has been widely applied in the western china little is known about the variation of water quality induced by the removal transformation of nitrogen and dissolved organic matter dom rich in mine water during its storage and transport in a coal mine underground reservoir column experiments were carried out at 30 c and at darcy fluxes ranging from 0 32 cm h to 0 64 cm h to investigate the transport parameters and dynamic changes of nitrogen and dom in a simulated underground reservoir filled with coal gangue which was composed of sandstone and mudstone results showed that chloride transport could be described by the convection dispersion equation cde well at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h wherein the dispersion role was obvious despite the high level of nitrite in the influent the effluent concentrations of nitrite and nitrate fluctuated around the background values through complete denitrification and the removal of total nitrogen tn with efficiencies between 55 1 and 76 were highly correlated with nitrite denitrification ammonification of organic nitrogen got weakened over time and the content of ammonium ion tended to be stable at the level of that in the input mine water the delayed breakthrough curves of chemical oxygen demand cod and dissolved organic carbon doc at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h could be attributed to their adsorption onto the coal gangue during their transport through the simulated underground reservoir due to the variations of microbial and compositions of the input mine water the removal efficiencies of cod and doc increased slightly from 62 to 68 56 to 63 respectively when the darcy flux increased from 0 32 cm h to 0 62 cm h the findings would be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of post treatment of mine water during its storage in an underground reservoir in coal mine areas of western china keywords coal mine underground reservoir coal gangue dissolved organic matter nitrogen mine water denitrification ammonification 1 introduction among coal oil and natural gas supplies coal accounts for approximately 70 of chinese primary energy consumption in a long term as the world s largest coal producer and consumer china records mine drainage amounts of 8 billion tons of mine water every year and only 25 of it could be utilized li et al 2015 nejat et al 2015 zhao and chen 2015 the unutilized amount of mine drainage is approximately 60 of industrial and living water scarcity in china mine water utilization should be deemed of great importance and motivate the effective management and comprehensive utilization of mine water during resource exploitation notably the coal production in shanxi shaanxi inner mongolia ningxia and gansu is approximately 840 billion tons and it constituted 65 70 of china s total coal production by the end of 2010 although coal resources are abundant in these areas of western china the surface evaporation capacity is six times higher than the amount of rainfall thus mine water evaporates quickly if it is discharged to the ground directly serious water resource shortage exists in these areas to utilize mine drainage effectively and avoid water loss through evaporation during water treatment and reservation in these areas of western china scholars have proposed a technical approach to the storage and utilization of mine water by using coal mine underground reservoirs wu and liu 2011 gu 2014 2015 cao et al 2016 artificial dams were constructed to form underground reservoirs in the abandoned goafs the technical system of coal mine underground reservoirs involves reservoir site selection water quantity prediction reservoir volume calculation dam construction safety guarantees and water quality protection gu 2014 2015 the technology of coal mine underground reservoirs has been widely applied in the western mining areas of china such as shendong baotou and xinjie among these mining areas 35 coal mine underground reservoirs were established in the shendong mining area by the end of 2015 the total maximum storage capacity of mine water for these coal mine underground reservoirs amounted to 31 million m3 in 2013 and 2014 these coal mine underground reservoirs supplied 95 4 and 95 1 of the total amount of water needed for mining activities in the shendong mining area respectively consequently approximately 123 47 million m3 of water was saved in the span of two years generating an income of approximately 2 billion yuan because of mine water utilization although the technology has been advocated in coal mine areas by the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china little is known about the variation of water quality during the storage and transport of mine water in a coal mine underground reservoir with regard to the derivation of aquifers and manufacturing activities during underground mining mine water may include complicated components such as organic compounds heavy metals h no3 no2 nh4 ca2 mg2 na so4 2 hco3 2 fe and s2 ions etc the removal of p so4 2 and metals including as zn fe mn co cu mg and ni in mine water through physical chemical and biochemical methods has been widely reported ňancucheo and johnson 2014 sapsford et al 2015 iakovleva et al 2016 rakotonimaro et al 2017 in addition the purification and neutralization of acid mine drainage have been studied thoroughly sun et al 2012 jenk et al 2014 shim et al 2015 masindi et al 2017 shabalala et al 2017 containing clay mineral contents such as illite and kaolinite the coal gangue packed in underground reservoirs could act as a useful adsorbent to reduce the contents of organic compounds and nitrogen in mine water gao et al 2015 jabłońska et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 although the removal and transformation of organic pollutants and nitrogen from domestic agriculture and industrial sewage have been extensively reported mook et al 2012 ji et al 2014 li et al 2016 hamid et al 2017 li et al 2018 little is known about the removal of these compounds in mine water during its storage and transport in coal mine underground reservoirs packed with coal gangue wu et al 2015 pujades et al 2017 qian et al 2017 ji et al 2017 álvarez et al 2018 and nitrogen mineralization has been extensively explored in soil and sludge whereas its potential under anaerobic conditions in a coal mine underground reservoir has yet to be reported hernández et al 2002 feichtinger et al 2004 widowati et al 2012 gomez muñoz et al 2017 therefore efforts should be made to explore the dynamic changes of nitrogen and dom of mine water so as to enrich our understanding of the removal mechanisms of these matters during their transport in a coal mine underground reservoir in western china and the variation of water quality induced by nitrogen and dom biological transformation are also worth investigating in the study area the research would be significant to evaluate the feasibility of the coal mine underground reservoirs technology in western china the current study aims to 1 evaluate the transport mechanism of non reactive tracer in a simulated coal mine underground reservoir through column experiments 2 investigate the transformation mechanism of nitrogen at different darcy flux under the simulated coal mine underground reservoir conditions and 3 quantify the dynamic changes of dom through the determination of doc cod and organic nitrogen during the transport of mine water at darcy fluxes of 0 32 cm h and 0 62 cm h 2 study area as a major coal mine in the shendong mining area the bulianta coal mine is located northwest of ulanmulun town yinjinhuoluo county ordos city inner mongolia province china the study area belongs to the semi arid and semi desert plateau continental climate zone the precipitation ranges from 194 7 mm year 1 to 531 6 mm year 1 with the average value being 357 3 mm year 1 the evapotranspiration ranges from 2 297 4 mm year 1 to 2 833 7 mm year 1 with the average value being 2 457 4 mm year 1 in the last 30 years thus the evapotranspiration is 5 11 times the precipitation in the study area the bulianta coal mine with a mining area of 106 34 km2 ranging from 39 17 22 n 109 58 03 e to 39 23 32 n 110 10 18 e was established in 1987 the coal bearing strata of the coal mine comprise middle lower yanan formation of jurassic the nos 1 2 2 2 and 3 1 coal seams mainly mined in the area have the average coal thicknesses of 3 18 m 6 65 m and 3 27 m respectively the burial depth of the coal bed is 177 257 m with 50 2 years as the remaining service life the approved production capacity of coal for the study area in 2015 was 28 million tons year the average water inflow to the coal mine is 431 5 m3 h with the maximum value being 677 m3 h three underground reservoirs have been established since 2010 to store and purify mine water in the pores of filled rocks in the abandoned goaf the actual water total storage has amounted to 536 000 m3 according to information provided by the technical staff of the mining company the average porosity for the reservoirs is 0 25 the water storage in no 1 underground reservoir established by using abandoned goaf in 22 301 22 306 working face is 85 000 m3 before the water was pumped into the underground reservoir it was stored in a coal mine sump the discharge rate pumped to the reservoir is between 220 and 240 m3 h and the hydraulic residence time in the underground reservoir is 354 386 h 3 materials and methods 3 1 column material the coal gangue composed of sandstone and mudstone was collected from the strata of middle lower yanan formation of jurassic in the 22 308 working face of the bulianta coal mine located northwest of ulanmulun town yinjinhuoluo county ordos city inner mongolia province china 39 17 36 n 110 12 13 e zhao et al 2017 before use all samples were air dried crushed and ground to pass through a 5 mm screen the carbon content in the coal gangue was 1 85

2018a 3 2 characterization of coal mine water from 15 october 2015 to 22 august 2017 the coal mine water has been collected for 6 times at the outlet of an underground coal mine sump which was used to store mine water from the 22 308 working face of the bulianta coal mine the average pump flow from the 22 308 working face was 50 m3 h the coal mine water was comprised of 10 30 groundwater and 70 90 sewage involving cooling cleaning operation of equipment during mining etc after being filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane within 24 h they were kept at 4 c in the dark before determination according to the chemical analysis results of 6 samples at the same place the concentrations of no2 n no3 n doc and ec of the mine water varied from 13 23 32 52 mg l 0 42 9 08 mg l 86 1 174 mg l and 3558 5548 μs cm respectively since the collected water was mainly sewage during coal mining their high contents of no2 n might be due to nitrate incomplete denitrification during water flow and storage in the sump before the water was pumped into no 1 underground reservoir and the lack of nitrite reducing bacteria in the mine water rich in salinity would induce accumulation of nitrite despite high contents of organic carbon in the water rivett et al 2008 wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 also found the obvious nitrite accumulation during nitrate transportation in a loose pore geothermal reservoir and the production of nitrite increased with temperature 20 c 65 c despite the instability of nitrite in water the coal mine water used in this work was collected at the same place on 22 august 2017 its characteristics during phase i 0 1016 h and phase ii 1016 1352 h of subsequent column experiments sections 3 3 and 4 are listed in table 1 the average values of all chemical and physical parameters of the mine water mentioned in table 1 during phase ii were 6 26 higher than that during phase i the differences in water quality could be due to the heterogeneity of mine water and the preserving time of the studied mine water before determination and using could also affect the water quality 3 3 column design the used experimental setup is shown in fig 1 two identical acrylic columns 0 11 m i d and 0 9 m height were prepared for the hand packing of the air dried coal gangue as described in section 3 1 the structure of the column and the method of packing the matrix were the same as those used in our previous studies zhao et al 2014 2017 2018a 2018b the bulk density value of the packed matrix in the column was 1 7 g cm3 the column setups were placed in darkness inside an incubator as described previously to simulate the temperature environment of the studied underground reservoir wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2018b although zhao et al 2018a have reported the removal of dom and ammonium from coal mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir through column experiments the removal and transformation mechanisms of dom and nitrogen were not understood clearly within the short test period 6 44 pore volumes pv moreover the transport mechanism of a non reactive tracer chloride is helpful for enriching our understanding of adsorption and biological transformation of dom and nitrogen in the studied underground reservoir matrix referring to the in situ hydraulic residence time 354 386 h column experiments were carried out here at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h with a hydraulic residence time of 81 h for 12 5 pore volumes pv of column effluents about 1016 h at 30 c firstly phase i after saturation and the values of doc and electrical conductivity of the outflow less than 5 mg l and 110 μs cm respectively wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 2018a thereafter the darcy flux was increased to 0 62 cm h for 8 pv of column effluents about 336 h at 30 c phase ii to analyze the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on the removal efficiencies of nitrogen and dom from the studied coal mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir lei et al 2007 during phase i and phase ii columns were operated in a vertical position with rising flow from the coal mine drainage vessel in order to expel the atmosphere in the input mine water and gaseous nitrogen compounds i e no n2o n2 or co2 produced through nitrogen no3 n and no2 n reduction from the outlet top of the column during experiments as described in the

time intervals the oxidation reduction potential orp was simultaneously determined for part of the eluted liquid in order to study the dynamic changes of dom and nitrogen during the transport of mine

estimation and data processing the model parameter d was estimated by using the the computer program cxtfit2 1 toride et al 1995 the program was based on a nonlinear least squares fit of the

calculated by 3 pv vc v 0 where v0 is the pore volume of the saturated matrix column cm3 and vc is the cumulative volume of column effluent cm3 because the dissolution of formed no n2o and n2 in the effluent solution could be neglected during column experiments the concentration of organic nitrogen mg l in the liquid with curtain volume could usually be calculated by the formula presented below

figure cl concentrations at the outlet of the column accounted for more than 98 of the injected one 351 9 372 9 mg l after the water in the columns was entirely displaced by the input solution considering the constant chloride concentration in the influent c0 351 9 mg l at the first 200 h of phase i 0 2 47pv fig 3 shows the fitted and observed breakthrough curves btcs of chloride at this period the observed chloride btcs were plotted according to its relative concentrations c c0 and pore volume pv as shown in fig 3 hollow symbols as shown in fig 3 the observed chloride btc at 0 200 h of phase i was almost symmetrical indicating that the packing of the coal gangue column was uniform and chloride moved through the coal gangue column with minimal preferential flow assuming that the retardation factor r was equal to 1 and q being fixed to 0 32 cm h the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d was estimated by using the cde model as defined in cxtfit 2 1 toride et al 1995 through analyzing the observed chloride btcs the fitted result at 30 c is presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 and fig 3 the chloride transport in the packed matrix column at 30 c at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h can all be well fitted by the cde model with r 2 of 0 996 thus the vertical 1d transport of chloride through the studied coal mine underground reservoir matrix could follow cde model well suggesting that chloride is not reactive with the packed matrix the calculated values of molecular diffusion coefficient d f mechanical dispersion coefficient d h peclet number represented by p porosity θ and dispersivity λ are presented in table 2 as shown in the table the calculated porosity value of the packed matrix was 0 22 close to the in situ average porosity of 0 25 the calculated pe was much lower than the reported values meng and li 2004 ye et al 2004 wang et al 2013 bryant et al 2003 reported that the effect of dispersion was much more pronounced at lower values 1 100 of pe thus the role of dispersion for the transport of chloride was obvious in the packed coal gangue column which could also be confirmed by the simulated and computed high values of d d f d h and λ the higher value of λ than the reported values ranging from 0 1 to 2 6 cm could be highly correlated with temperature grain size and characteristics of the packed matrix in the current work bolshov et al 2008 jellali et al 2010 wang et al 2013 toride et al 2003 zhao et al 2016 recently jin et al 2017 proposed a triple effect model to characterize mass flow in self affine rough fractures considering the scale and size effects however it is hard to obtain detailed surface geometries in practice 4 2 variations in no3 n no2 n nh4 n and organic nitrogen concentrations fig 4 a b shows no3 n and no2 n concentrations of the influent and effluent solution over time during phase i and phase ii as illustrated in fig 4 a b the effluent concentrations of nitrite and nitrate were around the background values during phase i and phase ii despite the high content of nitrite in the input solution indicating the complete removal of nitrite and nitrate during experiments according to the literatures the lower orp values 15 118 mv and higher carbon to nitrogen c n ratio in the input mine water 2 04 6 25 than the reported values of 250 mv and 1 25 respectively were favourable for heterotrophic denitrification to proceed to molecular nitrogen as the flowing equation expresses her and huang 1995 majumder et al 2008 thayalakumaran et al 2008 qian et al 2011 sahinkaya et al 2011 ge et al 2012 9

n o 3 n o 2 no n 2 o n 2 in addition the removal of tn in the effluent during column experiments as described in sections 4 3 and 4 4 could also confirm the formation of gaseous nitrogen compounds i e no n2o or n2 which were not determined in this study because the increasing of nitrate content in the effluent was not observed during the whole experiments the oxidization of nitrite to nitrate in the simulated underground reservoir with low content of dissolved oxygen could not be affirmative as the following equation describes 11 n o 2 o 2 n o 3 fig 4 c shows the nh4 n and organic nitrogen concentrations in the column influent and effluent during phase i and phase ii as illustrated by fig 4 c the ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the effluent ranged from 1 66 to 12 11 mg l most of which were higher than the values of the influent ranging from 1 97 mg l to 5 74 mg l during the whole test duration table 1 on the contrary the organic nitrogen concentrations in the effluent ranged from 0 04 to 11 58 mg l most of which were lower than the values of the influent between 8 8 and 12 82 mg l during the experiments additionally the organic nitrogen concentration decreased while the ammonium nitrogen concentration increased gradually after the breakthrough point of chloride 128 h 1 58pv during phase i thereafter the organic nitrogen concentration reached the minimum value of 2 4 mg l whereas the ammonium nitrogen reached the maximum value of 12 11 mg l at the same time 200h fig 4 d shows the variation trends of c nh4 n and c orgn over time during phase i and phase ii as shown in fig 4 d the value of c nh4 n was close to that of c orgn at the same sampling point after the breakthrough point of chloride during phase i thus ammonification which describes the release of ammonium ion from organic n compounds through enzymatically catalysed microbial processes occurred under the anoxic environment in the simulated underground reservoir during the column experiments brunet et al 2008 dempster et al 2012 nádudvari and fabiańska 2015 carswell et al 2016 the initial step during its process is the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen to their monomeric components for example proteins could be hydrolysed by proteinases and peptidases to their constituent amino acids which in turn are deaminated to release ammonium the general reaction could be summarized as 12 protein proteinases peptides peptidases amino acids deamination organic acid nh 4 the deamination of organic acids in the above equation can be expressed as 13 r ch cooh nh 2 3 h 2 e deamination r ch 2 cooh nh 4 and the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea induced by the enzymatically catalysed microbial process of nucleic acids could also release ammonium as the following equation describes 14 nh 2 co nh 2 3 h 2 o hydrolysis nh 4 2 oh co 2 notably the values of c nh4 n and c orgn increased firstly and reached the maximum at the same time 200 h thereafter they decreased with time during phase i and tended to be stable combining with the formation of stable microbial environment in the studied coal mine underground reservoir during phase ii according to the measured results during the whole test duration the concentrations of fe3 of the most effluent samples 4 3 11 76 mg l were higher than that of the influent 3 87 5 32 mg l suggesting the releasing of fe3 from the packed coal gangue in addition the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 of the influent were between 79 12 95 43 mg l and 56 12 84 84 mg l table 1 respectively thus the adsorption of ammonium could be inhibited by fe3 ca2 and mg2 in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir in addition when the input solution was displaced by deionized water at the end of experiments the concentrations of ammonium ion in the effluent were between 1 69 3 61 mg l without obvious increasing trend the result could also confirm that the adsorption ammonium ion onto the packed matrix could be neglected hence the values of c nh4 n could present the levels of ammonification production during column experiments 4 3 variations in tn concentrations fig 5 shows the variations of tn over time during phase i and phase ii as shown in fig 5 the tn concentrations in the effluent increased gradually with time and reached the maximum value of 17 69 mg l at 248 h during phase i thereafter the values of tn concentration in the effluent during phase i were between 13 28 and 17 69 mg l accounting for 28 5 42 7 of the input values when the darcy flux increased from 0 32 cm h to 0 62 cm h during phase ii the values of tn concentration in the effluent ranged between 12 09 and 15 91 mg l amounting to 24 44 9 of the input values thus the removal efficiencies of tn during phase i 57 3 71 5 were close to the values obtained during phase ii 55 1 76 the result indicated that the effect of the darcy flux ranging from 0 32 cm h to 0 62 cm h on the removal efficiency of tn could be negligible during the transport of mine water in the simulated coal mine underground reservoir fig 6 shows the variation trends of c no2 n and c tn over time during phase i and phase ii as illustrated by the figure the value of c no2 n was close to that of c tn after the breakthrough point of chloride during the elution experiments thus the removal of tn in the effluent mine water was mainly due to the nitrite biological denitrification 4 4 nitrogen mass balance calculations table 3 shows the nitrogen tn no2 n no3 n and orgn removal and their total mass in the inlet and outlet during phase i and phase ii as illustrated in table 3 the removal efficiency of no2 n during the whole test duration is 99 95 confirming the complete denitrification of nitrite as described in section 4 2 considering the fractional nitrate released from the packed coal gangue and the low content of nitrate in the input mine water 0 42 0 66 mg l the calculated total removal efficiencies of no3 n during 2 phases were between 79 09 79 99 which were lower than that of no2 n the removal of organic nitrogen was almost equal to the production of nh4 n as shown in table 3 during phase i indicating the removal of organic nitrogen could be completely attributed to ammonification during the period given the weakening of ammonification during phase ii the removal efficiency of organic nitrogen was obvious lower during phase ii than that during phase i while the variation trend of tn removal efficiency was opposite during 2 phases since the elevated removal efficiencies of cod and doc during phase ii section 4 5 the organic nitrogen in the studied mine water was less suitable for acting as electron donor participating in denitrification than the other organic matter during the transport of mine water through the packed coal gangue during phase ii according to the variation trends of nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn and nitrogen mass balance calculation result as described in table 3 it is difficult to confirm the occurrence of dnra in the current work despite the suitable ph value and high organic carbon contents in the studied mine water as described in section 4 5 decatanzaro et al 1987 yin et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 4 5 variations in cod and doc concentrations fig 7 a b shows the variations of cod and doc over time at 30 c during phase i and phase ii in the column experiments the variations of normalized concentrations c c 0 of cod and doc during phase i and phase ii are shown in fig 7 c as illustrated by fig 7 a c the variation trends of cod and doc with time were similar during phase i and phase ii moreover the breakthrough points of the effluent concentrations of cod and doc were all 72 h later than that of chloride 128 h during phase i as shown in fig 7 a c and fig 3 the delayed breakthrough curves of cod and doc during phase i could be attributed to the adsorption of dom onto the coal gangue during its transport through the simulated coal mine underground reservoir according to the x ray diffraction xrd analysis the content of clay minerals including illite kaolinite chlorite in the studied matrix was 43 3 the strong adsorption capacity of these clay minerals contributed to the delayed breakthrough of cod and doc in the current work gao et al 2015 wang et al 2016 jabłońska et al 2017 wu et al 2017 after 200 h the measured values of cod and doc in the effluent were 32 42 and 34 51 of the input values table 1 during phase i respectively the corresponding removal efficiencies of cod and doc were individually 58 68 and 49 66 with the average value of 62 and 56 respectively which were correlated with the exhaustion and biodegradation of organic pollutants through ammonification denitrification etc as shown in fig 7 a c when the darcy flux during phase ii increased almost 2 times of the value during phase i the concentrations and c c 0 of cod and doc in the effluent decreased and increased alternately considering the altering of microbial environment induced by the increasing of hrt and the unstable composition of the input mine water according to the literatures velocity of water flow usually has a negative effect on the adsorption and biodegradation capacity of inorganic and organic pollutants in water jellali et al 2010 however the removal efficiencies of cod and doc during phase ii were 60 76 average 68 and 54 72 average 63 respectively which were still a slightly higher than the values as described during phase i as shown in table 1 the average values of cod doc nh4 n no2 n tn cl so4 2 fe3 na k mg2 ca2 and ec during phase i are higher than those measured during phase ii thus the opposite results obtained in the current work could be correlated with the changes of microbial not measured in the current work physical and chemical compositions of the input mine water table 1 4 6 ec and ph the temporal variations of ec and ph during phase i and phase ii of the effluent and influent are shown in fig 8 a b as illustrated by fig 8 a the effluent ec increased sharply from 108 to 3248 μs cm before the breakthrough point of chloride 128 h during phase i thereafter it increased gradually and fluctuated between 82 and 98 of the input values during phase i during phase ii the values of ec in the effluent decreased and increased alternately in accordance with the variation trends of cod doc and tn fig 5 and fig 8 a c thus the values of ec were easily affected by the contents of dom and nitrogen in the studied coal mine underground reservoir the temporal variations of ph during phase i and phase ii are shown in fig 8 b as illustrated in fig 8 b the lowest ph occurred at 247 h which was 47 h later than the time that the maximum concentration of ammonium nitrogen 12 11 mg l reached during experiments although the effluent ph increased gradually during the whole test duration it was still below the value of the influent during the ammonification process as described in section 4 2 the released ammonium ion in the water could be hydrolysed to produce h which could induce a decrease of ph value in the effluent 15 nh 4 h 2 o n h 3 h 2 o h in addition high content of bicarbonate ion and low content of ca2 in the input solution as shown in table 1 would result in the formation of calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide hussein et al 2012 qin et al 2013 16 2 hc o 3 c a 2 ca hc o 3 2 17 2 ca hc o 3 2 2 cac o 3 h 2 o 2 c o 2 the formed soluble carbon dioxide during the above process and the microbial biodegradation of dom through denitrification mineralization etc as described in sections 4 2 and 4 4 could affect the carbonate balance in the studied underground reservoir reaction 18 majumder et al 2008 mook et al 2012 wang et al 2016 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2018b then hydrogen ion was produced through reaction 19 gurugnanam et al 2010 pasvanoğlu and çelik 2018 18 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 19 h 2 c o 3 hc o 3 h and the formed low molecular weight organic acid during dom biodegradation such as the hydrolysis of proteins reaction 12 could also induce the drop of ph in the effluent consequently the value of ph in the solution eluted from the column was lower than that in the input solution 5 conclusion the chloride breakthrough curve at a darcy s flux of 0 32 cm h at 30 c in a studied coal mine underground reservoir could be well simulated by using the convection dispersion equation in the cxtfit2 1 low level of pe and high levels of d d f d h and λ indicated an obvious role of dispersion for the chloride transport in the packed coal gangue column considering the biological transformation of nitrate and nitrite through denitrification the effluent concentrations of these ions fluctuated around the background values despite the extremely high level of nitrite in the influent mine water ammonification of organic nitrogen induced a sharp increase of ammonium ion content in the effluent initially then the mineralization of organic nitrogen got weakened over time and the content of ammonium ion tended to be stable at the level of that in the input solution the removal efficiencies of tn were between 55 1 and 76 which were highly correlated with nitrite denitrification the delayed breakthrough curves of cod and doc at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h at 30 c could be attributed to their adsorption onto the coal gangue during their transport through the studied underground reservoir the average removal efficiencies of cod and doc at a darcy flux of 0 32 cm h at 30 c were 62 and 56 respectively when the darcy flux increased to 0 62 cm h the average removal efficiencies of cod and doc increased to 68 and 63 respectively higher removal efficiencies of cod and doc at an higher darcy flux could be due to the change of microbial physical and chemical compositions of the input mine water considering the production of ammonium ion hydrogen ion and low molecular weight organic acid through ammonification and hydrolysis the ph value was lower than that in the influent during the experiments the variation trend of ec was similar to that of doc cod and nitrogen observed under the same experimental condition in general mine water could be purified through the removal of nitrite nitrate tn and dom by biological transformation during its storage and transport in a simulated coal mine underground reservoir packed with coal gangue however the releasing of metals such as fe3 from the packed coal gangue could inhibit the adsorption of ammonium ion onto the packed coal gangue and ammonification could induce an increase of ammonium ion content in the effluent mine water from the studied coal mine underground reservoir considering the high level of electronic conductivity of the effluent from the simulated coal mine underground reservoir the outlet from the coal mine underground reservoir should be desalted and treated further before it was discharged to a river or recycling in the coal mine area the findings would be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of mine water post treatment during its storage in an underground reservoir in coal mine areas of western china acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china

1586,radionuclide contamination of groundwater causes critical impacts on water resources human lives and ecosystems the intrusion of radionuclides into the groundwater flow system in fukushima japan could be illuminated by determining groundwater age and mixing processes to do this periodical field surveys were conducted in catchments contaminated by the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant accident sampling began in may 2011 which was 2 months after the disaster and continued through june 2012 chlorofluorocarbon cfcs tritium and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were used as environmental tracers the observed tritium concentrations suggested that the water contained accident derived radionuclides that exceeded the natural background baseline groundwater ages in the selected two headwater catchments were estimated to be between 10 and 26 years by combined use of multiple cfcs concentrations in addition the governing groundwater flow system was mostly approximated by a piston flow model however modern water fraction was also suggested based on the relationship between cfc 11 and cfc 12 the estimated water age and isotopic signals among stream water spring water and groundwater revealed that the intrusion of radionuclides into the groundwater was caused by the mixing between groundwater and modern water sources such as soil water and precipitation with relatively high radionuclide concentrations this mixing was facilitated by a weathered and fractured granite bedrock and a thin unsaturated subsurface layer in the study area continued long term monitoring of radionuclides in the groundwater will be necessary for water resources management in the future capsule radionuclide intrusion into the groundwater is related to the mixing between radionuclide poor groundwater and modern water with relatively high radionuclide concentration keywords tritium cfcs groundwater age fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant headwater catchment 1 introduction substantial concentrations of radionuclides were released to the environment during the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident which was caused by the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan on march 11 2011 this contamination is expected to have a detrimental impact on water resources human life and local ecosystems tritium and radiocesium 137cs both leaked from fdnpp have radioactive half lives of 12 3 years and 30 2 years respectively due to the possibility of continuous environmental impacts a lot of research has studied their behavior in the environment after the fdnpp accident e g matsumoto et al 2013 kato et al 2012a 2012b tritium was leaked into the atmosphere from the damaged reactor units at fdnpp as a tritiated water hto vapor which was then washed out of the atmosphere by precipitation matsumoto et al 2013 after being integrated into the soil water stream water and groundwater of the region tritium dynamics in the environment were governed by the natural hydrological cycle matsumoto et al 2013 observed the tritium concentrations in the precipitation falling on several cities within 700 km from fdnpp they reported that the tritium concentrations immediately after the fdnpp accident as high as 160 tritium units tu greatly exceeded the natural background 6 tu and that these concentrations rapidly returned to the natural background tritium concentrations in river water in the fukushima prefecture were investigated by ueda et al 2015 temporal changes in the tritium concentrations in river water followed a trend which was similar to that of precipitation it greatly exceeded the natural background shortly after the fdnpp accident before rapidly decreasing to the natural background more recently the fdnpp oriented tritium was reported in the seawater around 100 km away from the fdnpp and this indicated the important role of precipitation in spreading of the fdnpp derived tritium kaizer et al 2018 from the perspective of water resources management the fdnpp derived tritium in groundwater recharge areas such as headwaters cannot be neglected kashiwaya et al 2018 observed the tritium concentration in groundwater of the coastal region near the fdnpp after the accident and these values were between 1 8 tu and 12 9 tu however few research has reported tritium concentrations in groundwater in the headwater regions and there are still lack of idea of the fdnpp derived tritium impact on the water resources radiocesium is another radionuclide that was prominently released from fdnpp however it is not incorporated into the molecular structure of water like tritium as a result the environmental behavior of radiocesium is different from that of tritium the depositional distribution of radiocesium in the environment has been studied with airborne surveys and soil surveys ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext 2011 saito et al 2014 and about 70 of the area where radiocesium was deposited was a forested area hashimoto et al 2012 radiocesium was first intercepted by the forest canopy kato et al 2012a and its subsequent migration to the forest floor by throughfall stemflow and litterfall was monitored kato et al 2017 radiocesium profiles in the soil showed that most radiocesium remained within the top 5 cm kato et al 2012b matsunaga et al 2013 takahashi et al 2015 radiocesium in the soil is known to be strongly adsorbed onto clay minerals cremers et al 1988 walling 1998 so its subsequent migration will be restricted to the physical movement of soil particles by soil erosion yoshimura et al 2015 after studying the groundwater in two headwater catchments in the radionuclide contaminated area in fukushima iwagami et al 2017b reported dissolved 137cs concentrations in the range of 0 0 0 039 bq l and 0 0 0 013 bq l while these concentrations are low 137cs derived from the fdnpp accident was detectable in the groundwater several months after the accident iwagami et al 2017a also reported 2 5 bq l as the maximum dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water in the same headwater catchments however the interactions and exchanges of radionuclides between different water bodies are still not clear effective water resources management and groundwater conservation in the fukushima prefecture will require clarification of the origin of 137cs and its intrusion processes into the groundwater however such answers remain elusive due to a lack of understanding of the groundwater flow system in the region affected by the fdnpp accident groundwater residence time age is a critical metric for determining water origin flow paths and mixing processes hence it is a key to understanding the entire groundwater flow system mcdonnell et al 2010 molson and frind 2012 in order to determine groundwater age previous studies have used tritium and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs as tracers e g busenberg and plummer 1992 hiyama et al 2013 sturchio et al 2014 tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen often incorporated into water molecules and its concentration in the groundwater changes only due to radioactive decay iaea 1967 morgenstern and daughney 2012 xu et al 2018 cfcs are a group of excellent tracing gases because they are highly conservative in the environment iaea 2006 long term variations in tritium and cfc concentrations in precipitation and atmosphere have been recorded iaea 2006 establishing a baseline that makes it possible to determine the age of tritium or cfcs in a system this makes them useful for determining water age as well additionally simultaneous use of these dating tracers can reveal water mixing processes darling et al 2012 therefore the objective of this research is to evaluate impacts of the fdnpp oriented radionuclide on groundwater resources by investigating the groundwater age and water mixing processes with environmental tracers such as stable isotopes tritium and cfcs in the headwater catchments affected by the fdnpp accident this study is also the first to report groundwater age in the radionuclide contaminated headwater region and it attempts to determine the causes of radionuclide intrusion into the groundwater flow system 2 study area this study was undertaken in two small headwater catchments in the yamakiya district fukushima prefecture japan iboishi yama catchment ibo 0 17 km2 71 forested 44 conifer 27 broad leaf and koutaishi yama catchment kou 0 54 km2 94 forested 72 conifer 22 broad leaf the catchments are located 35 km northwest of fdnpp and received heavy local fallout 300 1000 kbq m2 of 137cs after the fdnpp accident mext 2011 the average 137cs deposition densities in the ibo and kou catchment areas were 544 and 916 kbq m2 respectively mext 2011 the catchments are located at the headwaters of the abukuma river which is the major river in fukushima prefecture and is an important industrial and domestic water resource its importance is the principal motivation for research into radionuclide transition processes in the environment iwagami et al 2017b reported dissolved 137cs concentrations in the groundwater in the same areas as this study however the groundwater flow system has not been clarified yet a map of the study area with contour lines of 137cs deposition is shown in fig 1 from mext 2011 and iwagami et al 2017b the structure and average groundwater depth at each borehole with the maximum 137cs concentration observed by iwagami et al 2017b are also shown in fig 1 the underlying bedrock in this region is granite watanabe et al 1955 data from the drilling of the boreholes suggested that the main basement rock in the study area is granitic and also includes a crack containing layer and a weathered sedimentary layer 3 methods 3 1 water sampling and isotope cfc analyses water sampling campaigns were undertaken to determine oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h and concentrations of tritium 3h and cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 samples were collected from the stream water spring water and groundwater at each borehole in the ibo and kou headwater catchments from may 2011 which was 2 months after the fdnpp accident to june 2012 rainwater was collected from may 2015 to may 2017 at the location just several kilometers away from the two catchments samples for the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions tritium and cfc analyses were collected in 250 ml polypropylene bottles 1 l polypropylene bottles and 100 ml glass bottles respectively groundwater samples for cfc analysis were collected in triplicate to consider the measurement error in order to avoid atmospheric contamination of the groundwater samples a nylon tube connecting the appropriate pump geo pump bennett 1400 was placed at the bottom of the bottle so that any air contaminated water would be pushed up and out of the bottle by pure groundwater after overflowing the sample by at least 1 l the tube was carefully removed the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions were measured using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i the measured stable isotopic compositions were expressed using conventional δ notations as permil deviations from vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical accuracies of the stable isotopic compositions of 18o and 2h were 0 1 and 0 5 respectively tritium concentration was determined by liquid scintillation counting tri carb 2000ca ll and hidex 300sl after electrolytic enrichment at the university of tsukuba ibaraki japan each water sample was analyzed at least nine times to determine the analytical error the obtained tritium concentrations were expressed in tu 1 tu 1 3h 1018h analysis of the dissolved cfcs concentrations was performed using a purge and trap gas chromatography procedure busenberg and plummer 1992 and a shimadzu gc 8a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector ecd at the university of tsukuba japan the cfcs in the water samples were stripped with ultrapure n2 gas at 100 ml min using a bubbling system and then trapped in a porapak q column at a temperature of 38 c finally the trapped cfcs were injected into the ecd gas chromatograph by placing the trap column into 85 c water only cfc free materials were used for all equipment parts stainless steel copper glass nylon grease less materials and so forth 3 2 dating method of water using tritium and cfcs the dissolved cfcs concentrations in the groundwater were converted to atmospheric mixing ratios based on henry s law and several parameters recharge temperature recharge elevation and excess air busenberg and plummer 1992 iaea 2006 the detailed description of how to analyze water age by using cfcs data is given at the url https water usgs gov lab usgs the reston groundwater dating laboratory and we followed its methodology the average ground surface elevation in each catchment ibo 733 0 m kou 721 9 m was set as the recharge elevation annual average air temperature from 1981 to 2010 of amedas automated meteorological data acquisition system of japan stations near the study area has a clear correlation with ground surface elevation of those stations fig 2 the annual average air temperature of each study catchment was estimated based on this relationship fig 2 and average ground surface elevation ibo 733 0 m kou 721 9 m set as the groundwater recharge temperature parameters in this study ibo 8 4 c kou 8 5 c because these catchments are small area of ibo 0 17 km2 area of kou 0 54 km2 the dating error introduced by these two parameters is assumed to be limited manning et al 2012 additionally excess air has been seen to contribute to the underestimation of the age of water gooddy et al 2006 however we did not correct observed cfcs concentration based on excess air parameters previous researches such as gooddy et al 2006 mentioned the correction factor of observed cfcs concentration in water sample due to excess air is mostly 0 95 thus possible underestimation range of water age due to excess air relatively small and could be 1 year qin et al 2011 the cfc based piston flow age of groundwater was determined by fitting the observed dissolved cfc concentrations with a historical record of atmospheric cfc concentrations fig 3 the well known cfcs chronicle of the northern hemisphere belonging to the study area was obtained from the following website https water usgs gov lab usgs the reston groundwater dating laboratory a wide variety of studies applied these curves to date the water gooddy et al 2006 qin et al 2011 ako et al 2013 in addition to piston flow water age exponential mixing model and binary mixing model were also assumed for dating water age while considering the groundwater flow systems tritium is another ideal and conservative tracer because it is a part of the water molecule and because it is only lost through radioactive decay iaea 1967 historical records of the tritium concentration in precipitation are shown in fig 3 whose data were obtained from the reston groundwater dating laboratory database usgs for 1940 2002 and environmental radiation database nuclear regulatory agency japan for 2007 2017 the tritium concentration in precipitation sharply increased around 1963 fig 3 due to generation of tremendous tritium quantity in atmosphere derived from global testing of nuclear bombs then with a half life of 12 3 years the tritium concentration in precipitation rapidly returned to the natural level after termination of nuclear testing during the 1990s the tritium concentration in precipitation varied with time especially after 1952 lu et al 2008 hence the curve showing in fig 3 can be utilized as input function for dating young water 4 results and discussion 4 1 tritium concentrations in water and its sources the temporal change of tritium concentrations in precipitation at chiba 200 km from fdnpp from 2007 to 2017 is shown in fig 3 right tritium concentration in precipitation before the fdnpp accident before march 2011 was 2 9 tu on average however tritium concentrations in precipitation immediately after the accident sharply increased to 12 7 tu which is 3 times higher than the tritium concentration before the accident within months these concentrations decreased to pre accident levels in the case of after 2007 the tritium concentration in precipitation at chiba before the accident ranges from 1 1 tu to 6 4 tu considering radioactive decay of tritium on the basis of the day of fdnpp accident 2011 most tritium concentration in precipitation before the accident is 5 0 tu based on the long term tritium concentration record matsumoto et al 2013 defined 6 0 tu as a conservative estimate of the background tritium value in japanese precipitation before the fdnpp accident therefore the spike in tritium to 12 7 tu in precipitation in march 2011 fig 3 right may become useful indicator of evaluation of radionuclide impact on the groundwater resources however the tritium concentration of 12 7 tu is much smaller than that in 1960s hence it is necessary to discuss water age before discussing radionuclide impact on the water resources using tritium tracer results and discussion regarding water age are presented in section 4 3 table 1 shows the observed tritium concentrations in stream water spring water and groundwater in rainless conditions several months after the fdnpp accident tritium concentrations in the ibo catchment and kou catchment ranged from 1 3 to 11 7 tu and from 2 5 to 4 1 tu respectively a spring water sample collected at may 2011 in the ibo catchment had 11 7 tu which greatly exceeded the level of tritium concentration in precipitation before the accident meaning that this spring water was possibly affected by the fdnpp accident stream water at may 2011 6 3 tu spring water at june 2011 6 9 tu and 30 m groundwater at june 2011 6 0 tu in the ibo catchment had concentrations that were also higher than the level of tritium concentration in precipitation before the accident ueda et al 2015 mentioned that the natural tritium background concentration for river water in the fukushima prefecture is 0 4 0 1 bq l which corresponds to 3 4 0 8 tu in march 2011 in addition iwagami et al 2017b observed and reported high 137cs concentrations which seemed to be derived from the fdnpp accident in the same 30 m borehole in the ibo catchment spring discharge and streamflow in headwater catchments are the origins of the abukuma river so spring and stream water with tritium concentrations higher than 3 4 tu natural background in the river seems to contain extra radionuclides presumably released from fdnpp this interpretation is supported by ueda et al 2015 additionally slightly high tritium concentrations in the groundwater 6 0 tu might also be derived from the fdnpp accident which is supported by radiocesium concentration data from a previous study iwagami et al 2017b 4 2 stable isotopic characteristics stable isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen are the ideal conservative tracers for discusing water origin in the catchments stable isotopic compositions in rainwater grealy varied ranging from 15 0 to 3 7 for δ18o and from 108 7 to 20 5 for δ2h whereas those in stream water spring water and groundwater presented within the range between 10 1 and 9 0 for δ18o and 67 8 to 60 0 for δ2h table 2 and these water is mostly plotted near the regression line of stable isotopic compositions in rainwater representing the lmwl local meteoric water line therefore stream water spring water and groundwater in the study area originates from local meteoric water fig 4 fig 4b and c show the relationship between δ18o and δ2h in the groundwater spring water and stream water collected during the observation period in the ibo and kou catchments along with the global meteoric water line gmwl and lmwl each plot and error bar in fig 4b and c represent the unprocessed analyzed results average value and standard deviation of the analytical results of each type of sample the stable isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen in the groundwater from each borehole in the ibo catchment showed similar values to each other ranging from 9 7 to 9 6 for δ18o and from 63 8 to 63 2 for δ2h as average values these isotopic compositions are within or near the measurement error δ18o 0 1 δ2h 0 5 on the other hand the shallower groundwater was enriched with stable isotopic compositions relative to the deeper groundwater in the kou catchment ranging from 9 6 to 9 1 for δ18o and from 63 1 to 60 4 for δ2h as average values in addition the spring water near the boreholes in the ibo catchment had similar isotopic values δ18o 9 6 δ2h 63 5 to the groundwater with depths of 5 m 15 m and 30 m by contrast spring water in the kou catchment clearly showed similar isotopic values δ18o 9 7 δ2h 63 4 to only the 20 m groundwater stable isotopic compositions of the stream water in the ibo catchment presented slightly different values δ18o 9 8 δ2h 65 0 from the other water types with larger error bars unfortunately this stream does not originate from only sources in ibo catchment some part of stream water flows from other small catchments into ibo catchment through a couple of artificial canals in addition all stream water were collected during no rainfall period indicating the direct rainfall contribution on the stream water is limited therefore the mixed origins of stream water may have resulted in the depleted stable isotopic values in stream water in the ibo catchment 4 3 cfcs age of groundwater and groundwater mixing model consideration dissolved concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 in groundwater with standard deviations of triplicated analyses are shown in table 3 all collected groundwater samples contained cfcs ranging from 631 pg kg to 834 pg kg for cfc 11 from 262 pg kg to 337 pg kg for cfc 12 and from 83 pg kg to 123 pg kg for cfc 113 this indicates sampled groundwater mainly consists of young water fraction recharged after 1940s additionally deeper groundwater tends to have lower cfcs concentration compared with shallower groundwater in both catchments however cfcs concentration in some samples presents higher level than the equilibrium concentration with the maximum cfcs mixing ratio in the historical record in atmosphere especially cfc 113 concentration in 3 of 6 samples exceeded maximum level of equilibrium concentration indicating local sources of cfc 113 in the study area this might cause the bias of water age estimation using cfc 113 cfc 113 is previously used for cleaning of electronic devices and precision equipment however study area are located far from mega cities and industrial district so it is difficult to identify exact source of cfc 113 in the area therefore cfc 11 and 12 were mainly used for further interpretation in this study calculated groundwater age based on the hypothetical assumption of a piston flow model and an exponential mixing model are shown in table 3 the piston flow model age varied from 18 years to 24 years for the groundwater in ibo catchment and from 22 years to 26 years for the groundwater in kou catchment on the other hand the exponential mixing model age varied from 10 years to 20 years for the groundwater in ibo catchment and from 11 years to 24 years for the groundwater in kou catchment in both ibo and kou catchments deeper groundwater shows slightly older age than shallower groundwater indicates longer groundwater flow path in deeper subsurface area in addition the piston flow model age by cfc 11 and 12 data in both ibo and kou catchment agrees with each other except for shallow groundwater in ibo catchment ibo 5 m whereas exponential mixing model age in both catchment doesn t agree so much with each other fig 5 presents the relationship between cfc 11 and cfc 12 cfc 11 and cfc 113 in groundwater samples in the ibo and kou catchments with lines representing three hypothetical mixing models piston flow model exponential mixing models and binary mixing model maloszewski and zuber 1982 cook and böhlke 1999 three mixing model lines were drawn by using cfcs concentration data of northern hemisphere obtained from the usgs database the reston groundwater dating laboratory the black line in fig 5 is the atmospheric mixing record of cfc 11 and cfc 12 generated by the piston flow model which is an idealized model of groundwater flow without any mixing the red line is the curve based on exponential mixing model which is idealized groundwater flow models in which once groundwater is recharged the modern water immediately mixes within the groundwater flow system the dashed line represents the binary mixing model which is an idealized model of simple mixing between modern water and old water with an age of 60 years each data of sampled groundwater was plotted after converting from the dissolved cfc concentration pg kg to the atmospheric mixing ratio pptv fig 5 the groundwater samples in the kou catchment were perfectly plotted on the piston flow model line on the figure of relationship between cfc 11 and 12 on the other hand each groundwater sample in the ibo catchment was plotted on the different locations in the figure a groundwater sample with the depth of 5 m below the ground surface was plotted near the exponential mixing model curve another groundwater sample with the depth of 30 m below the ground surface was plotted on the piston flow model curve the other groundwater sample with the depth of 15 m below the ground surface had particularly high cfc 11 concentrations 834 pg kg which exceeded the maximum atmospheric mixing ratio of cfc 11 in the historical record indicating partial cfc 11 contamination of the groundwater system in addition no water samples were plotted near the binary mixing model curve on the cfc 11 vs cfc 12 figure although some groundwater samples were plotted near the binary mixing model on the cfc 11 vs cfc 113 figure half of all groundwater samples contained much higher cfc 113 concentrations than the historical maximum atmospheric cfc 113 concentration meaning cfc 113 is not suitable for discussing groundwater age and flow process those results suggest groundwater flow in kou catchment is governed by a piston flow model whereas that in ibo catchment seems to depends on the depth from the ground surface 4 4 groundwater flow system the observed oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions and cfcs concentrations from water samples figs 4 and 5 imply a difference in the groundwater flow systems that are predominant in these similar proximal headwater catchments according to cfc 11 and cfc 12 concentrations in groundwater fig 5 the groundwater flow in the kou catchment can be approximated by a piston flow model and an exponential mixing fraction was indicated in the shallow groundwater with the depth of 5 m below the ground surface in ibo catchment in addition stable isotopic compositions in spring water indicate that spring water in the ibo catchment is isotopically similar to every groundwater samples at depths of 5 m 15 m and 30 m whereas spring water in the kou catchment is isotopically similar to only deeper groundwater 20 m fig 4 these isotopic signatures also imply the groundwater in different depth in kou catchment has different source and flows without any mixing each other therefore isolation of groundwater flow at each depth appears to predominate in the groundwater flow system in the kou catchment with spring water drawing primarily from the groundwater at 20 m the younger age of the shallow groundwater in the kou catchment might reflect shorter groundwater flow paths than in deeper groundwater the piston flow model that was indicated for the kou catchment by the cfc tracers fig 5 would be expected to result in lower residence times near the surface and little mixing between depths so these results support each other in the case of the ibo catchment although different groundwater mixing models between shallower and deeper subsurface layer are suggested by cfc 11 and cfc 12 data isotopic signatures are similar to one another this indicates the sources of groundwater with the depth of 5 m 15 m and 30 m might be same despite these show different groundwater age 4 5 impact evaluation of radionuclides on groundwater mext 2011 reported that the studied catchments received heavy 137cs deposition due to local fallout after the fdnpp accident kato et al 2012ab 2017 also mentioned that those radionuclides have remained in the forest and upper layer of soil this section will discuss in detail radionuclide impacts on water resources in terms of groundwater age and flow dynamics the 11 7 tu of tritium concentration was observed in spring water about 2 months after fdnpp accident which is observed maximum tritium concentration in environmental water in this study table 1 fig 6 shows the relationship between cfc 12 and tritium concentration in groundwater samples in the ibo and kou catchments with lines representing three hypothetical mixing models piston flow model exponential mixing model and binary mixing model groundwater samples in both catchments were plotted near model curves and there were not clear facts of radionuclide tritium intrusion to the groundwater resources however the 11 7 tu in spring water solid line in fig 6 presents higher level of tritium concentration than each model representing modern to 40 years except for the time just after fdnpp accident considering cfcs age of all groundwater samples are 26 years table 3 the 11 7 tu in spring water seems not to be derived from older water 40 years therefore it is reasonable to think the spring water is somewhat affected by fdnpp accident oriented tritium concentration resulting in higher tritium concentration fortunately the tritium concentration in spring water collected three months after fdnpp accident decreased to 6 9 tu from 11 7 tu nevertheless continuous observation of radionuclide in water is very important to certify and evaluate the radionuclide impact on the water resources in the future the conceptual model for groundwater flow for each catchment based on the observed tritium concentrations and groundwater ages was shown in fig 7 radiocesium concentrations observed by iwagami et al 2017b are also shown in fig 7 the results obtained by iwagami et al 2017b revealed that the groundwater in the study fields contained a dissolved 137cs concentration derived from fdnpp though its concentration was much lower than in stream water in particular the observed dissolved 137cs concentrations in the groundwater in the ibo catchment are up to three times higher than in the kou catchment fig 1 which is difficult to attribute to analytical errors additionally the observed tritium concentrations in the groundwater 6 0 tu in this study is slightly higher than natural tritium level which is possibly derived from fdnpp oriented radionuclides however cfc estimated groundwater ages in the ibo catchment were 18 24 years and 10 20 years based on piston flow model and exponential mixing model respectively table 3 therefore there seems to be a discrepancy between groundwater age data and the observation of tritium and dissolved 137cs concentrations in the groundwater just several months after the fdnpp accident in order to explain these inconsistent results we must look to the governing groundwater mixing processes in the ibo catchment as revealed by the relationship among cfc concentrations fig 5 a groundwater sample in ibo catchment was plotted near exponential mixing curve in fig 5 this suggested a part of groundwater flow process in the ibo catchment could be approximated by an exponential mixing model or influenced by modern water fraction in the study area the groundwater table is from just several tens of centimeters to 1 m below the ground surface resulting in a very thin unsaturated subsurface layer fig 1 additionally highly weathered and fractured granite is the main bedrock watanabe et al 1955 therefore radionuclide rich tritium 137cs rainwater or soil water modern water promptly recharges the groundwater and mixes with the groundwater flow system resulting in the observation of high tritium and dissolved 137cs concentrations only months after the fdnpp accident previous research that concluded that dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water and throughfall is much higher than that in groundwater iwagami et al 2017b provides clear support for this interpretation the borehole location in the kou catchment was identified as a groundwater discharge area based on hydraulic gradient from deeper subsurface area to shallower subsurface area fig 1 iwagami et al 2017b in addition groundwater flow process in kou catchment is approximated by piston flow model with the cfc estimated groundwater age ranged from 22 to 26 years table 3 fig 5 it seems improbable that groundwater samples would contain high concentrations of tritium and dissolved 137cs derived from the fdnpp accident nevertheless dissolved 137cs was detected in groundwater samples in the kou catchment though tritium concentration is almost natural level this suggests that while the groundwater flow in the kou catchment can be mainly described by a piston flow model groundwater is sometimes mixed with modern water with dissolved 137cs from the ground surface fortunately iwagami et al 2017b concluded that dissolved 137cs concentrations in groundwater will continuously decrease based on their long term observations however considering groundwater age in the region 10 years for both ibo and kou catchments prolonged observations of tritium and 137cs will be necessary in this area so that the radionuclide impact on groundwater resources can be evaluated this is not exclusive to the fukushima area in japan but is true for any location in the world that faces environmental contamination 5 conclusions we reported tritium concentrations in the groundwater in two headwater catchments that are around 35 km from fdnpp water sampled after the fdnpp accident contained 1 3 11 7 tu some of the water including the spring water and groundwater from a depth of 30 m presented higher tritium concentrations than the natural background level suggesting that the tritium possibly originated from the fdnpp accident we also examined the groundwater age and mixing processes in the region affected by the fdnpp accident cfcs and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were used as environmental tracers in this study the use of multiple observed cfcs concentrations in groundwater indicated that the groundwater flow system in the kou catchments can be approximated by the piston flow model whereas the groundwater flow system in ibo catchment is somewhat affected by modern water fraction based on the cfcs concentration and the governing groundwater flow model the estimated groundwater ages in the ibo and kou catchments were calculated as between 10 and 26 years this study also discussed possible causes of radionuclide such as tritium and 137cs intrusion into the groundwater based on groundwater age and mixing processes radionuclide intrusion into the groundwater seemed to be related to the mixing between radionuclide poor groundwater and modern water with relatively high radionuclide concentrations such as soil water and throughfall this intrusion and mixing is enabled by the weathered and fractured granite bedrock and the thin unsaturated subsurface layer funding information japan atomic energy agency jaea ministry

1586,radionuclide contamination of groundwater causes critical impacts on water resources human lives and ecosystems the intrusion of radionuclides into the groundwater flow system in fukushima japan could be illuminated by determining groundwater age and mixing processes to do this periodical field surveys were conducted in catchments contaminated by the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant accident sampling began in may 2011 which was 2 months after the disaster and continued through june 2012 chlorofluorocarbon cfcs tritium and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were used as environmental tracers the observed tritium concentrations suggested that the water contained accident derived radionuclides that exceeded the natural background baseline groundwater ages in the selected two headwater catchments were estimated to be between 10 and 26 years by combined use of multiple cfcs concentrations in addition the governing groundwater flow system was mostly approximated by a piston flow model however modern water fraction was also suggested based on the relationship between cfc 11 and cfc 12 the estimated water age and isotopic signals among stream water spring water and groundwater revealed that the intrusion of radionuclides into the groundwater was caused by the mixing between groundwater and modern water sources such as soil water and precipitation with relatively high radionuclide concentrations this mixing was facilitated by a weathered and fractured granite bedrock and a thin unsaturated subsurface layer in the study area continued long term monitoring of radionuclides in the groundwater will be necessary for water resources management in the future capsule radionuclide intrusion into the groundwater is related to the mixing between radionuclide poor groundwater and modern water with relatively high radionuclide concentration keywords tritium cfcs groundwater age fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant headwater catchment 1 introduction substantial concentrations of radionuclides were released to the environment during the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident which was caused by the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan on march 11 2011 this contamination is expected to have a detrimental impact on water resources human life and local ecosystems tritium and radiocesium 137cs both leaked from fdnpp have radioactive half lives of 12 3 years and 30 2 years respectively due to the possibility of continuous environmental impacts a lot of research has studied their behavior in the environment after the fdnpp accident e g matsumoto et al 2013 kato et al 2012a 2012b tritium was leaked into the atmosphere from the damaged reactor units at fdnpp as a tritiated water hto vapor which was then washed out of the atmosphere by precipitation matsumoto et al 2013 after being integrated into the soil water stream water and groundwater of the region tritium dynamics in the environment were governed by the natural hydrological cycle matsumoto et al 2013 observed the tritium concentrations in the precipitation falling on several cities within 700 km from fdnpp they reported that the tritium concentrations immediately after the fdnpp accident as high as 160 tritium units tu greatly exceeded the natural background 6 tu and that these concentrations rapidly returned to the natural background tritium concentrations in river water in the fukushima prefecture were investigated by ueda et al 2015 temporal changes in the tritium concentrations in river water followed a trend which was similar to that of precipitation it greatly exceeded the natural background shortly after the fdnpp accident before rapidly decreasing to the natural background more recently the fdnpp oriented tritium was reported in the seawater around 100 km away from the fdnpp and this indicated the important role of precipitation in spreading of the fdnpp derived tritium kaizer et al 2018 from the perspective of water resources management the fdnpp derived tritium in groundwater recharge areas such as headwaters cannot be neglected kashiwaya et al 2018 observed the tritium concentration in groundwater of the coastal region near the fdnpp after the accident and these values were between 1 8 tu and 12 9 tu however few research has reported tritium concentrations in groundwater in the headwater regions and there are still lack of idea of the fdnpp derived tritium impact on the water resources radiocesium is another radionuclide that was prominently released from fdnpp however it is not incorporated into the molecular structure of water like tritium as a result the environmental behavior of radiocesium is different from that of tritium the depositional distribution of radiocesium in the environment has been studied with airborne surveys and soil surveys ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext 2011 saito et al 2014 and about 70 of the area where radiocesium was deposited was a forested area hashimoto et al 2012 radiocesium was first intercepted by the forest canopy kato et al 2012a and its subsequent migration to the forest floor by throughfall stemflow and litterfall was monitored kato et al 2017 radiocesium profiles in the soil showed that most radiocesium remained within the top 5 cm kato et al 2012b matsunaga et al 2013 takahashi et al 2015 radiocesium in the soil is known to be strongly adsorbed onto clay minerals cremers et al 1988 walling 1998 so its subsequent migration will be restricted to the physical movement of soil particles by soil erosion yoshimura et al 2015 after studying the groundwater in two headwater catchments in the radionuclide contaminated area in fukushima iwagami et al 2017b reported dissolved 137cs concentrations in the range of 0 0 0 039 bq l and 0 0 0 013 bq l while these concentrations are low 137cs derived from the fdnpp accident was detectable in the groundwater several months after the accident iwagami et al 2017a also reported 2 5 bq l as the maximum dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water in the same headwater catchments however the interactions and exchanges of radionuclides between different water bodies are still not clear effective water resources management and groundwater conservation in the fukushima prefecture will require clarification of the origin of 137cs and its intrusion processes into the groundwater however such answers remain elusive due to a lack of understanding of the groundwater flow system in the region affected by the fdnpp accident groundwater residence time age is a critical metric for determining water origin flow paths and mixing processes hence it is a key to understanding the entire groundwater flow system mcdonnell et al 2010 molson and frind 2012 in order to determine groundwater age previous studies have used tritium and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs as tracers e g busenberg and plummer 1992 hiyama et al 2013 sturchio et al 2014 tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen often incorporated into water molecules and its concentration in the groundwater changes only due to radioactive decay iaea 1967 morgenstern and daughney 2012 xu et al 2018 cfcs are a group of excellent tracing gases because they are highly conservative in the environment iaea 2006 long term variations in tritium and cfc concentrations in precipitation and atmosphere have been recorded iaea 2006 establishing a baseline that makes it possible to determine the age of tritium or cfcs in a system this makes them useful for determining water age as well additionally simultaneous use of these dating tracers can reveal water mixing processes darling et al 2012 therefore the objective of this research is to evaluate impacts of the fdnpp oriented radionuclide on groundwater resources by investigating the groundwater age and water mixing processes with environmental tracers such as stable isotopes tritium and cfcs in the headwater catchments affected by the fdnpp accident this study is also the first to report groundwater age in the radionuclide contaminated headwater region and it attempts to determine the causes of radionuclide intrusion into the groundwater flow system 2 study area this study was undertaken in two small headwater catchments in the yamakiya district fukushima prefecture japan iboishi yama catchment ibo 0 17 km2 71 forested 44 conifer 27 broad leaf and koutaishi yama catchment kou 0 54 km2 94 forested 72 conifer 22 broad leaf the catchments are located 35 km northwest of fdnpp and received heavy local fallout 300 1000 kbq m2 of 137cs after the fdnpp accident mext 2011 the average 137cs deposition densities in the ibo and kou catchment areas were 544 and 916 kbq m2 respectively mext 2011 the catchments are located at the headwaters of the abukuma river which is the major river in fukushima prefecture and is an important industrial and domestic water resource its importance is the principal motivation for research into radionuclide transition processes in the environment iwagami et al 2017b reported dissolved 137cs concentrations in the groundwater in the same areas as this study however the groundwater flow system has not been clarified yet a map of the study area with contour lines of 137cs deposition is shown in fig 1 from mext 2011 and iwagami et al 2017b the structure and average groundwater depth at each borehole with the maximum 137cs concentration observed by iwagami et al 2017b are also shown in fig 1 the underlying bedrock in this region is granite watanabe et al 1955 data from the drilling of the boreholes suggested that the main basement rock in the study area is granitic and also includes a crack containing layer and a weathered sedimentary layer 3 methods 3 1 water sampling and isotope cfc analyses water sampling campaigns were undertaken to determine oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h and concentrations of tritium 3h and cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 samples were collected from the stream water spring water and groundwater at each borehole in the ibo and kou headwater catchments from may 2011 which was 2 months after the fdnpp accident to june 2012 rainwater was collected from may 2015 to may 2017 at the location just several kilometers away from the two catchments samples for the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions tritium and cfc analyses were collected in 250 ml polypropylene bottles 1 l polypropylene bottles and 100 ml glass bottles respectively groundwater samples for cfc analysis were collected in triplicate to consider the measurement error in order to avoid atmospheric contamination of the groundwater samples a nylon tube connecting the appropriate pump geo pump bennett 1400 was placed at the bottom of the bottle so that any air contaminated water would be pushed up and out of the bottle by pure groundwater after overflowing the sample by at least 1 l the tube was carefully removed the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions were measured using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i the measured stable isotopic compositions were expressed using conventional δ notations as permil deviations from vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical accuracies of the stable isotopic compositions of 18o and 2h were 0 1 and 0 5 respectively tritium concentration was determined by liquid scintillation counting tri carb 2000ca ll and hidex 300sl after electrolytic enrichment at the university of tsukuba ibaraki japan each water sample was analyzed at least nine times to determine the analytical error the obtained tritium concentrations were expressed in tu 1 tu 1 3h 1018h analysis of the dissolved cfcs concentrations was performed using a purge and trap gas chromatography procedure busenberg and plummer 1992 and a shimadzu gc 8a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector ecd at the university of tsukuba japan the cfcs in the water samples were stripped with ultrapure n2 gas at 100 ml min using a bubbling system and then trapped in a porapak q column at a temperature of 38 c finally the trapped cfcs were injected into the ecd gas chromatograph by placing the trap column into 85 c water only cfc free materials were used for all equipment parts stainless steel copper glass nylon grease less materials and so forth 3 2 dating method of water using tritium and cfcs the dissolved cfcs concentrations in the groundwater were converted to atmospheric mixing ratios based on henry s law and several parameters recharge temperature recharge elevation and excess air busenberg and plummer 1992 iaea 2006 the detailed description of how to analyze water age by using cfcs data is given at the url https water usgs gov lab usgs the reston groundwater dating laboratory and we followed its methodology the average ground surface elevation in each catchment ibo 733 0 m kou 721 9 m was set as the recharge elevation annual average air temperature from 1981 to 2010 of amedas automated meteorological data acquisition system of japan stations near the study area has a clear correlation with ground surface elevation of those stations fig 2 the annual average air temperature of each study catchment was estimated based on this relationship fig 2 and average ground surface elevation ibo 733 0 m kou 721 9 m set as the groundwater recharge temperature parameters in this study ibo 8 4 c kou 8 5 c because these catchments are small area of ibo 0 17 km2 area of kou 0 54 km2 the dating error introduced by these two parameters is assumed to be limited manning et al 2012 additionally excess air has been seen to contribute to the underestimation of the age of water gooddy et al 2006 however we did not correct observed cfcs concentration based on excess air parameters previous researches such as gooddy et al 2006 mentioned the correction factor of observed cfcs concentration in water sample due to excess air is mostly 0 95 thus possible underestimation range of water age due to excess air relatively small and could be 1 year qin et al 2011 the cfc based piston flow age of groundwater was determined by fitting the observed dissolved cfc concentrations with a historical record of atmospheric cfc concentrations fig 3 the well known cfcs chronicle of the northern hemisphere belonging to the study area was obtained from the following website https water usgs gov lab usgs the reston groundwater dating laboratory a wide variety of studies applied these curves to date the water gooddy et al 2006 qin et al 2011 ako et al 2013 in addition to piston flow water age exponential mixing model and binary mixing model were also assumed for dating water age while considering the groundwater flow systems tritium is another ideal and conservative tracer because it is a part of the water molecule and because it is only lost through radioactive decay iaea 1967 historical records of the tritium concentration in precipitation are shown in fig 3 whose data were obtained from the reston groundwater dating laboratory database usgs for 1940 2002 and environmental radiation database nuclear regulatory agency japan for 2007 2017 the tritium concentration in precipitation sharply increased around 1963 fig 3 due to generation of tremendous tritium quantity in atmosphere derived from global testing of nuclear bombs then with a half life of 12 3 years the tritium concentration in precipitation rapidly returned to the natural level after termination of nuclear testing during the 1990s the tritium concentration in precipitation varied with time especially after 1952 lu et al 2008 hence the curve showing in fig 3 can be utilized as input function for dating young water 4 results and discussion 4 1 tritium concentrations in water and its sources the temporal change of tritium concentrations in precipitation at chiba 200 km from fdnpp from 2007 to 2017 is shown in fig 3 right tritium concentration in precipitation before the fdnpp accident before march 2011 was 2 9 tu on average however tritium concentrations in precipitation immediately after the accident sharply increased to 12 7 tu which is 3 times higher than the tritium concentration before the accident within months these concentrations decreased to pre accident levels in the case of after 2007 the tritium concentration in precipitation at chiba before the accident ranges from 1 1 tu to 6 4 tu considering radioactive decay of tritium on the basis of the day of fdnpp accident 2011 most tritium concentration in precipitation before the accident is 5 0 tu based on the long term tritium concentration record matsumoto et al 2013 defined 6 0 tu as a conservative estimate of the background tritium value in japanese precipitation before the fdnpp accident therefore the spike in tritium to 12 7 tu in precipitation in march 2011 fig 3 right may become useful indicator of evaluation of radionuclide impact on the groundwater resources however the tritium concentration of 12 7 tu is much smaller than that in 1960s hence it is necessary to discuss water age before discussing radionuclide impact on the water resources using tritium tracer results and discussion regarding water age are presented in section 4 3 table 1 shows the observed tritium concentrations in stream water spring water and groundwater in rainless conditions several months after the fdnpp accident tritium concentrations in the ibo catchment and kou catchment ranged from 1 3 to 11 7 tu and from 2 5 to 4 1 tu respectively a spring water sample collected at may 2011 in the ibo catchment had 11 7 tu which greatly exceeded the level of tritium concentration in precipitation before the accident meaning that this spring water was possibly affected by the fdnpp accident stream water at may 2011 6 3 tu spring water at june 2011 6 9 tu and 30 m groundwater at june 2011 6 0 tu in the ibo catchment had concentrations that were also higher than the level of tritium concentration in precipitation before the accident ueda et al 2015 mentioned that the natural tritium background concentration for river water in the fukushima prefecture is 0 4 0 1 bq l which corresponds to 3 4 0 8 tu in march 2011 in addition iwagami et al 2017b observed and reported high 137cs concentrations which seemed to be derived from the fdnpp accident in the same 30 m borehole in the ibo catchment spring discharge and streamflow in headwater catchments are the origins of the abukuma river so spring and stream water with tritium concentrations higher than 3 4 tu natural background in the river seems to contain extra radionuclides presumably released from fdnpp this interpretation is supported by ueda et al 2015 additionally slightly high tritium concentrations in the groundwater 6 0 tu might also be derived from the fdnpp accident which is supported by radiocesium concentration data from a previous study iwagami et al 2017b 4 2 stable isotopic characteristics stable isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen are the ideal conservative tracers for discusing water origin in the catchments stable isotopic compositions in rainwater grealy varied ranging from 15 0 to 3 7 for δ18o and from 108 7 to 20 5 for δ2h whereas those in stream water spring water and groundwater presented within the range between 10 1 and 9 0 for δ18o and 67 8 to 60 0 for δ2h table 2 and these water is mostly plotted near the regression line of stable isotopic compositions in rainwater representing the lmwl local meteoric water line therefore stream water spring water and groundwater in the study area originates from local meteoric water fig 4 fig 4b and c show the relationship between δ18o and δ2h in the groundwater spring water and stream water collected during the observation period in the ibo and kou catchments along with the global meteoric water line gmwl and lmwl each plot and error bar in fig 4b and c represent the unprocessed analyzed results average value and standard deviation of the analytical results of each type of sample the stable isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen in the groundwater from each borehole in the ibo catchment showed similar values to each other ranging from 9 7 to 9 6 for δ18o and from 63 8 to 63 2 for δ2h as average values these isotopic compositions are within or near the measurement error δ18o 0 1 δ2h 0 5 on the other hand the shallower groundwater was enriched with stable isotopic compositions relative to the deeper groundwater in the kou catchment ranging from 9 6 to 9 1 for δ18o and from 63 1 to 60 4 for δ2h as average values in addition the spring water near the boreholes in the ibo catchment had similar isotopic values δ18o 9 6 δ2h 63 5 to the groundwater with depths of 5 m 15 m and 30 m by contrast spring water in the kou catchment clearly showed similar isotopic values δ18o 9 7 δ2h 63 4 to only the 20 m groundwater stable isotopic compositions of the stream water in the ibo catchment presented slightly different values δ18o 9 8 δ2h 65 0 from the other water types with larger error bars unfortunately this stream does not originate from only sources in ibo catchment some part of stream water flows from other small catchments into ibo catchment through a couple of artificial canals in addition all stream water were collected during no rainfall period indicating the direct rainfall contribution on the stream water is limited therefore the mixed origins of stream water may have resulted in the depleted stable isotopic values in stream water in the ibo catchment 4 3 cfcs age of groundwater and groundwater mixing model consideration dissolved concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 in groundwater with standard deviations of triplicated analyses are shown in table 3 all collected groundwater samples contained cfcs ranging from 631 pg kg to 834 pg kg for cfc 11 from 262 pg kg to 337 pg kg for cfc 12 and from 83 pg kg to 123 pg kg for cfc 113 this indicates sampled groundwater mainly consists of young water fraction recharged after 1940s additionally deeper groundwater tends to have lower cfcs concentration compared with shallower groundwater in both catchments however cfcs concentration in some samples presents higher level than the equilibrium concentration with the maximum cfcs mixing ratio in the historical record in atmosphere especially cfc 113 concentration in 3 of 6 samples exceeded maximum level of equilibrium concentration indicating local sources of cfc 113 in the study area this might cause the bias of water age estimation using cfc 113 cfc 113 is previously used for cleaning of electronic devices and precision equipment however study area are located far from mega cities and industrial district so it is difficult to identify exact source of cfc 113 in the area therefore cfc 11 and 12 were mainly used for further interpretation in this study calculated groundwater age based on the hypothetical assumption of a piston flow model and an exponential mixing model are shown in table 3 the piston flow model age varied from 18 years to 24 years for the groundwater in ibo catchment and from 22 years to 26 years for the groundwater in kou catchment on the other hand the exponential mixing model age varied from 10 years to 20 years for the groundwater in ibo catchment and from 11 years to 24 years for the groundwater in kou catchment in both ibo and kou catchments deeper groundwater shows slightly older age than shallower groundwater indicates longer groundwater flow path in deeper subsurface area in addition the piston flow model age by cfc 11 and 12 data in both ibo and kou catchment agrees with each other except for shallow groundwater in ibo catchment ibo 5 m whereas exponential mixing model age in both catchment doesn t agree so much with each other fig 5 presents the relationship between cfc 11 and cfc 12 cfc 11 and cfc 113 in groundwater samples in the ibo and kou catchments with lines representing three hypothetical mixing models piston flow model exponential mixing models and binary mixing model maloszewski and zuber 1982 cook and böhlke 1999 three mixing model lines were drawn by using cfcs concentration data of northern hemisphere obtained from the usgs database the reston groundwater dating laboratory the black line in fig 5 is the atmospheric mixing record of cfc 11 and cfc 12 generated by the piston flow model which is an idealized model of groundwater flow without any mixing the red line is the curve based on exponential mixing model which is idealized groundwater flow models in which once groundwater is recharged the modern water immediately mixes within the groundwater flow system the dashed line represents the binary mixing model which is an idealized model of simple mixing between modern water and old water with an age of 60 years each data of sampled groundwater was plotted after converting from the dissolved cfc concentration pg kg to the atmospheric mixing ratio pptv fig 5 the groundwater samples in the kou catchment were perfectly plotted on the piston flow model line on the figure of relationship between cfc 11 and 12 on the other hand each groundwater sample in the ibo catchment was plotted on the different locations in the figure a groundwater sample with the depth of 5 m below the ground surface was plotted near the exponential mixing model curve another groundwater sample with the depth of 30 m below the ground surface was plotted on the piston flow model curve the other groundwater sample with the depth of 15 m below the ground surface had particularly high cfc 11 concentrations 834 pg kg which exceeded the maximum atmospheric mixing ratio of cfc 11 in the historical record indicating partial cfc 11 contamination of the groundwater system in addition no water samples were plotted near the binary mixing model curve on the cfc 11 vs cfc 12 figure although some groundwater samples were plotted near the binary mixing model on the cfc 11 vs cfc 113 figure half of all groundwater samples contained much higher cfc 113 concentrations than the historical maximum atmospheric cfc 113 concentration meaning cfc 113 is not suitable for discussing groundwater age and flow process those results suggest groundwater flow in kou catchment is governed by a piston flow model whereas that in ibo catchment seems to depends on the depth from the ground surface 4 4 groundwater flow system the observed oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic compositions and cfcs concentrations from water samples figs 4 and 5 imply a difference in the groundwater flow systems that are predominant in these similar proximal headwater catchments according to cfc 11 and cfc 12 concentrations in groundwater fig 5 the groundwater flow in the kou catchment can be approximated by a piston flow model and an exponential mixing fraction was indicated in the shallow groundwater with the depth of 5 m below the ground surface in ibo catchment in addition stable isotopic compositions in spring water indicate that spring water in the ibo catchment is isotopically similar to every groundwater samples at depths of 5 m 15 m and 30 m whereas spring water in the kou catchment is isotopically similar to only deeper groundwater 20 m fig 4 these isotopic signatures also imply the groundwater in different depth in kou catchment has different source and flows without any mixing each other therefore isolation of groundwater flow at each depth appears to predominate in the groundwater flow system in the kou catchment with spring water drawing primarily from the groundwater at 20 m the younger age of the shallow groundwater in the kou catchment might reflect shorter groundwater flow paths than in deeper groundwater the piston flow model that was indicated for the kou catchment by the cfc tracers fig 5 would be expected to result in lower residence times near the surface and little mixing between depths so these results support each other in the case of the ibo catchment although different groundwater mixing models between shallower and deeper subsurface layer are suggested by cfc 11 and cfc 12 data isotopic signatures are similar to one another this indicates the sources of groundwater with the depth of 5 m 15 m and 30 m might be same despite these show different groundwater age 4 5 impact evaluation of radionuclides on groundwater mext 2011 reported that the studied catchments received heavy 137cs deposition due to local fallout after the fdnpp accident kato et al 2012ab 2017 also mentioned that those radionuclides have remained in the forest and upper layer of soil this section will discuss in detail radionuclide impacts on water resources in terms of groundwater age and flow dynamics the 11 7 tu of tritium concentration was observed in spring water about 2 months after fdnpp accident which is observed maximum tritium concentration in environmental water in this study table 1 fig 6 shows the relationship between cfc 12 and tritium concentration in groundwater samples in the ibo and kou catchments with lines representing three hypothetical mixing models piston flow model exponential mixing model and binary mixing model groundwater samples in both catchments were plotted near model curves and there were not clear facts of radionuclide tritium intrusion to the groundwater resources however the 11 7 tu in spring water solid line in fig 6 presents higher level of tritium concentration than each model representing modern to 40 years except for the time just after fdnpp accident considering cfcs age of all groundwater samples are 26 years table 3 the 11 7 tu in spring water seems not to be derived from older water 40 years therefore it is reasonable to think the spring water is somewhat affected by fdnpp accident oriented tritium concentration resulting in higher tritium concentration fortunately the tritium concentration in spring water collected three months after fdnpp accident decreased to 6 9 tu from 11 7 tu nevertheless continuous observation of radionuclide in water is very important to certify and evaluate the radionuclide impact on the water resources in the future the conceptual model for groundwater flow for each catchment based on the observed tritium concentrations and groundwater ages was shown in fig 7 radiocesium concentrations observed by iwagami et al 2017b are also shown in fig 7 the results obtained by iwagami et al 2017b revealed that the groundwater in the study fields contained a dissolved 137cs concentration derived from fdnpp though its concentration was much lower than in stream water in particular the observed dissolved 137cs concentrations in the groundwater in the ibo catchment are up to three times higher than in the kou catchment fig 1 which is difficult to attribute to analytical errors additionally the observed tritium concentrations in the groundwater 6 0 tu in this study is slightly higher than natural tritium level which is possibly derived from fdnpp oriented radionuclides however cfc estimated groundwater ages in the ibo catchment were 18 24 years and 10 20 years based on piston flow model and exponential mixing model respectively table 3 therefore there seems to be a discrepancy between groundwater age data and the observation of tritium and dissolved 137cs concentrations in the groundwater just several months after the fdnpp accident in order to explain these inconsistent results we must look to the governing groundwater mixing processes in the ibo catchment as revealed by the relationship among cfc concentrations fig 5 a groundwater sample in ibo catchment was plotted near exponential mixing curve in fig 5 this suggested a part of groundwater flow process in the ibo catchment could be approximated by an exponential mixing model or influenced by modern water fraction in the study area the groundwater table is from just several tens of centimeters to 1 m below the ground surface resulting in a very thin unsaturated subsurface layer fig 1 additionally highly weathered and fractured granite is the main bedrock watanabe et al 1955 therefore radionuclide rich tritium 137cs rainwater or soil water modern water promptly recharges the groundwater and mixes with the groundwater flow system resulting in the observation of high tritium and dissolved 137cs concentrations only months after the fdnpp accident previous research that concluded that dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water and throughfall is much higher than that in groundwater iwagami et al 2017b provides clear support for this interpretation the borehole location in the kou catchment was identified as a groundwater discharge area based on hydraulic gradient from deeper subsurface area to shallower subsurface area fig 1 iwagami et al 2017b in addition groundwater flow process in kou catchment is approximated by piston flow model with the cfc estimated groundwater age ranged from 22 to 26 years table 3 fig 5 it seems improbable that groundwater samples would contain high concentrations of tritium and dissolved 137cs derived from the fdnpp accident nevertheless dissolved 137cs was detected in groundwater samples in the kou catchment though tritium concentration is almost natural level this suggests that while the groundwater flow in the kou catchment can be mainly described by a piston flow model groundwater is sometimes mixed with modern water with dissolved 137cs from the ground surface fortunately iwagami et al 2017b concluded that dissolved 137cs concentrations in groundwater will continuously decrease based on their long term observations however considering groundwater age in the region 10 years for both ibo and kou catchments prolonged observations of tritium and 137cs will be necessary in this area so that the radionuclide impact on groundwater resources can be evaluated this is not exclusive to the fukushima area in japan but is true for any location in the world that faces environmental contamination 5 conclusions we reported tritium concentrations in the groundwater in two headwater catchments that are around 35 km from fdnpp water sampled after the fdnpp accident contained 1 3 11 7 tu some of the water including the spring water and groundwater from a depth of 30 m presented higher tritium concentrations than the natural background level suggesting that the tritium possibly originated from the fdnpp accident we also examined the groundwater age and mixing processes in the region affected by the fdnpp accident cfcs and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were used as environmental tracers in this study the use of multiple observed cfcs concentrations in groundwater indicated that the groundwater flow system in the kou catchments can be approximated by the piston flow model whereas the groundwater flow system in ibo catchment is somewhat affected by modern water fraction based on the cfcs concentration and the governing groundwater flow model the estimated groundwater ages in the ibo and kou catchments were calculated as between 10 and 26 years this study also discussed possible causes of radionuclide such as tritium and 137cs intrusion into the groundwater based on groundwater age and mixing processes radionuclide intrusion into the groundwater seemed to be related to the mixing between radionuclide poor groundwater and modern water with relatively high radionuclide concentrations such as soil water and throughfall this intrusion and mixing is enabled by the weathered and fractured granite bedrock and the thin unsaturated subsurface layer funding information japan atomic energy agency jaea ministry

1587,selection of proper surfactants is critical for applying surfactant enhanced remediation ser to sites contaminated with nonaqueous phase liquids napls here ethoxylated nonionic surfactants tween 20 tween 40 tween 80 and triton x 100 were evaluated for their applicability to remedy chlorinated organic phases chloroform cf trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce on the basis of solubilization capacity partitioning behavior and macroemulsion formation the most hydrophilic cf was not relevant for ser applications since excessive surfactant partitioning into cf rendered only few of them available for its solubilization in contrast the more hydrophobic tce and pce having moderate surfactant partitioning were effectively solubilized among tween surfactants a more hydrophobic surfactant showed a larger solubilization potential for both chloroethylenes but it suffered from a greater partitioning loss depending on the type and extent of napl contaminations thus a prior consideration should be given to either solubilization capacity or partitioning loss when selecting the optimal tween surfactant compared to tween surfactants the more hydrophobic triton x 100 showed greater partitioning losses into all three napls of particular its partitioning into cf and tce was nearly complete making impractical its application to the remediation of both organic liquids the formation of macroemulsions characterized by a high turbidity may significantly deteriorate ser applicability by producing undesirable flows in aquifers their formation became more problematic with the increasing surfactant hydrophilicity and the increasing napl hydrophobicity when these combinations are applied it is critical to keep such surfactant concentrations as to exploit the solubilization potential but not to cause the macroemulsion formation keywords surfactant enhanced remediation ser nonaqueous phase liquids napls micellar solubilization partitioning loss macroemulsion formation 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds such as chloroform cf trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce are widespread contaminants in subsurface environments u s epa 2004 due to the immiscibility with water these pollutants usually form nonaqueous phase liquids napls which can serve as long term contamination sources by slowly dissolving to form plumes along groundwater flow paths thus drawing environmental concerns jeong 2012 kang and jeong 2015 shiau et al 1994 zhao et al 2006 a common approach to restore the sites contaminated with such napls is a pump and treat method kang and jeong 2015 shiau et al 1994 however this method has proven to be not effective due to the low aqueous solubility and slow dissolution kinetics of chlorinated organic compounds mackay and cherry 1989 mercer and cohen 1990 zhao et al 2006 for example a conventional pump and treat method may need to extract hundreds to thousands of pore volumes of water or even more to clean up residual napls shiau et al 1994 thus surfactant enhanced remediation ser has often been accompanied to enhance napl remediation by a pump and treat method cowell et al 2000 pennell et al 1993 west and harwell 1992 in ser applications napl removal can be accomplished by two processes solubilization and mobilization cowell et al 2000 palmer and fish 1992 above critical micelle concentrations cmcs aqueous surfactant molecules form micelles in which the hydrophobic tails of surfactant molecules are orientated to the center of micelles while their hydrophilic heads are pointed toward the bulk aqueous phase rosen 1989 then organic molecules can partition into the hydrophobic cores of micelles thus making their apparent aqueous solubility increase pennell et al 1993 west and harwell 1992 this process is referred to as micellar solubilization on the other hand surfactants can significantly lower the interfacial tension between napls and water to form middle phase microemulsions that are composed of organic water and surfactant molecules palmer and fish 1992 then such emulsions can be readily mobilized to be removed via pumping shiau et al 1994 of the two solubilization was investigated here given the technical difficulties in producing middle phase microemulsions e g obtaining a proper balance of surfactant systems and preventing the formation of rigid intermediate phases bourrel and chambu 1983 west and harwell 1992 ethoxylated nonionic surfactants have drawn significant attentions in solubilization based ser applications due to their high solubilization capacity of organic compounds kile and chiou 1989 zhu and rhue 2000 insensitivity to background electrolyte concentrations rosen 1989 and easiness of biodegradation swisher 1987 yet some issues remain unresolved when such surfactants are used in ser applications first ethoxylated nonionic surfactants are more prone to sorb to aquifer materials compared to anionic surfactants jafvert and heath 1991 stellner and scamehorn 1989 surfactant sorption can make ser applications less effective by lowering both the availability of surfactants for solubilization zheng and obbard 2002 and the aquifer permeability gardner and arias 2000 second nonionic surfactants tend to partition considerably into napls butler and hayes 1998 cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 due to the amphiphilic nature surfactants are soluble in both napls and water thus causing them to partition between the two phases butler and hayes 1998 zimmerman et al 1999 as in case of the sorption loss the partitioning of surfactants into napls can reduce their active concentrations for solubilization west and harwell 1992 furthermore the unawareness of the partitioning loss may lead to artifacts in measuring the solubilization capacity of surfactants zimmerman et al 1999 third nonionic surfactants at elevated concentrations may form macroemulsions which are surfactant rich aggregates characterized by a high turbidity west and harwell 1992 unlike micelles a kind of microemulsions macroemulsions are in colloidal size schramm 1991 as a result their formation produces undesirable flow characteristics in aquifers e g permeable reduction and phase trapping shinoda and friberg 1986 west and harwell 1992 of the aforementioned issues the sorption loss of surfactants has been extensively studies in elsewhere kang and jeong 2015 khan and zareen 2006 yang et al 2010 zheng and obbard 2002 although many studies have been conducted to investigate the second issue most of them have been mainly focused on the surfactant partitioning at concentrations below cmcs bourrel and schechter 1988 brooks and richmond 1994 marquez et al 1995 ravera et al 1997 salager et al 1995 given that aqueous phase surfactant concentrations should be maintained well above cmcs in solubilization based sers it is necessary to evaluate the partitioning behaviour of surfactants under such conditions likewise there is little information on which conditions favor the macroemulsion formation in this study several ethoxylated nonionic surfactants were evaluated for their applicability to solubilize chlorinated organic phases for this considered were the partitioning loss of surfactants and the macroemulsion formation as well as the solubilization capacity importantly our focus was placed on the physicochemical behaviour of these surfactants above cmcs thus the results of this study will help to choose the optimal surfactant for ser applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the ethoxylated nonionic surfactants examined were three polysorbate type surfactants tween 20 tween 40 and tween 80 and triton x 100 polyethylene glycol p 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl phenyl ether with their physical properties summarized in table s1 supplementary material in the table hlb represents the hydrophile lipophile balance which is a measure of surfactant hydrophilicity the higher hlbs surfactants have the more soluble they are in water cowell et al 2000 the aforementioned surfactants were purchased from samchun chemicals korea and used as received thus they were polydisperse mixtures of homologous components kibbey and hayes 1997 kim and weber 2003 three chlorinated organic compounds cf tce and pce from sigma aldrich were used to generate napls these compounds were selected based on both their common occurrence and a range of hydrophobicity see table s1 2 2 batch experiments to examine napl solubilization surfactant partitioning and macroemulsion formation batch experiments were carried out with 12 ml glass centrifuge vials sealed with teflon lined plastic caps wheaton a series of stock solutions having surfactant concentrations at 0 1 40 g l were prepared using 100 mm nano3 solutions these high concentrations were used to anticipate that aqueous phase surfactant concentrations were above cmcs after the partitioning between napls and water as mentioned later however aqueous phase surfactant concentrations in some cases did not reach cmcs due to the intensive partitioning into napls after transferring 10 ml of the stock solutions to centrifuge vials 1 ml of chlorinated organic compounds were added to have the initial volume ratio of napl to water at 1 10 the resultant batches were allowed to equilibrate for 3 days on a reciprocal shaker inside a fume hood at room temperature this period was sufficient to reach the equilibrium state cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 following this the vials were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min and 5 ml of the supernatants were then withdrawn using a gas tight syringe to determine the aqueous phase concentrations of both surfactants and chlorinated organic compounds if cloudy macroemulsions were present cares were taken not to withdraw them 2 3 analyses a portion of the supernatants obtained above were analyzed for aqueous phase surfactant concentrations for tween surfactants their concentrations were determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer teledyne tekmar as described in kang and jeong 2015 the supernatants were acidified using a h3po4 solution to convert inorganic carbonate species into h2co3 which was stripped by n2 purging then a persulfate solution was added under ultraviolet uv irradiation to oxidize tween surfactants into co2 subsequently the produced co2 was analyzed on a non dispersive infrared ir detector if necessary the supernatants were diluted as needed to have the aqueous phase concentrations within the calibration range 25 125 mg l for triton x 100 the aqueous phase concentration was determined by a uv spectrophotometric method sun and jaffe 1996 after diluted as needed the supernatant was transferred to quartz cuvets and its absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 275 nm for both tween surfactants and triton x 100 the aqueous phase concentrations were determined based on the calibration curve obtained from the standard solutions for the analysis of chlorinated organic compounds 0 5 ml of aliquots from the remaining supernatants were mixed with the same volume of methanol the resultant mixtures were then analyzed on a gas chromatograph gc clarus 600 perkin elmer equipped with a db 624 column j w scientific and an electron capture detector the injector temperature was kept at 250 c the oven temperature was initially isothermal at 40 c for 5 min then ramped at the rate of 10 c min to 80 c and kept isothermal for 5 min and ramped at 15 c min to 200 c and kept isothermal for 10 min finally the aqueous phase concentrations of the solubilized chlorinated organic compounds were determined by comparing gc peak areas to calibration curves more details of gc analysis are available in jeong 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 micellar solubilization fig 1 presents the micellar solubilization of chlorinated organic phases by ethoxylated nonionic surfactants the extent of micellar solubilization is generally given by a molar solubilization ratio msr edwards et al 1991 1 msr c w c w s s t s cmc where c w is the molar concentration of the solubilized organic compound c w s is the molar aqueous phase solubility of the organic compound s t is the total molar concentration of a surfactant and s cmc is the molar cmc concentration of the surfactant in practice msr can be determined by the slope of a linear part in a plot of aqueous phase organic concentrations versus total surfactant concentrations zimmerman et al 1999 using this approach the msrs were determined for a combination of napl water systems with the results in table s2 as indicated by the near constant c w in fig 1 a the most hydrophilic cf was not appreciably solubilized under our experimental conditions similarly zimmerman et al 1999 reported little solubilization of cf by ethoxylated nonionic surfactants as discussed later most of the initially added surfactants partitioned into napl phase cf keeping their aqueous phase concentrations below or near cmcs in contrast with an exception of triton x 100 in tce water systems the aqueous phase concentrations of tce and pce were found to increase with s t see figs 1 b and c no apparent solubilization of tce by triton x 100 was also attributable to its substantial partitioning loss into napl phase tce a close examination of figs 1 b and c reveals that the onset of the linear parts lags behind the apparent cmcs due to the partitioning loss of surfactants into napls zimmerman et al 1999 among the tween surfactants the msr of tce was found to be larger than that of pce see table s2 this contrasts with the previous finding that a more hydrophobic organic compound has a greater tendency to partition into micelles edwards et al 1991 jafvert and heath 1991 valsaraj and thibodeaux 1989 on the contrary the extent of solubilization was shown to increase with the smaller molar volume of organic compounds chaiko et al 1984 diallo et al 1994 thus the smaller molar volume of tce than pce see table s1 better explains the larger msr of the former in this study as shown in fig 1 and table s2 the observed msr varied significantly with the surfactant used in fig s1 the msrs of tce and pce are plotted against the hlbs of surfactants within the homologous series of tween surfactants the msr increased with the lower hlb i e the more hydrophobicity this was likely due to the greater partitioning of both organic compounds into more hydrophobic cores of micelles in agreement a more hydrophobic surfactant was found to have a greater msr zimmerman et al 1999 despite the lowest hlb however triton x 100 showed the msr of pce comparable to tween 40 and even smaller than tween 80 considering the significantly different structure between triton x 100 and tween surfactants specific interaction between organic compounds and micelles would matter for example if pce can partition into the shell portions of micelles besides their cores such a process may be favored by longer hydrophobic tails of tween surfactants than triton x 100 compare their molecular weights in table s1 although not documented for pce other organic compounds have been observed to partition into the shell portions of micelles bernardez and ghoshal 2004 chaiko et al 1984 nagarajan et al 1984 several important findings can be summarized solubilization based ser seems not to be adequate for removal of napl phase cf also tce can be more readily solubilized than pce among the surfactants examined tween 80 has the greatest solubilization capacity for both tce and pce yet as previously mentioned the selection of optimal surfactants requires other considerations such as surfactant partitioning loss and macroemulsion formation these two aspects are discussed in the following sections 3 2 partitioning loss of surfactants fig 2 describes the partitioning of surfactants between napls and water since the volume of napls decreased as a result of micellar solubilization napl phase surfactant concentrations s o were corrected for such volume decreases cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 notably s o continued to increase with aqueous phase surfactant concentrations s w well above cmcs in principle surfactant partitioning is a monomeric process thus rendering the extent of napl phase partitioning limited by the micelle formation in the aqueous phase zhu and free 2015 for monodisperse surfactants thus the maximum plateau surfactant concentrations in napls are reached as s w approach cmcs cowell et al 2000 harusawa et al 1980 kibbey and chen 2008 in contrast the partitioning of polydisperse surfactants into napls continuously increases above cmcs due to the different partitioning tendencies among multiple components harusawa and tanaka 1981 harusawa et al 1980 warr et al 1983 in fact the surfactant partitioning leads to the fractionation of polydisperse surfactants in such a way that more hydrophobic components selectively partition into the napls with more hydrophilic components remaining in the aqueous phase butler and hayes 1998 kibbey and chen 2008 accordingly the continued npal phase partitioning beyond cmcs in this study was likely due to the polydispersity of the surfactants used similarly cowell et al 2000 observed the continued surfactant partitioning into napls until s w increased 100 times as high as cmcs for polydisperse surfactants their napl phase concentrations were found to asymptotically approach the plateau concentrations cowell et al 2000 kibbey and chen 2008 this partitioning behaviour is illustrated in fig s2 where a more hydrophobic component is assumed to have a lower cmc and a greater tendency to partition into napls cowell et al 2000 kibbey and chen 2008 zimmerman et al 1999 in fig s2 the partitioning of each component is characterized by a sharp break at cmc whereas that of their mixture follows a langmuir like isotherm as such the data in fig 2 was fitted into langmuir isotherms 2 s o s o p k s w 1 k s w where s o p is the napl phase plateau concentration of a surfactant and k is the affinity constant of the surfactant for napls in fig 2 the partitioning data are reasonably well represented by langmuir isotherms with the fitting parameters provided in table s3 in case that k s w is much smaller than the unity in the denominator of eq 2 this equation is simplified into 3 s o s o p k s w k l s w here the lumped parameter k l s o p k is defined as the linear partitioning parameter note that this parameter is different from the linear partition coefficient that describes the relationship between s o and s w below cmcs by using this single lumped parameter it is more convenient to compare the partitioning tendency among different surfactants the larger k l a surfactant has the greater tendency it has to partition into napls since surfactant partitioning is influenced by the volume ratio of napl to water graciaa et al 1983 kibbey and chen 2008 the k l values in table s3 should be regarded as conditional in fig 2 and table s3 the most hydrophobic surfactant triton x 100 exhibited the greatest partitioning loss into all three napls notably its partitioning into napl phase cf and tce was nearly complete thus keeping its aqueous phase concentration below the cmc under our experimental conditions previously the partitioning loss of triton x 100 into napl phase tce and bromoform were found to be over 99 and 97 respectively zhao et al 2006 as mentioned above such a loss led to no micellar solubilization of cf and tce by triton x 100 in fig 2 the napl phase partitioning extents of the tween surfactants are in the order of tween 80 tween 40 tween 20 in cf water systems tween 80 tween 20 tween 40 in tce water systems and tween 80 tween 40 tween 20 in pce water systems generally a higher hydrophobic tween surfactant are more prone to partition into napls similarly the surfactants having fewer ethoxylated polar heads were found to have greater partitioning losses into napls cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 in some cases however the specific interaction between surfactants and napls may be so large as to produce deviations from the aforementioned trend e g tween 20 tween 40 in tce water systems in fig 2 the most hydrophilic cf showed the greatest surfactant partitioning loss whereas the most hydrophobic pce did the least partitioning loss for highly hydrophilic organic compounds e g cf and dichloromethane the surfactant partitioning was so great that nearly all of the added surfactants were lost into napls edwards et al 1991 zimmerman et al 1999 in this study there was no sign of leveling off in the cf phase surfactant concentrations thus no solubilization of cf was likely due to the substantial surfactants loss in contrast for more hydrophobic tce and pce the napl phase surfactant concentrations appeared to start to level off with an exception of triton x 100 in tce water systems consistent with this the surfactant partitioning loss was found to increase with the hydrophilicity of napls cowell et al 2000 shiau et al 1994 zimmerman et al 1999 the leveling off in the napl phase surfactant concentrations results from micelle formation which limits the aqueous monomeric surfactants available for napl partitioning saito and shinoda 1967 as discussed above the extent of surfactant partitioning is affected by the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of both surfactants and organic compounds in this regard cowell et al 2000 have proposed an empirical formula in which the napl phase plateau concentrations of surfactants s o p in mg l is correlated with the cmcs of surfactants in mg l and the interfacial tensions of organic compounds ift in dyn cm 4 s o p κ cmc α ift β where the empirical constants κ α and β are 5 3 1015 0 4 and 6 2 respectively since a more hydrophilic surfactant has a higher cmc kibbey and chen 2008 it represents the hydrophilicity of the surfactants in eq 4 in fig 3 a the s o p values obtained in this study are compared to those predicted according to eq 4 in this figure the average behavior of our data is reasonably estimated by eq 4 but the difference between the two is substantial in some cases from eq 4 two shortcomings are recognized first while cmc and ift can represent the interactions of surfactant water and water napl respectively no parameter is included to account for the interaction among surfactant napl water second the parameters in eq 4 are not consistent in unit thus the following formula is proposed 5 log 10 s o p mm a b log 10 cmc mm c hlb d log 10 c w s m where the hlb of a surfactant accounts for the interaction among surfactant napl water and the aqueous solubility of an organic compound c w s represents the interaction of water napl also all concentration units e g mg l or g l are converted into molarities e g mm or m and that they are then taken the logarithm of to be consistent with the dimension of free energy μi μi o rt ln γi c i for molar free energy a multiple linear regression of the s o p values using eq 5 produced a 9 19 1 61 b 7 40 10 3 1 46 10 1 c 0 35 0 10 and d 0 75 0 28 with the adjusted determination coefficient adjusted r 2 of 0 737 in fig 3 the s o p estimation by eq 5 is a little better than that by eq 4 a close examination reveals that the parameter b in eq 5 is associated with a large error with a very small t stat 0 05 on the other hand the t stats of c and d are 3 38 and 2 69 much greater than that of b accordingly the least significant descriptor cmc is removed from eq 5 6 log 10 s o p mm a c hlb d log 10 c w s m a multiple linear regression using eq 6 led to a slightly better fitting adjusted r 2 0 767 with a 9 18 1 51 c 0 35 0 10 and d 0 74 0 15 while the negative c indicates the decreasing surfactant partitioning loss with the hlb hydrophilicity of surfactants the positive d points to the increasing partitioning loss with the c w s hydrophilicity of organic compounds also judging from the t stats of c 3 62 and d 5 00 the properties of surfactants and organic compounds are both important in determining the surfactant partitioning in napl water systems as shown in fig 3 b there is still a room to improve the s o p estimation by eq 6 for example one may introduce activities a i instead of molar concentrations to account for non ideality a i γi c i where γi and c i are the activity coefficient and molar concentration of species i respectively also the surfactant partitioning in some instances showed no sign of leveling off see fig 2 thus producing large uncertainties in determining s o p nonetheless as discussed below the use of higher surfactant concentrations to approach s o p would cause the formation of macroemulsions thus making it difficult to separate between napls and water 3 3 macroemulsion formation in fig 4 macroemulsions are characterized by milky phases with a high turbidity or cloudiness their formation is undesirable since it leads to either permeable reduction and or phase trapping during aquifer remediation shinoda and friberg 1986 west and harwell 1992 as shown in fig 4 the 24 h settling or the centrifuging at 5000 rpm helped to destabilize the emulsions indicating that they were not thermodynamically stable despite the kinetic persistence schramm 1991 also higher surfactant concentrations were found to intensify the formation of macroemulsions as a result the formation of macroemulsions may hinder the use of highly concentrated surfactants to promote the solubilization of napls in the absence of napls macroemulsions did not form even at highly elevated surfactant concentrations thus such emulsions were considered to be surfactant rich aggregates that contained not only water molecules but also organic ones shiau et al 1994 west and harwell 1992 in fig 4 several features can be gleaned regarding the macroemulsion formation among a combination of surfactants and napls first all tween surfactants in cf water systems showed the formation of macroemulsions the extent of which was the greatest for tween 20 even when the 24 h settling was insufficient to destabilize these emulsions the centrifuging at 5000 rpm could effectively remove them in contrast no such emulsions were observed for triton x 100 in cf water systems second the macroemulsion formation in tce water systems was more extensive than in cf water systems for example macroemulsions were found to form in tce water systems at the total concentrations of tween 40 and tween 80 at 5 g l unlike in the case of cf water systems also at the total concentration of triton x 100 at 40 g l their formation was noted in tce water systems nonetheless as in the case of cf water systems the macroemulsion formation in tce water systems was greater by tween surfactants than by triton x 100 third the extent of macroemulsion formation and their stability in pce water systems were comparable to those in tce water systems unexpectedly the macroemulsion formation by tween 80 was more intensive at the total concentration at 5 g l than 40 g l taken together the macroemulsion formation seems to be more problematic with more hydrophilic surfactants and more hydrophobic napls notably all tween surfactants may be encountered with the macroemulsion issue at the elevated concentrations once formed such emulsions are expected to last for a while although triton x 100 appears to a good candidate for ser applications it has the greatest tendency for napl phase partitioning 4 environmental implications in this study ethoxylated nonionic surfactants were investigated for micellar solubilization napl phase partitioning and macroemulsion formation to evaluate their ser applicability to the sites contaminated with chlorinated organic phases due to the excessive partitioning loss of surfactants napl phase cf the most hydrophilic organic compound examined may not be relevant for solubilization based ser applications this is also true of other highly hydrophilic organic compounds such as 1 1 2 tetrachloroethane and dichloromethane edwards et al 1991 zimmerman et al 1999 on the other hand napl phase tce and pce with moderate surfactant partitioning losses can be removed via micellar solubilization as indicated by the larger msr tce is more effectively solubilized than pce due to its smaller molar volume the msrs of tce and pce become greater with the increasing hydrophobicity of tween surfactants for example tween 80 the most hydrophobic tween surfactant in this study was shown to have the greatest solubilization capacity of both chlorinated organic phases yet more hydrophobic tween surfactants were found to partition into napls to greater extents a plot of msr versus k l is prepared in fig 5 to select the optimal tween surfactant in case of tce the msr is rather insensitive to the type of tween surfactants whereas the k l varies significantly thus it is better to select the surfactant with the least partitioning loss the smallest k l tween 20 to effectively solubilize napl phase tce in case of pce the opposite pattern is noted thus making the surfactant having the highest solubilization capacity the largest msr tween 80 more relevant furthermore the extent of napl contaminations needs to be taken into accounts when choosing the optimal surfactant zimmerman et al 1999 for example a more hydrophilic surfactant should be preferred to treat heavily contaminated sites despite its lower solubilization capacity among the surfactants examined triton x 100 exhibited the greatest partitioning into all three napls of particular its partitioning loss into cf and tce phases was nearly complete making impractical its application to the remediation of both chlorinated organic phases also triton x 100 substantially partitioned into napl phase pce although it could solubilize pce previously nonionic and anionic surfactants were found to form mixed micelles the properties of which were quite different from those of individual micelles rosen 1989 zhao et al 2005 zhu and feng 2003 when used with anionic surfactants triton x 100 showed a remarkably reduced partitioning loss by forming mixed micelles making this nonionic surfactant effective for the removal of napl phase tce zhao et al 2006 the similar approach may be applied to tween surfactants the formation of macroemulsions can significantly reduce the effectiveness of ser applications by causing undesirable flows in aquifers shinoda and friberg 1986 west and harwell 1992 in this study the macroemulsion formation becomes more intensive as surfactant concentrations increase also their formation seems to be greater with more hydrophilic surfactants and more hydrophobic organic compounds thus especially when hydrophilic surfactants are selected to solubilize hydrophobic organic phases it is important to apply them at the concentrations below which the formation of macroemulsions can be prevented given that the macroemulsion formation is sensitive to temperature such concentrations should be determined under the aquifer conditions west and harwell

1587,selection of proper surfactants is critical for applying surfactant enhanced remediation ser to sites contaminated with nonaqueous phase liquids napls here ethoxylated nonionic surfactants tween 20 tween 40 tween 80 and triton x 100 were evaluated for their applicability to remedy chlorinated organic phases chloroform cf trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce on the basis of solubilization capacity partitioning behavior and macroemulsion formation the most hydrophilic cf was not relevant for ser applications since excessive surfactant partitioning into cf rendered only few of them available for its solubilization in contrast the more hydrophobic tce and pce having moderate surfactant partitioning were effectively solubilized among tween surfactants a more hydrophobic surfactant showed a larger solubilization potential for both chloroethylenes but it suffered from a greater partitioning loss depending on the type and extent of napl contaminations thus a prior consideration should be given to either solubilization capacity or partitioning loss when selecting the optimal tween surfactant compared to tween surfactants the more hydrophobic triton x 100 showed greater partitioning losses into all three napls of particular its partitioning into cf and tce was nearly complete making impractical its application to the remediation of both organic liquids the formation of macroemulsions characterized by a high turbidity may significantly deteriorate ser applicability by producing undesirable flows in aquifers their formation became more problematic with the increasing surfactant hydrophilicity and the increasing napl hydrophobicity when these combinations are applied it is critical to keep such surfactant concentrations as to exploit the solubilization potential but not to cause the macroemulsion formation keywords surfactant enhanced remediation ser nonaqueous phase liquids napls micellar solubilization partitioning loss macroemulsion formation 1 introduction chlorinated organic compounds such as chloroform cf trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce are widespread contaminants in subsurface environments u s epa 2004 due to the immiscibility with water these pollutants usually form nonaqueous phase liquids napls which can serve as long term contamination sources by slowly dissolving to form plumes along groundwater flow paths thus drawing environmental concerns jeong 2012 kang and jeong 2015 shiau et al 1994 zhao et al 2006 a common approach to restore the sites contaminated with such napls is a pump and treat method kang and jeong 2015 shiau et al 1994 however this method has proven to be not effective due to the low aqueous solubility and slow dissolution kinetics of chlorinated organic compounds mackay and cherry 1989 mercer and cohen 1990 zhao et al 2006 for example a conventional pump and treat method may need to extract hundreds to thousands of pore volumes of water or even more to clean up residual napls shiau et al 1994 thus surfactant enhanced remediation ser has often been accompanied to enhance napl remediation by a pump and treat method cowell et al 2000 pennell et al 1993 west and harwell 1992 in ser applications napl removal can be accomplished by two processes solubilization and mobilization cowell et al 2000 palmer and fish 1992 above critical micelle concentrations cmcs aqueous surfactant molecules form micelles in which the hydrophobic tails of surfactant molecules are orientated to the center of micelles while their hydrophilic heads are pointed toward the bulk aqueous phase rosen 1989 then organic molecules can partition into the hydrophobic cores of micelles thus making their apparent aqueous solubility increase pennell et al 1993 west and harwell 1992 this process is referred to as micellar solubilization on the other hand surfactants can significantly lower the interfacial tension between napls and water to form middle phase microemulsions that are composed of organic water and surfactant molecules palmer and fish 1992 then such emulsions can be readily mobilized to be removed via pumping shiau et al 1994 of the two solubilization was investigated here given the technical difficulties in producing middle phase microemulsions e g obtaining a proper balance of surfactant systems and preventing the formation of rigid intermediate phases bourrel and chambu 1983 west and harwell 1992 ethoxylated nonionic surfactants have drawn significant attentions in solubilization based ser applications due to their high solubilization capacity of organic compounds kile and chiou 1989 zhu and rhue 2000 insensitivity to background electrolyte concentrations rosen 1989 and easiness of biodegradation swisher 1987 yet some issues remain unresolved when such surfactants are used in ser applications first ethoxylated nonionic surfactants are more prone to sorb to aquifer materials compared to anionic surfactants jafvert and heath 1991 stellner and scamehorn 1989 surfactant sorption can make ser applications less effective by lowering both the availability of surfactants for solubilization zheng and obbard 2002 and the aquifer permeability gardner and arias 2000 second nonionic surfactants tend to partition considerably into napls butler and hayes 1998 cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 due to the amphiphilic nature surfactants are soluble in both napls and water thus causing them to partition between the two phases butler and hayes 1998 zimmerman et al 1999 as in case of the sorption loss the partitioning of surfactants into napls can reduce their active concentrations for solubilization west and harwell 1992 furthermore the unawareness of the partitioning loss may lead to artifacts in measuring the solubilization capacity of surfactants zimmerman et al 1999 third nonionic surfactants at elevated concentrations may form macroemulsions which are surfactant rich aggregates characterized by a high turbidity west and harwell 1992 unlike micelles a kind of microemulsions macroemulsions are in colloidal size schramm 1991 as a result their formation produces undesirable flow characteristics in aquifers e g permeable reduction and phase trapping shinoda and friberg 1986 west and harwell 1992 of the aforementioned issues the sorption loss of surfactants has been extensively studies in elsewhere kang and jeong 2015 khan and zareen 2006 yang et al 2010 zheng and obbard 2002 although many studies have been conducted to investigate the second issue most of them have been mainly focused on the surfactant partitioning at concentrations below cmcs bourrel and schechter 1988 brooks and richmond 1994 marquez et al 1995 ravera et al 1997 salager et al 1995 given that aqueous phase surfactant concentrations should be maintained well above cmcs in solubilization based sers it is necessary to evaluate the partitioning behaviour of surfactants under such conditions likewise there is little information on which conditions favor the macroemulsion formation in this study several ethoxylated nonionic surfactants were evaluated for their applicability to solubilize chlorinated organic phases for this considered were the partitioning loss of surfactants and the macroemulsion formation as well as the solubilization capacity importantly our focus was placed on the physicochemical behaviour of these surfactants above cmcs thus the results of this study will help to choose the optimal surfactant for ser applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the ethoxylated nonionic surfactants examined were three polysorbate type surfactants tween 20 tween 40 and tween 80 and triton x 100 polyethylene glycol p 1 1 3 3 tetramethylbutyl phenyl ether with their physical properties summarized in table s1 supplementary material in the table hlb represents the hydrophile lipophile balance which is a measure of surfactant hydrophilicity the higher hlbs surfactants have the more soluble they are in water cowell et al 2000 the aforementioned surfactants were purchased from samchun chemicals korea and used as received thus they were polydisperse mixtures of homologous components kibbey and hayes 1997 kim and weber 2003 three chlorinated organic compounds cf tce and pce from sigma aldrich were used to generate napls these compounds were selected based on both their common occurrence and a range of hydrophobicity see table s1 2 2 batch experiments to examine napl solubilization surfactant partitioning and macroemulsion formation batch experiments were carried out with 12 ml glass centrifuge vials sealed with teflon lined plastic caps wheaton a series of stock solutions having surfactant concentrations at 0 1 40 g l were prepared using 100 mm nano3 solutions these high concentrations were used to anticipate that aqueous phase surfactant concentrations were above cmcs after the partitioning between napls and water as mentioned later however aqueous phase surfactant concentrations in some cases did not reach cmcs due to the intensive partitioning into napls after transferring 10 ml of the stock solutions to centrifuge vials 1 ml of chlorinated organic compounds were added to have the initial volume ratio of napl to water at 1 10 the resultant batches were allowed to equilibrate for 3 days on a reciprocal shaker inside a fume hood at room temperature this period was sufficient to reach the equilibrium state cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 following this the vials were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min and 5 ml of the supernatants were then withdrawn using a gas tight syringe to determine the aqueous phase concentrations of both surfactants and chlorinated organic compounds if cloudy macroemulsions were present cares were taken not to withdraw them 2 3 analyses a portion of the supernatants obtained above were analyzed for aqueous phase surfactant concentrations for tween surfactants their concentrations were determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer teledyne tekmar as described in kang and jeong 2015 the supernatants were acidified using a h3po4 solution to convert inorganic carbonate species into h2co3 which was stripped by n2 purging then a persulfate solution was added under ultraviolet uv irradiation to oxidize tween surfactants into co2 subsequently the produced co2 was analyzed on a non dispersive infrared ir detector if necessary the supernatants were diluted as needed to have the aqueous phase concentrations within the calibration range 25 125 mg l for triton x 100 the aqueous phase concentration was determined by a uv spectrophotometric method sun and jaffe 1996 after diluted as needed the supernatant was transferred to quartz cuvets and its absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 275 nm for both tween surfactants and triton x 100 the aqueous phase concentrations were determined based on the calibration curve obtained from the standard solutions for the analysis of chlorinated organic compounds 0 5 ml of aliquots from the remaining supernatants were mixed with the same volume of methanol the resultant mixtures were then analyzed on a gas chromatograph gc clarus 600 perkin elmer equipped with a db 624 column j w scientific and an electron capture detector the injector temperature was kept at 250 c the oven temperature was initially isothermal at 40 c for 5 min then ramped at the rate of 10 c min to 80 c and kept isothermal for 5 min and ramped at 15 c min to 200 c and kept isothermal for 10 min finally the aqueous phase concentrations of the solubilized chlorinated organic compounds were determined by comparing gc peak areas to calibration curves more details of gc analysis are available in jeong 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 micellar solubilization fig 1 presents the micellar solubilization of chlorinated organic phases by ethoxylated nonionic surfactants the extent of micellar solubilization is generally given by a molar solubilization ratio msr edwards et al 1991 1 msr c w c w s s t s cmc where c w is the molar concentration of the solubilized organic compound c w s is the molar aqueous phase solubility of the organic compound s t is the total molar concentration of a surfactant and s cmc is the molar cmc concentration of the surfactant in practice msr can be determined by the slope of a linear part in a plot of aqueous phase organic concentrations versus total surfactant concentrations zimmerman et al 1999 using this approach the msrs were determined for a combination of napl water systems with the results in table s2 as indicated by the near constant c w in fig 1 a the most hydrophilic cf was not appreciably solubilized under our experimental conditions similarly zimmerman et al 1999 reported little solubilization of cf by ethoxylated nonionic surfactants as discussed later most of the initially added surfactants partitioned into napl phase cf keeping their aqueous phase concentrations below or near cmcs in contrast with an exception of triton x 100 in tce water systems the aqueous phase concentrations of tce and pce were found to increase with s t see figs 1 b and c no apparent solubilization of tce by triton x 100 was also attributable to its substantial partitioning loss into napl phase tce a close examination of figs 1 b and c reveals that the onset of the linear parts lags behind the apparent cmcs due to the partitioning loss of surfactants into napls zimmerman et al 1999 among the tween surfactants the msr of tce was found to be larger than that of pce see table s2 this contrasts with the previous finding that a more hydrophobic organic compound has a greater tendency to partition into micelles edwards et al 1991 jafvert and heath 1991 valsaraj and thibodeaux 1989 on the contrary the extent of solubilization was shown to increase with the smaller molar volume of organic compounds chaiko et al 1984 diallo et al 1994 thus the smaller molar volume of tce than pce see table s1 better explains the larger msr of the former in this study as shown in fig 1 and table s2 the observed msr varied significantly with the surfactant used in fig s1 the msrs of tce and pce are plotted against the hlbs of surfactants within the homologous series of tween surfactants the msr increased with the lower hlb i e the more hydrophobicity this was likely due to the greater partitioning of both organic compounds into more hydrophobic cores of micelles in agreement a more hydrophobic surfactant was found to have a greater msr zimmerman et al 1999 despite the lowest hlb however triton x 100 showed the msr of pce comparable to tween 40 and even smaller than tween 80 considering the significantly different structure between triton x 100 and tween surfactants specific interaction between organic compounds and micelles would matter for example if pce can partition into the shell portions of micelles besides their cores such a process may be favored by longer hydrophobic tails of tween surfactants than triton x 100 compare their molecular weights in table s1 although not documented for pce other organic compounds have been observed to partition into the shell portions of micelles bernardez and ghoshal 2004 chaiko et al 1984 nagarajan et al 1984 several important findings can be summarized solubilization based ser seems not to be adequate for removal of napl phase cf also tce can be more readily solubilized than pce among the surfactants examined tween 80 has the greatest solubilization capacity for both tce and pce yet as previously mentioned the selection of optimal surfactants requires other considerations such as surfactant partitioning loss and macroemulsion formation these two aspects are discussed in the following sections 3 2 partitioning loss of surfactants fig 2 describes the partitioning of surfactants between napls and water since the volume of napls decreased as a result of micellar solubilization napl phase surfactant concentrations s o were corrected for such volume decreases cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 notably s o continued to increase with aqueous phase surfactant concentrations s w well above cmcs in principle surfactant partitioning is a monomeric process thus rendering the extent of napl phase partitioning limited by the micelle formation in the aqueous phase zhu and free 2015 for monodisperse surfactants thus the maximum plateau surfactant concentrations in napls are reached as s w approach cmcs cowell et al 2000 harusawa et al 1980 kibbey and chen 2008 in contrast the partitioning of polydisperse surfactants into napls continuously increases above cmcs due to the different partitioning tendencies among multiple components harusawa and tanaka 1981 harusawa et al 1980 warr et al 1983 in fact the surfactant partitioning leads to the fractionation of polydisperse surfactants in such a way that more hydrophobic components selectively partition into the napls with more hydrophilic components remaining in the aqueous phase butler and hayes 1998 kibbey and chen 2008 accordingly the continued npal phase partitioning beyond cmcs in this study was likely due to the polydispersity of the surfactants used similarly cowell et al 2000 observed the continued surfactant partitioning into napls until s w increased 100 times as high as cmcs for polydisperse surfactants their napl phase concentrations were found to asymptotically approach the plateau concentrations cowell et al 2000 kibbey and chen 2008 this partitioning behaviour is illustrated in fig s2 where a more hydrophobic component is assumed to have a lower cmc and a greater tendency to partition into napls cowell et al 2000 kibbey and chen 2008 zimmerman et al 1999 in fig s2 the partitioning of each component is characterized by a sharp break at cmc whereas that of their mixture follows a langmuir like isotherm as such the data in fig 2 was fitted into langmuir isotherms 2 s o s o p k s w 1 k s w where s o p is the napl phase plateau concentration of a surfactant and k is the affinity constant of the surfactant for napls in fig 2 the partitioning data are reasonably well represented by langmuir isotherms with the fitting parameters provided in table s3 in case that k s w is much smaller than the unity in the denominator of eq 2 this equation is simplified into 3 s o s o p k s w k l s w here the lumped parameter k l s o p k is defined as the linear partitioning parameter note that this parameter is different from the linear partition coefficient that describes the relationship between s o and s w below cmcs by using this single lumped parameter it is more convenient to compare the partitioning tendency among different surfactants the larger k l a surfactant has the greater tendency it has to partition into napls since surfactant partitioning is influenced by the volume ratio of napl to water graciaa et al 1983 kibbey and chen 2008 the k l values in table s3 should be regarded as conditional in fig 2 and table s3 the most hydrophobic surfactant triton x 100 exhibited the greatest partitioning loss into all three napls notably its partitioning into napl phase cf and tce was nearly complete thus keeping its aqueous phase concentration below the cmc under our experimental conditions previously the partitioning loss of triton x 100 into napl phase tce and bromoform were found to be over 99 and 97 respectively zhao et al 2006 as mentioned above such a loss led to no micellar solubilization of cf and tce by triton x 100 in fig 2 the napl phase partitioning extents of the tween surfactants are in the order of tween 80 tween 40 tween 20 in cf water systems tween 80 tween 20 tween 40 in tce water systems and tween 80 tween 40 tween 20 in pce water systems generally a higher hydrophobic tween surfactant are more prone to partition into napls similarly the surfactants having fewer ethoxylated polar heads were found to have greater partitioning losses into napls cowell et al 2000 zimmerman et al 1999 in some cases however the specific interaction between surfactants and napls may be so large as to produce deviations from the aforementioned trend e g tween 20 tween 40 in tce water systems in fig 2 the most hydrophilic cf showed the greatest surfactant partitioning loss whereas the most hydrophobic pce did the least partitioning loss for highly hydrophilic organic compounds e g cf and dichloromethane the surfactant partitioning was so great that nearly all of the added surfactants were lost into napls edwards et al 1991 zimmerman et al 1999 in this study there was no sign of leveling off in the cf phase surfactant concentrations thus no solubilization of cf was likely due to the substantial surfactants loss in contrast for more hydrophobic tce and pce the napl phase surfactant concentrations appeared to start to level off with an exception of triton x 100 in tce water systems consistent with this the surfactant partitioning loss was found to increase with the hydrophilicity of napls cowell et al 2000 shiau et al 1994 zimmerman et al 1999 the leveling off in the napl phase surfactant concentrations results from micelle formation which limits the aqueous monomeric surfactants available for napl partitioning saito and shinoda 1967 as discussed above the extent of surfactant partitioning is affected by the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of both surfactants and organic compounds in this regard cowell et al 2000 have proposed an empirical formula in which the napl phase plateau concentrations of surfactants s o p in mg l is correlated with the cmcs of surfactants in mg l and the interfacial tensions of organic compounds ift in dyn cm 4 s o p κ cmc α ift β where the empirical constants κ α and β are 5 3 1015 0 4 and 6 2 respectively since a more hydrophilic surfactant has a higher cmc kibbey and chen 2008 it represents the hydrophilicity of the surfactants in eq 4 in fig 3 a the s o p values obtained in this study are compared to those predicted according to eq 4 in this figure the average behavior of our data is reasonably estimated by eq 4 but the difference between the two is substantial in some cases from eq 4 two shortcomings are recognized first while cmc and ift can represent the interactions of surfactant water and water napl respectively no parameter is included to account for the interaction among surfactant napl water second the parameters in eq 4 are not consistent in unit thus the following formula is proposed 5 log 10 s o p mm a b log 10 cmc mm c hlb d log 10 c w s m where the hlb of a surfactant accounts for the interaction among surfactant napl water and the aqueous solubility of an organic compound c w s represents the interaction of water napl also all concentration units e g mg l or g l are converted into molarities e g mm or m and that they are then taken the logarithm of to be consistent with the dimension of free energy μi μi o rt ln γi c i for molar free energy a multiple linear regression of the s o p values using eq 5 produced a 9 19 1 61 b 7 40 10 3 1 46 10 1 c 0 35 0 10 and d 0 75 0 28 with the adjusted determination coefficient adjusted r 2 of 0 737 in fig 3 the s o p estimation by eq 5 is a little better than that by eq 4 a close examination reveals that the parameter b in eq 5 is associated with a large error with a very small t stat 0 05 on the other hand the t stats of c and d are 3 38 and 2 69 much greater than that of b accordingly the least significant descriptor cmc is removed from eq 5 6 log 10 s o p mm a c hlb d log 10 c w s m a multiple linear regression using eq 6 led to a slightly better fitting adjusted r 2 0 767 with a 9 18 1 51 c 0 35 0 10 and d 0 74 0 15 while the negative c indicates the decreasing surfactant partitioning loss with the hlb hydrophilicity of surfactants the positive d points to the increasing partitioning loss with the c w s hydrophilicity of organic compounds also judging from the t stats of c 3 62 and d 5 00 the properties of surfactants and organic compounds are both important in determining the surfactant partitioning in napl water systems as shown in fig 3 b there is still a room to improve the s o p estimation by eq 6 for example one may introduce activities a i instead of molar concentrations to account for non ideality a i γi c i where γi and c i are the activity coefficient and molar concentration of species i respectively also the surfactant partitioning in some instances showed no sign of leveling off see fig 2 thus producing large uncertainties in determining s o p nonetheless as discussed below the use of higher surfactant concentrations to approach s o p would cause the formation of macroemulsions thus making it difficult to separate between napls and water 3 3 macroemulsion formation in fig 4 macroemulsions are characterized by milky phases with a high turbidity or cloudiness their formation is undesirable since it leads to either permeable reduction and or phase trapping during aquifer remediation shinoda and friberg 1986 west and harwell 1992 as shown in fig 4 the 24 h settling or the centrifuging at 5000 rpm helped to destabilize the emulsions indicating that they were not thermodynamically stable despite the kinetic persistence schramm 1991 also higher surfactant concentrations were found to intensify the formation of macroemulsions as a result the formation of macroemulsions may hinder the use of highly concentrated surfactants to promote the solubilization of napls in the absence of napls macroemulsions did not form even at highly elevated surfactant concentrations thus such emulsions were considered to be surfactant rich aggregates that contained not only water molecules but also organic ones shiau et al 1994 west and harwell 1992 in fig 4 several features can be gleaned regarding the macroemulsion formation among a combination of surfactants and napls first all tween surfactants in cf water systems showed the formation of macroemulsions the extent of which was the greatest for tween 20 even when the 24 h settling was insufficient to destabilize these emulsions the centrifuging at 5000 rpm could effectively remove them in contrast no such emulsions were observed for triton x 100 in cf water systems second the macroemulsion formation in tce water systems was more extensive than in cf water systems for example macroemulsions were found to form in tce water systems at the total concentrations of tween 40 and tween 80 at 5 g l unlike in the case of cf water systems also at the total concentration of triton x 100 at 40 g l their formation was noted in tce water systems nonetheless as in the case of cf water systems the macroemulsion formation in tce water systems was greater by tween surfactants than by triton x 100 third the extent of macroemulsion formation and their stability in pce water systems were comparable to those in tce water systems unexpectedly the macroemulsion formation by tween 80 was more intensive at the total concentration at 5 g l than 40 g l taken together the macroemulsion formation seems to be more problematic with more hydrophilic surfactants and more hydrophobic napls notably all tween surfactants may be encountered with the macroemulsion issue at the elevated concentrations once formed such emulsions are expected to last for a while although triton x 100 appears to a good candidate for ser applications it has the greatest tendency for napl phase partitioning 4 environmental implications in this study ethoxylated nonionic surfactants were investigated for micellar solubilization napl phase partitioning and macroemulsion formation to evaluate their ser applicability to the sites contaminated with chlorinated organic phases due to the excessive partitioning loss of surfactants napl phase cf the most hydrophilic organic compound examined may not be relevant for solubilization based ser applications this is also true of other highly hydrophilic organic compounds such as 1 1 2 tetrachloroethane and dichloromethane edwards et al 1991 zimmerman et al 1999 on the other hand napl phase tce and pce with moderate surfactant partitioning losses can be removed via micellar solubilization as indicated by the larger msr tce is more effectively solubilized than pce due to its smaller molar volume the msrs of tce and pce become greater with the increasing hydrophobicity of tween surfactants for example tween 80 the most hydrophobic tween surfactant in this study was shown to have the greatest solubilization capacity of both chlorinated organic phases yet more hydrophobic tween surfactants were found to partition into napls to greater extents a plot of msr versus k l is prepared in fig 5 to select the optimal tween surfactant in case of tce the msr is rather insensitive to the type of tween surfactants whereas the k l varies significantly thus it is better to select the surfactant with the least partitioning loss the smallest k l tween 20 to effectively solubilize napl phase tce in case of pce the opposite pattern is noted thus making the surfactant having the highest solubilization capacity the largest msr tween 80 more relevant furthermore the extent of napl contaminations needs to be taken into accounts when choosing the optimal surfactant zimmerman et al 1999 for example a more hydrophilic surfactant should be preferred to treat heavily contaminated sites despite its lower solubilization capacity among the surfactants examined triton x 100 exhibited the greatest partitioning into all three napls of particular its partitioning loss into cf and tce phases was nearly complete making impractical its application to the remediation of both chlorinated organic phases also triton x 100 substantially partitioned into napl phase pce although it could solubilize pce previously nonionic and anionic surfactants were found to form mixed micelles the properties of which were quite different from those of individual micelles rosen 1989 zhao et al 2005 zhu and feng 2003 when used with anionic surfactants triton x 100 showed a remarkably reduced partitioning loss by forming mixed micelles making this nonionic surfactant effective for the removal of napl phase tce zhao et al 2006 the similar approach may be applied to tween surfactants the formation of macroemulsions can significantly reduce the effectiveness of ser applications by causing undesirable flows in aquifers shinoda and friberg 1986 west and harwell 1992 in this study the macroemulsion formation becomes more intensive as surfactant concentrations increase also their formation seems to be greater with more hydrophilic surfactants and more hydrophobic organic compounds thus especially when hydrophilic surfactants are selected to solubilize hydrophobic organic phases it is important to apply them at the concentrations below which the formation of macroemulsions can be prevented given that the macroemulsion formation is sensitive to temperature such concentrations should be determined under the aquifer conditions west and harwell

1588,this paper presents a new modelling approach to describe and explain the temporal variation of oil thickness in well due to groundwater table fluctuations this new model which intends to be simple and easy to implement was compared to field data obtained by continuous measurements of vertical lnapl position in wells two scenarios have been studied a pumping well where the oil layer is unconfined and one where the oil layer is present in a confined porous media this study shows that the time depend fluctuation of the oil thickness observed in the wells could not be reproduced only with the differences between the residual oil saturations sorw and sora as suggested by kemblowski and chiang 1990 it should consider the transient mass exchange between the well and the porous media also the proposed model shows that making the assumption of equilibrium conditions as suggested by lenhard et al 2017 for calculating the volume exchanges between the wells and its surrounding introduced errors considering transient transfers of oil better reflects the field observations this observation is a key outcome for improving field data interpretation e g bail down test data and the remedial approach at site polluted by mineral oils 1 introduction since the 1950s an increasing number of sites contaminated by hydrocarbons or mineral oil have been identified in industrialized countries these compounds correspond to liquids that are immiscible in water and because they are generally lighter than water they are so called light nonaqueous phase liquids lnapl to recover this oil present in the subsurface it is of primary importance to estimate the amount of oil present in the porous media and its evolution the amount of oil retained in the unsaturated and saturated zones is not equivalent to the amount present in a monitoring well due to the effects of porosity and capillary pressure furthermore the oil distribution in the soil and the oil that will flow to the well is also driven by the groundwater fluctuation gatsios et al 2018 for instance deska and ociepa 2013 showed in a simplified experiment that the lnapl thickness in the aquifer was different from the one measured in the well some simplified field methods de pastrovich et al 1979 hughes et al 1988 zilliox and muntzer 1975 were proposed to estimate the oil thickness in the aquifer but a comparison of these methods at a site dippenaar et al 2005 showed results that were not satisfactory mainly because the methods did not calculate correctly the capillary effects several scientific publications addressed the quantification of the lnapl volume in homogeneous media charbeneau et al 2000 lenhard and parker 1990a or heterogeneous media johnston and trefry 2009 however temporal variations of oil thickness in a well linked to variations in the water table levels were rarely studied the amount of lnapl in a well has been shown to vary with the water table ballestero et al 1994 showed that the lnapl thickness in a well increases when the water table drops and declines when the water table rises steffy et al 1995 measured in detail the temporal variations of lnapl thicknesses both in an aquifer and a well they showed that the lnapl moves vertically in an aquifer with water table fluctuations leading to periods of absence of lnapl in the well when groundwater is high other experiments involving water table fluctuations outlined that after several events of water table rise and fall the lnapl layer was also moving steffy et al 1998 and the oil was spreading laterally in the porous media leading to lower average oil saturations in a similar way white et al 2004 showed that during the first drainage stage there is a significant loss of mobile oil into a residual immobile saturation thus reducing significantly the mobile amount experimental work showed that during the water table variation the lnapl top and bottom position vary both in the well and in the aquifer due to the potential delay between the movement in the aquifer compared to movement in the well the thickness of the oil layer in the well can vary significantly and lnapl can even disappear from the well at high water table levels additionally very few papers detail the effects of water table variations with mainly two different explanations for the origin of the variations on one hand marinelli and durnford 1996 and kemblowski and chiang 1990 suggest that the thickness variations are mainly due to the difference in residual saturation s or in the saturated and unsaturated zone of the porous aquifer the authors provide an analytical solution linking the variations in the well to those in the porous media however their approach does not quantify transient mass exchanges between the well and the porous media and the solution was not compared to actual field data on the other hand aral and liao 2002 provided a model for the transient exchange between the well and the aquifer that was based on a simplified homogeneous lnapl layer without considering the effect of variable s or recently lenhard et al 2017 presented a modelling approach to compute the distribution of lnapl in the porous media from actual and historical well data their approach adds the properties of entrapped oil to the classical capillary equilibrium approach introduced by lenhard and parker 1990b and relates the amount of residual oil to the historical positions of the oil in the well as it is based on an equilibrium assumption this approach cannot be used to assess the oil permeability of the aquifer the objective of this paper is to present a novel modelling approach that considers both the role of the residual oil saturations s or and vertical movement of the lnapl layer in the aquifer to our knowledge this approach is the first to present a simple approach based on a multiphase description of the medium that allows to fully interpret the transient variations of well thickness and position in a well the approach must remain simple and easy to implement as it is intended to fit field data that were obtained by continuous measurements of the vertical lnapl position in a well the analysis concerns two scenarios a pumping well where the lnapl layer is unconfined and one where the oil layer is present in a confined porous media this paper is organized as follows section material and methods presents ii the key assumptions to calculate the groundwater fluctuations in both the well and the aquifer ii theoretical background proposed to explain how the oil saturation is influenced by the groundwater fluctuation and iii the field case study in the section results the proposed theoretical model is applied for some test cases and for the unconfined and confined conditions encountered during the field study results from the theoretical model are compared to the field measurements finally the sections discussion and conclusion expand the conclusions from section results comparing the obtained results with other approaches and discussing the domain in which this approach can be applied 2 material and methods 2 1 theoretical background the floating oil phase thickness in a well can vary rapidly and this change in thickness in the well cannot reflect the variation in the aquifer itself particularly in presence of high viscosity oil the modelling approach described below is based on some elements of aral and liao 2002 with significant modifications and different notations that require a full description the non equilibrium situation can be described as in fig 1 using for simplification a layer of mobile oil of time invariant characteristics two main situations may occur in fig 1a the height of the oil air interface in the well z oa is lower than the one in the aquifer n oa therefore oil can move from the aquifer to the well in the same figure the pressure in the two fluids within the aquifer is drawn and it can be seen that the oil pressure at the bottom of the oil layer is higher than the oil pressure at equilibrium state p o stat p w p cow and thus the oil layer will move downward fig 1b shows the reverse case with an oil interface z oa in the well being higher than in the aquifer pressure values used in the following explanation are expressed as differential pressures relative to the constant pressure in the atmosphere the relative pressure in the air of the unsaturated zone is thus considered equal to zero to calculate the fluctuations in both the well and the aquifer the following assumptions are made 1 the pressure equilibrates much faster in the water phase than in the oil the pressure at the bottom of the well is thus considered to be equivalent to the pressure at the same elevation in the aquifer inducing blue dotted and solid line to be overlaid in fig 1 2 as historical groundwater movements may have reached both higher and lower levels than the current position a presence of residual oil below and above the mobile oil is considered 3 the volume of mobile oil moving through a unit surface area is considered to be constant this arises from the previous assumption of the presence of residual oil and from the negligible volume of oil in the well compared to the aquifer 4 the presence of air on top of the oil leading to an atmospheric pressure at this elevation 5 the presence of a mobile oil layer in the porous media 6 a constant value of oil hydraulic conductivity in the oil layer assumption 1 is different from the work of aral and liao 2002 because here we consider oil with a significantly higher viscosity than water assumption 2 was not used by aral and liao 2002 but can be considered as valid for field conditions lenhard et al 2017 steffy et al 1995 note that the mathematical approach used here to quantify the vertical displacement of the water oil front resp oil air front in an unconfined porous medium is easier to handle than the one introduced by aral and liao 2002 2 1 1 oil layer in unconfined porous media if the oil saturation is considered constant in an oil layer having a constant thickness the vertical movement of the mobile oil layer may be caused by the pressure difference δp between the oil pressure due to the height of the mobile oil layer and the pressure of the oil phase at equilibrium state at the water oil interface supposing a simultaneous displacement of both the water oil and oil air interface the vertical darcy velocity of the mobile oil layer u o can be described with the generalized darcy law muskat 1937 1 u o k o p ρ o gb o k k r μ p b o where ρ o is the volumetric mass of oil in kg m 3 k o the average oil conductivity of the porous medium in m s 1 depending on the given oil saturation within the oil layer k the intrinsic permeability in m2 and k r the relative permeability to oil μ the oil dynamic viscosity in pa s 1 g is the gravitational acceleration in m s 2 and b o the oil thickness in the formation in m at equilibrium state of an immiscible fluid distribution in the porous medium the pressure of the water phase and oil phase can be expressed at the water oil interface z n ow as follows see fig 1a 2a p w z p n ow ρ w g 2b p o z p n ow ρ w g pc

oil layer to displace oil vertically downwards from a given oil layer the oil pressure needs to be higher than the oil pressure expressed by eq 2b for the situation presented in fig 1a the vertical movement is potentially possible when the oil pressure caused by the oil layer thickness b0 yields to a pressure difference 3 p b o ρ o g z p n ow ρ w g pc ow higher than zero given this transient condition from darcy s law and the conservation of mass principle for the oil phase the front velocity of the water oil interface can be calculated 4 θ o d n ow dt k o p ρ o g b o where θ o is the volumetric content of the pore space filled by oil neglecting the lateral loss of oil to the well the displacement of the oil air interface is obtained from the vertical displacement of the water oil interface for a given time interval dt as follows 5 d n oa d n ow due to the assumption of quasi instantaneous equilibrium and the negligible amount of water in the well compared to the amount of water in the aquifer the exchange of water between the well and the aquifer is not calculated the exchange of oil between the well and the aquifer can be calculated using classical fluid flow methods describing the movement of fluid from an unconfined aquifer to a well thiem 1906 6 q o 2 π k o max n oa z oa max n ow z ow z oa n oa ln r e r w where r e is the equivalent radius and r w the radius of the well casing m the oil head difference is n oa z oa and the thickness over which the oil is exchanged is the place where oil is present in both the well and the aquifer this flux is considered as positive when the flux is going from the well to the aquifer the conservation of mass principle applied to the well yields to the velocity of the water oil interface in the well calculated as follows 7 d z ow dt q o π r c 2 where r c is the radius of the well m during the oil exchange between the well and the aquifer due to fast water exchanges and due to pressure equilibrium in the well we consider that the piezometric head in the well remains equal to the imposed groundwater head in the porous media z p due to fast water exchanges and due to pressure equilibrium in the well 8 z p z ow

time dependent variation of z oa is strongly linked to z ow by effect of the oil density 9b d z ow ρ r q o π r c 2 dt d z oa ρ r 1 ρ r eqs 4 and 7 can be iteratively solved by an explicit method considering a series of steady state conditions requiring short time steps equations currently developed assume a constant residual and maximum oil saturation in the porous medium however the residual oil saturation in the non saturated zone s ora zone can be lower than in the saturated zone s orw bohy et al 2006 moreover depending on the characteristic of the porous medium the maximum saturation s max z can vary with elevation this saturation will directly impact the quantification of the vertical displacement of the water oil interface dn ow see eq 4 as δp depends directly on the capillary pressure between the water and oil phase p cow a function of the oil saturation itself the total specific volume of oil v o is considered to remain constant therefore dv o 0 using eq 3 the specific volume being the height multiplied by saturation and porosity ϕ 10 d v a dn oa s max n oa s ora and d v w dn ow s max n ow s orw where dv a and dv w are the variations of air and water volume per square meter in order to maintain a constant volume the equality of the two volumes is assumed or 11 d n oa d n ow s max n ow s orw s max n oa s ora note that if s max and s or are constant over the entire porous media thickness eq 11 takes the form of eq 5 on the contrary the oil layer thickness b o also varies with time it is recalculated during each iteration 2 1 2 oil layer in confined or semi confined porous media in a strictly confined medium i e when the pressure head is always higher than the bottom of the confining medium the oil cannot move thus the only process that will occur is the variation of water and oil levels in the well to equilibrate the variations of head in that case we have 12 d z ow d z oa d z p however this case is not so common and most of the wells concerned by the present study include a confining layer of thickness smaller than the oil thickness several cases including confinement or semi confinement can occur depending on the relative position of the confining layer and the top and bottom of the oil to analyze these different cases the confining case was modeled by assigning a low permeability to the confining layer the previous equations have thus to be modified to consider a vertical variation of the medium permeability for the vertical oil movement the movement is perpendicular to the layering and we have 13 k ov n oa n ow l i k i where l i and k i are the thickness and oil permeability of each layer included in the oil between n oa and n ow as the permeability to oil is generally low in silt layers this will often lead to very slow vertical movements of oil in the aquifer for the transfer between the well and the aquifer the averaging is different as the flow is parallel to the layering 14 k oh l i k i max n oa z oa max n ow z ow here a thin layer of sand at any depth can significantly increase the exchange between the well and the aquifer it can be noted that if the permeability is homogeneous these equations lead to the same value of k o and thus to the same equations as in the unconfined case to maintain the consistency with the unconfined approach allowing for a very low oil content in the silt layers the top of the oil in the aquifer n oa is at atmospheric pressure as in fig 1 2 2 site and oil thickness measurements the studied site is a manufacturing facility which started production in 1973 using several types of oil the site is located on the alluvial plain of the garonne river in france the local shallow layers are composed of 12 to 18 m of pleistocene sediments mainly gravels and sands over a thick tertiary marl layer from ground surface to the tertiary marl this upper layer is vertically and horizontally heterogeneous due to a large grain size distribution variation from fine sand to gravel leading to a weak capillary effect to neglect capillary forces here for modelling of lnapl displacement between well and porous media is thus justified in addition thin silty lenses are randomly encountered across the site groundwater beneath this site is unconfined with a seasonal fluctuation between 2 and 3 5 m below ground surface the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has been estimated from pumping tests at four different locations across the site the values are in close agreement ranging between 2 6 and 3 10 4 m s 1 the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater is quantified to 0 0025 and is oriented from south west to north east the soil and groundwater baseline campaign highlighted four main areas where oil was encountered with a total extent of approximately 15 000 m2 the oil thicknesses measured in 120 wells ranged from a few centimeters to 2 5 m fig 2 presents the location of key monitoring wells that have been used for this study due to the long history of the site and the complexity of past industrial processes the nature and the released volume of oil are unknown the oil properties classify it as mostly lubricant oil with the use of a number of oil products over the years oil mixing in the soil precipitation and different degradation stages the physical properties of the oil slightly vary in space contributing to a range of values as summarized in table 1 the oil viscosity and relative density have been measured on 25 oil samples and the interfacial tension on four samples the positions of the air oil and oil water interfaces were continuously monitored using three pressure gauges fig 3 probe 1 provides the atmospheric pressure and probe 3 measures the total pressure of water and oil lnapl in the well as probe 2 is located in the water at a fixed distance l from the top of the napl layer by knowing the oil density and the three pressures it is possible to obtain the position of the oil water and the air water interface a regular manual measurement of the interfaces was completed to confirm validation of the automated measurements and to insure the absence of drift 3 results 3 1 test cases to illustrate the behaviour of the model with simple changes to the piezometric water head for a napl of 0 85 relative density four tests cases were used for simplification purpose these test cases do not include capillary effects and thus the oil thickness in the well and in the aquifer will be equal at equilibrium the obtained results are given in fig 4 test case 1 shows a situation where horizontal oil conductivity is equal to 0 02 m d 1 and the vertical oil conductivity is set to zero which results in fixed n ow and n oa here around day 5 20 cm of raising peak at day 7 followed up by 20 cm of lowering of the water table were created the perturbation of the piezometric water head lasts about five days during that peak it can be seen that z oa is rising and then becomes higher than n oa leading to a discharge of oil from the well to the aquifer this discharge leads to a decrease of the oil thickness in the well which is marked mainly by the significant rise of the z ow level then at approximately day 9 the vertical position of the oil air interface becomes higher than zoa resulting in a flow back of oil from the aquifer to the well and decrease of the vertical position of the oil water interface in the well towards its initial position of equilibrium the second test case starts from the same equilibrium conditions as case 1 and is exposed to the same fluctuation of piezometric water head as before but the vertical oil conductivity in the aquifer is equal to the horizontal one 0 02 m d 1 leading to a vertical movement of the oil in the aquifer during the 27 days of the numerical experiment both vertical positions of fluid interfaces n oa and n ow decrease in the aquifer to equilibrate with the z p level this in turn leads to a decrease of the z oa level in the long term and thus a decrease of the oil layer thickness in the well therefore the oil thickness in the well depends on the equilibrium between z p and the oil in the aquifer in the case of higher oil conductivity the oil thickness observed in the well becomes smaller test case 3 uses the same conditions as test case 2 but with a different starting point for n ow and n oa as the oil in the formation is much higher than the equilibrium state it leads to an increasing thickness of the oil in the well before day 5 the oil in the aquifer tends to equilibrate with z p but at a slower rate as after 25 days the oil thickness in the well zoa zow is still greater than in case 2 test case 4 illustrates a completely different situation here z p rises steadily and finally reaches an elevation higher than the initial vertical position at t 0 of the oil air interface in the porous media n oa in that situation all the oil present in the well flows into the aquifer and the oil thickness in the well becomes zero from the analysis of all test cases it can be seen that the variations are quite complex as the vertical positions of the fluid interfaces in the well and in the aquifer equilibrate at different time scales moreover these results clearly illustrate that the oil thickness is almost never the same in the well and in the aquifer 3 2 application to oil layers in unconfined aquifers 3 2 1 automatic measurements the solutions were first applied to the case of an oil layer in unconfined porous media using automatic data measurements of monitoring well pz262 after manual tests the optimal values of the parameters given in table 2 were found using the excel solver testing both nonlinear and evolutionary options fig 5 shows that a good fit case 0 zow on the figure was finally obtained with an rmse root mean square error around 0 09 m table 2 the first interesting point is the presence of a significantly lower value of oil conductivity k 2 in the upper part of the unconfined aquifer visible once the water table elevation exceeds 3 2 m the presence of this low conductivity zone is highlighted by the stable value of z oa after the peak of day 80 and rapid lowering of zow resulting in a significant increase of the measured oil thickness in the well after this peak the low oil conductivity located in the upper part of the aquifer may have limited the decrease of the elevation the oil air interface the fitted values of s max and s or are also very interesting to fit the whole curve only a very small difference between s max and s or is necessary this means that a very small proportion of the oil is mobile and may also justify the high value of oil conductivity in the lower part of the aquifer k 1 as only the largest pores contain mobile oil the fitted values of s orw and s ora are also quite different this suggests that the effect mentioned by marinelli and durnford 1996 of a transfer of oil from mobile to immobile is important this has an important consequence during the rise of the water table between day 60 and day 80 in fig 5 the thickness of the mobile oil layer in the aquifer declines largely although an important mass of oil remain in the aquifer as oil reappears when the water table declines this is illustrated by the increase of n oa in fig 5 several tests were done case 1 to 4 that can reach the same correctness of fit table 2 s orw s max and k 2 and the starting position n oa and n ow were varied in a realistic range and show a similar value of the rmse in case 1 k 2 is increased which may result in a decrease of the difference between s max and s orw case 2 is quite similar to case 0 except that n oa is slightly higher in case 3 both n oa and n ow were slightly higher and the difference between s max and s orw is smaller case 4 is also similar to case 0 with a smaller difference between s max and s orw but the rmse is then higher than the one of case 0 this analysis indicates that some parameters are correlated although not in a simple way several trials were done without the presence of a low permeability layer above 3 2 m and gave a correct fit case 5 rmse 0 133 m as long as we keep a small difference between s max and sorw other tests were done for a small value of the sorw the residual oil saturation in the saturated zone they gave a correct fit case 6 rmse 0 118 m if the low permeability value is kept above 3 2 m on the contrary if we remove both the low permeability layer and keep a low value for sorw the fit becomes less correct case 7 rmse 0 31 these elements tend to suggest that there are two major elements for the given well 1 presence of a small amount of mobile oil in the porous media and 2 existence of a two layered porous medium with a low permeability above an elevation of 3 2 m these two elements seem to co exist and contribute both to a good fit of the observed measurements however only one element is sufficient to fit correctly the observed data none of the tested parameter set without one of this element can give a correct fit 3 2 2 long term series on the wells with long term manual measurements we applied the same modelling approach see fig 6 the piezometric water head data are provided every ten days at the reference points not at the measured well while the oil levels were measured every two or three months it can be seen that for this observation well pz262 the fit is also correct however the sensitivity to the input parameters is small and thus the uncertainty in the parameter s value is high this has two main reasons the manual measurements are of worse quality than the automatic measurements and there is no series of data on a short time scale to fit correctly the oil conductivity again the true thickness of the oil in the aquifer is difficult to determine with this approach it was not possible to assess the potential vertical variations of saturation despite these uncertainties the fitted oil conductivity of approximately 0 07 m d 1 is quite close to the one of the previous well and is in a range of plausible values 3 3 application to oil layers in confined or semi confined aquifers 3 3 1 automatic measurements on the pz264 well automatic measurements of the vertical position of the fluid interfaces z ow z oa were acquired every two hours in this area of the polluted site some layers of silt were identified it is therefore possible that the oil movement in this well might be semi confined or confined in the measured variations of interfaces positions fig 7 zow m zoa m the presence of a confined medium can be detected when their temporal variation is shifted almost parallely to the occurring water table variation this implies that the amount of oil in the well is almost independent of the one in the aquifer during this period this can be due to very low oil conductivity in the aquifer applying a layered aquifer structure composed of a main layer with low conductivity and high permeable layers above and below the model provide a good fit for zoa and some slight discrepancies for zow fig 7 reference case it can also be seen that based on the obtained model parameters table 3 the resulting n oa and n ow are stable showing an almost immobile oil layer in the aquifer corresponding to a confinement by a silt or clay layer when the oil conductivity is low the other parameters like oil saturation do not play a role in the fitting case 2 shows a trial with only one layer for the oil conductivity it can be seen that the fit before day 95 is similar to the previous ones although slightly worse however after day 95 when the top of the oil reaches an elevation of 4 5 m the model significantly underestimates measured vertical position of the oil water interface this confirms the presence of a more permeable layer above this elevation 4 discussion 4 1 b o z ow correlations the correlations found between oil thickness in the well z oa z ow and the position of the interface z ow were investigated by kemblowski and chiang 1990 if we consider the approach presented here in an unconfined porous medium these correlations are mainly linked to the equilibrium in the well when some oil is transferred to the aquifer due to density effects the major effect is seen on z ow in theory in a homogeneous unconfined medium with fast exchange with no movement of the oil in the aquifer the slope shall be equal to the oil density fig 8a shows the relation between b o and z ow for the well pz262 which is unconfined it can be seen that during some period there is no correlation while some points show a clear correlation this correlation occurs after day 74 see fig 5 i e when the water table starts to move the slope of the correlation line is equal to 0 95 which is slightly different from the value of the relative oil density 0 88 in that well this difference may be justified by the movement of the oil phase in the aquifer as function of time in an entirely confined system the oil thickness in the well does not change in semi confined systems there are likely periods similar to the confined situations when the exchange with the well is quite rapid and during these periods the slope may be similar to the unconfined i e equal to the relative oil density during the period of no exchange the thickness shall not change there shall also be transition periods when the exchange is rapidly decreasing or increasing thus with no specific slope fig 8b shows the behavior of the well 264 which is semi confined for that well a large number of points do not show a clear trend only a short period after day 96 see 8 shows a correlation between b o and z ow this period is the only one when the oil is connected to a more permeable part in the well i e the behavior of a part of the oil is close to unconfined before this period the well is not totally confined as b o remains stable during some periods and varies during others 4 2 comparison with other approaches as outlined in the introduction some authors assumed that the oil thickness variations over time observed in the well are due to the difference in the residual oil saturations s orw and s ora kemblowski and chiang 1990 marinelli and durnford 1996 this possible effect is taken explicitly into account in our model the curve fitting procedure provides different values for the two residual oil saturations however the time dependent fluctuations of the oil thickness observed in the wells could not be reproduced only with these differences a movement of oil between the well and the aquifer was required the approach recently proposed by lenhard et al 2017 analyses the oil vertical distribution in relation with historical data in their approach the authors consider that due to an equilibrium state the oil distribution in the formation should be defined by considering only the highest and lowest position of the oil air interface in the well and the actual oil position in the well their equilibrium calculations may not be applicable to field measurements as it leads to a steady thickness of the oil in the well while our field results indicate that this thickness is highly transient 4 3 effect of oil viscosity the model was developed and applied to quite viscous oil 100 cp which leads to slow movements of the oil in the formation this property has consequences on the model itself as it assumes a very fast equilibrium in the water phase compared to the oil phase to test this assumption we used the same model for the well pz262 but multiplied the hydraulic conductivity of the oil by a factor of one hundred to consider an oil of low viscosity close to the viscosity of water or gasoline the results are shown in fig 9 although the fit is not as good the figure shows that the oil water interface in the formation n ow is closer to z ow than in fig 5 but remain quite different from z ow so n ow variation is much slower than the one in the well therefore the main assumption of our model i e a fast equilibration in the well and a slow one in the formation remains valid in fact as only a portion of the porosity is occupied by the oil leading to a low value of k ro and thus the assumption of slow oil movement in the formation seems to still be valid this graph also outlines that even with the low viscosity oil the assumption of a well aquifer equilibrium for the oil is almost never reached the possible difference of the elevation of the fluid interfaces between the well and the porous medium resulting from the water oil capillarity in the porous media has not been taken into account in the interpretation of our field experiments this is justified by the rather low capillarity of the gravel sand formation note that capillary pressure may modify the oil thickness in the well but the transient differences between interfaces position in the well and the aquifer shall remain it is difficult to define precisely the domain of validity of our approach but the present result suggests that it may be valid for low viscosity oil in formations of hydraulic conductivity as high as 50 m d 1 4 4 sensitivity study of the obtained model parameters in the case of oil layers in unconfined aquifers a sensitivity analysis was performed on the obtained fit parameters to estimate the relative role of each model parameter the base values obtained from the best fit of the pz262 data were used case 0 the sensitivity of each model parameter was calculated by varying these base parameters by 10 of the potential range for each parameter called applied δ table 4 the potential range was estimated from the knowledge of the site characteristics which are presented in table 4 as min and max for the oil conductivities k 1 and k 2 the 10 range of variation were calculated on the decimal log of their base value as classically done when using hydraulic conductivities to quantify the individual sensitivity of each model parameter we used the calculated vertical positions of the oil water interface of z ow for different measuring periods for each modified model parameter and for four selected measuring periods the relative difference between the calculated z ow and the reference value obtained for case0 was quantified and time averaged over the selected period fig 10 it appears clearly that the model is not linear as the results for a positive and negative δ can be very different the first parameter that shows a significant sensitivity is the relative density of the oil ρ indicating that this parameter must be measured very accurately at the well for some periods a 10 variation of ρ leads to a variation slightly higher than 10 of the z ow range the initial position of the interface in the porous medium n ow0 and n oa0 also induce a significant variation of z ow this point raises some difficulties because these elevations cannot easily be measured in the field the next influencing parameter is sorw which plays only a role for a negative δ and for one period surprisingly the oil conductivities show a very low sensitivity meaning that the fitted values will keep a large degree of uncertainty however the measuring tool allows a precision of 1 to 2 cm leading to a precision equal to the value of δ for k 1 and k 2 for most of the parameters the sensitivity observed at the first peak period day 78 to 84 is the most important underlining the importance of measuring and fitting precisely the peaks of z ow 5 conclusion in this paper a simplified model for analyzing the temporal variation of the water oil interface and the oil thickness was proposed this model incorporates the variations of residual saturation between unsaturated and water saturated porous media but also exchanges between the well and the aquifer and oil movement in the aquifer the model reproduced quite well the observed characteristics of the two wells located in the field site whether in an unconfined or a semi confined part of the aquifer to our knowledge this is the first study that shows such a fitting of natural transient variations of napl levels in wells that allow to estimate several parameters of the porous medium the results suggest that the wells are most of the time not at equilibrium with the aquifer and that the oil in the porous media moves much more slowly than the water table thus a continuous record of the oil position in the well can be used to estimate the oil conductivity in the aquifer but also the oil saturation which can be quite useful for remediation purposes as it has already been shown in several studies the apparent thickness of the measured oil in a well is strongly dependent on the grain size distribution of the adjacent formation the condition in which the oil is present in the soil in an unconfined condition the oil thickness in a well does provide a good indication of head whereas a confined condition results in a misleading oil thickness the groundwater fluctuation history based on our modelling approach the impact of the groundwater fluctuation on the oil thickness in a monitoring well can be explained by the transient transfer of oil between the well and its surrounding area this is an important conclusion because this phenomenon has real consequences on data interpretation and its use for remediation project management purpose for example it impacts the values the hydraulic conductivity of the oil measured from the bail down tests which must then be corrected according to the static level of the water therefore oil thickness measurements for short term decisions relating to a remediation design is useless and can lead to substantial error long term measurements of both oil thickness in a well along with groundwater fluctuation is a better diagnostic tool it allows i to define the nature of the soil around the well and the confining situation unconfined or semi confined and ii to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the oil in the porous media knowing the evolution of both the thickness of the oil and the hydraulic conductivity of the oil the recovery of the oil in the well can be optimized according to the variations of the water table and the status of the oil layer confined or unconfined in the porous medium ultimately the proposed approach will reduce the cost of a remediation project due to its simplicity the model has limitations particularly by the use of a vertically constant oil content this may have consequences on the values of the estimated parameters but the order of magnitude of the average value of the oil conductivity may be correct furthermore neglecting capillary effects may lead also to errors on the estimated thickness of the oil phase in the aquifer however our measurements and simulations show that there is a large heterogeneity of the average physical properties which may exceed the capillary effect further application of the model to different sites may provide more confidence in the model and its applicability to different cases 
1588,this paper presents a new modelling approach to describe and explain the temporal variation of oil thickness in well due to groundwater table fluctuations this new model which intends to be simple and easy to implement was compared to field data obtained by continuous measurements of vertical lnapl position in wells two scenarios have been studied a pumping well where the oil layer is unconfined and one where the oil layer is present in a confined porous media this study shows that the time depend fluctuation of the oil thickness observed in the wells could not be reproduced only with the differences between the residual oil saturations sorw and sora as suggested by kemblowski and chiang 1990 it should consider the transient mass exchange between the well and the porous media also the proposed model shows that making the assumption of equilibrium conditions as suggested by lenhard et al 2017 for calculating the volume exchanges between the wells and its surrounding introduced errors considering transient transfers of oil better reflects the field observations this observation is a key outcome for improving field data interpretation e g bail down test data and the remedial approach at site polluted by mineral oils 1 introduction since the 1950s an increasing number of sites contaminated by hydrocarbons or mineral oil have been identified in industrialized countries these compounds correspond to liquids that are immiscible in water and because they are generally lighter than water they are so called light nonaqueous phase liquids lnapl to recover this oil present in the subsurface it is of primary importance to estimate the amount of oil present in the porous media and its evolution the amount of oil retained in the unsaturated and saturated zones is not equivalent to the amount present in a monitoring well due to the effects of porosity and capillary pressure furthermore the oil distribution in the soil and the oil that will flow to the well is also driven by the groundwater fluctuation gatsios et al 2018 for instance deska and ociepa 2013 showed in a simplified experiment that the lnapl thickness in the aquifer was different from the one measured in the well some simplified field methods de pastrovich et al 1979 hughes et al 1988 zilliox and muntzer 1975 were proposed to estimate the oil thickness in the aquifer but a comparison of these methods at a site dippenaar et al 2005 showed results that were not satisfactory mainly because the methods did not calculate correctly the capillary effects several scientific publications addressed the quantification of the lnapl volume in homogeneous media charbeneau et al 2000 lenhard and parker 1990a or heterogeneous media johnston and trefry 2009 however temporal variations of oil thickness in a well linked to variations in the water table levels were rarely studied the amount of lnapl in a well has been shown to vary with the water table ballestero et al 1994 showed that the lnapl thickness in a well increases when the water table drops and declines when the water table rises steffy et al 1995 measured in detail the temporal variations of lnapl thicknesses both in an aquifer and a well they showed that the lnapl moves vertically in an aquifer with water table fluctuations leading to periods of absence of lnapl in the well when groundwater is high other experiments involving water table fluctuations outlined that after several events of water table rise and fall the lnapl layer was also moving steffy et al 1998 and the oil was spreading laterally in the porous media leading to lower average oil saturations in a similar way white et al 2004 showed that during the first drainage stage there is a significant loss of mobile oil into a residual immobile saturation thus reducing significantly the mobile amount experimental work showed that during the water table variation the lnapl top and bottom position vary both in the well and in the aquifer due to the potential delay between the movement in the aquifer compared to movement in the well the thickness of the oil layer in the well can vary significantly and lnapl can even disappear from the well at high water table levels additionally very few papers detail the effects of water table variations with mainly two different explanations for the origin of the variations on one hand marinelli and durnford 1996 and kemblowski and chiang 1990 suggest that the thickness variations are mainly due to the difference in residual saturation s or in the saturated and unsaturated zone of the porous aquifer the authors provide an analytical solution linking the variations in the well to those in the porous media however their approach does not quantify transient mass exchanges between the well and the porous media and the solution was not compared to actual field data on the other hand aral and liao 2002 provided a model for the transient exchange between the well and the aquifer that was based on a simplified homogeneous lnapl layer without considering the effect of variable s or recently lenhard et al 2017 presented a modelling approach to compute the distribution of lnapl in the porous media from actual and historical well data their approach adds the properties of entrapped oil to the classical capillary equilibrium approach introduced by lenhard and parker 1990b and relates the amount of residual oil to the historical positions of the oil in the well as it is based on an equilibrium assumption this approach cannot be used to assess the oil permeability of the aquifer the objective of this paper is to present a novel modelling approach that considers both the role of the residual oil saturations s or and vertical movement of the lnapl layer in the aquifer to our knowledge this approach is the first to present a simple approach based on a multiphase description of the medium that allows to fully interpret the transient variations of well thickness and position in a well the approach must remain simple and easy to implement as it is intended to fit field data that were obtained by continuous measurements of the vertical lnapl position in a well the analysis concerns two scenarios a pumping well where the lnapl layer is unconfined and one where the oil layer is present in a confined porous media this paper is organized as follows section material and methods presents ii the key assumptions to calculate the groundwater fluctuations in both the well and the aquifer ii theoretical background proposed to explain how the oil saturation is influenced by the groundwater fluctuation and iii the field case study in the section results the proposed theoretical model is applied for some test cases and for the unconfined and confined conditions encountered during the field study results from the theoretical model are compared to the field measurements finally the sections discussion and conclusion expand the conclusions from section results comparing the obtained results with other approaches and discussing the domain in which this approach can be applied 2 material and methods 2 1 theoretical background the floating oil phase thickness in a well can vary rapidly and this change in thickness in the well cannot reflect the variation in the aquifer itself particularly in presence of high viscosity oil the modelling approach described below is based on some elements of aral and liao 2002 with significant modifications and different notations that require a full description the non equilibrium situation can be described as in fig 1 using for simplification a layer of mobile oil of time invariant characteristics two main situations may occur in fig 1a the height of the oil air interface in the well z oa is lower than the one in the aquifer n oa therefore oil can move from the aquifer to the well in the same figure the pressure in the two fluids within the aquifer is drawn and it can be seen that the oil pressure at the bottom of the oil layer is higher than the oil pressure at equilibrium state p o stat p w p cow and thus the oil layer will move downward fig 1b shows the reverse case with an oil interface z oa in the well being higher than in the aquifer pressure values used in the following explanation are expressed as differential pressures relative to the constant pressure in the atmosphere the relative pressure in the air of the unsaturated zone is thus considered equal to zero to calculate the fluctuations in both the well and the aquifer the following assumptions are made 1 the pressure equilibrates much faster in the water phase than in the oil the pressure at the bottom of the well is thus considered to be equivalent to the pressure at the same elevation in the aquifer inducing blue dotted and solid line to be overlaid in fig 1 2 as historical groundwater movements may have reached both higher and lower levels than the current position a presence of residual oil below and above the mobile oil is considered 3 the volume of mobile oil moving through a unit surface area is considered to be constant this arises from the previous assumption of the presence of residual oil and from the negligible volume of oil in the well compared to the aquifer 4 the presence of air on top of the oil leading to an atmospheric pressure at this elevation 5 the presence of a mobile oil layer in the porous media 6 a constant value of oil hydraulic conductivity in the oil layer assumption 1 is different from the work of aral and liao 2002 because here we consider oil with a significantly higher viscosity than water assumption 2 was not used by aral and liao 2002 but can be considered as valid for field conditions lenhard et al 2017 steffy et al 1995 note that the mathematical approach used here to quantify the vertical displacement of the water oil front resp oil air front in an unconfined porous medium is easier to handle than the one introduced by aral and liao 2002 2 1 1 oil layer in unconfined porous media if the oil saturation is considered constant in an oil layer having a constant thickness the vertical movement of the mobile oil layer may be caused by the pressure difference δp between the oil pressure due to the height of the mobile oil layer and the pressure of the oil phase at equilibrium state at the water oil interface supposing a simultaneous displacement of both the water oil and oil air interface the vertical darcy velocity of the mobile oil layer u o can be described with the generalized darcy law muskat 1937 1 u o k o p ρ o gb o k k r μ p b o where ρ o is the volumetric

oil layer to displace oil vertically downwards from a given oil layer the oil pressure needs to be higher than the oil pressure expressed by eq 2b for the situation presented in fig 1a the vertical movement is potentially possible when the oil pressure caused by the oil layer thickness b0 yields to a pressure difference 3 p b o ρ o g z p n ow ρ w g pc ow higher than zero given this transient condition from darcy s law and the conservation of mass principle for the oil phase the front velocity of the water oil interface can be calculated 4 θ o d n ow dt k o p ρ o g b o where θ o is the volumetric content of the pore space filled by oil neglecting the lateral loss of oil to the well the displacement of the oil air interface is obtained from the vertical displacement of the water oil interface for a given time interval dt as follows 5 d n oa d n ow due to the assumption of quasi instantaneous equilibrium and the negligible amount of water in the well compared to the amount of water in the aquifer the exchange of water between the well and the aquifer is not calculated the exchange of oil between the well and the aquifer can be calculated using classical fluid flow methods describing the movement of fluid from an unconfined aquifer to a well thiem 1906 6 q o 2 π k o max n oa z oa max n ow z ow z oa n oa ln r e r w where r e is the equivalent radius and r w the radius of the well casing m the oil head difference is n oa z oa and the thickness over which the oil is exchanged is the place where oil is present in both the well and the aquifer this flux is considered as positive when the flux is going from the well to the aquifer the conservation of mass principle applied to the well yields to the velocity of the water oil interface in the well calculated as follows 7 d z ow dt q o π r c 2 where r c is the radius of the well m during the oil exchange between the well and the aquifer due to fast water exchanges and due to pressure equilibrium in the well we consider that the piezometric head in the well remains equal to the imposed groundwater head in the porous media z p due to fast water exchanges and due to pressure equilibrium in the well 8 z p z ow

time dependent variation of z oa is strongly linked to z ow by effect of the oil density 9b d z ow ρ r q o π r c 2 dt d z oa ρ r 1 ρ r eqs 4 and 7 can be iteratively solved by an explicit method considering a series of steady state conditions requiring short time steps equations currently developed assume a constant residual and maximum oil saturation in the porous medium however the residual oil saturation in the non saturated zone s ora zone can be lower than in the saturated zone s orw bohy et al 2006 moreover depending on the characteristic of the porous medium the maximum saturation s max z can vary with elevation this saturation will directly impact the quantification of the vertical displacement of the water oil interface dn ow see eq 4 as δp depends directly on the capillary pressure between the water and oil phase p cow a function of the oil saturation itself the total specific volume of oil v o is considered to remain constant therefore dv o 0 using eq 3 the specific

square meter in order to maintain a constant volume the equality of the two volumes is assumed or 11 d n oa d n ow s max n ow s orw s max n oa s ora note that if s max and s or are constant over the entire porous media thickness eq 11 takes the form of eq 5 on the contrary the oil layer thickness b o also varies with time it is recalculated during each iteration 2 1 2 oil layer in confined or semi confined porous media in a strictly confined medium i e when the pressure head is always higher than the bottom of the confining medium the oil cannot move thus the only process that will occur is the variation of water and oil levels in the well to equilibrate the variations of head in that case we have 12 d z ow d z oa d z p however this case is not so common and most of the wells concerned by the present study include a confining layer of thickness smaller than the oil thickness several cases including confinement or semi confinement can occur depending on the relative position of the confining layer and the top and bottom of the oil to analyze these different cases the confining case was modeled by assigning a low permeability to the confining layer the previous equations have thus to be modified to consider a vertical variation of the medium permeability for the vertical oil movement the movement is perpendicular to the layering and we have 13 k ov n oa n ow l i k i where l i and k i are the thickness and oil permeability of each layer included in the oil between n oa and n ow as the permeability to oil is generally low in silt layers this will often lead to very slow vertical movements of oil in the aquifer for the transfer between the well and the aquifer the averaging is different as the flow is parallel to the layering 14 k oh l i k i max n oa z oa max n ow z ow here a thin layer of sand at any depth can significantly increase the exchange between the well and the aquifer it can be noted that if the permeability is homogeneous these equations lead to the same value of k o and thus to the same equations as in the unconfined case to maintain the consistency with the unconfined approach allowing for a very low oil content in the silt layers the top of the oil in the aquifer n oa is at atmospheric pressure as in fig 1 2 2 site and oil thickness measurements the studied site is a manufacturing facility which started production in 1973 using several types of oil the site is located on the alluvial plain of the garonne river in france the local shallow layers are composed of 12 to 18 m of pleistocene sediments mainly gravels and sands over a thick tertiary marl layer from ground surface to the tertiary marl this upper layer is vertically and horizontally heterogeneous due to a large grain size distribution variation from fine sand to gravel leading to a weak capillary effect to neglect capillary forces here for modelling of lnapl displacement between well and porous media is thus justified in addition thin silty lenses are randomly encountered across the site groundwater beneath this site is unconfined with a seasonal fluctuation between 2 and 3 5 m below ground surface the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has been estimated from pumping tests at four different locations across the site the values are in close agreement ranging between 2 6 and 3 10 4 m s 1 the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater is quantified to 0 0025 and is oriented from south west to north east the soil and groundwater baseline campaign highlighted four main areas where oil was encountered with a total extent of approximately 15 000 m2 the oil thicknesses measured in 120 wells ranged from a few centimeters to 2 5 m fig 2 presents the location of key monitoring wells that have been used for this study due to the long history of the site and the complexity of past industrial processes the nature and the released volume of oil are unknown the oil properties classify it as mostly lubricant oil with the use of a number of oil products over the years oil mixing in the soil precipitation and different degradation stages the physical properties of the oil slightly vary in space contributing to a range of values as summarized in table 1 the oil viscosity and relative density have been measured on 25 oil samples and the interfacial tension on four samples the positions of the air oil and oil water interfaces were continuously monitored using three pressure gauges fig 3 probe 1 provides the atmospheric pressure and probe 3 measures the total pressure of water and oil lnapl in the well as probe 2 is located in the water at a fixed distance l from the top of the napl layer by knowing the oil density and the three pressures it is possible to obtain the position of the oil water and the air water interface a regular manual measurement of the interfaces was completed to confirm validation of the automated measurements and to insure the absence of drift 3 results 3 1 test cases to illustrate the behaviour of the model with simple changes to the piezometric water head for a napl of 0 85 relative density four tests cases were used for simplification purpose these test cases do not include capillary effects and thus the oil thickness in the well and in the aquifer will be equal at equilibrium the obtained results are given in fig 4 test case 1 shows a situation where horizontal oil conductivity is equal to 0 02 m d 1 and the vertical oil conductivity is set to zero which results in fixed n ow and n oa here around day 5 20 cm of raising peak at day 7 followed up by 20 cm of lowering of the water table were created the perturbation of the piezometric water head lasts about five days during that peak it can be seen that z oa is rising and then becomes higher than n oa leading to a discharge of oil from the well to the aquifer this discharge leads to a decrease of the oil thickness in the well which is marked mainly by the significant rise of the z ow level then at approximately day 9 the vertical position of the oil air interface becomes higher than zoa resulting in a flow back of oil from the aquifer to the well and decrease of the vertical position of the oil water interface in the well towards its initial position of equilibrium the second test case starts from the same equilibrium conditions as case 1 and is exposed to the same fluctuation of piezometric water head as before but the vertical oil conductivity in the aquifer is equal to the horizontal one 0 02 m d 1 leading to a vertical movement of the oil in the aquifer during the 27 days of the numerical experiment both vertical positions of fluid interfaces n oa and n ow decrease in the aquifer to equilibrate with the z p level this in turn leads to a decrease of the z oa level in the long term and thus a decrease of the oil layer thickness in the well therefore the oil thickness in the well depends on the equilibrium between z p and the oil in the aquifer in the case of higher oil conductivity the oil thickness observed in the well becomes smaller test case 3 uses the same conditions as test case 2 but with a different starting point for n ow and n oa as the oil in the formation is much higher than the equilibrium state it leads to an increasing thickness of the oil in the well before day 5 the oil in the aquifer tends to equilibrate with z p but at a slower rate as after 25 days the oil thickness in the well zoa zow is still greater than in case 2 test case 4 illustrates a completely different situation here z p rises steadily and finally reaches an elevation higher than the initial vertical position at t 0 of the oil air interface in the porous media n oa in that situation all the oil present in the well flows into the aquifer and the oil thickness in the well becomes zero from the analysis of all test cases it can be seen that the variations are quite complex as the vertical positions of the fluid interfaces in the well and in the aquifer equilibrate at different time scales moreover these results clearly illustrate that the oil thickness is almost never the same in the well and in the aquifer 3 2 application to oil layers in unconfined aquifers 3 2 1 automatic measurements the solutions were first applied to the case of an oil layer in unconfined porous media using automatic data measurements of monitoring well pz262 after manual tests the optimal values of the parameters given in table 2 were found using the excel solver testing both nonlinear and evolutionary options fig 5 shows that a good fit case 0 zow on the figure was finally obtained with an rmse root mean square error around 0 09 m table 2 the first interesting point is the presence of a significantly lower value of oil conductivity k 2 in the upper part of the unconfined aquifer visible once the water table elevation exceeds 3 2 m the presence of this low conductivity zone is highlighted by the stable value of z oa after the peak of day 80 and rapid lowering of zow resulting in a significant increase of the measured oil thickness in the well after this peak the low oil conductivity located in the upper part of the aquifer may have limited the decrease of the elevation the oil air interface the fitted values of s max and s or are also very interesting to fit the whole curve only a very small difference between s max and s or is necessary this means that a very small proportion of the oil is mobile and may also justify the high value of oil conductivity in the lower part of the aquifer k 1 as only the largest pores contain mobile oil the fitted values of s orw and s ora are also quite different this suggests that the effect mentioned by marinelli and durnford 1996 of a transfer of oil from mobile to immobile is important this has an important consequence during the rise of the water table between day 60 and day 80 in fig 5 the thickness of the mobile oil layer in the aquifer declines largely although an important mass of oil remain in the aquifer as oil reappears when the water table declines this is illustrated by the increase of n oa in fig 5 several tests were done case 1 to 4 that can reach the same correctness of fit table 2 s orw s max and k 2 and the starting position n oa and n ow were varied in a realistic range and show a similar value of the rmse in case 1 k 2 is increased which may result in a decrease of the difference between s max and s orw case 2 is quite similar to case 0 except that n oa is slightly higher in case 3 both n oa and n ow were slightly higher and the difference between s max and s orw is smaller case 4 is also similar to case 0 with a smaller difference between s max and s orw but the rmse is then higher than the one of case 0 this analysis indicates that some parameters are correlated although not in a simple way several trials were done without the presence of a low permeability layer above 3 2 m and gave a correct fit case 5 rmse 0 133 m as long as we keep a small difference between s max and sorw other tests were done for a small value of the sorw the residual oil saturation in the saturated zone they gave a correct fit case 6 rmse 0 118 m if the low permeability value is kept above 3 2 m on the contrary if we remove both the low permeability layer and keep a low value for sorw the fit becomes less correct case 7 rmse 0 31 these elements tend to suggest that there are two major elements for the given well 1 presence of a small amount of mobile oil in the porous media and 2 existence of a two layered porous medium with a low permeability above an elevation of 3 2 m these two elements seem to co exist and contribute both to a good fit of the observed measurements however only one element is sufficient to fit correctly the observed data none of the tested parameter set without one of this element can give a correct fit 3 2 2 long term series on the wells with long term manual measurements we applied the same modelling approach see fig 6 the piezometric water head data are provided every ten days at the reference points not at the measured well while the oil levels were measured every two or three months it can be seen that for this observation well pz262 the fit is also correct however the sensitivity to the input parameters is small and thus the uncertainty in the parameter s value is high this has two main reasons the manual measurements are of worse quality than the automatic measurements and there is no series of data on a short time scale to fit correctly the oil conductivity again the true thickness of the oil in the aquifer is difficult to determine with this approach it was not possible to assess the potential vertical variations of saturation despite these uncertainties the fitted oil conductivity of approximately 0 07 m d 1 is quite close to the one of the previous well and is in a range of plausible values 3 3 application to oil layers in confined or semi confined aquifers 3 3 1 automatic measurements on the pz264 well automatic measurements of the vertical position of the fluid interfaces z ow z oa were acquired every two hours in this area of the polluted site some layers of silt were identified it is therefore possible that the oil movement in this well might be semi confined or confined in the measured variations of interfaces positions fig 7 zow m zoa m the presence of a confined medium can be detected when their temporal variation is shifted almost parallely to the occurring water table variation this implies that the amount of oil in the well is almost independent of the one in the aquifer during this period this can be due to very low oil conductivity in the aquifer applying a layered aquifer structure composed of a main layer with low conductivity and high permeable layers above and below the model provide a good fit for zoa and some slight discrepancies for zow fig 7 reference case it can also be seen that based on the obtained model parameters table 3 the resulting n oa and n ow are stable showing an almost immobile oil layer in the aquifer corresponding to a confinement by a silt or clay layer when the oil conductivity is low the other parameters like oil saturation do not play a role in the fitting case 2 shows a trial with only one layer for the oil conductivity it can be seen that the fit before day 95 is similar to the previous ones although slightly worse however after day 95 when the top of the oil reaches an elevation of 4 5 m the model significantly underestimates measured vertical position of the oil water interface this confirms the presence of a more permeable layer above this elevation 4 discussion 4 1 b o z ow correlations the correlations found between oil thickness in the well z oa z ow and the position of the interface z ow were investigated by kemblowski and chiang 1990 if we consider the approach presented here in an unconfined porous medium these correlations are mainly linked to the equilibrium in the well when some oil is transferred to the aquifer due to density effects the major effect is seen on z ow in theory in a homogeneous unconfined medium with fast exchange with no movement of the oil in the aquifer the slope shall be equal to the oil density fig 8a shows the relation between b o and z ow for the well pz262 which is unconfined it can be seen that during some period there is no correlation while some points show a clear correlation this correlation occurs after day 74 see fig 5 i e when the water table starts to move the slope of the correlation line is equal to 0 95 which is slightly different from the value of the relative oil density 0 88 in that well this difference may be justified by the movement of the oil phase in the aquifer as function of time in an entirely confined system the oil thickness in the well does not change in semi confined systems there are likely periods similar to the confined situations when the exchange with the well is quite rapid and during these periods the slope may be similar to the unconfined i e equal to the relative oil density during the period of no exchange the thickness shall not change there shall also be transition periods when the exchange is rapidly decreasing or increasing thus with no specific slope fig 8b shows the behavior of the well 264 which is semi confined for that well a large number of points do not show a clear trend only a short period after day 96 see 8 shows a correlation between b o and z ow this period is the only one when the oil is connected to a more permeable part in the well i e the behavior of a part of the oil is close to unconfined before this period the well is not totally confined as b o remains stable during some periods and varies during others 4 2 comparison with other approaches as outlined in the introduction some authors assumed that the oil thickness variations over time observed in the well are due to the difference in the residual oil saturations s orw and s ora kemblowski and chiang 1990 marinelli and durnford 1996 this possible effect is taken explicitly into account in our model the curve fitting procedure provides different values for the two residual oil saturations however the time dependent fluctuations of the oil thickness observed in the wells could not be reproduced only with these differences a movement of oil between the well and the aquifer was required the approach recently proposed by lenhard et al 2017 analyses the oil vertical distribution in relation with historical data in their approach the authors consider that due to an equilibrium state the oil distribution in the formation should be defined by considering only the highest and lowest position of the oil air interface in the well and the actual oil position in the well their equilibrium calculations may not be applicable to field measurements as it leads to a steady thickness of the oil in the well while our field results indicate that this thickness is highly transient 4 3 effect of oil viscosity the model was developed and applied to quite viscous oil 100 cp which leads to slow movements of the oil in the formation this property has consequences on the model itself as it assumes a very fast equilibrium in the water phase compared to the oil phase to test this assumption we used the same model for the well pz262 but multiplied the hydraulic conductivity of the oil by a factor of one hundred to consider an oil of low viscosity close to the viscosity of water or gasoline the results are shown in fig 9 although the fit is not as good the figure shows that the oil water interface in the formation n ow is closer to z ow than in fig 5 but remain quite different from z ow so n ow variation is much slower than the one in the well therefore the main assumption of our model i e a fast equilibration in the well and a slow one in the formation remains valid in fact as only a portion of the porosity is occupied by the oil leading to a low value of k ro and thus the assumption of slow oil movement in the formation seems to still be valid this graph also outlines that even with the low viscosity oil the assumption of a well aquifer equilibrium for the oil is almost never reached the possible difference of the elevation of the fluid interfaces between the well and the porous medium resulting from the water oil capillarity in the porous media has not been taken into account in the interpretation of our field experiments this is justified by the rather low capillarity of the gravel sand formation note that capillary pressure may modify the oil thickness in the well but the transient differences between interfaces position in the well and the aquifer shall remain it is difficult to define precisely the domain of validity of our approach but the present result suggests that it may be valid for low viscosity oil in formations of hydraulic conductivity as high as 50 m d 1 4 4 sensitivity study of the obtained model parameters in the case of oil layers in unconfined aquifers a sensitivity analysis was performed on the obtained fit parameters to estimate the relative role of each model parameter the base values obtained from the best fit of the pz262 data were used case 0 the sensitivity of each model parameter was calculated by varying these base parameters by 10 of the potential range for each parameter called applied δ table 4 the potential range was estimated from the knowledge of the site characteristics which are presented in table 4 as min and max for the oil conductivities k 1 and k 2 the 10 range of variation were calculated on the decimal log of their base value as classically done when using hydraulic conductivities to quantify the individual sensitivity of each model parameter we used the calculated vertical positions of the oil water interface of z ow for different measuring periods for each modified model parameter and for four selected measuring periods the relative difference between the calculated z ow and the reference value obtained for case0 was quantified and time averaged over the selected period fig 10 it appears clearly that the model is not linear as the results for a positive and negative δ can be very different the first parameter that shows a significant sensitivity is the relative density of the oil ρ indicating that this parameter must be measured very accurately at the well for some periods a 10 variation of ρ leads to a variation slightly higher than 10 of the z ow range the initial position of the interface in the porous medium n ow0 and n oa0 also induce a significant variation of z ow this point raises some difficulties because these elevations cannot easily be measured in the field the next influencing parameter is sorw which plays only a role for a negative δ and for one period surprisingly the oil conductivities show a very low sensitivity meaning that the fitted values will keep a large degree of uncertainty however the measuring tool allows a precision of 1 to 2 cm leading to a precision equal to the value of δ for k 1 and k 2 for most of the parameters the sensitivity observed at the first peak period day 78 to 84 is the most important underlining the importance of measuring and fitting precisely the peaks of z ow 5 conclusion in this paper a simplified model for analyzing the temporal variation of the water oil interface and the oil thickness was proposed this model incorporates the variations of residual saturation between unsaturated and water saturated porous media but also exchanges between the well and the aquifer and oil movement in the aquifer the model reproduced quite well the observed characteristics of the two wells located in the field site whether in an unconfined or a semi confined part of the aquifer to our knowledge this is the first study that shows such a fitting of natural transient variations of napl levels in wells that allow to estimate several parameters of the porous medium the results suggest that the wells are most of the time not at equilibrium with the aquifer and that the oil in the porous media moves much more slowly than the water table thus a continuous record of the oil position in the well can be used to estimate the oil conductivity in the aquifer but also the oil saturation which can be quite useful for remediation purposes as it has already been shown in several studies the apparent thickness of the measured oil in a well is strongly dependent on the grain size distribution of the adjacent formation the condition in which the oil is present in the soil in an unconfined condition the oil thickness in a well does provide a good indication of head whereas a confined condition results in a misleading oil thickness the groundwater fluctuation history based on our modelling approach the impact of the groundwater fluctuation on the oil thickness in a monitoring well can be explained by the transient transfer of oil between the well and its surrounding area this is an important conclusion because this phenomenon has real consequences on data interpretation and its use for remediation project management purpose for example it impacts the values the hydraulic conductivity of the oil measured from the bail down tests which must then be corrected according to the static level of the water therefore oil thickness measurements for short term decisions relating to a remediation design is useless and can lead to substantial error long term measurements of both oil thickness in a well along with groundwater fluctuation is a better diagnostic tool it allows i to define the nature of the soil around the well and the confining situation unconfined or semi confined and ii to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the oil in the porous media knowing the evolution of both the thickness of the oil and the hydraulic conductivity of the oil the recovery of the oil in the well can be optimized according to the variations of the water table and the status of the oil layer confined or unconfined in the porous medium ultimately the proposed approach will reduce the cost of a remediation project due to its simplicity the model has limitations particularly by the use of a vertically constant oil content this may have consequences on the values of the estimated parameters but the order of magnitude of the average value of the oil conductivity may be correct furthermore neglecting capillary effects may lead also to errors on the estimated thickness of the oil phase in the aquifer however our measurements and simulations show that there is a large heterogeneity of the average physical properties which may exceed the capillary effect further application of the model to different sites may provide more confidence in the model and its applicability to different cases 
1589,methanol extractions for chloroethene analyses are conducted on rock samples from seven closely spaced coreholes in a mudstone aquifer that was subject to releases of the nonaqueous phase liquid napl form of trichloroethene tce between the 1950 s and 1990 s although tce concentration in the rock matrix over the length of coreholes is dictated by proximity to subhorizontal bedding plane fractures elevated tce concentrations in the rock matrix are not continuous along the most permeable bedding plane fractures a complex configuration of subvertical and subhorizontal fractures appears to be responsible for the tce distribution from prior tce releases at land surface phase partitioning calculations of tce in the rock matrix show that most tce is adsorbed to solid surfaces because of the large fraction of organic carbon f oc in the mudstone large tce content in some cores indicate the likely presence of the napl form of tce in the rock matrix using average values of porosity n and f oc in phase partitioning calculations identifies a number of locations of possible napl occurrence in the rock matrix samples of mudstone analyzed for n and f oc show variability in these properties over several orders of magnitude accounting for this variability in phase partitioning calculations identifies a probability of napl occurrence p napl the spatial variability of p napl along coreholes identifies a configuration that may be attributed to a tce source zone that has evolved after emplacement due to napl dissolution adsorption and matrix diffusion 1 introduction chlorinated solvents have been widely used at commercial industrial and federal facilities for more than fifty years and releases of these compounds into the environment have resulted in contamination of the underlying groundwater pankow et al 1996 mccarty 2010 nrc 2013 discussions of the persistence of chlorinated solvents in the subsurface and processes controlling their migration as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls and as vapor aqueous and adsorbed phase contaminants are available from numerous sources including schwille 1988 mercer and cohen 1990 feenstra et al 1996 and cwiertny and scherer 2010 the characterization and remediation of chlorinated solvents in fractured rock aquifers has been a particularly vexing problem nrc 2013 nas 2015 the spatial extent and the rate of downgradient migration of aqueous phase chlorinated constituents is controlled largely by the connectivity of permeable fractures and matrix diffusion and in some cases degradation processes evaluating the longevity of groundwater contamination and the efficacy of groundwater remediation strategies in fractured rock also requires information on the diffusive exchange of aqueous phase contaminants between fractures and the intrinsic porosity of the rock referred to as the rock matrix mutch et al 1993 parker et al 1994 it is widely recognized that aqueous phase contaminants can diffuse from fractures into the rock matrix sterling et al 2005 goode et al 2014 and at a later time diffuse back into permeable fractures adversely affecting the downgradient water quality over time periods that may extend from decades to centuries parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 because fractures constitute only a small volume of the aquifer void space sites that have been subject to contamination with chlorinated constituents for multiple decades will have source zones where much or all of the napl has dissolved with most of the contaminant mass residing in the rock matrix in dissolved and adsorbed phases parker et al 1994 parker et al 1997 the retention of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix also depends on physical and chemical properties of the rock chlorinated constituents adsorb to organic carbon on solid surfaces in sedimentary formations that have undergone diagenesis a majority of the mass of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix is likely to be adsorbed to solid surfaces rather than residing in the aqueous phase occupying the pores of the rock matrix allen king et al 2002 choung et al 2014 under the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption the capacity of the rock matrix to store chlorinated constituents increases and the retardation factor scales the magnitude of diffusion out of the rock matrix resulting in longer residence times for chlorinated constituents in comparison to constituents that do not adsorb to solid surfaces parker et al 1994 boving and grathwohl 2001 identifying the distribution of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix is not easily realized because much of the contaminant mass may be in the adsorbed phase in addition to the difficulty of extracting water from the low permeability geologic materials under in situ conditions methods of analyzing rock core using methanol extractions have been developed to estimate the total mass of chlorinated constituents from aqueous adsorbed and napl phases within rock samples goldstein et al 2004 sterling et al 2005 kennel 2008 these analyses are subject to the elevated costs associated with coring and the processing of core samples immediately upon their recovery nevertheless core samples analyzed with sufficient resolution to capture the spatially variable contaminant distribution associated with fracture locations provide a relatively undisturbed evaluation of the contaminant distribution with depth in the aquifer at the time of coring in contrast samples collected from mobile groundwater in fractures intersecting boreholes even after the installation of multilevel monitoring equipment may be impacted by the hydraulic disturbances induced by drilling hydraulic connections between multiple fractures along the length of the borehole and the installation and operation of monitoring equipment shapiro 2002 sterling et al 2005 additionally concentrations of chlorinated constituents in fractures may not be representative of the aqueous concentrations in the pores of the rock matrix goode et al 2014 and are also typically collected at much lower vertical resolution than possible with core analyses thus sampling of aqueous concentrations from permeable fractures will not provide an accurate means of assessing the total contaminant mass retained in the rock matrix because of the elevated expense of installing coreholes and monitoring boreholes in fractured rock an understanding of the hydrogeologic setting is critical in locating a sparse number of coring locations and monitoring boreholes for site characterization the hydrogeologic conceptual model is then used to extrapolate the results of geochemical monitoring to infer the distribution of contaminants in sedimentary rocks that are characterized by areally extensive bedding plane fractures groundwater flow and geochemical conditions are often extrapolated in association with the structure of bedding and the local and regional stress distribution that lead to multiple fracture sets relative to the bedding in many instances bedding plane fractures are the most permeable features controlling groundwater flow and the distribution of contaminants tiedeman et al 2010 however even in formations where extensive fractures are anticipated along lithologic boundaries slight variations in fracture aperture may result in the complex distribution of the dnapls following their release at land surface simulations conducted by slough et al 1999 and mclaren et al 2012 demonstrate complex distributions of dnapls with depth and lateral extent that arise from dnapl releases in a formation characterized by a combination of subhorizontal and vertical fracturing with variable apertures the complex spatial distribution of dnapl may then lead to the complex distribution of chloroethene compounds in fractures and within the rock matrix which may not always be intuitively extrapolated from the general hydrogeologic conceptual model additionally the dnapl in the source zones of fractured rock will evolve over decades due to dissolution into the advecting groundwater and diffusion into the rock matrix parker et al 2018 such that much or all of the dnapl has transformed to aqueous and adsorbed phases that may show a signature in the rock matrix in the vicinity of the source zone this investigation uses measured chloroethene concentrations in the rock matrix of a mudstone aquifer to illustrate the complexity of the contaminant distribution that can arise over relatively short lateral and vertical distances in sedimentary formations attempting to infer the distribution of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix based on evidence from a single corehole may lead to erroneous interpretations even in groundwater flow regimes that are dominated by bedding plane fractures this investigation uses chloroethene profiles from rock core analyzed from seven closely spaced boreholes in a 9 m diameter footprint at the former naval air warfare center nawc west trenton nj fig 1 the nawc was an aircraft engine testing facility that operated between the mid 1950 s and mid 1990 s where the use of trichloroethene tce resulted in releases at multiple locations that led to the contamination of the groundwater in the underlying mudstone aquifer lacombe 2000 lacombe and burton 2010 the mudstone underlying the nawc is characterized by areally extensive bedding plane fractures associated with fissile units in the mudstone that have been shown to be responsible for the majority of groundwater flow tiedeman et al 2010 tiedeman et al 2018 in addition this article investigates the partitioning of chloroethene compounds in the rock matrix between the napl aqueous and adsorbed phases the analyses of rock cores using methanol extraction methods does not distinguish between the napl aqueous and adsorbed phases differentiating between tce phases in the rock matrix requires information on rock matrix properties in particular the porosity n bulk density ρ b and fraction of organic carbon f oc estimates of n and f oc are usually derived from a sparse number of rock samples where average values are applied in the calculation of the tce partitioning kueper et al 2003 sterling et al 2005 shapiro et al 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018a showed that n and f oc can vary over orders of magnitude over distances of centimeters even within continuous mudstone layers additionally n and f oc are dependent on the depositional conditions attributed to mudstone layers this investigation examines calculations of the partitioning of tce into napl aqueous and adsorbed phases in the rock matrix using average values of rock properties and compares those results to calculations that consider the variability in n and f oc characterizing the partitioning between the napl aqueous and adsorbed phases can potentially identify locations of tce contamination that require targeted remediation additionally characterizing the chloroethene partitioning can affect estimates of contaminant longevity and decisions on applying remediation technologies that attempt to accelerate the release of chlorinated constituents from the rock matrix 2 hydrogeologic setting the nawc is underlain by triassic age rocks of the newark basin olsen et al 1996 fig 1 the upper strata of the stockton formation and the lower strata of the lockatong formations are exposed at land surface due to faulting the contact between the stockton and lockatong formations appears as a near vertical fault zone at the southern extent of the nawc fig 1 however tce has only been detected in the lockatong formation lacombe 2000 the lockatong formation is categorized as a mudstone with discernible layers that are the result of varying depositional conditions lacombe 2000 describes four types of mudstone layers in the lockatong mudstone underlying the nawc including light gray massive gry mas and red massive red mas mudstones that are the result of shallow water deposition black fissile blk fis mudstone associated with deep water depositional conditions and gray laminated gry lam mudstone which is attributed to transitional conditions between shallow and deep water deposition the mudstone layers have been shown to be continuous over the nawc through correlations conducted between boreholes lacombe 2000 regional compression and faulting in the newark basin resulted in the local orientation of the mudstone layers striking n65oe with a dip angle of approximately 25onw in the vicinity of the fault separating the stockton and lockatong formations the dip angle of the mudstone layers approaches 75onw off loading due to erosion has resulted in hydraulically conductive bedding plane fractures primarily in the blk fis mudstone layers bedding plane fractures are usually not observed in the gry mas and red mas mudstones however regional compression has created strata bound jointing perpendicular to bedding in general joints perpendicular to bedding are less permeable than bedding plane fractures lacombe and burton 2010 tiedeman et al 2010 additionally weathering has created soil and saprolite near land surface and weathered bedrock with an increased fracture density is observed in mudstone layers to depths of approximately 15 m below land surface hydraulic testing multi level monitoring of hydraulic heads in boreholes and models of groundwater flow in the mudstone underlying the nawc show that the blk fis mudstone layers are responsible for the majority of groundwater flow below the zone of weathered rock tiedeman et al 2010 tiedeman et al 2018 results from chloroethene analyses of rock core conducted by goode et al 2014 showed that tce and its degradation products are confined to small distances in the rock matrix adjacent to bedding plane fractures in the blk fis rock indicating that these permeable features are primarily responsible for the spatial distribution of tce contamination in the aquifer below the weathered rock the blk fis mudstone is also characterized by large values of f oc which limit the diffusive migration of chlorinated constituents into the rock matrix because of adsorption to solid surfaces shapiro and brenneis 2018b within the weathered mudstone goode et al 2014 show a more diffuse distribution of chloroethenes in the rock matrix which is attributed to the increased fracturing of the mudstone layers in the weathered rock 3 core sampling and analyses continuous rock core was collected from seven closely spaced boreholes at the nawc denoted as 83br 89br fig 1 between 15 and 36 5 m below land surface description of the coring and borehole completion procedures are discussed in robinson et al 2015 shapiro and hayes 2017 and shapiro et al 2017 discuss analyses of the rock cores to identify the different types of mudstone with depth in each corehole only the gry mas gry lam and blk fis mudstones were observed in the core from 83br 89br the red mas mudstone occurs at greater depths at this location underlying the nawc fig 2 shows the classification of the mudstone with depth in each corehole optical telviewer otv logs displaying an opened and oriented digital image of the corehole walls are also shown in fig 2 fractures along the length of coreholes were picked using otv and acoustic televiewer atv logs using methods discussed in hearst et al 2000 in combination with acoustic caliper logs and observations of the core the geophysical logs collected in 83br 89br are available from the u s geological survey usgs web application usgs geolog locator https webapps usgs gov geologlocator fig 2 also shows a profile of the hydraulic conductivity k in each corehole interpreted from hydraulic tomography testing described in barrash et al 2018 and tiedeman and barrash 2019 the k profile shown in fig 2 is truncated at 10 5 m per second m s to accentuate the location of the most permeable fractures intersecting the coreholes the interpreted high k sections in the coreholes are distributed over finite lengths which is a result of the packer locations that isolated sections of the corehole during testing and the 0 5 m vertical resolution in the interpreted k profile tiedeman and barrash 2019 additional details of the hydraulic tomography and inversion algorithm to estimate the k distribution in the rock volume is given in tiedeman and barrash 2019 the depth of the core information for each corehole in fig 2 is translated up or down to account for the dip of bedding identified using the natural gamma radiation logs and optical televiewer logs for each corehole shapiro et al 2017 adjusting the core information for the dip of bedding shows the continuity of the mudstone layers fig 2 for example fig 2 shows the continuity of the blk fis mudstone layers at approximately 25 30 and 34 m at depths 20 m the blk fis mudstone is not continuously observed from one corehole to the next this may be an artifact of the alteration of the rock closer to land surface from increased groundwater flow or variations in the depositional features used to classify the types of mudstone indicators used to differentiate between the gry mas gry lam and blk fis rocks do not always provide a clear distinction and relatively thin mudstone layers may not be clearly identified upon the recovery of rock cores at land surface samples of the core approximately 2 cm in length were separated and processed using methods described in goode et al 2014 in preparation for analyses of chloroethene constituents in the rock matrix in total 299 core samples were analyzed from the seven coreholes table 1 for the concentration of tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc the results of the analyses for tce dce and vc are tabulated in shapiro et al 2019 along with a description of the analytical equipment used in the analyses reporting limits and the method of reporting the concentrations of chloroethene compounds from multiple analyses conducted on the same core sample results for analyses of tce and dce in samples of the rock core are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively as a function of the depth adjusted for the dip of bedding concentrations of tce and dce are reported in micrograms per gram of rock μg g the method of measuring chloroethenes in core samples does not distinguish between aqueous adsorbed and napl phases thus results shown in figs 3 and 4 account for the total i e aqueous adsorbed and napl tce and dce content in each core sample it should be noted that a napl phase may not be present additionally the results shown in figs 3 and 4 are identified by the mudstone classification gry mas gry lam or blk fis assigned to the core sample samples of the rock core selected for analyses covered the entire length of the core recovered in 87br in the other coreholes the depth where samples were selected for analyses was truncated before the bottom of the corehole the depth of the top and bottom samples in each corehole and the number of samples analyzed in each corehole are given in table 1 the analysis frequency over the length of the corehole where samples were analyzed varies from 0 32 to 0 43 m per sample table 1 however the selection of cores for analyses were not uniformly distributed over the length of the corehole samples of cores were chosen for their proximity to observed fractures and proximity to the blk fis mudstone layers because of their large f oc shapiro and brenneis 2018b samples of the rock core were also selected to identify tce dce and vc as a function of distance on either side of fractures additionally some samples of rock core were selected for analyses in the upper part of each corehole to identify if there was an effect of weathering in the rock nearer to land surface the concentrations of tce and dce in the rock matrix in 83br 89br vary over several orders of magnitude shapiro et al 2019 the results in figs 3 and 4 are shown on an arithmetic scale to highlight the locations of the highest concentrations of tce and dce the concentration of tce in core samples is in general an order of magnitude greater than the concentration of dce operations at the nawc did not use and dispose of dce thus the presence of dce and vc are interpreted as degradation products of tce lacombe 2000 most of the results for vc measured in core samples were at the minimum reporting limit shapiro et al 2019 and are not shown here the results of tce and dce profiles from the coreholes show punctuated locations of high concentration in the rock core that are attributed to the location of fractures as observed on borehole wall image logs see fig 2 at depths between 15 and 20 m several of the coreholes show samples of elevated tce and dce concentration indicative of large diffusion distances into the rock matrix from adjacent fractures we attribute this to weathering in the rock from enhanced groundwater flow through permeable features at the top of the coreholes in particular the blk fis mudstone below 20 m elevated tce and dce concentrations in the rock matrix are isolated and dictated by fracture locations additional rock samples were selected from the cores collected from 83br 89br to evaluate the spatial distribution of n and f oc within the seven coreholes 94 rock samples were selected and analyzed for both n and f oc and an additional 284 samples were analyzed only for f oc results of these analyses are given in shapiro and evans 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018a with additional discussion of the results given in shapiro et al 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018b the variability of n and f oc as a function of the depth adjusted for the dip of bedding is shown in fig 5 where the results from the seven coreholes are combined on a single graph for n and f oc respectively the arithmetic averages of n and f oc for each rock type are also shown on this figure both n and f oc vary over approximately two orders of magnitude with the largest values of n and f oc associated with the blk fis mudstone even though n and f oc tend to correlate with the mudstone unit there is still variability over an order of magnitude within continuous mudstone layers by plotting n and f oc as a function of the depth adjusted for the dip of bedding in fig 5 the variability at a given depth is attributed to the variability within continuous mudstone layers additionally results of core analyses show that n and f oc do not vary smoothly over small distances perpendicular to bedding analyses of chloroethene compounds in the rock matrix from core samples were previously conducted at other locations at the nawc goode et al 2014 however these boreholes were not clustered to investigate spatial variability over small lateral distances within the rock matrix for comparison with the results of 83br 89br we use information presented in goode et al 2014 for coreholes 70br and 68br fig 1 corehole 70br is near one of the locations that experienced surface releases of tce during the coring of 70br the napl form of tce was observed in the corehole goode et al 2014 corehole 68br is located outside a presumed tce source zone the number of core samples analyzed and sampling frequency over the length of 68br and 70br are also listed in table 1 for comparison with the frequency of analyses conducted in 83br 89br additional information describing the distribution of tce in the mudstone underlying the nawc is available in lacombe 2000 goode et al 2014 révész et al 2014 shapiro et al 2018 and tiedeman et al 2018 4 spatial distribution of chloroethene compounds in the rock matrix the spatial distributions of tce and dce in the rock over the length of coreholes 83br 89br shown in figs 3 and 4 identify specific depths of elevated chloroethene concentrations from these results however it is difficult to draw comparisons between coreholes to distinguish variations in chloroethene contamination over the short lateral distance between coreholes to facilitate a comparison of the tce and dce over lateral distances in the rock volume we consider a cumulative definition of the chloroethene concentration over the length of each corehole similar to that used by hurley 2003 in this analysis the total chloroethene concentration in the rock core s i defined in units of μg g figs 3 and 4 is converted to a volumetric concentration using ρ b 1 c i ρ b s i where the subscript i denotes either tce or dce and c i is the total concentration of the chloroethene compound defined per unit volume of the rock m l 3 where m denotes units of mass and l is a unit of length the cumulative total chloroethene concentration in the rock matrix defined as a function of the depth γ i z is specified by integrating c i over the length of the corehole 2 γ i z z 0 z c i ξ dξ where γ i z is defined as the chloroethene mass per unit area m l 2 at a given depth z and z 0 is the depth of the first core sample analyzed in the corehole because measurements of s i in core samples do not distinguish between the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases γ i z represents the total content of the chloroethene compound as a function of depth this interpretation assumes that there is sufficient density of sampling at discrete points in the rock matrix to define γ i z effectively in this investigation we have selected core samples for analyses adjacent to fractures and other features along each corehole that are likely to be responsible for the retention of chloroethene mass in the rock matrix in evaluating 2 from the discrete information shown in figs 3 and 4 we assume a linear interpolation between data points and use an average value for ρ b 2 58 g cm 3 defined from mercury porosimetry analyses of rock cores shapiro et al 2017 fig 6 shows γ tce z in coreholes 68br and 70br from results presented in goode et al 2014 and fig 7 shows γ tce z and γ dce z with depth in coreholes 83br 89br γ i z i tce dce increases with depth as additional analyses are added in the calculation however γ i z does not smoothly vary as a function of z the sharp increases in γ i z are associated with a single sample or closely spaced samples of high tce or dce concentration in the rock core these locations are usually associated with fractures the large increase in γ tce z for 70br at approximately 27 m fig 6 is associated with bedding plane fracture in the blk fis mudstone this was also the location where the napl form of tce was detected during coring goode et al 2014 abrupt increases in γ tce z are also depicted in results for 68br fig 6 however the incremental increase in the tce mass at locations along the core are not as large as that shown for 70br even at depths close to land surface the incremental increases in the tce mass depicted in 70br are greater than at similar depths in 68br which is indicative of 70br being located within an area of tce releases at land surface in contrast the distribution of tce in the rock core at 68br may be indicative of areas outside of tce releases where tce in the aqueous phase was transported downgradient from a source zone along permeable fractures incremental increases in γ i z i tce dce as a function of depth are also observed in cores analyzed from 83br 89br fig 7 analyses in corehole 87br extend to a greater depth than in the other coreholes however with the exception of 84br and 89br comparisons of γ i z between boreholes can be readily made and attributed to bedding units between depths of 15 and 32 m the abrupt increases in γ i z at depths in boreholes 83br 89br fig 7 are also associated with the fracture locations in these coreholes fig 2 cross hole hydraulic testing for hydraulic tomography in coreholes 83br 89br discussed in barrash et al 2018 and tiedeman and barrash 2019 showed that hydraulic properties of fractures along the length of the coreholes vary over several orders of magnitude fig 2 with the fractures associated with the blk fis layer at approximately 20 m depth being the most permeable feature in several coreholes fractures intersecting the borehole below 20 m have substantially lower hydraulic conductivity large concentrations of tce in the rock matrix adjacent to low permeability fractures are plausible because the napl form of tce may have entered low permeability fractures due to capillary forces derived from continuous pool heights of the napl kueper and mcwhorter 1991 and kueper et al 2003 discuss the conditions where napl can enter fractures of a given aperture noting that napl pool heights as small as 1 m can lead to napl entry into apertures as small as 1 μm 10 6 m tiedeman and barrash 2019 also noted that the high hydraulic conductivity is not necessarily continuous along presumed bedding layers offsets or truncations in the bedding layers in the shallow bedrock may lead to locally convoluted groundwater flow paths that do not conform to the general conceptual model of groundwater flow dominated by subhorizontal bedding plane fractures tiedeman and barrash 2019 noted that at 20 m depth although hydraulic perturbations eventually propagate between all coreholes there are volumes of rock with lower hydraulic conductivity that segregate fluid pressure responses between coreholes on the northwestern side of the rock volume 84br 88br and 89br from the coreholes on the southeastern side 83br 85br 86br and 87br in fig 7 γ tce z for coreholes 88br and 89br show similar characteristics to γ tce z for 70br fig 6 which is assumed to be representative of a location near a source release of tce these coreholes show elevated concentrations of tce and dce in the shallow rock in comparison to the other coreholes fig 3 and additionally they show larger incremental increases in γ i z i tce dce at fracture locations in the shallow rock in comparison to the other coreholes fig 7 coreholes 83br 84br 85br and 86br show characteristics of γ tce z similar to 68br fig 6 which is assumed to represent a location outside an area of surface releases of tce γ tce z for corehole 87br in fig 7 does not show elevated tce in the shallow rock characteristic of a tce source zone however elevated tce content in the rock at greater depths appears to be indicative of tce migrating from a source zone the incremental increases γ tce z at depths 25 m in 87br is greater than that associated with 70br fig 6 which is presumed to be characteristic of an area in the immediate vicinity of a surface release of tce results from hydraulic testing discussed in barrash et al 2018 and tiedeman and barrash 2019 indicate that fractures at this depth in 87br are not highly transmissive fig 2 therefore the napl form of tce may have entered low permeability fractures at depth in the rock associated with continuous pool heights of the napl form of tce it is conceivable that similar increases in γ tce z at depths 32 m could also be present in the other coreholes in the other coreholes analyses were not conducted on samples at depths greater than approximately 32 m table 1 γ dce z as a function of depth in coreholes 83br 89br is approximately an order of magnitude less than γ tce z fig 7 for the most part characteristics of γ dce z with depth are similar to γ tce z coreholes 88br and 89br show largest dce in the shallow rock which may be indicative of a location of tce releases and the degradation of tce to dce the other coreholes show little dce content with depth until approximately 20 m in contrast to γ tce z in corehole 87br γ dce z in 87br does not show the largest cumulative dce accumulation in comparison to the other coreholes which goode et al 2014 attributed to decreasing microbial degradation with depth in the bedrock aquifer 5 partitioning between napl aqueous and adsorbed phases measurements of tce and dce in rock cores using methods described in sterling et al 2005 and goode et al 2014 do not directly measure aqueous adsorbed and or napl phases in the rock matrix aqueous phase tce and dce can enter the rock matrix from adjacent fractures through diffusion and adsorb onto solid surfaces additionally under appropriate pool heights of dnapl in adjacent fractures the napl form of tce can also enter pores in the rock matrix that are of sufficient size where capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure kueper and mcwhorter 1991 from mercury porosimetry analyses conducted on rock cores from 83br 89br shapiro et al 2017 demonstrated that a percentage of the pore throat diameters in the mudstone rock types at the nawc could accept the napl form of tce induced by continuous pool heights of approximately 3 m which are reasonable for conditions of napl releases at land surface that extend through the soil saprolite and then into fractures in the competent rock once in the rock matrix adsorption on solid surfaces will distribute the chloroethene constituent between the aqueous and adsorbed phases depending on the capacity for adsorption and rates of matrix diffusion the napl form of tce may persist in the rock matrix 5 1 linear equilibrium adsorption under the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption feenstra et al 1991 allen king et al 1996 the total chloroethene concentration s i can be defined by the partitioning between the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases 3 s i nc i ρ b k di c i s napl i where c i is the aqueous concentration m l 3 defined per volume of the fluid the subscript i denotes either tce or dce s napl i is the concentration of the napl phase component per mass of the rock and k di k oc i f oc is the partitioning coefficient for the chloroethene constituent l 3 m defined for the fluid volume per mass of the rock with k oc i l 3 m being the partitioning coefficient for the chloroethene constituent and organic carbon in the above equation if c i c sol i where c sol i m l 3 is the maximum solubility concentration for the chloroethene constituent the napl phase is assumed to be absent however in the presence of a napl phase c i c sol i for conditions at the nawc dce was not used and disposed of in site operations thus if a napl phase exists it is only likely to present for tce 5 2 partitioning calculations using average rock properties the core samples analyzed for chloroethene concentrations using methanol extractions were not analyzed for f oc additionally because the method of conducting methanol extractions are destructive of the rock core n and ρ b for these samples are also unavailable therefore calculations of phase partitioning from measurement of s i i tce dce require estimates of n ρ b and f oc that must be inferred by other means one approach for phase partitioning calculations is to use average values of the rock properties defined from analyses conducted on selected core samples hurley 2003 kueper et al 2003 sterling et al 2005 arithmetic average values associated with data that range over several orders of magnitude may not accurately define the central tendencies of the distribution which may yield erroneous interpretations of expected values in the phase partitioning calculations for example outliers in a distribution substantially affect the arithmetic average whereas the median of a distribution is sometime regarded as a better reflection of central tendencies for data showing large variability the arithmetic average and the median for n ρ b and f oc for the different rock types identified in the mudstone blk fis gry lam gry mas are given in table 2 arithmetic average and median values are also given in table 2 without differentiating between rock types tce partitioning calculations between the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases from measurements of s tce require identification of k oc tce grathwohl 1990 and allen king et al 2002 noted the significance of different types of organic matter on the magnitude of adsorption and indicate that values of k oc may depend on the type of organic materials in the aquifer value of k oc appropriate for the different mudstone types have not be identified from laboratory experiments and instead for tce partitioning calculations presented her we use a literature value of k oc tce equal to 126 ml per gram ml g pankow and johnson 1996 for the tce partitioning calculations in this section we use median estimates of the distributions of n ρ b and f oc table 2 the results of the phase partitioning calculations are shown in fig 8 as the cumulative aqueous phase γ tce aq z cumulative adsorbed phase γ tce ad z and cumulative napl γ tce napl z with depth in each of the coreholes where the cumulative phase with depth is calculated using a relation similar to that shown in 2 fig 8a shows results of calculations of phase partitioning where median estimates of the distributions of n ρ b and f oc are made without differentiating between rock types and fig 8b shows results where the median estimates are defined for each rock type because of the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption the cumulative aqueous and adsorbed tce have similar characteristic shapes with depth in the coreholes fig 8 which also resembles the total tce concentration with depth in the coreholes shown in fig 7a the calculations of phase partitioning indicate only a small percentage of the tce mass is associated with the aqueous phase because of the large f oc associated with the mudstone the aqueous tce is more than an order of magnitude less than the adsorbed tce in the rock cores additionally tce associated with the napl phase occurs only at a small number of locations in the coreholes the majority of the tce napl in the rock cores is identified at two depths in 87br other locations at the top of coreholes 85br 88br and 89br also show the possible presence of napl in the phase partitioning calculations in 87br the napl phase accounts for nearly an equal amount of tce as the adsorbed phase the results of phase partitioning calculations shown in fig 8 for the aqueous and adsorbed tce show minor differences between using median estimates of n ρ b and f oc defined with and without differentiating between the rock types the median estimate of f oc defined from all rock samples table 2 is slightly larger than the median estimates of f oc defined for the gry lam and gry mas rock types which results in larger amount of adsorbed tce fig 8a the larger amount of the adsorbed tce results in less aqueous tce in the rock matrix and reduces the likelihood of the napl form of tce in fig 8b the median estimates of n ρ b and f oc are defined for each rock type smaller values of f oc for the gry lam and gry mas rocks under this scenario yields less adsorbed tce more aqueous tce in the rock matrix and a greater likelihood of tce in the napl phase the different methods of assigning n ρ b and f oc show substantial differences in estimating the napl phase and locations where napl may occur if the arithmetic averages of the rock properties were used instead of the median estimates partitioning calculations would yield slightly larger amounts of tce in the adsorbed phase lower aqueous concentrations and less tce in the napl phase than that shown in fig 8 the arithmetic average for f oc is larger than the median estimate for all rock samples as well as estimates that differentiate samples by rock type table 2 similar partitioning calculations can also be conducted for analyses of dce in rock cores but are not shown here the concentrations of dce in the rock cores fig 4 are approximately an order of magnitude less than the tce concentrations consequently partitioning calculations for dce yield only the aqueous and adsorbed phases in the rock matrix with the majority of the dce in the adsorbed phase because of the large f oc associated with the mudstone 5 3 partitioning calculations from realizations of spatially variable rock properties because variability in both n and f oc ranges over orders of magnitude even within different mudstone rock types using median and average rock properties to conduct phase partitioning calculations may not yield representative results for the phase distribution particularly in evaluating the presence of the napl form of tce for example core samples with f oc at the lower end of the measured distribution would result in less adsorbed tce and larger aqueous tce concentrations in the rock matrix if the estimated aqueous tce concentration equals or exceeds the solubility concentration a napl phase could be present within the rock matrix in this section uncertainties in phase partitioning calculations are investigated by considering realizations of spatially variable rock properties uncertainties also exist in the evaluation of chloroethene concentrations conducted on rock core through methanol extractions in this investigation however we focus only on the variability that is observed in n and f oc in each realization values of n and f oc are assigned to core samples analyzed for tce content values of n and f oc are assumed to be independent and vary spatially along the length of the borehole shapiro and brenneis 2018b discussed the spatial correlation in f oc and showed correlation distances of less than a meter thus with the separation distances between core locations where tce was measured values of f oc are assumed to be uncorrelated methods of selecting uniform deviates between 0 and 1 as discussed in press et al 1992 were used to select rock matrix properties from the experimental distributions for n and f oc shown in shapiro et al 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018b respectively values of ρ b used in the phase partitioning calculations are defined from the observed correlation between n and ρb shapiro et al 2017 the spatially varying values of n and f oc are used in the phase partitioning calculation defined by 3 at each of the core locations where tce was analyzed at each core location 1000 realizations were conducted where each realization provided an estimate of the aqueous adsorbed and napl phase concentration the average aqueous and adsorbed tce concentrations calculated from the realizations at core locations are used to evaluate the cumulative aqueous and adsorbed tce as a function of depth for each corehole shown in fig 9 the cumulative aqueous and adsorbed tce with depth shown in fig 9 are denoted by γ tce aq z c tce and γ tce ad z c tce respectively where c tce denotes the average aqueous tce concentration in rock samples from multiple realizations the results in fig 9 for the coreholes have similar characteristic shapes and relative positions in comparison to the results of phase partitioning calculations using median values of rock properties fig 8 the large difference between the results shown in figs 8 and 9 is the reduction in the adsorbed tce when considering realizations of spatially variable rock properties the results in fig 9 show that the adsorbed tce in the rock matrix is approximately half of the adsorbed tce that is calculated using median rock properties which is a result of considering the full range of the distribution of f oc comparing the results in figs 8 and 9 indicate that neither the arithmetic average nor the median estimates of the rock properties represent central tendencies of the distribution that characterize the linear equilibrium adsorption for the results of the phase partitioning calculations using spatially variable rock properties fig 9 the aqueous phase tce is only nominally increased in comparison to the cumulative aqueous tce with depth from partitioning calculations using median rock properties fig 8 as shown in fig 9 the aqueous tce in the rock matrix is still approximately an order of magnitude less than the adsorbed tce however by considering the effect of the entire range of the distribution for f oc more instances of the occurrence of napl arise in the phase partitioning calculations from realizations of spatially variable rock properties we do not present a cumulative calculation of the napl phase tce concentration with depth for the phase partitioning calculations from realizations of spatially variable rock properties because the average of the napl concentration at locations along the coreholes would be greatly impacted by the number of realizations where napl does not occur instead to highlight the occurrence of napl in the rock matrix when accounting for variability in rock properties we present the probability of napl occurrence which is proportional to the number of occurrences of napl at a given location from the multiple realizations the probability of napl occurrence p napl is shown in fig 10 where p napl is shown at each location where a core sample was analyzed for chloroethene constituents the majority of sample locations show p napl 0 however locations where p napl 0 show a complex picture of potential locations where napl may be present in the rock matrix in comparison to results from phase partitioning calculations using median rock properties fig 8 which suppress the significance of napl occurrence in the rock matrix 6 interpretations of tce source zones the results showing γ tce z and p napl among the closely spaced coreholes 83br 89br in figs 7 and 10 respectively indicate a complex pattern of tce contamination and phase distributions in the mudstone over the 9 m diameter footprint encompassed by the coreholes the distribution of tce in the rock matrix was analyzed from core samples collected multiple decades after the initial releases of tce consequently the distribution of tce in the rock matrix may not necessarily be representative of the configuration of the tce distribution that arose from initial tce releases as there have been decades for napl dissolution as well as advection of aqueous phase tce and adsorption and matrix diffusion additionally decades of groundwater flow may accelerate tce diffusing out of the rock matrix adjacent to highly permeable fractures in comparison to less permeable fractures vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 however the large f oc associated with the mudstone rocks has resulted in substantial tce mass in the adsorbed phase which may provide a residual signature of the initial distribution of napl from tce releases shapiro and brenneis 2018b conducted simulations that show tce being retained in the rock matrix of the mudstone at the nawc for possibly hundreds of years following remediation in fractures the distribution of tce in the rock matrix is not necessarily controlled by proximity to the most permeable fractures in the rock volume the mudstone underlying the nawc is generally characterized by subhorizontal layers and bedding plane fractures parallel to the layering that are principally responsible for groundwater flow where the most permeable bedding plane fractures are associated with the blk fis rock coreholes on the western side of the well field show different configuration for γ tce z and p napl in comparison to coreholes on the eastern side of the well field for example 88br shows p napl 0 05 at a number of locations over the entire length of the corehole fig 10 similar characteristics are also shown at the top of the core in 89br however because core samples were not analyzed below 25 m in 89br p napl below this depth cannot be compared with the other coreholes γ tce z at the top of 88br and 89br also show large tce content in comparison to coreholes 83br 87br on the eastern side of the well field at depths 20 m in 83br 87br clusters of samples do not show elevated values of p napl these observations could imply that locations near 88br and 89br are in proximity to surface releases of tce that migrated downward through soil and weathered rock because the other coreholes 83br 87br do not show elevated tce content at the top of the corehole profiles it is conceivable that the surface releases did not extend over the entire footprint of the well field a highly permeable fractured interval is observed at approximately 20 m depth in most of the coreholes fig 2 however there is a high degree of heterogeneity in permeability within the mudstone layers at this depth with high permeability at 83br 85br 86br 87br and 89br but low permeability at 84br and 88br tiedeman and barrash 2019 in fig 7 coreholes 88br and 89br show evidence of a large tce content at this depth however elevated tce is not uniformly observed in the other coreholes at this depth 83br 84br and 85br show larger amounts of tce in the rock matrix in proximity to this depth in comparison to 86br and 87br fig 7 the nonuniformity of the tce distribution in the rock matrix at this elevation is also reflected in the calculations of p napl fig 10 however calculations of p napl also depend on the range of variability in the rock properties attributed to each rock type in addition to the total tce measured in core samples the variability in the tce in the adjacent rock matrix at approximately 20 m depth is likely affected by the heterogeneous permeability within this fractured interval which results in variability in the flow regime that is distributing tce from a possible source area in proximity to 88br and 89br investigations have shown that aperture variability in fractures can lead to convoluted paths of dnapl migration mclaren et al 2012 thus it is conceivable that heterogeneity within this permeable feature may lead to the variability of tce in adjacent rock matrix at this depth releases of tce at land surface from operations at the nawc until approximately the mid 1990s would have been affected by the natural flow regime starting in approximately 1995 pumping wells were installed to constrain the migration of the tce in the groundwater lacombe 2011 an examination of both ambient flow conditions and hydraulic conditions induced by pumping would be needed to gain additional insight into the distribution of tce in the rock matrix at these corehole locations coreholes 84br 85br and 86br show isolated samples of p napl 0 25 between 25 and 30 m it is conceivable that napl may be present at these locations due to a convoluted migration from a source zone due to fracture aperture variability the fact the tce content in the rock matrix is not uniformly distributed at depths 25 m would also need to be viewed in the context of the spatial variability of the fractures and the flow regime under ambient and pumped conditions the presences of p napl 0 25 at these locations also illustrates the complexity of attempting to identify the configuration of a tce source zone from conditions multiple decades after tce emplacement at depths 20 m 87br and 88br show similar characteristics with a number of locations of elevated values of p napl and large incremental increases in γ tce z both 87br and 88br have core samples where p napl 0 50 at a similar depth this indicates a possible network of subhorizontal and subvertical fractures which results in downward migration of tce from the source zone in the vicinity of 88br and 89br with lateral migration of the tce source at a depth of approximately 30 m this is consistent with results of tiedeman and barrash 2019 who identified a region of vertical permeability in the fracture network at depths 20 m in the vicinity of 83br 87br and 88br napl migration along the dip of bedding on the western side of the well field may have also contributed to the tce distribution with 88br and 89br being downdip from 87br the lateral migration of tce at 30 m depth however is not equally distributed to other locations interrogated by the coreholes but may be the result of the complex distribution of a napl phase that can be distributed through variable aperture fractures in 83br 85br and 86br there are small tce contributions to γ tce z between depths of 25 and 30 m in comparison to 87br and 88br core samples from 84br and 89br were not analyzed at these depths and thus we do not have a complete picture of the distribution of tce in the rock matrix at this depth 7 conclusions at sites of groundwater contamination characterizing the spatial distribution of contaminants in the aquifer is a critical element in formulating remedial strategies in fractured rock aquifers differentiating between contamination in the groundwater of the fracture porosity and the rock matrix is important in understanding factors affecting the longevity of contamination and the effectiveness of various remediation technologies at fractured rock sites that have been subject to groundwater contamination for multiple decades the majority of the contaminant mass is likely to reside in the low permeability rock matrix because of limitations in collecting groundwater samples from low permeability geologic materials collecting and analyzing rock core for contaminants in the rock matrix has become an important component of site characterization in fractured rock in this investigation of tce contamination in the mudstone aquifer underlying a former jet engine testing facility analyses of rock core in seven closely spaced coreholes shows substantial variability of tce concentration with depth in the rock matrix along the length of the coreholes and along continuous mudstone layers between adjacent coreholes elevated concentrations of tce in the rock matrix occur adjacent to fractures however the permeability of fractures does not necessarily dictate the tce distribution in the rock matrix the complex spatial distribution of tce within the rock matrix is likely a combination of the permeability and connectivity of fractures and capillary forces affecting the emplacement of the napl form of tce following releases at land surface as well as the subsequent napl dissolution advection of aqueous phase contaminants and the adsorption and matrix diffusion that has occurred over several decades plotting the cumulative tce concentration as a function of depth in coreholes provides a means of comparing characteristics of the tce distribution in the rock matrix between adjacent coreholes the cumulative tce concentration with depth in the coreholes show characteristics associated with 1 tce releases at lands surface 2 locations of downward movement of tce along fractures of different orientation and 3 tce distributed by fractures that may have been derived from a distant source area coreholes with these unique characteristics are observed over a 9 m diameter circular foot print indicating that there can be substantial differences in the tce distribution within the rock matrix over relatively small lateral distances at fractured rock sites the coreholes on the western side of the well field 83br 89br show proximity to tce releases the elevated tce concentration at the top of coreholes 88br and 89br may be indicative of localized tce releases at land surface additionally elevated tce concentration in the rock matrix in these coreholes at greater depths indicate possible downward movement of tce through a combination of subhorizontal and subvertical fractures results of hydraulic testing conducted by barrash et al 2018 indicate that fractures at greater depths in these coreholes are generally less permeable in comparison to bedding plane fractures in the blk fis rock at approximately 20 m depth the tce in the rock matrix adjacent to the lower permeability fractures is likely the result of capillary forces leading to the emplacement of tce into the small aperture fractures on the eastern side of the well field the distribution of tce in the rock core does not show tce concentrations indicative of surface leases the method of evaluating the tce concentration in rock cores using methanol extraction does not distinguish between tce in the aqueous adsorbed or napl phases identifying the tce in the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases is important for evaluating the longevity of tce contamination in the rock matrix partitioning calculations require information on the rock properties n ρ b and f oc in this investigation the large f oc in the matrix of the mudstone results in the majority of tce in the rock matrix being adsorbed to solid phase aquifer materials which can substantially extend the residence time of tce in the rock matrix simulations of tce diffusion out of the mudstone conducted by shapiro and brenneis 2018b indicate that tce may reside in the mudstone for hundreds of years following remediation applied in the adjacent fractures additionally the large tce concentration identified in a number of core samples indicates that a napl component of tce may also be present at locations along the coreholes in the rock matrix shapiro et al 2017 showed that a percentage of the large pore throat diameters in the rock matrix could be accessible to napl phase tce phase partitioning calculations using average rock properties for n and f oc do not account for the variability over more than an order of magnitude recognized in these rock properties using arithmetic average or median values of rock properties tend to suppress the likelihood of a tce napl phase occurrence in the rock matrix in this investigation a method of calculating the probability of the napl phase occurrence p napl is calculated at locations where cores samples were analyzed for tce concentration using experimental probability distributions for n and f oc the distribution of p napl at locations where core samples were analyzed indicates a pattern where tce in the napl phase may have infiltrated through fractures on the western side of the well field a number of core samples distributed over the length of the vertical concentration profiles show nonzero values of p napl indicating the likelihood of napl migrating downward at these location through a combination of subhorizontal and subvertical fractures in contrast on the eastern side of the well field nonzero values of p napl occur only at a few isolated locations along the coreholes at these isolated locations the napl form of tce may have been translated laterally along fractures

1589,methanol extractions for chloroethene analyses are conducted on rock samples from seven closely spaced coreholes in a mudstone aquifer that was subject to releases of the nonaqueous phase liquid napl form of trichloroethene tce between the 1950 s and 1990 s although tce concentration in the rock matrix over the length of coreholes is dictated by proximity to subhorizontal bedding plane fractures elevated tce concentrations in the rock matrix are not continuous along the most permeable bedding plane fractures a complex configuration of subvertical and subhorizontal fractures appears to be responsible for the tce distribution from prior tce releases at land surface phase partitioning calculations of tce in the rock matrix show that most tce is adsorbed to solid surfaces because of the large fraction of organic carbon f oc in the mudstone large tce content in some cores indicate the likely presence of the napl form of tce in the rock matrix using average values of porosity n and f oc in phase partitioning calculations identifies a number of locations of possible napl occurrence in the rock matrix samples of mudstone analyzed for n and f oc show variability in these properties over several orders of magnitude accounting for this variability in phase partitioning calculations identifies a probability of napl occurrence p napl the spatial variability of p napl along coreholes identifies a configuration that may be attributed to a tce source zone that has evolved after emplacement due to napl dissolution adsorption and matrix diffusion 1 introduction chlorinated solvents have been widely used at commercial industrial and federal facilities for more than fifty years and releases of these compounds into the environment have resulted in contamination of the underlying groundwater pankow et al 1996 mccarty 2010 nrc 2013 discussions of the persistence of chlorinated solvents in the subsurface and processes controlling their migration as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls and as vapor aqueous and adsorbed phase contaminants are available from numerous sources including schwille 1988 mercer and cohen 1990 feenstra et al 1996 and cwiertny and scherer 2010 the characterization and remediation of chlorinated solvents in fractured rock aquifers has been a particularly vexing problem nrc 2013 nas 2015 the spatial extent and the rate of downgradient migration of aqueous phase chlorinated constituents is controlled largely by the connectivity of permeable fractures and matrix diffusion and in some cases degradation processes evaluating the longevity of groundwater contamination and the efficacy of groundwater remediation strategies in fractured rock also requires information on the diffusive exchange of aqueous phase contaminants between fractures and the intrinsic porosity of the rock referred to as the rock matrix mutch et al 1993 parker et al 1994 it is widely recognized that aqueous phase contaminants can diffuse from fractures into the rock matrix sterling et al 2005 goode et al 2014 and at a later time diffuse back into permeable fractures adversely affecting the downgradient water quality over time periods that may extend from decades to centuries parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 because fractures constitute only a small volume of the aquifer void space sites that have been subject to contamination with chlorinated constituents for multiple decades will have source zones where much or all of the napl has dissolved with most of the contaminant mass residing in the rock matrix in dissolved and adsorbed phases parker et al 1994 parker et al 1997 the retention of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix also depends on physical and chemical properties of the rock chlorinated constituents adsorb to organic carbon on solid surfaces in sedimentary formations that have undergone diagenesis a majority of the mass of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix is likely to be adsorbed to solid surfaces rather than residing in the aqueous phase occupying the pores of the rock matrix allen king et al 2002 choung et al 2014 under the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption the capacity of the rock matrix to store chlorinated constituents increases and the retardation factor scales the magnitude of diffusion out of the rock matrix resulting in longer residence times for chlorinated constituents in comparison to constituents that do not adsorb to solid surfaces parker et al 1994 boving and grathwohl 2001 identifying the distribution of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix is not easily realized because much of the contaminant mass may be in the adsorbed phase in addition to the difficulty of extracting water from the low permeability geologic materials under in situ conditions methods of analyzing rock core using methanol extractions have been developed to estimate the total mass of chlorinated constituents from aqueous adsorbed and napl phases within rock samples goldstein et al 2004 sterling et al 2005 kennel 2008 these analyses are subject to the elevated costs associated with coring and the processing of core samples immediately upon their recovery nevertheless core samples analyzed with sufficient resolution to capture the spatially variable contaminant distribution associated with fracture locations provide a relatively undisturbed evaluation of the contaminant distribution with depth in the aquifer at the time of coring in contrast samples collected from mobile groundwater in fractures intersecting boreholes even after the installation of multilevel monitoring equipment may be impacted by the hydraulic disturbances induced by drilling hydraulic connections between multiple fractures along the length of the borehole and the installation and operation of monitoring equipment shapiro 2002 sterling et al 2005 additionally concentrations of chlorinated constituents in fractures may not be representative of the aqueous concentrations in the pores of the rock matrix goode et al 2014 and are also typically collected at much lower vertical resolution than possible with core analyses thus sampling of aqueous concentrations from permeable fractures will not provide an accurate means of assessing the total contaminant mass retained in the rock matrix because of the elevated expense of installing coreholes and monitoring boreholes in fractured rock an understanding of the hydrogeologic setting is critical in locating a sparse number of coring locations and monitoring boreholes for site characterization the hydrogeologic conceptual model is then used to extrapolate the results of geochemical monitoring to infer the distribution of contaminants in sedimentary rocks that are characterized by areally extensive bedding plane fractures groundwater flow and geochemical conditions are often extrapolated in association with the structure of bedding and the local and regional stress distribution that lead to multiple fracture sets relative to the bedding in many instances bedding plane fractures are the most permeable features controlling groundwater flow and the distribution of contaminants tiedeman et al 2010 however even in formations where extensive fractures are anticipated along lithologic boundaries slight variations in fracture aperture may result in the complex distribution of the dnapls following their release at land surface simulations conducted by slough et al 1999 and mclaren et al 2012 demonstrate complex distributions of dnapls with depth and lateral extent that arise from dnapl releases in a formation characterized by a combination of subhorizontal and vertical fracturing with variable apertures the complex spatial distribution of dnapl may then lead to the complex distribution of chloroethene compounds in fractures and within the rock matrix which may not always be intuitively extrapolated from the general hydrogeologic conceptual model additionally the dnapl in the source zones of fractured rock will evolve over decades due to dissolution into the advecting groundwater and diffusion into the rock matrix parker et al 2018 such that much or all of the dnapl has transformed to aqueous and adsorbed phases that may show a signature in the rock matrix in the vicinity of the source zone this investigation uses measured chloroethene concentrations in the rock matrix of a mudstone aquifer to illustrate the complexity of the contaminant distribution that can arise over relatively short lateral and vertical distances in sedimentary formations attempting to infer the distribution of chlorinated constituents in the rock matrix based on evidence from a single corehole may lead to erroneous interpretations even in groundwater flow regimes that are dominated by bedding plane fractures this investigation uses chloroethene profiles from rock core analyzed from seven closely spaced boreholes in a 9 m diameter footprint at the former naval air warfare center nawc west trenton nj fig 1 the nawc was an aircraft engine testing facility that operated between the mid 1950 s and mid 1990 s where the use of trichloroethene tce resulted in releases at multiple locations that led to the contamination of the groundwater in the underlying mudstone aquifer lacombe 2000 lacombe and burton 2010 the mudstone underlying the nawc is characterized by areally extensive bedding plane fractures associated with fissile units in the mudstone that have been shown to be responsible for the majority of groundwater flow tiedeman et al 2010 tiedeman et al 2018 in addition this article investigates the partitioning of chloroethene compounds in the rock matrix between the napl aqueous and adsorbed phases the analyses of rock cores using methanol extraction methods does not distinguish between the napl aqueous and adsorbed phases differentiating between tce phases in the rock matrix requires information on rock matrix properties in particular the porosity n bulk density ρ b and fraction of organic carbon f oc estimates of n and f oc are usually derived from a sparse number of rock samples where average values are applied in the calculation of the tce partitioning kueper et al 2003 sterling et al 2005 shapiro et al 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018a showed that n and f oc can vary over orders of magnitude over distances of centimeters even within continuous mudstone layers additionally n and f oc are dependent on the depositional conditions attributed to mudstone layers this investigation examines calculations of the partitioning of tce into napl aqueous and adsorbed phases in the rock matrix using average values of rock properties and compares those results to calculations that consider the variability in n and f oc characterizing the partitioning between the napl aqueous and adsorbed phases can potentially identify locations of tce contamination that require targeted remediation additionally characterizing the chloroethene partitioning can affect estimates of contaminant longevity and decisions on applying remediation technologies that attempt to accelerate the release of chlorinated constituents from the rock matrix 2 hydrogeologic setting the nawc is underlain by triassic age rocks of the newark basin olsen et al 1996 fig 1 the upper strata of the stockton formation and the lower strata of the lockatong formations are exposed at land surface due to faulting the contact between the stockton and lockatong formations appears as a near vertical fault zone at the southern extent of the nawc fig 1 however tce has only been detected in the lockatong formation lacombe 2000 the lockatong formation is categorized as a mudstone with discernible layers that are the result of varying depositional conditions lacombe 2000 describes four types of mudstone layers in the lockatong mudstone underlying the nawc including light gray massive gry mas and red massive red mas mudstones that are the result of shallow water deposition black fissile blk fis mudstone associated with deep water depositional conditions and gray laminated gry lam mudstone which is attributed to transitional conditions between shallow and deep water deposition the mudstone layers have been shown to be continuous over the nawc through correlations conducted between boreholes lacombe 2000 regional compression and faulting in the newark basin resulted in the local orientation of the mudstone layers striking n65oe with a dip angle of approximately 25onw in the vicinity of the fault separating the stockton and lockatong formations the dip angle of the mudstone layers approaches 75onw off loading due to erosion has resulted in hydraulically conductive bedding plane fractures primarily in the blk fis mudstone layers bedding plane fractures are usually not observed in the gry mas and red mas mudstones however regional compression has created strata bound jointing perpendicular to bedding in general joints perpendicular to bedding are less permeable than bedding plane fractures lacombe and burton 2010 tiedeman et al 2010 additionally weathering has created soil and saprolite near land surface and weathered bedrock with an increased fracture density is observed in mudstone layers to depths of approximately 15 m below land surface hydraulic testing multi level monitoring of hydraulic heads in boreholes and models of groundwater flow in the mudstone underlying the nawc show that the blk fis mudstone layers are responsible for the majority of groundwater flow below the zone of weathered rock tiedeman et al 2010 tiedeman et al 2018 results from chloroethene analyses of rock core conducted by goode et al 2014 showed that tce and its degradation products are confined to small distances in the rock matrix adjacent to bedding plane fractures in the blk fis rock indicating that these permeable features are primarily responsible for the spatial distribution of tce contamination in the aquifer below the weathered rock the blk fis mudstone is also characterized by large values of f oc which limit the diffusive migration of chlorinated constituents into the rock matrix because of adsorption to solid surfaces shapiro and brenneis 2018b within the weathered mudstone goode et al 2014 show a more diffuse distribution of chloroethenes in the rock matrix which is attributed to the increased fracturing of the mudstone layers in the weathered rock 3 core sampling and analyses continuous rock core was collected from seven closely spaced boreholes at the nawc denoted as 83br 89br fig 1 between 15 and 36 5 m below land surface description of the coring and borehole completion procedures are discussed in robinson et al 2015 shapiro and hayes 2017 and shapiro et al 2017 discuss analyses of the rock cores to identify the different types of mudstone with depth in each corehole only the gry mas gry lam and blk fis mudstones were observed in the core from 83br 89br the red mas mudstone occurs at greater depths at this location underlying the nawc fig 2 shows the classification of the mudstone with depth in each corehole optical telviewer otv logs displaying an opened and oriented digital image of the corehole walls are also shown in fig 2 fractures along the length of coreholes were picked using otv and acoustic televiewer atv logs using methods discussed in hearst et al 2000 in combination with acoustic caliper logs and observations of the core the geophysical logs collected in 83br 89br are available from the u s geological survey usgs web application usgs geolog locator https webapps usgs gov geologlocator fig 2 also shows a profile of the hydraulic conductivity k in each corehole interpreted from hydraulic tomography testing described in barrash et al 2018 and tiedeman and barrash 2019 the k profile shown in fig 2 is truncated at 10 5 m per second m s to accentuate the location of the most permeable fractures intersecting the coreholes the interpreted high k sections in the coreholes are distributed over finite lengths which is a result of the packer locations that isolated sections of the corehole during testing and the 0 5 m vertical resolution in the interpreted k profile tiedeman and barrash 2019 additional details of the hydraulic tomography and inversion algorithm to estimate the k distribution in the rock volume is given in tiedeman and barrash 2019 the depth of the core information for each corehole in fig 2 is translated up or down to account for the dip of bedding identified using the natural gamma radiation logs and optical televiewer logs for each corehole shapiro et al 2017 adjusting the core information for the dip of bedding shows the continuity of the mudstone layers fig 2 for example fig 2 shows the continuity of the blk fis mudstone layers at approximately 25 30 and 34 m at depths 20 m the blk fis mudstone is not continuously observed from one corehole to the next this may be an artifact of the alteration of the rock closer to land surface from increased groundwater flow or variations in the depositional features used to classify the types of mudstone indicators used to differentiate between the gry mas gry lam and blk fis rocks do not always provide a clear distinction and relatively thin mudstone layers may not be clearly identified upon the recovery of rock cores at land surface samples of the core approximately 2 cm in length were separated and processed using methods described in goode et al 2014 in preparation for analyses of chloroethene constituents in the rock matrix in total 299 core samples were analyzed from the seven coreholes table 1 for the concentration of tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene dce and vinyl chloride vc the results of the analyses for tce dce and vc are tabulated in shapiro et al 2019 along with a description of the analytical equipment used in the analyses reporting limits and the method of reporting the concentrations of chloroethene compounds from multiple analyses conducted on the same core sample results for analyses of tce and dce in samples of the rock core are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively as a function of the depth adjusted for the dip of bedding concentrations of tce and dce are reported in micrograms per gram of rock μg g the method of measuring chloroethenes in core samples does not distinguish between aqueous adsorbed and napl phases thus results shown in figs 3 and 4 account for the total i e aqueous adsorbed and napl tce and dce content in each core sample it should be noted that a napl phase may not be present additionally the results shown in figs 3 and 4 are identified by the mudstone classification gry mas gry lam or blk fis assigned to the core sample samples of the rock core selected for analyses covered the entire length of the core recovered in 87br in the other coreholes the depth where samples were selected for analyses was truncated before the bottom of the corehole the depth of the top and bottom samples in each corehole and the number of samples analyzed in each corehole are given in table 1 the analysis frequency over the length of the corehole where samples were analyzed varies from 0 32 to 0 43 m per sample table 1 however the selection of cores for analyses were not uniformly distributed over the length of the corehole samples of cores were chosen for their proximity to observed fractures and proximity to the blk fis mudstone layers because of their large f oc shapiro and brenneis 2018b samples of the rock core were also selected to identify tce dce and vc as a function of distance on either side of fractures additionally some samples of rock core were selected for analyses in the upper part of each corehole to identify if there was an effect of weathering in the rock nearer to land surface the concentrations of tce and dce in the rock matrix in 83br 89br vary over several orders of magnitude shapiro et al 2019 the results in figs 3 and 4 are shown on an arithmetic scale to highlight the locations of the highest concentrations of tce and dce the concentration of tce in core samples is in general an order of magnitude greater than the concentration of dce operations at the nawc did not use and dispose of dce thus the presence of dce and vc are interpreted as degradation products of tce lacombe 2000 most of the results for vc measured in core samples were at the minimum reporting limit shapiro et al 2019 and are not shown here the results of tce and dce profiles from the coreholes show punctuated locations of high concentration in the rock core that are attributed to the location of fractures as observed on borehole wall image logs see fig 2 at depths between 15 and 20 m several of the coreholes show samples of elevated tce and dce concentration indicative of large diffusion distances into the rock matrix from adjacent fractures we attribute this to weathering in the rock from enhanced groundwater flow through permeable features at the top of the coreholes in particular the blk fis mudstone below 20 m elevated tce and dce concentrations in the rock matrix are isolated and dictated by fracture locations additional rock samples were selected from the cores collected from 83br 89br to evaluate the spatial distribution of n and f oc within the seven coreholes 94 rock samples were selected and analyzed for both n and f oc and an additional 284 samples were analyzed only for f oc results of these analyses are given in shapiro and evans 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018a with additional discussion of the results given in shapiro et al 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018b the variability of n and f oc as a function of the depth adjusted for the dip of bedding is shown in fig 5 where the results from the seven coreholes are combined on a single graph for n and f oc respectively the arithmetic averages of n and f oc for each rock type are also shown on this figure both n and f oc vary over approximately two orders of magnitude with the largest values of n and f oc associated with the blk fis mudstone even though n and f oc tend to correlate with the mudstone unit there is still variability over an order of magnitude within continuous mudstone layers by plotting n and f oc as a function of the depth adjusted for the dip of bedding in fig 5 the variability at a given depth is attributed to the variability within continuous mudstone layers additionally results of core analyses show that n and f oc do not vary smoothly over small distances perpendicular to bedding analyses of chloroethene compounds in the rock matrix from core samples were previously conducted at other locations at the nawc goode et al 2014 however these boreholes were not clustered to investigate spatial variability over small lateral distances within the rock matrix for comparison with the results of 83br 89br we use information presented in goode et al 2014 for coreholes 70br and 68br fig 1 corehole 70br is near one of the locations that experienced surface releases of tce during the coring of 70br the napl form of tce was observed in the corehole goode et al 2014 corehole 68br is located outside a presumed tce source zone the number of core samples analyzed and sampling frequency over the length of 68br and 70br are also listed in table 1 for comparison with the frequency of analyses conducted in 83br 89br additional information describing the distribution of tce in the mudstone underlying the nawc is available in lacombe 2000 goode et al 2014 révész et al 2014 shapiro et al 2018 and tiedeman et al 2018 4 spatial distribution of chloroethene compounds in the rock matrix the spatial distributions of tce and dce in the rock over the length of coreholes 83br 89br shown in figs 3 and 4 identify specific depths of elevated chloroethene concentrations from these results however it is difficult to draw comparisons between coreholes to distinguish variations in chloroethene contamination over the short lateral distance between coreholes to facilitate a comparison of the tce and dce over lateral distances in the rock volume we consider a cumulative definition of the chloroethene concentration over the length of each corehole similar to that used by hurley 2003 in this analysis the total chloroethene concentration in the rock core s i defined in units of μg g figs 3 and 4 is converted to a volumetric concentration using ρ b 1 c i ρ b s i where the subscript i denotes either tce or dce and c i is the total concentration of the chloroethene compound defined per unit volume of the rock m l 3 where m denotes units of mass and l is a unit of length the cumulative total chloroethene concentration in the rock matrix defined as a function of the depth γ i z is specified by integrating c i over the length of the corehole 2 γ i z z 0 z c i ξ dξ where γ i z is defined as the chloroethene mass per unit area m l 2 at a given depth z and z 0 is the depth of the first core sample analyzed in the corehole because measurements of s i in core samples do not distinguish between the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases γ i z represents the total content of the chloroethene compound as a function of depth this interpretation assumes that there is sufficient density of sampling at discrete points in the rock matrix to define γ i z effectively in this investigation we have selected core samples for analyses adjacent to fractures and other features along each corehole that are likely to be responsible for the retention of chloroethene mass in the rock matrix in evaluating 2 from the discrete information shown in figs 3 and 4 we assume a linear interpolation between data points and use an average value for ρ b 2 58 g cm 3 defined from mercury porosimetry analyses of rock cores shapiro et al 2017 fig 6 shows γ tce z in coreholes 68br and 70br from results presented in goode et al 2014 and fig 7 shows γ tce z and γ dce z with depth in coreholes 83br 89br γ i z i tce dce increases with depth as additional analyses are added in the calculation however γ i z does not smoothly vary as a function of z the sharp increases in γ i z are associated with a single sample or closely spaced samples of high tce or dce concentration in the rock core these locations are usually associated with fractures the large increase in γ tce z for 70br at approximately 27 m fig 6 is associated with bedding plane fracture in the blk fis mudstone this was also the location where the napl form of tce was detected during coring goode et al 2014 abrupt increases in γ tce z are also depicted in results for 68br fig 6 however the incremental increase in the tce mass at locations along the core are not as large as that shown for 70br even at depths close to land surface the incremental increases in the tce mass depicted in 70br are greater than at similar depths in 68br which is indicative of 70br being located within an area of tce releases at land surface in contrast the distribution of tce in the rock core at 68br may be indicative of areas outside of tce releases where tce in the aqueous phase was transported downgradient from a source zone along permeable fractures incremental increases in γ i z i tce dce as a function of depth are also observed in cores analyzed from 83br 89br fig 7 analyses in corehole 87br extend to a greater depth than in the other coreholes however with the exception of 84br and 89br comparisons of γ i z between boreholes can be readily made and attributed to bedding units between depths of 15 and 32 m the abrupt increases in γ i z at depths in boreholes 83br 89br fig 7 are also associated with the fracture locations in these coreholes fig 2 cross hole hydraulic testing for hydraulic tomography in coreholes 83br 89br discussed in barrash et al 2018 and tiedeman and barrash 2019 showed that hydraulic properties of fractures along the length of the coreholes vary over several orders of magnitude fig 2 with the fractures associated with the blk fis layer at approximately 20 m depth being the most permeable feature in several coreholes fractures intersecting the borehole below 20 m have substantially lower hydraulic conductivity large concentrations of tce in the rock matrix adjacent to low permeability fractures are plausible because the napl form of tce may have entered low permeability fractures due to capillary forces derived from continuous pool heights of the napl kueper and mcwhorter 1991 and kueper et al 2003 discuss the conditions where napl can enter fractures of a given aperture noting that napl pool heights as small as 1 m can lead to napl entry into apertures as small as 1 μm 10 6 m tiedeman and barrash 2019 also noted that the high hydraulic conductivity is not necessarily continuous along presumed bedding layers offsets or truncations in the bedding layers in the shallow bedrock may lead to locally convoluted groundwater flow paths that do not conform to the general conceptual model of groundwater flow dominated by subhorizontal bedding plane fractures tiedeman and barrash 2019 noted that at 20 m depth although hydraulic perturbations eventually propagate between all coreholes there are volumes of rock with lower hydraulic conductivity that segregate fluid pressure responses between coreholes on the northwestern side of the rock volume 84br 88br and 89br from the coreholes on the southeastern side 83br 85br 86br and 87br in fig 7 γ tce z for coreholes 88br and 89br show similar characteristics to γ tce z for 70br fig 6 which is assumed to be representative of a location near a source release of tce these coreholes show elevated concentrations of tce and dce in the shallow rock in comparison to the other coreholes fig 3 and additionally they show larger incremental increases in γ i z i tce dce at fracture locations in the shallow rock in comparison to the other coreholes fig 7 coreholes 83br 84br 85br and 86br show characteristics of γ tce z similar to 68br fig 6 which is assumed to represent a location outside an area of surface releases of tce γ tce z for corehole 87br in fig 7 does not show elevated tce in the shallow rock characteristic of a tce source zone however elevated tce content in the rock at greater depths appears to be indicative of tce migrating from a source zone the incremental increases γ tce z at depths 25 m in 87br is greater than that associated with 70br fig 6 which is presumed to be characteristic of an area in the immediate vicinity of a surface release of tce results from hydraulic testing discussed in barrash et al 2018 and tiedeman and barrash 2019 indicate that fractures at this depth in 87br are not highly transmissive fig 2 therefore the napl form of tce may have entered low permeability fractures at depth in the rock associated with continuous pool heights of the napl form of tce it is conceivable that similar increases in γ tce z at depths 32 m could also be present in the other coreholes in the other coreholes analyses were not conducted on samples at depths greater than approximately 32 m table 1 γ dce z as a function of depth in coreholes 83br 89br is approximately an order of magnitude less than γ tce z fig 7 for the most part characteristics of γ dce z with depth are similar to γ tce z coreholes 88br and 89br show largest dce in the shallow rock which may be indicative of a location of tce releases and the degradation of tce to dce the other coreholes show little dce content with depth until approximately 20 m in contrast to γ tce z in corehole 87br γ dce z in 87br does not show the largest cumulative dce accumulation in comparison to the other coreholes which goode et al 2014 attributed to decreasing microbial degradation with depth in the bedrock aquifer 5 partitioning between napl aqueous and adsorbed phases measurements of tce and dce in rock cores using methods described in sterling et al 2005 and goode et al 2014 do not directly measure aqueous adsorbed and or napl phases in the rock matrix aqueous phase tce and dce can enter the rock matrix from adjacent fractures through diffusion and adsorb onto solid surfaces additionally under appropriate pool heights of dnapl in adjacent fractures the napl form of tce can also enter pores in the rock matrix that are of sufficient size where capillary pressure exceeds the entry pressure kueper and mcwhorter 1991 from mercury porosimetry analyses conducted on rock cores from 83br 89br shapiro et al 2017 demonstrated that a percentage of the pore throat diameters in the mudstone rock types at the nawc could accept the napl form of tce induced by continuous pool heights of approximately 3 m which are reasonable for conditions of napl releases at land surface that extend through the soil saprolite and then into fractures in the competent rock once in the rock matrix adsorption on solid surfaces will distribute the chloroethene constituent between the aqueous and adsorbed phases depending on the capacity for adsorption and rates of matrix diffusion the napl form of tce may persist in the rock matrix 5 1 linear equilibrium adsorption under the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption feenstra et al 1991 allen king et al 1996 the total chloroethene concentration s i can be defined by the partitioning between the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases 3 s i nc i ρ b k di c i s napl i where c i is the aqueous concentration m l 3 defined per volume of the fluid the subscript i denotes either tce or dce s napl i is the concentration of the napl phase component per mass of the rock and k di k oc i f oc is the partitioning coefficient for the chloroethene constituent l 3 m defined for the fluid volume per mass of the rock with k oc i l 3 m being the partitioning coefficient for the chloroethene constituent and organic carbon in the above equation if c i c sol i where c sol i m l 3 is the maximum solubility concentration for the chloroethene constituent the napl phase is assumed to be absent however in the presence of a napl phase c i c sol i for conditions at the nawc dce was not used and disposed of in site operations thus if a napl phase exists it is only likely to present for tce 5 2 partitioning calculations using average rock properties the core samples analyzed for chloroethene concentrations using methanol extractions were not analyzed for f oc additionally because the method of conducting methanol extractions are destructive of the rock core n and ρ b for these samples are also unavailable therefore calculations of phase partitioning from measurement of s i i tce dce require estimates of n ρ b and f oc that must be inferred by other means one approach for phase partitioning calculations is to use average values of the rock properties defined from analyses conducted on selected core samples hurley 2003 kueper et al 2003 sterling et al 2005 arithmetic average values associated with data that range over several orders of magnitude may not accurately define the central tendencies of the distribution which may yield erroneous interpretations of expected values in the phase partitioning calculations for example outliers in a distribution substantially affect the arithmetic average whereas the median of a distribution is sometime regarded as a better reflection of central tendencies for data showing large variability the arithmetic average and the median for n ρ b and f oc for the different rock types identified in the mudstone blk fis gry lam gry mas are given in table 2 arithmetic average and median values are also given in table 2 without differentiating between rock types tce partitioning calculations between the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases from measurements of s tce require identification of k oc tce grathwohl 1990 and allen king et al 2002 noted the significance of different types of organic matter on the magnitude of adsorption and indicate that values of k oc may depend on the type of organic materials in the aquifer value of k oc appropriate for the different mudstone types have not be identified from laboratory experiments and instead for tce partitioning calculations presented her we use a literature value of k oc tce equal to 126 ml per gram ml g pankow and johnson 1996 for the tce partitioning calculations in this section we use median estimates of the distributions of n ρ b and f oc table 2 the results of the phase partitioning calculations are shown in fig 8 as the cumulative aqueous phase γ tce aq z cumulative adsorbed phase γ tce ad z and cumulative napl γ tce napl z with depth in each of the coreholes where the cumulative phase with depth is calculated using a relation similar to that shown in 2 fig 8a shows results of calculations of phase partitioning where median estimates of the distributions of n ρ b and f oc are made without differentiating between rock types and fig 8b shows results where the median estimates are defined for each rock type because of the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption the cumulative aqueous and adsorbed tce have similar characteristic shapes with depth in the coreholes fig 8 which also resembles the total tce concentration with depth in the coreholes shown in fig 7a the calculations of phase partitioning indicate only a small percentage of the tce mass is associated with the aqueous phase because of the large f oc associated with the mudstone the aqueous tce is more than an order of magnitude less than the adsorbed tce in the rock cores additionally tce associated with the napl phase occurs only at a small number of locations in the coreholes the majority of the tce napl in the rock cores is identified at two depths in 87br other locations at the top of coreholes 85br 88br and 89br also show the possible presence of napl in the phase partitioning calculations in 87br the napl phase accounts for nearly an equal amount of tce as the adsorbed phase the results of phase partitioning calculations shown in fig 8 for the aqueous and adsorbed tce show minor differences between using median estimates of n ρ b and f oc defined with and without differentiating between the rock types the median estimate of f oc defined from all rock samples table 2 is slightly larger than the median estimates of f oc defined for the gry lam and gry mas rock types which results in larger amount of adsorbed tce fig 8a the larger amount of the adsorbed tce results in less aqueous tce in the rock matrix and reduces the likelihood of the napl form of tce in fig 8b the median estimates of n ρ b and f oc are defined for each rock type smaller values of f oc for the gry lam and gry mas rocks under this scenario yields less adsorbed tce more aqueous tce in the rock matrix and a greater likelihood of tce in the napl phase the different methods of assigning n ρ b and f oc show substantial differences in estimating the napl phase and locations where napl may occur if the arithmetic averages of the rock properties were used instead of the median estimates partitioning calculations would yield slightly larger amounts of tce in the adsorbed phase lower aqueous concentrations and less tce in the napl phase than that shown in fig 8 the arithmetic average for f oc is larger than the median estimate for all rock samples as well as estimates that differentiate samples by rock type table 2 similar partitioning calculations can also be conducted for analyses of dce in rock cores but are not shown here the concentrations of dce in the rock cores fig 4 are approximately an order of magnitude less than the tce concentrations consequently partitioning calculations for dce yield only the aqueous and adsorbed phases in the rock matrix with the majority of the dce in the adsorbed phase because of the large f oc associated with the mudstone 5 3 partitioning calculations from realizations of spatially variable rock properties because variability in both n and f oc ranges over orders of magnitude even within different mudstone rock types using median and average rock properties to conduct phase partitioning calculations may not yield representative results for the phase distribution particularly in evaluating the presence of the napl form of tce for example core samples with f oc at the lower end of the measured distribution would result in less adsorbed tce and larger aqueous tce concentrations in the rock matrix if the estimated aqueous tce concentration equals or exceeds the solubility concentration a napl phase could be present within the rock matrix in this section uncertainties in phase partitioning calculations are investigated by considering realizations of spatially variable rock properties uncertainties also exist in the evaluation of chloroethene concentrations conducted on rock core through methanol extractions in this investigation however we focus only on the variability that is observed in n and f oc in each realization values of n and f oc are assigned to core samples analyzed for tce content values of n and f oc are assumed to be independent and vary spatially along the length of the borehole shapiro and brenneis 2018b discussed the spatial correlation in f oc and showed correlation distances of less than a meter thus with the separation distances between core locations where tce was measured values of f oc are assumed to be uncorrelated methods of selecting uniform deviates between 0 and 1 as discussed in press et al 1992 were used to select rock matrix properties from the experimental distributions for n and f oc shown in shapiro et al 2017 and shapiro and brenneis 2018b respectively values of ρ b used in the phase partitioning calculations are defined from the observed correlation between n and ρb shapiro et al 2017 the spatially varying values of n and f oc are used in the phase partitioning calculation defined by 3 at each of the core locations where tce was analyzed at each core location 1000 realizations were conducted where each realization provided an estimate of the aqueous adsorbed and napl phase concentration the average aqueous and adsorbed tce concentrations calculated from the realizations at core locations are used to evaluate the cumulative aqueous and adsorbed tce as a function of depth for each corehole shown in fig 9 the cumulative aqueous and adsorbed tce with depth shown in fig 9 are denoted by γ tce aq z c tce and γ tce ad z c tce respectively where c tce denotes the average aqueous tce concentration in rock samples from multiple realizations the results in fig 9 for the coreholes have similar characteristic shapes and relative positions in comparison to the results of phase partitioning calculations using median values of rock properties fig 8 the large difference between the results shown in figs 8 and 9 is the reduction in the adsorbed tce when considering realizations of spatially variable rock properties the results in fig 9 show that the adsorbed tce in the rock matrix is approximately half of the adsorbed tce that is calculated using median rock properties which is a result of considering the full range of the distribution of f oc comparing the results in figs 8 and 9 indicate that neither the arithmetic average nor the median estimates of the rock properties represent central tendencies of the distribution that characterize the linear equilibrium adsorption for the results of the phase partitioning calculations using spatially variable rock properties fig 9 the aqueous phase tce is only nominally increased in comparison to the cumulative aqueous tce with depth from partitioning calculations using median rock properties fig 8 as shown in fig 9 the aqueous tce in the rock matrix is still approximately an order of magnitude less than the adsorbed tce however by considering the effect of the entire range of the distribution for f oc more instances of the occurrence of napl arise in the phase partitioning calculations from realizations of spatially variable rock properties we do not present a cumulative calculation of the napl phase tce concentration with depth for the phase partitioning calculations from realizations of spatially variable rock properties because the average of the napl concentration at locations along the coreholes would be greatly impacted by the number of realizations where napl does not occur instead to highlight the occurrence of napl in the rock matrix when accounting for variability in rock properties we present the probability of napl occurrence which is proportional to the number of occurrences of napl at a given location from the multiple realizations the probability of napl occurrence p napl is shown in fig 10 where p napl is shown at each location where a core sample was analyzed for chloroethene constituents the majority of sample locations show p napl 0 however locations where p napl 0 show a complex picture of potential locations where napl may be present in the rock matrix in comparison to results from phase partitioning calculations using median rock properties fig 8 which suppress the significance of napl occurrence in the rock matrix 6 interpretations of tce source zones the results showing γ tce z and p napl among the closely spaced coreholes 83br 89br in figs 7 and 10 respectively indicate a complex pattern of tce contamination and phase distributions in the mudstone over the 9 m diameter footprint encompassed by the coreholes the distribution of tce in the rock matrix was analyzed from core samples collected multiple decades after the initial releases of tce consequently the distribution of tce in the rock matrix may not necessarily be representative of the configuration of the tce distribution that arose from initial tce releases as there have been decades for napl dissolution as well as advection of aqueous phase tce and adsorption and matrix diffusion additionally decades of groundwater flow may accelerate tce diffusing out of the rock matrix adjacent to highly permeable fractures in comparison to less permeable fractures vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 however the large f oc associated with the mudstone rocks has resulted in substantial tce mass in the adsorbed phase which may provide a residual signature of the initial distribution of napl from tce releases shapiro and brenneis 2018b conducted simulations that show tce being retained in the rock matrix of the mudstone at the nawc for possibly hundreds of years following remediation in fractures the distribution of tce in the rock matrix is not necessarily controlled by proximity to the most permeable fractures in the rock volume the mudstone underlying the nawc is generally characterized by subhorizontal layers and bedding plane fractures parallel to the layering that are principally responsible for groundwater flow where the most permeable bedding plane fractures are associated with the blk fis rock coreholes on the western side of the well field show different configuration for γ tce z and p napl in comparison to coreholes on the eastern side of the well field for example 88br shows p napl 0 05 at a number of locations over the entire length of the corehole fig 10 similar characteristics are also shown at the top of the core in 89br however because core samples were not analyzed below 25 m in 89br p napl below this depth cannot be compared with the other coreholes γ tce z at the top of 88br and 89br also show large tce content in comparison to coreholes 83br 87br on the eastern side of the well field at depths 20 m in 83br 87br clusters of samples do not show elevated values of p napl these observations could imply that locations near 88br and 89br are in proximity to surface releases of tce that migrated downward through soil and weathered rock because the other coreholes 83br 87br do not show elevated tce content at the top of the corehole profiles it is conceivable that the surface releases did not extend over the entire footprint of the well field a highly permeable fractured interval is observed at approximately 20 m depth in most of the coreholes fig 2 however there is a high degree of heterogeneity in permeability within the mudstone layers at this depth with high permeability at 83br 85br 86br 87br and 89br but low permeability at 84br and 88br tiedeman and barrash 2019 in fig 7 coreholes 88br and 89br show evidence of a large tce content at this depth however elevated tce is not uniformly observed in the other coreholes at this depth 83br 84br and 85br show larger amounts of tce in the rock matrix in proximity to this depth in comparison to 86br and 87br fig 7 the nonuniformity of the tce distribution in the rock matrix at this elevation is also reflected in the calculations of p napl fig 10 however calculations of p napl also depend on the range of variability in the rock properties attributed to each rock type in addition to the total tce measured in core samples the variability in the tce in the adjacent rock matrix at approximately 20 m depth is likely affected by the heterogeneous permeability within this fractured interval which results in variability in the flow regime that is distributing tce from a possible source area in proximity to 88br and 89br investigations have shown that aperture variability in fractures can lead to convoluted paths of dnapl migration mclaren et al 2012 thus it is conceivable that heterogeneity within this permeable feature may lead to the variability of tce in adjacent rock matrix at this depth releases of tce at land surface from operations at the nawc until approximately the mid 1990s would have been affected by the natural flow regime starting in approximately 1995 pumping wells were installed to constrain the migration of the tce in the groundwater lacombe 2011 an examination of both ambient flow conditions and hydraulic conditions induced by pumping would be needed to gain additional insight into the distribution of tce in the rock matrix at these corehole locations coreholes 84br 85br and 86br show isolated samples of p napl 0 25 between 25 and 30 m it is conceivable that napl may be present at these locations due to a convoluted migration from a source zone due to fracture aperture variability the fact the tce content in the rock matrix is not uniformly distributed at depths 25 m would also need to be viewed in the context of the spatial variability of the fractures and the flow regime under ambient and pumped conditions the presences of p napl 0 25 at these locations also illustrates the complexity of attempting to identify the configuration of a tce source zone from conditions multiple decades after tce emplacement at depths 20 m 87br and 88br show similar characteristics with a number of locations of elevated values of p napl and large incremental increases in γ tce z both 87br and 88br have core samples where p napl 0 50 at a similar depth this indicates a possible network of subhorizontal and subvertical fractures which results in downward migration of tce from the source zone in the vicinity of 88br and 89br with lateral migration of the tce source at a depth of approximately 30 m this is consistent with results of tiedeman and barrash 2019 who identified a region of vertical permeability in the fracture network at depths 20 m in the vicinity of 83br 87br and 88br napl migration along the dip of bedding on the western side of the well field may have also contributed to the tce distribution with 88br and 89br being downdip from 87br the lateral migration of tce at 30 m depth however is not equally distributed to other locations interrogated by the coreholes but may be the result of the complex distribution of a napl phase that can be distributed through variable aperture fractures in 83br 85br and 86br there are small tce contributions to γ tce z between depths of 25 and 30 m in comparison to 87br and 88br core samples from 84br and 89br were not analyzed at these depths and thus we do not have a complete picture of the distribution of tce in the rock matrix at this depth 7 conclusions at sites of groundwater contamination characterizing the spatial distribution of contaminants in the aquifer is a critical element in formulating remedial strategies in fractured rock aquifers differentiating between contamination in the groundwater of the fracture porosity and the rock matrix is important in understanding factors affecting the longevity of contamination and the effectiveness of various remediation technologies at fractured rock sites that have been subject to groundwater contamination for multiple decades the majority of the contaminant mass is likely to reside in the low permeability rock matrix because of limitations in collecting groundwater samples from low permeability geologic materials collecting and analyzing rock core for contaminants in the rock matrix has become an important component of site characterization in fractured rock in this investigation of tce contamination in the mudstone aquifer underlying a former jet engine testing facility analyses of rock core in seven closely spaced coreholes shows substantial variability of tce concentration with depth in the rock matrix along the length of the coreholes and along continuous mudstone layers between adjacent coreholes elevated concentrations of tce in the rock matrix occur adjacent to fractures however the permeability of fractures does not necessarily dictate the tce distribution in the rock matrix the complex spatial distribution of tce within the rock matrix is likely a combination of the permeability and connectivity of fractures and capillary forces affecting the emplacement of the napl form of tce following releases at land surface as well as the subsequent napl dissolution advection of aqueous phase contaminants and the adsorption and matrix diffusion that has occurred over several decades plotting the cumulative tce concentration as a function of depth in coreholes provides a means of comparing characteristics of the tce distribution in the rock matrix between adjacent coreholes the cumulative tce concentration with depth in the coreholes show characteristics associated with 1 tce releases at lands surface 2 locations of downward movement of tce along fractures of different orientation and 3 tce distributed by fractures that may have been derived from a distant source area coreholes with these unique characteristics are observed over a 9 m diameter circular foot print indicating that there can be substantial differences in the tce distribution within the rock matrix over relatively small lateral distances at fractured rock sites the coreholes on the western side of the well field 83br 89br show proximity to tce releases the elevated tce concentration at the top of coreholes 88br and 89br may be indicative of localized tce releases at land surface additionally elevated tce concentration in the rock matrix in these coreholes at greater depths indicate possible downward movement of tce through a combination of subhorizontal and subvertical fractures results of hydraulic testing conducted by barrash et al 2018 indicate that fractures at greater depths in these coreholes are generally less permeable in comparison to bedding plane fractures in the blk fis rock at approximately 20 m depth the tce in the rock matrix adjacent to the lower permeability fractures is likely the result of capillary forces leading to the emplacement of tce into the small aperture fractures on the eastern side of the well field the distribution of tce in the rock core does not show tce concentrations indicative of surface leases the method of evaluating the tce concentration in rock cores using methanol extraction does not distinguish between tce in the aqueous adsorbed or napl phases identifying the tce in the aqueous adsorbed and napl phases is important for evaluating the longevity of tce contamination in the rock matrix partitioning calculations require information on the rock properties n ρ b and f oc in this investigation the large f oc in the matrix of the mudstone results in the majority of tce in the rock matrix being adsorbed to solid phase aquifer materials which can substantially extend the residence time of tce in the rock matrix simulations of tce diffusion out of the mudstone conducted by shapiro and brenneis 2018b indicate that tce may reside in the mudstone for hundreds of years following remediation applied in the adjacent fractures additionally the large tce concentration identified in a number of core samples indicates that a napl component of tce may also be present at locations along the coreholes in the rock matrix shapiro et al 2017 showed that a percentage of the large pore throat diameters in the rock matrix could be accessible to napl phase tce phase partitioning calculations using average rock properties for n and f oc do not account for the variability over more than an order of magnitude recognized in these rock properties using arithmetic average or median values of rock properties tend to suppress the likelihood of a tce napl phase occurrence in the rock matrix in this investigation a method of calculating the probability of the napl phase occurrence p napl is calculated at locations where cores samples were analyzed for tce concentration using experimental probability distributions for n and f oc the distribution of p napl at locations where core samples were analyzed indicates a pattern where tce in the napl phase may have infiltrated through fractures on the western side of the well field a number of core samples distributed over the length of the vertical concentration profiles show nonzero values of p napl indicating the likelihood of napl migrating downward at these location through a combination of subhorizontal and subvertical fractures in contrast on the eastern side of the well field nonzero values of p napl occur only at a few isolated locations along the coreholes at these isolated locations the napl form of tce may have been translated laterally along fractures
