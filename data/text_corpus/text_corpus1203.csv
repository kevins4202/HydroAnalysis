6015,the poyang lake basin plb is expected to see more precipitation and higher temperature by 2050 due to climate change it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate induced hydrologic variation therefore the local high density reservoir network is integrated into a distributed hydrologic model hms through a fully coupled reservoir module we then apply the extended hms in a one way coupled mode to the bias corrected coordinated regional downscaling experiment in east asia cordex ea regional climate simulations under two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the plb with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049 the local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin despite that much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk the approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale keywords climate impact reservoir network hydrologic modelling floods 1 introduction climate change is expected to pose a worldwide challenge to water resource management for the next few decades chen et al 2011 this is particularly relevant for the catchment of china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake basin plb which was historically threatened by frequent droughts and floods feng et al 2012 with the precipitation and temperature both expected to increase throughout this century su et al 2017 yu et al 2018 an increasing number of intensive and frequent extreme flood events are also projected around this area with the return period of floods reducing from 50 20 and 10 years to no more than 20 10 and 5 years respectively gu et al 2015 the variation in the flow regime can also be expected which can potentially impact water supply hydropower and ecological productivity kummu et al 2006 asadieh et al 2016 the climate change also poses a challenge to the tactic management and strategic planning of water resources because decisions made from historic hydrological records may no longer be as sustainable as expected with the increasing variability of flow regime sene 2010 the local reservoir network on the other hand may be able to provide additional resilience to the variability of flow regime in the context of climate change deng et al 2014 in the plb there are nearly 11 000 reservoirs built for the local economy with a total capacity over 3 1010 m3 they serve as a reliable water source and are operated to spatiotemporally displace the streamflow on a regional scale for the benefit of economy society and environment khagram 2003 räsänen et al 2012 2017 li et al 2017 as noted earlier the streamflow and flood conditions in the plb is expected to see considerable variations due to climate change which is likely to become a major concern in the plb and similar basins characterized by a similar climate shankman et al 2009 liu et al 2017 accordingly the extent to which reservoirs can mitigate these variations is crucial to the adaptive water resources planning and management wang et al 2017 however the role of reservoirs in this aspect remains unclear despite recent research on the joint impact of climate change and reservoir operation on the monthly streamflow for the mekong river basin lauri et al 2012 ngo et al 2018 and yuan river basin wen et al 2018 it is noted that most of the above mentioned research for example lauri et al 2012 used the climate data from either one gcm or multi gcm ensemble to analyze the climate impact for the area of interest however gcms are generally of a rather coarse resolution and is unable to capture the fine scale physical processes necessary for a regional assessment oh et al 2014 gu et al 2018a on the other hand the higher resolution output from regional climate models rcms is considered able to provide a better representation of climate variables over areas with rugged terrain and land ocean interactions for example the pre summer rainy season in the plb is missing in most of the simulations by gcms while it can be correctly reproduced by most of the rcms gu et al 2018b in addition due to the data scarcity and modelling difficulty of smaller reservoirs the conclusions of the existing literature were mostly based on the analysis of only a few large reservoirs with numerous smaller reservoirs either disregarded or simplified as a virtual reservoir at the basin outlet lauri et al 2012 ehsani et al 2016 wang et al 2018 ngo et al 2018 wen et al 2018 however a large group of smaller reservoirs can also induce considerable hydrologic alterations by reducing the downstream flood peaks and increasing the low flow deitch et al 2013 lu et al 2018 habets et al 2019 yet simplifying them at the basin outlet would make it unfeasible to quantify their spatial impacts on regional scales this is especially the case for the plb where smaller reservoirs account for around 50 of the total capacity of all reservoirs recent research reported an improvement in the streamflow simulation over a sub basin of the plb by accounting for both large reservoirs and the spatial pattern of numerous smaller reservoirs dong et al 2019 that being said additional spatial information on smaller reservoirs would allow a better understanding of the role of a reservoir network within a basin under climate change to support decisions on the regional water resource management in the context of climate change this study first intends to identify the likely variation in the hydrological regime due to climate change over the plb with vulnerable areas highlighted on its basis this study further aims to investigate the effectiveness of the local reservoir network in reducing the impact of climate change on the runoff and floods to this end we use the future climate conditions from the bias corrected regional climate simulations of regcm4 which performs well according to analysis of chen et al 2014 gu et al 2018a and 2018b in addition the local high density reservoir network is integrated into the physically based hydrologic model system hms through a fully coupled reservoir network module three simulations are then conducted by applying the extended hms to one historical and two future climate conditions the methods and results of this study are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs under climate change and provide information on the regional water resources management 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake basin plb is located in the middle of yangtze river basin with an area of 1 62 105 km2 wei et al 2015 2016 fig 1 the basin consists of five major sub basins with three in the north namely the xiu river basin xin river basin rao river basin and two in the south namely the gan river basin and fu river basin five hydrologic stations namely a waizhou b meigang c lijiadu d hushan and e wanjiabu are located in each of the above mentioned five rivers that drain into the lake the locations of eight cities with a population over 200 000 are also shown in fig 1 the basin is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with annual precipitation of 1622 mm the flood season lasts from april to june and the dry season lasts from october to december 2 2 reservoir data collection and estimation according to the database of the yangtze river water resources commission ywrc there are 25 large reservoirs with a capacity larger than 108 m3 and 234 medium reservoirs with a capacity between 107 m3 and 108 m3 in the plb the geophysical and geometrical information of these reservoirs such as location capacity mean annual runoff and control water levels were collected for reservoir modelling in addition there are over 10 300 small reservoirs with a capacity less than 107 m3 across the basin for hydropower irrigation and water supply as reported by the department of water resources of jiangxi province although the estimated combined capacity of small reservoirs is approximately 7 108 m3 there is generally no information available for most of the individual reservoirs such as mean annual runoff capacity and location to obtain the capacity and location of individual small reservoirs as much as possible the remote sensing images of the plb during the flood season were collected and processed to derive the location and the water surface area for 1114 small reservoirs that are fully visible in the image among them 177 are with known capacities to estimate the capacities of the other 937 visible small reservoirs firstly we assumed that for all small reservoirs the derived water surface area corresponds to their capacity given that the remote sensing images were captured in the flood season cao et al 2011 deitch et al 2013 the standard deviation of elevation sde across the basin was extracted from the srtm dem shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model to further include the effect of local terrain on the reservoir geometry then we fitted a multivariate relationship to the capacity area sde data points of the 177 small reservoirs with known capacities fig 2 the capacities of the other 937 visible small reservoirs were then estimated by applying the fitted relationship to each of them for an uncertainty analysis on the estimated capacities the kolmogorov smirnov test was performed cai et al 2019 the result indicates that the relative error between estimated and actual capacities follows the normal distribution with the mean of 1 0 and the standard deviation of 33 2 the 95 confidence interval of the relative error is from 64 1 to 66 1 indicating that the relative error can be relatively large in some cases see supporting information for more details although this is a rough estimation this method provides important data input for data scarce areas fig 3 depicts the spatial distribution of 25 large reservoirs 234 medium reservoirs and 1114 small reservoirs with either collected or estimated capacities in the plb for the remaining smaller reservoirs with literally no information the remaining total capacity of small reservoirs are allocated to cropland and surrounding upstream grid cells then it is assumed that for each of these grid cells there exists a reservoir with a capacity allocated to it this was justified by the fact that most small dams are located on or near the cropland in the plb grid cells with larger sde are allocated with a larger capacity given that there is a positive correlation between capacity and sde for a given reservoir water area fig 2 the storage area correlation is also required to estimate the reservoir seepage surface precipitation and evaporation in this study the inverted triangle storage area correlation is used i e v a a 1 5 where v a and a are storage surface area and shape coefficient respectively liebe et al 2005 van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2016 here the shape coefficient a for small reservoirs is calculated from the above fitted capacity area relationship for large and medium reservoirs the coefficient is calculated in a similar way given that all of them are also visible in the remote sensing images 2 3 hydrologic model and reservoir module the distributed hydrological model system hms is employed in this study to carry out the analysis the model is physically based and is two way coupled to the land surface scheme lsx of genesis yu et al 1999 2006 the lsx calculates runoff generation recharge soil moisture content and other hydrologic components vertically over the domain while the hms can derive the lateral movement of surface and subsurface water using hydrodynamic equations the model is able to represent multiple hydrologic processes in addition to the streamflow such as runoff generation and groundwater movement as reported by previous research yang et al 2010 2012 wagner et al 2016 the hydrological impact of the local reservoir network is quantified through a fully coupled reservoir module the module was developed based on our previous research which allows the regulated streamflow reservoir seepage and variation of the surface area to interact with flow routing groundwater motion runoff generation and multiple other hydrological processes in the coupled model which in turn gives feedback to the reservoir operation lv et al 2016 dong et al 2019 all of the large and medium reservoirs along with small reservoirs identified above are directly integrated into grid cells at their actual locations a major problem faced by reservoir modelling at large scales is that a reservoir can be erroneously integrated into a grid cell with considerably larger or smaller runoff because the precise river network is often not available on a regional scale especially for small reservoirs shin et al 2019 to avoid this problem we compare the simulated mean annual runoff of a likely grid cell with that collected for large and medium reservoirs and adjust their locations if there is a considerable discrepancy on the other hand the inflow of small reservoirs with no runoff information is simply estimated by assuming that the ratio of capacity to mean annual runoff of a small reservoir is the same as the average of nearby medium reservoirs a generalized conceptual release scheme is employed to determine the release of reservoirs of multiple sizes it was originally developed and tested only for large reservoirs by zhao et al 2016 and was further modified and tested for macroscale research in our previous study dong et al 2019 the scheme first divides the capacity of a reservoir into several storages or pools according to a few control water levels and assigns the reservoir with a specific objective e g flood control water supply when the storage exceeds a certain critical level the storage of reservoirs is then updated for each time step using the water balance equation where the reservoir inflow outflow seepage surface precipitation and evaporation are all included 2 4 experimental design to evaluate the impact of climate change and reservoir operation on the basin hydrology we conduct three simulations a baseline b future natural and c future regulated the baseline simulation depicts the natural flow regime for the period of 1970 1984 which is performed with the reservoir disabled hms to drive the model historical daily temperature and precipitation are obtained from a 0 5 degree gridded dataset published by the national meteorological center of china other meteorological forcing such as air pressure relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation are obtained from the ncep ncar reanalysis data yang 2009 the soil data is from the harmonized world soil database land use data from the avhrr data and digital elevation data from the hydro1k dem from the usgs and unep grid these static data are all available at a spatial resolution of 10 km yang 2009 dong et al 2019 which is the model resolution in this study the meteorological forcing was therefore bilinearly interpolated to the model grid points the future natural and future regulated scenarios represent the natural and reservoir regulated flow regime for the period of 2035 2049 respectively the regional climate projections here the projected precipitation and temperature are derived and selected from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment in east asia cordex ea which aims to provide climate projections using regional climate models at a spatial resolution of around 50 km details on the cordex ea can be found in park et al 2016 and gu et al 2018a the selected regional climate projections are analyzed in comparison with the historical observation and are then used to drive the reservoir disabled hms future natural and the reservoir enabled hms future regulated in order to analyze the impact of climate change and the mitigation role of reservoirs respectively 2 5 selection of regional climate projections in this study the selection of regional climate projections from the ongoing cordex ea is based on their performance over the plb to begin with the hadgem2 ao general circulation model gcm is employed here to provide the initial and boundary conditions for all regional climate models rcms because multiple studies have reported its advantage over many other gcms in simulating the precipitation of china for example chen et al 2014 noted that hadgem2 ao has relatively good performance in simulating the temporal and spatial pattern of precipitation among 43 gcms similar results are also noted by gu et al 2015 and 2018b in a comparative study among 27 gcms the performance of five rcms namely regcm4 wrf mm5 rsm and hadgem3 ra driven by hadgem2 ao was assessed in our previous studies gu et al 2018a b and is briefly illustrated in the supporting information the output of all rcms is available at a spatial resolution of 50 km except that hadgem3 ao is at a resolution of 0 44 the results indicated that regcm4 generally outperforms the other four rcms and the ensemble mean over the plb in terms of the spatiotemporal bias and error of the precipitation see fig s1 in supporting information accordingly the dynamically downscaled regcm4 simulations is used in this study to drive the hms modelling system over the plb under future scenarios two typical representative concentration pathways scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are considered to account for the intermediate and high emissions although rcms employ sophisticated physical parameterizations to represent detailed processes in the land atmosphere continuum they cannot resolve all of the relevant processes with a sufficient accuracy maraun et al 2017 this limitation produces systematic bias and justifies the use of bias correction laux et al 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012 mao et al 2015 dang et al 2018 in this aspect the histogram equalization method is chosen in this study this method is a widely used statistical approach in which a transfer function tf is derived such that the frequency histogram of the corrected variable can match the frequency histogram of the observed one piani et al 2010 ngo et al 2018 we employ the observed precipitation for 1961 2005 to derive the tf and then to correct the precipitation simulated by regcm4 for 2035 2049 in terms of the maximum minimum and mean daily temperature large error may arise if the histogram equalization method is used thrasher et al 2012 therefore the temperature is corrected by a linear scaling method in this study gu et al 2018b 2 6 quantifying the role of reservoirs in flood mitigation to assess the effectiveness of reservoirs in mitigating the impact of climate change on the flood conditions the annual maximum flood amf and the peak over threshold approach pot are employed to calculate the flood magnitude and flood frequency for the three scenarios the amf uses the annual maximum daily discharge averaged over the study period to quantify the magnitude of floods for spatially averaged analysis the normalized annual maximum flood amf divided by mean annual runoff is employed to determine if a larger or smaller portion of streamflow is likely to become floods on the other hand the amf may not cover all of the considerable flood events for example the amf in dry years can be too small to be included in floods of interest whereas there can be several flood peaks in wet years which are large enough to raise concerns wang et al 2017 the peak over threshold pot approach overcomes this limitation by selecting flood events exceeding a discharge threshold that corresponds to two events per year averaged over the study period the threshold value is determined first for the baseline and then applied to the future scenarios to extract floods for the 2035 2049 in this study to avoid counting the same flood event twice only one event is allowed within a 15 day sliding window mallakpour and villarini 2015 by doing so the future frequency of considerably large floods relative to the baseline period can be calculated 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the hms model without reservoirs is calibrated for 1961 1972 and validated for 1973 1984 the calibration and validation period were selected because of the natural hydrological regime without much disturbance from human activities before 1980s the five hydrologic stations located on the five major rivers in the plb are used for calibration and validation fig 1 six parameters of the hms model can be calibrated namely manning s roughness streambed conductivity porosity aquifer thickness wilting point and hydraulic conductivity among them manning s roughness and streambed conductivity were selected for calibration in this study because they are the only sensitive parameters as indicated by the sensitivity analysis in our previous research dong et al 2019 in all 10 000 parameter sets were generated from the latin hypercube sampling with 2000 for each station each of them was input into the model for simulation and the parameter set with which the hms simulation has the highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for each station was selected as the optimal parameter values more details on the sampled range of each parameter and the sensitivity analysis can be found in dong et al 2019 the results of calibration and validation are presented in fig 4 in the form of relative bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse moriasi et al 2007 1 pbias i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 2 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of timestep s i and o i are the simulated and observed streamflow at the ith timestep respectively and o is the averaged observed streamflow in general the model exhibits a good ability to reproduce the streamflow in different locations with the nse value larger than 0 85 for all stations over both the calibration and validation period for hushan station the model shows similarly good performance in the validation period nse 0 94 and calibration period nse 0 93 slightly higher nse in the validation period can also be found in many other studies for example in wagner et al 2016 ngo et al 2018 hoang et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 3 2 projections of precipitation and temperature the projected precipitation and temperature for the period of 2035 2049 as compared to the baseline 1970 1984 are presented in figs 5 and 6 on average the future annual precipitation increases by 0 59 mm day and 0 68 mm day under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively and the future temperature rises by 1 8 c and 2 1 c under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the spatially averaged precipitation increases in most of the months under both rcps except for july october and december for rcp4 5 and june and october for rcp8 5 the precipitation increases by 1 17 mm day under rcp4 5 and by 0 77 mm day under rcp8 5 in the flood season whereas it decreases by 0 25 mm day under rcp4 5 and increases slightly by 0 08 mm day under rcp8 5 in the dry season for temperature the spatially averaged value rises by 2 28 c and 2 42 c in the dry season and by 1 45 c and 1 50 c in the flood season under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in general with the increase in the emission of greenhouse gases the annual precipitation and temperature is projected with a larger increase fig 6 depicts the spatial pattern of variations in the precipitation and temperature it shows that the precipitation increases for almost the entire basin such increase in the precipitation generally concentrates in the northern area i e xiu river basin xin river basin rao river basin and becomes less pronounced to the south under both rcps notably the upper gan river basin and upper fu river basin see a relatively minor increase in the precipitation as compared to other areas similarly higher temperature is projected across the entire plb with a more notable rise in the north under both rcps 3 3 runoff under climate change and reservoir operation fig 7 depicts the spatially averaged monthly and annual runoff under the baseline future natural and future regulated scenarios due to the increase in the annual precipitation the basin averaged annual runoff increases by 15 9 and 22 6 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and slightly decreases under the impact of reservoir operation the spatially averaged monthly runoff generally increases in most months under the impact of climate change except for june july november and december for rcp4 5 and june july and october for rcp8 5 in particular the spatially averaged runoff increases most significantly from march to may due to climate change with the peak monthly flow correspondingly shifting two months earlier from june to april taking rcp4 5 as an example climate change increases the runoff by 21 4 m3 s 14 1 in the flood season but decreases the runoff by 1 7 m3 s 6 3 in the dry season similarly climate change increases the spatially averaged runoff from 171 9 m3 s to 199 3 m3 s for the wettest month and reduces the runoff from 25 3 m3 s to 20 1 m3 s for the driest month the conditions are similar for rcp8 5 except that climate change generally induces no significant variation of the runoff in the dry season compared to the baseline the local reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate impact by decreasing the runoff by 6 8 m3 s 3 9 in the flood season and increasing the runoff by 7 8 m3 s 31 2 in the dry season the operation of reservoirs combined with climate change eventually results in a 14 6 m3 s 9 6 increase of the natural runoff in the flood season and a 6 1 m3 s 22 6 increase in the dry season under rcp4 5 the reservoir operation also reduces the runoff by 13 5 m3 s to 185 8 m3 s for the wettest month and increases the runoff by 8 1 m3 s to 28 2 m3 s for the driest month a similar case is also found for rcp8 5 by combining the effect of reservoirs and climate change the averaged runoff eventually increases by 22 7 m3 s 14 9 in the flood season and by 8 0 m3 s 29 6 in the dry season fig 8 depicts the spatial pattern of the relative change in the runoff for the future natural and future regulated scenarios under both rcps as compared to the baseline the climate induced variation in the annual runoff generally follows that of the annual precipitation with a larger increase in the xiu river basin xin river basin and rao river basin and a smaller increase in the upper gan river basin and upper fu river basin as compared to the baseline fig 8a and d the reservoirs basically induce minor changes in the annual runoff for the flood season fig 8b and e most of the basin is expected to experience a larger amount of runoff under both rcps especially in the xiu river basin rao river basin and lower gan river basin by further taking account of reservoirs under rcp4 5 slightly decreased runoff can be observed in several locations as compared to the baseline although the runoff still increases by 0 40 in most of the plb and even up to 100 in the upper xiu river basin in terms of the rcp8 5 the increased runoff can be observed for most of the plb despite the operation of reservoirs for the dry season fig 8c and f results indicate that climate change can decrease the runoff by up to 40 in the fu river basin and gan river basin under rcp4 5 and the decreased runoff cannot be fully reversed by reservoirs for much of these areas for rcp8 5 it is noted that the decreased runoff occurs mostly in the upper gan river basin and can be generally offset by reservoirs on the other hand most of the xin river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin in the north are expected to see increased runoff under both rcps reservoirs can further increase the runoff in these areas where the runoff is expected to increase by up to 100 under the joint impact of climate change and reservoir operation 3 4 floods under climate change and reservoir operation fig 9 depicts the spatially averaged annual maximum flood and flood frequency under the baseline future natural and future regulated scenarios in general climate change is expected to induce a larger flood magnitude and frequency at the basin level for example the annual maximum flood is 508 m3 s 685 m3 s and 669 m3 s under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the normalized amf is 11 8 14 3 and 13 6 under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and climate change induces a relatively large interannual variability in the future although the basin averaged flood magnitude is larger under rcp4 5 than under rcp8 5 the floods occur more frequently under rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 as indicated by the pot analysis the flood frequency is 1 40 under rcp4 5 and 1 72 under rcp8 5 as compared to a baseline value of 1 0 the reservoir network can partially mitigate the climate impact by reducing the amf by 11 2 to 608 m3 s under rcp4 5 and by 13 3 to 580 m3 s under rcp8 5 which are nevertheless higher than those under the baseline similarly the normalized amf is reduced to 13 3 under rcp4 5 and 12 5 under rcp 8 5 and the flood frequency is reduced by 16 4 to 1 17 under rcp4 5 and by 15 7 to 1 45 under rcp8 5 despite that they are both higher than those of the baseline as well fig 10 depicts the spatial pattern of the relative change in the flood magnitude and flood frequency for the future natural and future regulated scenarios under both rcps as compared to the baseline due to the climate change the amf significantly increases by up to 100 for the xiu river basin and rao river basin while the rest of the plb also see a relatively minor increase fig 10a and c by taking account of reservoirs the amf for most of the upper gan river basin fu river basin and xin river basin can be reduced to that under the baseline whereas the amf for most of the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin is still much larger than the baseline the flood frequency also increases in most of the plb under the climate impact except for the upper gan river basin where the flood frequency considerably decreases under both rcps fig 10b and d by taking account of the effect of reservoirs the flood frequency can decrease by up to 30 for much of the upper gan river basin and fu river basin as compared to the baseline especially under rcp4 5 however an increased flood frequency can be expected in most of the lower gan river basin xiu river basin xin river basin and rao river basin under both rcps despite the mitigation by reservoirs 4 discussion the previous section quantitatively depicted the hydrological impact induced by climate change and the ability of reservoirs to mitigate this impact in general a larger amount of precipitation and higher temperature are projected across the plb for the period of 2035 2049 as compared to the baseline of 1970 1984 and the increase in both variables occurs most notably in the northern area of the basin this is in line with multiple recent studies covering the climate change in east asia and china gu et al 2015 2018a b yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 our findings also reveal the role of a high density reservoir network in mitigating the climate impact the local reservoir network can spatiotemporally redistribute the water by increasing the runoff in the dry season and decreasing the runoff in the flood season and can effectively mitigate the flood magnitude and frequency which was also observed for multiple basins wang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 ngo et al 2018 to be specific the average runoff in the dry season is more effectively regulated by local reservoirs with a relative increase of around 30 while the average runoff in the flood season is relatively less affected by the reservoir operation with a relative change less than 5 the flood magnitude is more effectively reduced by reservoirs with a relative decrease of 15 16 while the flood frequency sees a relative decrease of 11 13 at the basin level a slight decrease in the annual runoff is also induced by reservoirs which is a likely result of reservoir seepage and evaporation lu et al 2018 dong et al 2019 4 1 mitigating effect of reservoirs with respect to runoff in the wake of the increased precipitation in the future the water resources of the plb are expected to increase across the basin especially in the northern part of the basin this indicates the poyang lake will receive more water in the future leading to variations in the lakeshore geometry from the perspective of reservoir operation the larger annual runoff is indicative of a weakened ability of reservoirs to regulate flows as compared to what they were designed for due to the decrease in the reservoir capacity relative to the mean annual runoff or the degree of regulation grill et al 2014 the water resources in the plb are expected to increase in the flood season but is likely to decline in the dry season under the impact of climate change the larger variance between the water availability in the flood season and dry season can lead to a higher competition to meet different water demands in the future ehsani et al 2017 combined with the decreased degree of regulation as noted earlier this can pose new challenges for stakeholders to make a trade off between water requirements of multiple sectors and call on multi sectoral integrated water resources management in the basin this also suggests that more storage capacities may be required in the future to maintain the designed status of water service given their ability to temporally redistribute the water resources as indicated in the results while the local reservoirs can mitigate the climate impact by storing the additional runoff in the flood season our findings indicate that they cannot fully mitigate the increased runoff especially for the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin for the dry season we found that the local reservoirs can reverse the decreasing trend of water resources at the basin level by releasing more water in the dry season for hydropower irrigation and water supply however our spatial analysis suggests that the climate induced decrease cannot be completely mitigated by reservoirs alone for the gan river basin and fu river basin under rcp4 5 this implies that there can be more severe droughts and water shortage in these areas despite the reservoir operation local water dependent industries such as fishery may also be affected lauri et al 2012 some negative ecological consequences are also expected given the low flow is a fundamental constraint on the aquatic communities and has a notable impact on the number and diversity of organism that can survive hu et al 2008 lu et al 2018 csl style error reference with no printed form accordingly precautious measures may need to be taken to deal with the likely risk of water shortage and ecological consequences in water scarce months for those vulnerable areas identified above for example our findings indicate that construction of new reservoirs can be an effective adaptation option as they can dramatically increase the low flow at the basin level 4 2 mitigating effect of reservoirs with respect to floods the increase in the flood magnitude and flood frequency under both rcps implies larger and more frequent flood events or simply a higher flood risk as a result of climate change although the reservoirs can compensate for much of the increase in these variables by reducing the discharge and number of the flood peaks our findings indicate that their values cannot be reduced to the baseline level this result implies that flood control will potentially be a major concern in the future water resources planning and management of the plb accordingly adaptation measures need to be taken to mitigate the higher flood risk induced by climate change across the entire basin such as the development and application of flood warning system and construction of flood control reservoirs and embankments to save unnecessary efforts and investments particular attention should be paid to the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin especially the major cities located within them because these areas are found rather vulnerable to the climate change in terms of intensified floods and should be treated with particular care this is based on our spatial analysis which reveals that these areas are expected to see an increased flood magnitude and frequency despite the mitigation by reservoirs indicating the local reservoir network is not able to completely compensate for the climate intensified floods in these areas from another point of view according to the climate projections considered in this study reservoirs in these areas will experience floods with a larger magnitude and frequency in the future compared with those they were designed for in the past thereby leading to a greater risk of dam breach and overtopping mallakpour et al 2019 this will require more frequent examinations on the dam status in the future it should also be noted that the increased flood magnitude and frequency in these areas can reshape the physical and biological features of rivers and floodplains and induce variations in the ecosystem for example severe floods can wash away many organisms thereby eliminating some species but also bringing about opportunities for some other species by creating habitats such as the floodplain wetland the nature conservancy 2009 4 3 limitations of this study this study draws attention to the possible impact of climate change across the basin and the role of a high density reservoir network in mitigating the climate impact however the results presented in this study are subject to a few uncertainties that need to be clarified the major uncertainty comes from the reliability of projected climate data although the selection of regcm4 driven by hadgm2 ao in this study have exhibited relatively good performance over the plb as indicated in previous research we acknowledge that the use of multi model ensemble may be able to better address the uncertainty related to the climate projection on the other hand there is relatively limited uncertainty related to the climate projection over the plb as the ensemble mean of 27 gcms and the ensemble mean of 5 rcms both project increased precipitation especially in the northern area and in the flood season increased temperature especially in the northern basin and in the winter and intensified floods with shorter return periods gu et al 2018a b yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 this consistency of climate projections for the plb among different climate models gives us confidence in the robustness of the results presented in this study in addition to the uncertainty of climate models the uncertainty related to the bias correction methods should also be noted while the bias correction is considered a well established procedure for regional climate studies teutschbein and seibert 2010 2012 some have argued that the use of bias correction can add to the uncertainty of the climate model output ehret et al 2012 maraun et al 2017 however original rcm output nevertheless has substantial bias and is likely inadequate to drive hydrological analysis that requires a high standard of fidelity for hydrological simulation performance smiatek and kunstmann 2019 accordingly we are fully convinced that bias correction is necessary in this study the lack of actual reservoir operation rules also adds to the uncertainty of the results while the implementation of conceptual generalized operation rules in this study is straightforward with relatively little data requirements hanasaki et al 2006 voisin et al 2013 they are not a perfectly accurate reflection of the reality to overcome this issue recent studies have used machine learning to reconstruct reservoir operation rules for example coerver et al 2018 established artificial neural network ann based reservoir operation rules from the reservoir inflow outflow and storage data which achieved good results in simulating the operation of reservoirs in addition the lack of details on numerous small reservoirs such as actual capacities and mean annual runoff is considered as another source of uncertainty this is a frequent problem faced by global and regional scale research because many of the small reservoirs are not well documented by local agencies and for those with details on file researchers can hardly gain access to the detailed information although our proposed method to estimate the information on small reservoirs provides a rough estimation the use of high resolution satellite products may be able to more accurately derive the information on small reservoirs for example busker et al 2019 used satellite altimetry to estimate the reservoir volume in data sparse areas which is in good agreement with the observations it should also be noted that both the machine learning and satellite altimetry methods are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of data which is a challenge especially for small reservoirs nevertheless the development and application of these techniques are promising future research directions and are expected to enhance the data availability eventually leading to more accuracy in reservoir simulations 5 conclusions this study aims to identify areas which are prone to the climate induced hydrological variation and to investigate the effectiveness of reservoirs to mitigate the impact of climate change in the poyang lake basin china with the use of remote sensing and terrain features the local reservoir network was first integrated into a physically based hydrological model hms through a fully coupled reservoir network module then the extended hms simulations were conducted by using the historical climate datasets from observations and the regcm4 climate projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as compared to the 1970s the poyang lake basin is projected to see more precipitation and higher temperature by 2040s especially in the northern area of the basin with an increase of the annual water resources in the future due to larger precipitation the water resources are expected to increase in the flood season but are likely to decrease in the dry season this increased seasonal variability can strengthen the competition among multiple water demands and calls on adaptive water resources management in the future climate change also induces flood events with larger magnitude and frequency this combined with a wetter flood season increases the flood risks across the basin although the local reservoir network can store additional water resources and mitigate the floods in the flood season it cannot fully offset the impact of climate change especially in the northern basin i e the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin these areas may require flood adaptation measures to guarantee the safety of dams riverside settlements and major cities on the other hand the climate induced decreased water resources in the dry season can lead to a higher risk of droughts and water shortage at the basin level with the displacement of excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season by reservoirs the decreasing trend of water availability can be reversed at the basin level however the southern basin i e the gan river basin and fu river basin are nevertheless likely to see decreased water availability in water scarce months these areas may therefore require precautious measures to combat the likely risk of water shortage and negative ecological consequences for example construction of new local reservoirs these results are expected to provide instructive implications for future water resources management not only in this area but also in other basins along the middle of yangtze river given that these basins are characterized by a similar precipitation pattern and a similar development level to the plb more importantly our newly developed extended hms modelling system is generally enough to identify the vulnerable areas of basins due to climate change and to quantify the mitigation role of reservoirs which can be used to provide information for integrated water resources management in different

6015,the poyang lake basin plb is expected to see more precipitation and higher temperature by 2050 due to climate change it is advisable to identify the vulnerable area and to investigate if the local reservoir network of hundreds of larger reservoirs and thousands of smaller reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate induced hydrologic variation therefore the local high density reservoir network is integrated into a distributed hydrologic model hms through a fully coupled reservoir module we then apply the extended hms in a one way coupled mode to the bias corrected coordinated regional downscaling experiment in east asia cordex ea regional climate simulations under two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 results indicate that climate change poses new challenges to water resources management for the plb with a likely decrease of water availability in the dry season but an increase of water availability flood magnitude and flood frequency in the flood season till 2049 the local reservoir network can mitigate climate impacts by displacing excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season and mitigating floods across the basin despite that much of the southern basin is likely to see a higher risk of water shortage in the dry season while most of the northern basin is expected to see a higher flood risk the approach and findings are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs in the context of climate change and provide implications for water resources management and climate change adaptation strategies on a regional scale keywords climate impact reservoir network hydrologic modelling floods 1 introduction climate change is expected to pose a worldwide challenge to water resource management for the next few decades chen et al 2011 this is particularly relevant for the catchment of china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake basin plb which was historically threatened by frequent droughts and floods feng et al 2012 with the precipitation and temperature both expected to increase throughout this century su et al 2017 yu et al 2018 an increasing number of intensive and frequent extreme flood events are also projected around this area with the return period of floods reducing from 50 20 and 10 years to no more than 20 10 and 5 years respectively gu et al 2015 the variation in the flow regime can also be expected which can potentially impact water supply hydropower and ecological productivity kummu et al 2006 asadieh et al 2016 the climate change also poses a challenge to the tactic management and strategic planning of water resources because decisions made from historic hydrological records may no longer be as sustainable as expected with the increasing variability of flow regime sene 2010 the local reservoir network on the other hand may be able to provide additional resilience to the variability of flow regime in the context of climate change deng et al 2014 in the plb there are nearly 11 000 reservoirs built for the local economy with a total capacity over 3 1010 m3 they serve as a reliable water source and are operated to spatiotemporally displace the streamflow on a regional scale for the benefit of economy society and environment khagram 2003 räsänen et al 2012 2017 li et al 2017 as noted earlier the streamflow and flood conditions in the plb is expected to see considerable variations due to climate change which is likely to become a major concern in the plb and similar basins characterized by a similar climate shankman et al 2009 liu et al 2017 accordingly the extent to which reservoirs can mitigate these variations is crucial to the adaptive water resources planning and management wang et al 2017 however the role of reservoirs in this aspect remains unclear despite recent research on the joint impact of climate change and reservoir operation on the monthly streamflow for the mekong river basin lauri et al 2012 ngo et al 2018 and yuan river basin wen et al 2018 it is noted that most of the above mentioned research for example lauri et al 2012 used the climate data from either one gcm or multi gcm ensemble to analyze the climate impact for the area of interest however gcms are generally of a rather coarse resolution and is unable to capture the fine scale physical processes necessary for a regional assessment oh et al 2014 gu et al 2018a on the other hand the higher resolution output from regional climate models rcms is considered able to provide a better representation of climate variables over areas with rugged terrain and land ocean interactions for example the pre summer rainy season in the plb is missing in most of the simulations by gcms while it can be correctly reproduced by most of the rcms gu et al 2018b in addition due to the data scarcity and modelling difficulty of smaller reservoirs the conclusions of the existing literature were mostly based on the analysis of only a few large reservoirs with numerous smaller reservoirs either disregarded or simplified as a virtual reservoir at the basin outlet lauri et al 2012 ehsani et al 2016 wang et al 2018 ngo et al 2018 wen et al 2018 however a large group of smaller reservoirs can also induce considerable hydrologic alterations by reducing the downstream flood peaks and increasing the low flow deitch et al 2013 lu et al 2018 habets et al 2019 yet simplifying them at the basin outlet would make it unfeasible to quantify their spatial impacts on regional scales this is especially the case for the plb where smaller reservoirs account for around 50 of the total capacity of all reservoirs recent research reported an improvement in the streamflow simulation over a sub basin of the plb by accounting for both large reservoirs and the spatial pattern of numerous smaller reservoirs dong et al 2019 that being said additional spatial information on smaller reservoirs would allow a better understanding of the role of a reservoir network within a basin under climate change to support decisions on the regional water resource management in the context of climate change this study first intends to identify the likely variation in the hydrological regime due to climate change over the plb with vulnerable areas highlighted on its basis this study further aims to investigate the effectiveness of the local reservoir network in reducing the impact of climate change on the runoff and floods to this end we use the future climate conditions from the bias corrected regional climate simulations of regcm4 which performs well according to analysis of chen et al 2014 gu et al 2018a and 2018b in addition the local high density reservoir network is integrated into the physically based hydrologic model system hms through a fully coupled reservoir network module three simulations are then conducted by applying the extended hms to one historical and two future climate conditions the methods and results of this study are expected to improve the understanding of the role of reservoirs under climate change and provide information on the regional water resources management 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the poyang lake basin plb is located in the middle of yangtze river basin with an area of 1 62 105 km2 wei et al 2015 2016 fig 1 the basin consists of five major sub basins with three in the north namely the xiu river basin xin river basin rao river basin and two in the south namely the gan river basin and fu river basin five hydrologic stations namely a waizhou b meigang c lijiadu d hushan and e wanjiabu are located in each of the above mentioned five rivers that drain into the lake the locations of eight cities with a population over 200 000 are also shown in fig 1 the basin is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with annual precipitation of 1622 mm the flood season lasts from april to june and the dry season lasts from october to december 2 2 reservoir data collection and estimation according to the database of the yangtze river water resources commission ywrc there are 25 large reservoirs with a capacity larger than 108 m3 and 234 medium reservoirs with a capacity between 107 m3 and 108 m3 in the plb the geophysical and geometrical information of these reservoirs such as location capacity mean annual runoff and control water levels were collected for reservoir modelling in addition there are over 10 300 small reservoirs with a capacity less than 107 m3 across the basin for hydropower irrigation and water supply as reported by the department of water resources of jiangxi province although the estimated combined capacity of small reservoirs is approximately 7 108 m3 there is generally no information available for most of the individual reservoirs such as mean annual runoff capacity and location to obtain the capacity and location of individual small reservoirs as much as possible the remote sensing images of the plb during the flood season were collected and processed to derive the location and the water surface area for 1114 small reservoirs that are fully visible in the image among them 177 are with known capacities to estimate the capacities of the other 937 visible small reservoirs firstly we assumed that for all small reservoirs the derived water surface area corresponds to their capacity given that the remote sensing images were captured in the flood season cao et al 2011 deitch et al 2013 the standard deviation of elevation sde across the basin was extracted from the srtm dem shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model to further include the effect of local terrain on the reservoir geometry then we fitted a multivariate relationship to the capacity area sde data points of the 177 small reservoirs with known capacities fig 2 the capacities of the other 937 visible small reservoirs were then estimated by applying the fitted relationship to each of them for an uncertainty analysis on the estimated capacities the kolmogorov smirnov test was performed cai et al 2019 the result indicates that the relative error between estimated and actual capacities follows the normal distribution with the mean of 1 0 and the standard deviation of 33 2 the 95 confidence interval of the relative error is from 64 1 to 66 1 indicating that the relative error can be relatively large in some cases see supporting information for more details although this is a rough estimation this method provides important data input for data scarce areas fig 3 depicts the spatial distribution of 25 large reservoirs 234 medium reservoirs and 1114 small reservoirs with either collected or estimated capacities in the plb for the remaining smaller reservoirs with literally no information the remaining total capacity of small reservoirs are allocated to cropland and surrounding upstream grid cells then it is assumed that for each of these grid cells there exists a reservoir with a capacity allocated to it this was justified by the fact that most small dams are located on or near the cropland in the plb grid cells with larger sde are allocated with a larger capacity given that there is a positive correlation between capacity and sde for a given reservoir water area fig 2 the storage area correlation is also required to estimate the reservoir seepage surface precipitation and evaporation in this study the inverted triangle storage area correlation is used i e v a a 1 5 where v a and a are storage surface area and shape coefficient respectively liebe et al 2005 van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2016 here the shape coefficient a for small reservoirs is calculated from the above fitted capacity area relationship for large and medium reservoirs the coefficient is calculated in a similar way given that all of them are also visible in the remote sensing images 2 3 hydrologic model and reservoir module the distributed hydrological model system hms is employed in this study to carry out the analysis the model is physically based and is two way coupled to the land surface scheme lsx of genesis yu et al 1999 2006 the lsx calculates runoff generation recharge soil moisture content and other hydrologic components vertically over the domain while the hms can derive the lateral movement of surface and subsurface water using hydrodynamic equations the model is able to represent multiple hydrologic processes in addition to the streamflow such as runoff generation and groundwater movement as reported by previous research yang et al 2010 2012 wagner et al 2016 the hydrological impact of the local reservoir network is quantified through a fully coupled reservoir module the module was developed based on our previous research which allows the regulated streamflow reservoir seepage and variation of the surface area to interact with flow routing groundwater motion runoff generation and multiple other hydrological processes in the coupled model which in turn gives feedback to the reservoir operation lv et al 2016 dong et al 2019 all of the large and medium reservoirs along with small reservoirs identified above are directly integrated into grid cells at their actual locations a major problem faced by reservoir modelling at large scales is that a reservoir can be erroneously integrated into a grid cell with considerably larger or smaller runoff because the precise river network is often not available on a regional scale especially for small reservoirs shin et al 2019 to avoid this problem we compare the simulated mean annual runoff of a likely grid cell with that collected for large and medium reservoirs and adjust their locations if there is a considerable discrepancy on the other hand the inflow of small reservoirs with no runoff information is simply estimated by assuming that the ratio of capacity to mean annual runoff of a small reservoir is the same as the average of nearby medium reservoirs a generalized conceptual release scheme is employed to determine the release of reservoirs of multiple sizes it was originally developed and tested only for large reservoirs by zhao et al 2016 and was further modified and tested for macroscale research in our previous study dong et al 2019 the scheme first divides the capacity of a reservoir into several storages or pools according to a few control water levels and assigns the reservoir with a specific objective e g flood control water supply when the storage exceeds a certain critical level the storage of reservoirs is then updated for each time step using the water balance equation where the reservoir inflow outflow seepage surface precipitation and evaporation are all included 2 4 experimental design to evaluate the impact of climate change and reservoir operation on the basin hydrology we conduct three simulations a baseline b future natural and c future regulated the baseline simulation depicts the natural flow regime for the period of 1970 1984 which is performed with the reservoir disabled hms to drive the model historical daily temperature and precipitation are obtained from a 0 5 degree gridded dataset published by the national meteorological center of china other meteorological forcing such as air pressure relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation are obtained from the ncep ncar reanalysis data yang 2009 the soil data is from the harmonized world soil database land use data from the avhrr data and digital elevation data from the hydro1k dem from the usgs and unep grid these static data are all available at a spatial resolution of 10 km yang 2009 dong et al 2019 which is the model resolution in this study the meteorological forcing was therefore bilinearly interpolated to the model grid points the future natural and future regulated scenarios represent the natural and reservoir regulated flow regime for the period of 2035 2049 respectively the regional climate projections here the projected precipitation and temperature are derived and selected from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment in east asia cordex ea which aims to provide climate projections using regional climate models at a spatial resolution of around 50 km details on the cordex ea can be found in park et al 2016 and gu et al 2018a the selected regional climate projections are analyzed in comparison with the historical observation and are then used to drive the reservoir disabled hms future natural and the reservoir enabled hms future regulated in order to analyze the impact of climate change and the mitigation role of reservoirs respectively 2 5 selection of regional climate projections in this study the selection of regional climate projections from the ongoing cordex ea is based on their performance over the plb to begin with the hadgem2 ao general circulation model gcm is employed here to provide the initial and boundary conditions for all regional climate models rcms because multiple studies have reported its advantage over many other gcms in simulating the precipitation of china for example chen et al 2014 noted that hadgem2 ao has relatively good performance in simulating the temporal and spatial pattern of precipitation among 43 gcms similar results are also noted by gu et al 2015 and 2018b in a comparative study among 27 gcms the performance of five rcms namely regcm4 wrf mm5 rsm and hadgem3 ra driven by hadgem2 ao was assessed in our previous studies gu et al 2018a b and is briefly illustrated in the supporting information the output of all rcms is available at a spatial resolution of 50 km except that hadgem3 ao is at a resolution of 0 44 the results indicated that regcm4 generally outperforms the other four rcms and the ensemble mean over the plb in terms of the spatiotemporal bias and error of the precipitation see fig s1 in supporting information accordingly the dynamically downscaled regcm4 simulations is used in this study to drive the hms modelling system over the plb under future scenarios two typical representative concentration pathways scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are considered to account for the intermediate and high emissions although rcms employ sophisticated physical parameterizations to represent detailed processes in the land atmosphere continuum they cannot resolve all of the relevant processes with a sufficient accuracy maraun et al 2017 this limitation produces systematic bias and justifies the use of bias correction laux et al 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012 mao et al 2015 dang et al 2018 in this aspect the histogram equalization method is chosen in this study this method is a widely used statistical approach in which a transfer function tf is derived such that the frequency histogram of the corrected variable can match the frequency histogram of the observed one piani et al 2010 ngo et al 2018 we employ the observed precipitation for 1961 2005 to derive the tf and then to correct the precipitation simulated by regcm4 for 2035 2049 in terms of the maximum minimum and mean daily temperature large error may arise if the histogram equalization method is used thrasher et al 2012 therefore the temperature is corrected by a linear scaling method in this study gu et al 2018b 2 6 quantifying the role of reservoirs in flood mitigation to assess the effectiveness of reservoirs in mitigating the impact of climate change on the flood conditions the annual maximum flood amf and the peak over threshold approach pot are employed to calculate the flood magnitude and flood frequency for the three scenarios the amf uses the annual maximum daily discharge averaged over the study period to quantify the magnitude of floods for spatially averaged analysis the normalized annual maximum flood amf divided by mean annual runoff is employed to determine if a larger or smaller portion of streamflow is likely to become floods on the other hand the amf may not cover all of the considerable flood events for example the amf in dry years can be too small to be included in floods of interest whereas there can be several flood peaks in wet years which are large enough to raise concerns wang et al 2017 the peak over threshold pot approach overcomes this limitation by selecting flood events exceeding a discharge threshold that corresponds to two events per year averaged over the study period the threshold value is determined first for the baseline and then applied to the future scenarios to extract floods for the 2035 2049 in this study to avoid counting the same flood event twice only one event is allowed within a 15 day sliding window mallakpour and villarini 2015 by doing so the future frequency of considerably large floods relative to the baseline period can be calculated 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the hms model without reservoirs is calibrated for 1961 1972 and validated for 1973 1984 the calibration and validation period were selected because of the natural hydrological regime without much disturbance from human activities before 1980s the five hydrologic stations located on the five major rivers in the plb are used for calibration and validation fig 1 six parameters of the hms model can be calibrated namely manning s roughness streambed conductivity porosity aquifer thickness wilting point and hydraulic conductivity among them manning s roughness and streambed conductivity were selected for calibration in this study because they are the only sensitive parameters as indicated by the sensitivity analysis in our previous research dong et al 2019 in all 10 000 parameter sets were generated from the latin hypercube sampling with 2000 for each station each of them was input into the model for simulation and the parameter set with which the hms simulation has the highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for each station was selected as the optimal parameter values more details on the sampled range of each parameter and the sensitivity analysis can be found in dong et al 2019 the results of calibration and validation are presented in fig 4 in the form of relative bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse moriasi et al 2007 1 pbias i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 2 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the number of timestep s i and o i are the simulated and observed streamflow at the ith timestep respectively and o is the averaged observed streamflow in general the model exhibits a good ability to reproduce the streamflow in different locations with the nse value larger than 0 85 for all stations over both the calibration and validation period for hushan station the model shows similarly good performance in the validation period nse 0 94 and calibration period nse 0 93 slightly higher nse in the validation period can also be found in many other studies for example in wagner et al 2016 ngo et al 2018 hoang et al 2019 and liu et al 2019 3 2 projections of precipitation and temperature the projected precipitation and temperature for the period of 2035 2049 as compared to the baseline 1970 1984 are presented in figs 5 and 6 on average the future annual precipitation increases by 0 59 mm day and 0 68 mm day under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively and the future temperature rises by 1 8 c and 2 1 c under rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the spatially averaged precipitation increases in most of the months under both rcps except for july october and december for rcp4 5 and june and october for rcp8 5 the precipitation increases by 1 17 mm day under rcp4 5 and by 0 77 mm day under rcp8 5 in the flood season whereas it decreases by 0 25 mm day under rcp4 5 and increases slightly by 0 08 mm day under rcp8 5 in the dry season for temperature the spatially averaged value rises by 2 28 c and 2 42 c in the dry season and by 1 45 c and 1 50 c in the flood season under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in general with the increase in the emission of greenhouse gases the annual precipitation and temperature is projected with a larger increase fig 6 depicts the spatial pattern of variations in the precipitation and temperature it shows that the precipitation increases for almost the entire basin such increase in the precipitation generally concentrates in the northern area i e xiu river basin xin river basin rao river basin and becomes less pronounced to the south under both rcps notably the upper gan river basin and upper fu river basin see a relatively minor increase in the precipitation as compared to other areas similarly higher temperature is projected across the entire plb with a more notable rise in the north under both rcps 3 3 runoff under climate change and reservoir operation fig 7 depicts the spatially averaged monthly and annual runoff under the baseline future natural and future regulated scenarios due to the increase in the annual precipitation the basin averaged annual runoff increases by 15 9 and 22 6 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and slightly decreases under the impact of reservoir operation the spatially averaged monthly runoff generally increases in most months under the impact of climate change except for june july november and december for rcp4 5 and june july and october for rcp8 5 in particular the spatially averaged runoff increases most significantly from march to may due to climate change with the peak monthly flow correspondingly shifting two months earlier from june to april taking rcp4 5 as an example climate change increases the runoff by 21 4 m3 s 14 1 in the flood season but decreases the runoff by 1 7 m3 s 6 3 in the dry season similarly climate change increases the spatially averaged runoff from 171 9 m3 s to 199 3 m3 s for the wettest month and reduces the runoff from 25 3 m3 s to 20 1 m3 s for the driest month the conditions are similar for rcp8 5 except that climate change generally induces no significant variation of the runoff in the dry season compared to the baseline the local reservoirs can effectively mitigate the climate impact by decreasing the runoff by 6 8 m3 s 3 9 in the flood season and increasing the runoff by 7 8 m3 s 31 2 in the dry season the operation of reservoirs combined with climate change eventually results in a 14 6 m3 s 9 6 increase of the natural runoff in the flood season and a 6 1 m3 s 22 6 increase in the dry season under rcp4 5 the reservoir operation also reduces the runoff by 13 5 m3 s to 185 8 m3 s for the wettest month and increases the runoff by 8 1 m3 s to 28 2 m3 s for the driest month a similar case is also found for rcp8 5 by combining the effect of reservoirs and climate change the averaged runoff eventually increases by 22 7 m3 s 14 9 in the flood season and by 8 0 m3 s 29 6 in the dry season fig 8 depicts the spatial pattern of the relative change in the runoff for the future natural and future regulated scenarios under both rcps as compared to the baseline the climate induced variation in the annual runoff generally follows that of the annual precipitation with a larger increase in the xiu river basin xin river basin and rao river basin and a smaller increase in the upper gan river basin and upper fu river basin as compared to the baseline fig 8a and d the reservoirs basically induce minor changes in the annual runoff for the flood season fig 8b and e most of the basin is expected to experience a larger amount of runoff under both rcps especially in the xiu river basin rao river basin and lower gan river basin by further taking account of reservoirs under rcp4 5 slightly decreased runoff can be observed in several locations as compared to the baseline although the runoff still increases by 0 40 in most of the plb and even up to 100 in the upper xiu river basin in terms of the rcp8 5 the increased runoff can be observed for most of the plb despite the operation of reservoirs for the dry season fig 8c and f results indicate that climate change can decrease the runoff by up to 40 in the fu river basin and gan river basin under rcp4 5 and the decreased runoff cannot be fully reversed by reservoirs for much of these areas for rcp8 5 it is noted that the decreased runoff occurs mostly in the upper gan river basin and can be generally offset by reservoirs on the other hand most of the xin river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin in the north are expected to see increased runoff under both rcps reservoirs can further increase the runoff in these areas where the runoff is expected to increase by up to 100 under the joint impact of climate change and reservoir operation 3 4 floods under climate change and reservoir operation fig 9 depicts the spatially averaged annual maximum flood and flood frequency under the baseline future natural and future regulated scenarios in general climate change is expected to induce a larger flood magnitude and frequency at the basin level for example the annual maximum flood is 508 m3 s 685 m3 s and 669 m3 s under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the normalized amf is 11 8 14 3 and 13 6 under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively and climate change induces a relatively large interannual variability in the future although the basin averaged flood magnitude is larger under rcp4 5 than under rcp8 5 the floods occur more frequently under rcp8 5 than rcp4 5 as indicated by the pot analysis the flood frequency is 1 40 under rcp4 5 and 1 72 under rcp8 5 as compared to a baseline value of 1 0 the reservoir network can partially mitigate the climate impact by reducing the amf by 11 2 to 608 m3 s under rcp4 5 and by 13 3 to 580 m3 s under rcp8 5 which are nevertheless higher than those under the baseline similarly the normalized amf is reduced to 13 3 under rcp4 5 and 12 5 under rcp 8 5 and the flood frequency is reduced by 16 4 to 1 17 under rcp4 5 and by 15 7 to 1 45 under rcp8 5 despite that they are both higher than those of the baseline as well fig 10 depicts the spatial pattern of the relative change in the flood magnitude and flood frequency for the future natural and future regulated scenarios under both rcps as compared to the baseline due to the climate change the amf significantly increases by up to 100 for the xiu river basin and rao river basin while the rest of the plb also see a relatively minor increase fig 10a and c by taking account of reservoirs the amf for most of the upper gan river basin fu river basin and xin river basin can be reduced to that under the baseline whereas the amf for most of the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin is still much larger than the baseline the flood frequency also increases in most of the plb under the climate impact except for the upper gan river basin where the flood frequency considerably decreases under both rcps fig 10b and d by taking account of the effect of reservoirs the flood frequency can decrease by up to 30 for much of the upper gan river basin and fu river basin as compared to the baseline especially under rcp4 5 however an increased flood frequency can be expected in most of the lower gan river basin xiu river basin xin river basin and rao river basin under both rcps despite the mitigation by reservoirs 4 discussion the previous section quantitatively depicted the hydrological impact induced by climate change and the ability of reservoirs to mitigate this impact in general a larger amount of precipitation and higher temperature are projected across the plb for the period of 2035 2049 as compared to the baseline of 1970 1984 and the increase in both variables occurs most notably in the northern area of the basin this is in line with multiple recent studies covering the climate change in east asia and china gu et al 2015 2018a b yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 our findings also reveal the role of a high density reservoir network in mitigating the climate impact the local reservoir network can spatiotemporally redistribute the water by increasing the runoff in the dry season and decreasing the runoff in the flood season and can effectively mitigate the flood magnitude and frequency which was also observed for multiple basins wang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 ngo et al 2018 to be specific the average runoff in the dry season is more effectively regulated by local reservoirs with a relative increase of around 30 while the average runoff in the flood season is relatively less affected by the reservoir operation with a relative change less than 5 the flood magnitude is more effectively reduced by reservoirs with a relative decrease of 15 16 while the flood frequency sees a relative decrease of 11 13 at the basin level a slight decrease in the annual runoff is also induced by reservoirs which is a likely result of reservoir seepage and evaporation lu et al 2018 dong et al 2019 4 1 mitigating effect of reservoirs with respect to runoff in the wake of the increased precipitation in the future the water resources of the plb are expected to increase across the basin especially in the northern part of the basin this indicates the poyang lake will receive more water in the future leading to variations in the lakeshore geometry from the perspective of reservoir operation the larger annual runoff is indicative of a weakened ability of reservoirs to regulate flows as compared to what they were designed for due to the decrease in the reservoir capacity relative to the mean annual runoff or the degree of regulation grill et al 2014 the water resources in the plb are expected to increase in the flood season but is likely to decline in the dry season under the impact of climate change the larger variance between the water availability in the flood season and dry season can lead to a higher competition to meet different water demands in the future ehsani et al 2017 combined with the decreased degree of regulation as noted earlier this can pose new challenges for stakeholders to make a trade off between water requirements of multiple sectors and call on multi sectoral integrated water resources management in the basin this also suggests that more storage capacities may be required in the future to maintain the designed status of water service given their ability to temporally redistribute the water resources as indicated in the results while the local reservoirs can mitigate the climate impact by storing the additional runoff in the flood season our findings indicate that they cannot fully mitigate the increased runoff especially for the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin for the dry season we found that the local reservoirs can reverse the decreasing trend of water resources at the basin level by releasing more water in the dry season for hydropower irrigation and water supply however our spatial analysis suggests that the climate induced decrease cannot be completely mitigated by reservoirs alone for the gan river basin and fu river basin under rcp4 5 this implies that there can be more severe droughts and water shortage in these areas despite the reservoir operation local water dependent industries such as fishery may also be affected lauri et al 2012 some negative ecological consequences are also expected given the low flow is a fundamental constraint on the aquatic communities and has a notable impact on the number and diversity of organism that can survive hu et al 2008 lu et al 2018 csl style error reference with no printed form accordingly precautious measures may need to be taken to deal with the likely risk of water shortage and ecological consequences in water scarce months for those vulnerable areas identified above for example our findings indicate that construction of new reservoirs can be an effective adaptation option as they can dramatically increase the low flow at the basin level 4 2 mitigating effect of reservoirs with respect to floods the increase in the flood magnitude and flood frequency under both rcps implies larger and more frequent flood events or simply a higher flood risk as a result of climate change although the reservoirs can compensate for much of the increase in these variables by reducing the discharge and number of the flood peaks our findings indicate that their values cannot be reduced to the baseline level this result implies that flood control will potentially be a major concern in the future water resources planning and management of the plb accordingly adaptation measures need to be taken to mitigate the higher flood risk induced by climate change across the entire basin such as the development and application of flood warning system and construction of flood control reservoirs and embankments to save unnecessary efforts and investments particular attention should be paid to the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin especially the major cities located within them because these areas are found rather vulnerable to the climate change in terms of intensified floods and should be treated with particular care this is based on our spatial analysis which reveals that these areas are expected to see an increased flood magnitude and frequency despite the mitigation by reservoirs indicating the local reservoir network is not able to completely compensate for the climate intensified floods in these areas from another point of view according to the climate projections considered in this study reservoirs in these areas will experience floods with a larger magnitude and frequency in the future compared with those they were designed for in the past thereby leading to a greater risk of dam breach and overtopping mallakpour et al 2019 this will require more frequent examinations on the dam status in the future it should also be noted that the increased flood magnitude and frequency in these areas can reshape the physical and biological features of rivers and floodplains and induce variations in the ecosystem for example severe floods can wash away many organisms thereby eliminating some species but also bringing about opportunities for some other species by creating habitats such as the floodplain wetland the nature conservancy 2009 4 3 limitations of this study this study draws attention to the possible impact of climate change across the basin and the role of a high density reservoir network in mitigating the climate impact however the results presented in this study are subject to a few uncertainties that need to be clarified the major uncertainty comes from the reliability of projected climate data although the selection of regcm4 driven by hadgm2 ao in this study have exhibited relatively good performance over the plb as indicated in previous research we acknowledge that the use of multi model ensemble may be able to better address the uncertainty related to the climate projection on the other hand there is relatively limited uncertainty related to the climate projection over the plb as the ensemble mean of 27 gcms and the ensemble mean of 5 rcms both project increased precipitation especially in the northern area and in the flood season increased temperature especially in the northern basin and in the winter and intensified floods with shorter return periods gu et al 2018a b yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 this consistency of climate projections for the plb among different climate models gives us confidence in the robustness of the results presented in this study in addition to the uncertainty of climate models the uncertainty related to the bias correction methods should also be noted while the bias correction is considered a well established procedure for regional climate studies teutschbein and seibert 2010 2012 some have argued that the use of bias correction can add to the uncertainty of the climate model output ehret et al 2012 maraun et al 2017 however original rcm output nevertheless has substantial bias and is likely inadequate to drive hydrological analysis that requires a high standard of fidelity for hydrological simulation performance smiatek and kunstmann 2019 accordingly we are fully convinced that bias correction is necessary in this study the lack of actual reservoir operation rules also adds to the uncertainty of the results while the implementation of conceptual generalized operation rules in this study is straightforward with relatively little data requirements hanasaki et al 2006 voisin et al 2013 they are not a perfectly accurate reflection of the reality to overcome this issue recent studies have used machine learning to reconstruct reservoir operation rules for example coerver et al 2018 established artificial neural network ann based reservoir operation rules from the reservoir inflow outflow and storage data which achieved good results in simulating the operation of reservoirs in addition the lack of details on numerous small reservoirs such as actual capacities and mean annual runoff is considered as another source of uncertainty this is a frequent problem faced by global and regional scale research because many of the small reservoirs are not well documented by local agencies and for those with details on file researchers can hardly gain access to the detailed information although our proposed method to estimate the information on small reservoirs provides a rough estimation the use of high resolution satellite products may be able to more accurately derive the information on small reservoirs for example busker et al 2019 used satellite altimetry to estimate the reservoir volume in data sparse areas which is in good agreement with the observations it should also be noted that both the machine learning and satellite altimetry methods are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of data which is a challenge especially for small reservoirs nevertheless the development and application of these techniques are promising future research directions and are expected to enhance the data availability eventually leading to more accuracy in reservoir simulations 5 conclusions this study aims to identify areas which are prone to the climate induced hydrological variation and to investigate the effectiveness of reservoirs to mitigate the impact of climate change in the poyang lake basin china with the use of remote sensing and terrain features the local reservoir network was first integrated into a physically based hydrological model hms through a fully coupled reservoir network module then the extended hms simulations were conducted by using the historical climate datasets from observations and the regcm4 climate projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as compared to the 1970s the poyang lake basin is projected to see more precipitation and higher temperature by 2040s especially in the northern area of the basin with an increase of the annual water resources in the future due to larger precipitation the water resources are expected to increase in the flood season but are likely to decrease in the dry season this increased seasonal variability can strengthen the competition among multiple water demands and calls on adaptive water resources management in the future climate change also induces flood events with larger magnitude and frequency this combined with a wetter flood season increases the flood risks across the basin although the local reservoir network can store additional water resources and mitigate the floods in the flood season it cannot fully offset the impact of climate change especially in the northern basin i e the lower gan river basin xiu river basin and rao river basin these areas may require flood adaptation measures to guarantee the safety of dams riverside settlements and major cities on the other hand the climate induced decreased water resources in the dry season can lead to a higher risk of droughts and water shortage at the basin level with the displacement of excessive water resources in the flood season to the dry season by reservoirs the decreasing trend of water availability can be reversed at the basin level however the southern basin i e the gan river basin and fu river basin are nevertheless likely to see decreased water availability in water scarce months these areas may therefore require precautious measures to combat the likely risk of water shortage and negative ecological consequences for example construction of new local reservoirs these results are expected to provide instructive implications for future water resources management not only in this area but also in other basins along the middle of yangtze river given that these basins are characterized by a similar precipitation pattern and a similar development level to the plb more importantly our newly developed extended hms modelling system is generally enough to identify the vulnerable areas of basins due to climate change and to quantify the mitigation role of reservoirs which can be used to provide information for integrated water resources management in different

6016,this study demonstrated the spatiotemporal variation in runoff generating areas in grassed and agro forested hillslopes of lesser himalaya using soil moisture soil hydraulic conductivity and rainfall datasets nine rainfall events of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes were analysed and found that only high intensity rainfall events were able to convert 1 5 of runoff at the outlet the extremely low patch of soil hydraulic conductivity 5 mm h was located at the outlet in agro forested hillslope whereas similar low soil hydraulic conductivity patch is located at the end portion in a grassed hillslope therefore the grassed hillslope generated less runoff than the agro forested hillslope due to its surface resistance and heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity the runoff generated from the upper part of hillslope re infiltrated into the middle part due to higher soil hydraulic conductivity during low and medium intensity rainfall conditions major runoff contribution was observed from low conductivity zones of the hillslope moreover we analysed the correlation of spatial variation in soil moisture with topographic wetness index twi and soil hydraulic conductivity in two different landuse conditions to examine the predictive potential of these attributes during the wet and dry season the optimal formulation of twi was obtained from 72 different combinations using linear mixed effects modelling the correlation between optimal twi formulation and soil moisture was found to be negative as the main streamline is located near low conductivity zones furthermore the correlation between twi and soil moisture is stronger in the dry season than the wet season in comparison to grass cover hillslope agro forested landuse system shows better negative correlation between soil moisture and twi during the wet season as the agro forested hillslope produced more runoff than the grassed hillslope the correlation strength of soil hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture was strongest after mid of the wet season which is directly correlated to the moisture content of hillslopes keywords lesser himalayan hillslopes hydrological connectivity soil moisture variability mixed effects modelling topographic wetness index twi data scarce region 1 introduction soil moisture significantly impacts ecological i e species type and nutrient characteristics and hydrological i e runoff and drought landscape processes foremost among these impacts is the role that soil moisture plays in connecting hillslopes to streams the mechanisms by which hydrologic connectivity occurs varies with terrain and climate a comprehensive understanding of hydrologic connectivity its impact on ecohydrological functions and the implications for efficient watershed scale management therefore relies on a body of knowledge generated from studies in a broad range of hydrologic settings many studies have been carried out to understand the connection between runoff generation and soil moisture patterns in saturation excess dominated regions bracken et al 2013 but very few studies have explained the same correlation in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes or at watershed scales in this study we investigate hydrologic connectivity of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes of the lesser himalaya hydrological connectivity occurs when water moves from one point to another point on a hillslope causing runoff bracken and croke 2007 sen et al 2010 and depends on the spatial variability of soil water content wilson et al 2016 mcnamara et al 2005 and micro topographic conditions i e slope and vegetation of hillslopes ali and roy 2009 the existence of hydrological connectivity however is transient for example mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 stated that hillslopes were not connected to the streams at early stages of a rain event but runoff will generate after satisfying the infiltration capacities of the hillslope on longer hillslopes the chance of re infiltration disturbs the hydrological connectivity this re infiltration process is driven by soil infiltration capacity and topographic conditions although hydrologic connectivity is most commonly associated with landscapes that generate runoff by saturation excess both the infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanisms are driven by saturation one from the top and another from the bottom respectively mcdonnell 2013 when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil the infiltration excess runoff takes place horton 1933 sen et al 2008 when groundwater reaches the ground surface saturation excess runoff occurs sarkar et al 2015 conducted the plot scale runoff experiments under artificial rainfall conditions using sheet flow generator and also in natural circumstances to understand the runoff generation processes in wet sub tropics nanda et al 2018 studied the dominant runoff generation processes at plot and hillslope scale under artificial and natural rainfall conditions respectively and found infiltration excess as the dominant runoff process moreover they observed that initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall intensity have a significant impact on runoff hydrograph but prediction of soil moisture is a complex phenomenon and need lots of input data to set up a hydrologic modelling framework buchanan et al 2014 in this scenario topographic indices are an easier and simpler way to predict finer resolution soil moisture over the landscape but famiglietti et al 1998 mentioned that the strength of the correlation of any soil or topographic indices with soil moisture varies seasonally so one predictive index is not enough for predicting soil moisture during both dry and wet season in the present study we analyse the soil moisture correlation with both topographic index i e topographic wetness index twi and soil attribute i e soil hydraulic conductivity spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity influences the hillslope runoff processes and spatial variation in soil moisture sen et al 2010 the topographic controls on soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity are commonly related to the topographic wetness index twi as proposed by beven and kirkby 1979 the twi is related to contributing drainage area and slope that predicts a landscapes susceptibility to saturation numerous studies have demonstrated that soil moisture and the twi are correlated depending on climate vegetation cover and geology buchanan et al 2014 tague et al 2010 western et al 2004 although the twi was developed for catchment dominated by saturation excess it is reasonable to assume that the twi is related to hydrologic processes in infiltration excess catchments as well few studies however have investigated the use of twi as a predictor of hydrologic processes in catchments where infiltration excess is dominant minet et al 2011 interestingly the correlation may be positive or negative depending on the runoff generating areas of infiltration excess dominated systems minet et al 2011 usage of topographic input in modelling of soil moisture is an effective approach to estimate the hillslope hydrologic behaviour bronstert and bárdossy 1999 because of the strong relationship between twi and soil moisture ali and roy 2009 suggested a fine resolution digital elevation model dem for accurate interpretation of terrain conditions however the quality of topographic information extracted from dems depends not only on the quality of the dem but on the algorithms used to analyse the dem for example the upslope area draining to a point in a watershed has been computed using various algorithms bauer et al 1985 fairfield leymarie 1991 freeman 1991 lea 1992 moore et al 1991 o callaghan mark 1984 seibert mcglynn 2007 tarboton 1997 qin et al 2011 the slope can also be computed in many ways as well resulting in scores of different ways to compute the twi there is considerable potential therefore that the choice of algorithms for computing the twi could bias observed relationships between twi soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity in this study we implemented a method to optimize the twi calculation using mixed effects modelling many studies on flow process connectivity buda et al 2009 gomi et al 2008 sen et al 2010 smith et al 2010 and soil moisture connectivity ali roy 2009 james roulet 2007 western et al 1998 have been carried out in different locations of world but no study has been witnessed in the indian himalayan region ihr except the one from the current research group nanda et al 2018 more importantly infiltration excess dominated hillslopes have received little attention the present study elucidates new insight to identify the hillslope hydrological connectivity in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes using high resolution soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity data during natural rainfall condition seasonal soil moisture variability has a strong influence on runoff processes and hydrological connectivity thus the role of soil moisture variability on hydrological connectivity and runoff generation processes are studied in the first part of this paper and then we go for correlation of soil moisture variability with topographic and soil attributes especially in limited data availability conditions prediction of soil moisture in both dry and wet seasons is challenging considering the discussions above the present study addresses the following questions i does hydrological connectivity of lesser himalayan hillslopes explain the runoff generating and runoff absorbing areas under two different landuse conditions ii is the topographic wetness index twi able to describe the soil moisture variability of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes and iii does the correlation between soil hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture explain the hillslope scale soil moisture variability temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture and hillslope runoff were monitored to understand the hydrological connectivity and spatial correlation of soil moisture with topography different combinations of flow direction and slope algorithms were used in the mixed modelling approach to formulate optimal twi combination for predicting the soil moisture during wet and dry season 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area two lesser himalayan hillslopes were chosen for hydrological monitoring in the tehri garhwal region of india the hillslopes are located at north and south aspect of aglar watershed fig 1 a the average annual rainfall of aglar watershed is 1200 mm the maximum portion of rainfall i e 2000 mm to 2100 mm occurs during the monsoon season june to september the winter minimum temperature goes down to 5 c however the summer temperature rises to 40 c the highest altitude of watershed is dominated by deodar cedrus deodar trees followed by oak and pine trees pant and roy 1990 due to more solar radiation the south aspect of the watershed has degraded land cover features having gravely soil structure and shallow soil depth in comparison to the north aspect saha and singh 1991 nanda et al 2018 thus the south aspect of watershed is dominated with plants from the cactaceae family and native grasses whereas the north aspect of watershed is majorly dominated with agricultural lands and forests in this study the selected south aspect hillslope is mainly covered by native grasses ga whereas north aspect hillslope is dominated by a mixture of fallow and forest land agf bhimal grewia optiva semal bombax ceiba hisalu rubus ellipticus sm tree species are found in agf hillslope bhimal is a multipurpose agro forestry tree majorily used for wood fuel and fodder semal is a medicinal tree which is useful for skin care and healing wounds hisalu is a wild fruit also known as yellow himalayan raspberry 2 2 hydrologic measurements hillslopes were instrumented with 10 soil moisture sensors 5 decagon and 5 odyssey at a depth of 15 20 cm to capture the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture fig 1b decagon meter environment usa sensor measures the dielectric constant of the soil to estimate volumetric water content in this study the em50 logger along with 5tm decagon sensor was used to record both soil temperature and moisture simulataneously similarly odyssey dataflow systems ltd new zealand sensor also works on dielectric constant of the soils to record the soil moisture field and lab calibration was performed for odyssey and decagon soil moisture sensors respectively moreover hs flume with odyssey water level sensor has been used in both the sites to record the hillslope runoff depth at the outlet soil moisture and runoff data were recorded at 5 min temporal resolution rainwise tipping bucket raingauges rainwise inc usa were used to record rainfall data the data collection started in the 2017 monsoon i e june 2017 hillslopes are surveyed with real time kinematic rtk global positioning system gps to understand the detailed topography of hillslopes the observed data were used to create the 0 5 m resolution digital elevation model dem of hillslopes the elevation variation of ga hillslope was ranged between 1267 m and 1270 m whereas for agf hillslope the elevation was within the range of 1142 m to 1147 m the mean slope gradient of ga and agf hillslope was 14 4 and 20 7 respectively 2 3 selection of rain events the events were chosen on the basis of rainfall characteristics and data availability the agro forested agf hillslope and grassed ga hillslope have received 1018 mm and 963 mm of rainfall in monsoon 2017 the five minute rainfall peak varies between 12 mm h to 103 mm h for agf hillslope and 36 mm h to 109 mm h for ga hillslope six rainfall events from agf hillslope table 1 and four rainfall event from ga hillslope were selected for understanding hydrological connectivity table 2 2 4 derivation of hillslope hydrological connectivity hillslope connectivity was assessed using the soil hydraulic conductivity soil moisture runoff and rainfall data at primary level high medium and low hydraulic conductivity zones were identified to verify the spatial variation in hillslope infiltration patterns we used a basic assumption i e high soil moisture rise represents high infiltration and less runoff to identify whether the contributing area of a particular soil moisture sensor generates runoff or not further the spread network of soil moisture sensors was used to identify the runoff absorbing and runoff generating areas of each hillslope 2 5 determining soil hydraulic conductivity soil hydraulic conductivity has a significant impact on the hydrological characterises of hillslopes in situ infiltration experiments were conducted at 4 4 m grid along the hillslopes using compact size decagon mini disk infiltrometer to estimate hydraulic conductivity more details about the mini disk infiltrometer is available at decagon web manual decagon devices inc pullman wa the volume of water infiltrated was recorded at a constant time lag at each sampling point zhang method 1997 was used to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 1 i c 1 t c 2 t c1 cm s 1 and c2 cm s 1 2 stands for hydraulic conductivity and soil sorptivity parameters respectively and i cm and t sec represents cumulative infiltration and time respectively c1 is the slope gradient of plot which has a value between cumulative infiltration and square root of time hydraulic conductivity can be calculated as follows 2 k c 1 a value of a is a function of van genuchten parameters which can be calculated as 3 a 11 65 n 0 1 1 e x p 2 92 n 1 9 α h o α r o 0 91 n 1 9 11 65 n 0 1 1 e x p 7 5 n 1 9 α h o α r o 0 91 n 1 9 where n and α are van genuchten components h o is the suction head and r o is the mini disk radius in the present study n and α values are taken as 1 89 and 0 075 cm 1 respectively inverse distance weighted idw technique was used to develop spatial soil hydraulic conductivity maps fig 2 the variation in hydraulic conductivity was within the 2 mm h to 23 mm h for agf hillslope and 2 mm h to 34 mm h for ga hillslope areas near to the outlets have low value of hydraulic conductivity whereas middle portions of hillslopes have higher values fig 2 the percentage of area covered under each hydraulic conductivity group is presented in table 3 for both hillslope the results of hydraulic conductivity experiments are used to derive the high medium and low conductivity zones which will be useful to study the hydrological connectivity of hillslopes further we have analysed the correlation between soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity 2 6 topographic wetness index twi estimation this study addresses the link between soil moisture distribution and topographic wetness index twi the estimation of twi depends on the selection of flow accumulation algorithm and slope algorithm twi can be stated as beven kirkby 1979 4 twi l n u t a n β the notation αu represents upslope contributing area per unit contour length and β is the slope term m m one of the aims of this study is to analyse the influence of different flow accumulation algorithms and slope algorithms on the correlation between twi and volumetric water content vwc of soil nine different methods of flow accumulation algorithm and four different slope calculation methods were selected to construct 72 combinations of twi further linear mixed effect modelling was used to find best twi formulation 2 7 slope calculation method four slope calculation methods namely i maximum triangle slope mts tarboton 1997 ii least square fitted plane lsfp horn 1981 iii second degree polynomial sdp zevenbergen thorne 1987 iv downslope index hjerdt et al 2004 were used in this study since the first three methods only consider the targeted grid and its neighbourhood these can be termed as local slope methods the downslope index dsi estimates the hydraulic gradient by determining the hillslope length ld that water must move to lose a certain amount of potential energy d hjerdt et al 2004 the slope calculated using dsi method is more reasonable than other local methods because it allows downslope controls on local soil moisture conditions dsi is sensitive to the selection of d thus in the present study we have chosen 5 different values of d i e 5 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 1 m total eight slope types were used to estimate different combination of twi all slope analyses were conducted in open source saga gis system for automated geoscientific analyses saga gis was developed by the research team of j böhner and o conrad the saga gis development centre is located at institute of geography university of hamburg germany olaya 2004 the latest version of saga gis saga 6 3 0 is used in our study 2 8 flow accumulation algorithm the upslope contributing area can be calculated by different flow direction algorithms existing flow direction algorithms can be broadly classified as majorly as single flow direction sfd and multiple flow direction mfd approaches as their name implies sfd and mfd direct all flow to single downslope cell and multiple downslope cells respectively this study uses four sfd algorithms including i kinematic routing algorithm kra lea 1992 ii d8 o callaghan mark 1984 iii digital elevation model networks demon

multiple triangular flow direction md seibert mcglynn 2007 ix multiple flow direction based on maximum downslope gradient mmdg qin et al 2011 with different slope calculations described above to estimate twi all flow accumulation analyses were carried out in saga gis conrad et al 2015 2 9 mixed effects modelling out of 72 twi formulations the optimal formulation of twi was identified using linear mixed effects modelling mixed effect models contain both random effects and fixed effects in this study sample ids and sampling dates were considered as random effect and twi and hillslope ids as fixed effect criteria for mixed effects modelling the optimal model was validated with observed hillslope soil moisture by computing correlation coefficient akaike information criterion aic was used to evaluate the relative performance of 72 twis combination aic is an estimator of relative goodness fit of a model for a given data set and the lower aic value represents the best model akaike 1974 akaike 1973 the relative performance of slope and flow accumulation algorithms were tested by plotting violin plot and by performing pairwise comparison i e keeping one parameter constant and another one variable moreover δaic akaike weights aicw i and evidence ratios e ratio were calculated to identify best fitting twi formulation the δ aic can be calculated as the difference between the ith model aic i and the optimal twi model aic opt 5 δ a i c aic i aic opt the δ aic values can be better interpreted by akaike weights which are calculated as 6 aic wi e x p δ aic i 2 z 1 z e x p δ aic z 2 for a z sets of the model 7 eratio aicw opt aicw j where aicw opt is the akaike weight of the optimal twi model and j stands for indexes of the reaming akaike weights all the statistical calculations are carried out in lme4 package of r statistical programme bates et al 2011 r development core team 2011 3 results two lesser himalayan hillslopes were selected to understand the hydrological connectivity of hillslopes and to analyse how realistically topographic wetness index twi estimates the soil moisture distribution of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes 3 1 hydrological connectivity analysis the agro forested agf hillslope which has a mixture of fallow and forested land cover generated more runoff than the grassed ga hillslope tables 1 and 2 the vegetation cover of ga hillslope plays a critical role in reducing the runoff however 60 area of agf hillslope is fallow which results in higher runoff conversion in comparison to ga hillslope both the hillslopes are dominated by infiltration excess runoff nanda et al 2018 sen and nanda 2019 the high intensity rainfall causes a high percentage of runoff conversion at the outlet table 1 table 2 but an exception was observed during the onset of the monsoon when the soil moisture condition was very low for example the 26 06 17 rainfall event converted less than 1 of runoff at the outlet although the rainfall peak was quite high moreover for low and medium intensity events the runoff coefficient was less than 1 for both hillslopes figs 3 4 and 5 present the spatial variability of runoff generating areas during high intensity rainfall events for the agro forested hillslope agf when soil moisture peaked to high values it was assumed that a significant portion of water was infiltrated therefore a low runoff can be expected from the contributing area of that particular soil moisture sensor the spatial variation maps of the percentage change in soil moisture from base to the peak of the rising limb were developed by inverse distance weighted idw method to understand the spatial and temporal variability of runoff generating areas the higher percentage change in soil moisture represents more infiltration and less runoff from that particular contributing areas and vice versa the results obtained from this analysis are presented using arrows for visual representation purpose i e temporal variation in runoff is indicated by the arrows and the thickness of the arrow represents the relative amount of runoff fig 3 a 4a and 5a the direction of arrows was derived from 0 5 m resolution dem the 5 min maximum rainfall intensities 79 mm h to 103 mm h of high intensity rainfall events are much higher than the hillslope hydraulic conductivity but the average rainfall intensity for high intensity events was ranged between 13 mm h to 31 mm h the maximum amount of rain water infiltrated into high hydraulic conductivity zones in comparison to low and medium conductivity zones at the beginning of the rainfall during the 10 07 2017 event the high conductivity zone showed a 200 rise in volumetric water content whereas low conductivity zone showed only 35 to 45 rise in volumetric water content spatial variability of runoff generating areas depends on spatial variation in soil hydraulic conductivity the first runoff peak at 18 45 of 10 07 2017 event i e 4 4 mm h was lower than the second runoff peak of this event i e 7 8 mm h at 21 40 fig 4 b c the maximum rainfall intensity which occurred at the starting of the event did not generate peak runoff i e at 18 45 pm but the rainfall at 21 40 pm occurred after a significant amount of rain generated the maximum amount of runoff this was the longest event of the 2017 monsoon which continued for 6 hr and generated 5 of runoff at the outlet of the hillslope a similar spatial trend of runoff generation was observed during 12 07 2017 rainfall event which has a runoff coefficient value of 1 02 fig 5 b at the beginning of the rainfall the low and medium conductivity areas generated more runoff which are represented by thicker arrows fig 4a and 5a than high conductivity areas however runoff generated from medium conductivity areas which are located above the high conductivity areas were re infiltrated into that high conductivity zones the sm6 soil moisture sensor shows less rise in soil moisture which indicates the possibility of runoff generation from that location but the sm8 sensor which is placed few meters downslope the sm6 sensor shows the highest soil moisture peak above mentioned phenomena concluded that the runoff generated from sm6 zone re infiltrated at sm8 zone fig 4e and 5d at the peak rainfall intensity those high and low conductivity areas were connected to the outlet meanwhile an exception in runoff generation was observed during 26 06 2017 event which initial soil moisture was ranged from 0 054 m3 m3 to 0 158 m3 m3 during the peak rainfall intensity maximum amount of rainfall was infiltrated at an upper and middle portion of hillslope fig 3b which results due to very dry soil condition as the rainfall continued a small amount of runoff was generated at the lower and upper portion of the hillslope the runoff generated at an upper portion of hillslope re infiltrated at the lower portion fig 3c as the infiltration was at peak rate which results in very less amount of runoff at the outlet 1 the slope of the soil moisture rising limb indicates the infiltrating pattern of hillslope patches i e whether it is quick or gradual at a particular location the quick rise in soil moisture was observed in high conductivity zone whereas a gradual rise in moisture was noticed in low conductivity zones fig 3e 4e and 5d moreover the slope of the soil moisture rising limb is greater in high conductivity areas than the low conductivity areas the spatial and temporal variation in runoff during low and medium intensity rainfall for agro forested agf hillslope is presented in figs 6 7 and 8 the average rainfall intensity of low and medium intensity rainfall was 3 0 mm h and 8 4 mm h respectively at the initial phase of rainfall no runoff was generated at the outlet of hillslope due to infiltration at the lower portion of hillslope fig 7b and 8b the 31st july event did not develop significant hydrological connectivity for a long period of time and thus generated very less amount of runoff fig 6b and 6c during that event the low rainfall intensity was less than the soil hydraulic conductivity in most of the time steps at the first time step all moisture sensors showed a rise in vwc but at the second time step 4 40 some sensor point sm2 sm3 sm4 sm7 and sm8 showed a decrease in vwc in comparison to first time step time of the peak rainfall intensity has an influence on runoff characteristics of the hillslope since the 4th rainfall peak of 31st august occurred after a significant amount of total rainfall it generated more runoff 0 47 mm h in comparison to 1st rainfall peak 0 16 mm h which happened at the beginning of the event moreover the 31st august 4th rainfall peak showed higher runoff peak comparison to 3rd rainfall peak the percentage rise in soil moisture decreased over time at low conductivity zones of hillslope i e at sensor location sm1 sm2 and sm5 which are located at a lower portion of hillslope result more runoff at the outlet during 4th rainfall peak in comparison to the 3rd peak similarly on 28th august event during the first rainfall peak 3 15 am infiltration rate was higher in comparison to second rainfall peak 3 30 am which was also reflected on corresponding runoff peak the re infiltration process was also observed during these rainfall events similarly for grassed ga hillslope the spatial and temporal variability of runoff in form of a percentage of soil moisture change is presented in figs 9 10 and 11 the hydrological phenomena of the ga hillslope were different from agf hillslope table 1 and table 2 the average rainfall intensity varied from 10 mm h to 19 mm h during high intensity rainfall events the high intensity rainfall event generated low runoff volume through the dry period due to low soil moisture conditions fig 9d the soil moisture rise ranged from 18 to 440 just after the maximum rainfall intensity the highest soil moisture rise was recorded in high conductivity zones sm6 however the high intensity event of july month recorded 1 2 of runoff conversion at the outlet the average rainfall of medium intensity rainfall events fig 11 varied from 6 7 to 7 2 mm h which was greater than the hydraulic conductivity of some patches of low conductivity zones 10 mm h during a medium intensity rain event the runoff peak was generated after a significant amount of rainfall not suddenly after the rainfall peak as the peak took place at the beginning of the event fig 10d on 9th august rainfall occurred at an intensity of 12 mm h to 26 4 mm h from 4 10 am to 4 25 am this rainfall intensity generated runoff from low conductivity zones which were indicated by less soil moisture rise in that zones fig 10b the runoff generated from low conductivity zones re infiltrated on their pathways so results low runoff conversion at the outlet 1 the ga hillslope allows more water to re infiltrate by putting a surface resistance the soil moisture sensor showed a significant increase in soil moisture over the hillslope after 4 30 am due to low intensity rainfall 4 mm h and re infiltration of runoff at middle of the hillslope sm 5 and sm3 which was generated from end of the hillslope during the runoff peak fig 10c the delayed runoff was observed in ga hillslope which may result due to high surface resistance in comparison to agf hillslope fig 10d and 11d in both the medium intensity event of ga hillslope the difference between occurrence of rainfall peak and runoff peak was ranges from 10 to 20 min similarly it can be seen from fig 11b that after the maximum intensity of rainfall the low conductivity zones started generating runoff whereas the medium conductivity zones showed a significant amount of infiltration after few minutes of runoff peak the sensors recorded rise in soil moisture all over the landscape fig 11c the vegetation cover of ga hillslope reduced the surface runoff velocity thus results delay response of soil moisture at each sensor point and runoff at hillslope outlet especially during medium intensity rainfall 3 2 correlation of soil moisture with topographic wetness index and soil hydraulic conductivity the understanding derived from hydrological connectivity analysis stated that spatial variability of soil moisture influences the hillslope runoff processes soil moisture condition over the hillslope decides the infiltration capacity of a natural system during rainfall events in infiltration excess dominated hillslope the runoff contributing areas are influenced by initial soil moisture condition hydraulic conductivity zones of hillslope and rainfall intensities moreover soil moisture may have direct or inverse relation with topographic wetness index twi and this behaviour of soil moisture can be explained by the location of runoff contributing areas thus in this section we will explore how the topography and soil hydraulic conductivity influences the soil moisture variability of hillslopes 3 2 1 selection of optimal twi formulation this section presents the optimal formulation of twi among 72 different combinations of twi using linear mixed effects modelling violin plots illustrate relationships between aic and slope algorithms fig 12 and aic and flow accumulation of algorithms fig 13 violin plot is similar to the box plot and shows not only the percentile values 25 50 and 75 but also the distribution patterns of datasets the more negative aic value represents more promising twi model it can be seen from violin plots that the distributions of downslope index dsi with the distance parameter 60 cm second degree polynomial sdp and dsi 1m performed better than the other slope algorithms followed by least square fitted plane lfp dsi 20cm and dsi 5cm fig 12 moreover dsi 20cm and 5cm also shows similar aic distribution pattern the best twi formulation resulted from dsi 60cm slope method as it showed lowest aic value fig 12 the aic distribution suggests that rho8 and mmdg flow direction algorithms have a better fitting with hillslope soil moisture in comparison to other flow direction algorithms fig 13 the multiple flow direction mfd algorithms namely mmdg md and md show a similar type of aic distribution moreover after rho8 method the above mentioned mfd algorithms formulated optimal twi combination respectively table 4 it can be inferred from table 4 that the combination of rho8 and dsi 60 cm formulated best twi model which can be assured by its lowest aic value 602 87 and highest aic weight 0 14 meanwhile evidence ratio of model 2 and model 3 are less than 3 which shows little proof that model 1 is better than these models the akaike weights of the different models indicate that model 1 is 2 3 2 8 3 5 and 4 6 times more likely to be the best model than the model 2 model 3 model 4 and model 5 respectively similarly twi formulated with mmdg algorithm performed 1 25 and 1 6 times better than the md and md respectively the optimal twi model 1 values will be used in next section to analyse the correlation between soil moisture and topography 3 2 2 correlation analysis we analysed the daily soil moisture correlation with twi and hydraulic conductivity which will help us to illustrate the evolution of correlation from wet season to dry season no previous studies described soil moisture correlation analysis at this fine temporal resolution in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes it can be seen from fig 14 b and 15b that correlation between soil moisture and twi is negative which indicates that the points with high twi values tends to have lowest soil moisture it is to be noted that the hillslope drainage lines are mainly located at low and medium conductivity zones which may results in low soil moisture content at drainage lines in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes soil is quite dry during non monsoon seasons which result stronger negative correlation with twi in comparison to the wet season strength of this correlation dropped remarkably during high intensity rainfall events which can be verified by plotting correlation values in 5 min temporal scale fig 16 these fine resolution analysis implied that the correlation strength almost reached to 0 during high intensity rainfall peak however during dry season soil moisture and twi are strongly correlated having correlation coefficient 0 70 for agf and 0 91 for ga hillslope the ga hillslope shows stronger negative correlation with twi in comparison to agf hillslope however soil moisture has positive correlation with the soil hydraulic conductivity as high conductivity zones infiltrate more water in comparison to low conductivity zones as discussed earlier in section 3 1 hillslope soil moisture variability was strongly influenced by soil hydraulic conductivity in infiltration excess dominated hillslope at the beginning of the wet season the correlation strength is less than 0 4 fig 14c and 15c and this strength raised markedly after mid of the wet season as the hillslope contains more moisture during mid and end of the wet season the possible reason for getting higher correlation values may be due to the moisture holding of the soil at the beginning of the wet season all soil layers have low moisture content which increases with the passing of time water from the top soil layer drains and wet the deeper layers of soil therefore top soil do not hold much moisture during initial period for wet season however due to the moisture being stored at deeper layers during mid wet season water gets slower in the draining to downward layers therefore high soil moisture values can be observed over the mid of the monsoon fig 14a 15a these high soil moisture values results in higher correlation values with the hydraulic conductivity these arguments can be verified by analysing 5 min temporal scale correlation between soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity figs 17 and 18 analysis of 5 min data reveals that the correlation between soil hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture increases significantly just after every high intensity rainfall peak figs 17 and 18 fine scale correlation analysis of agf hillslope on 10th july 2017 event elucidated that correlation strength was quite low at the beginning of the wet season 0 3 however it raised instantaneously i e near to 1 only during high intensity rainfall peak but again returned to previous state after passing of rainfall peaks fig 17a these values of correlation were found to be very high as compared to the daily scale the reason for such behaviour is that the relationship between soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity at a higher temporal resolution is very unstable in other words this means that during rainfall peak the correlation increases very rapidly and further decreases after short time lag this decreased correlation while averaging on daily scale decreases the daily correlation values significantly even during high rainfall condition at the beginning of the wet season it can be seen from 31st august correlation plot that the correlation strength is greater than equal to 0 6 throughout the events as the soil retained more moisture in comparison to 10th july event fig 17b which results higher daily correlation value in month of august similar correlation pattern was also observed for ga hillslope fig 18a 18b for 26th june event the correlation value was observed to be less than equal to 0 2 before and few minutes after the rainfall peak whereas for 31st august event the minimum correlation value is 0 69 the grassed ga hillslope shows better correlation than the agro forested agf hillslope as the surface resistance of ga allows more water to infiltrate in high and medium conductivity zones correlation strength of soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity follows the trend of soil moisture however the twi follows opposite pattern 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological connectivity detailed analysis of all events indicated the spatial and temporal variation in runoff generating areas depends on the variability of hydraulic conductivity rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions soil moisture rise was more in high conductivity zones in comparison to low conductivity zones at the beginning of the rainfall event indicating that the generation of runoff mainly from low conductivity zones as rainfall proceeds the instantaneous peak of soil moisture occurs in high conductivity zones at maximum rainfall intensity and then quickly recedes during high intensity events the maximum rainfall intensity tends to be greater than soil hydraulic conductivity of hillslope significant runoff conversion occurs at the outlet in comparison to low and medium intensity rainfall soil moisture rise was evenly distributed over hillslope during low and medium intensity events which result low runoff conversion at the outlet 1 the vegetation cover of ga hillslope allows more water to infiltrate results less hillslope runoff in comparison to agf hillslope bracken et al 2013 moreover extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity 5 mm h patches located near an outlet in agf hillslope whereas it was located at end portion in ga hillslope this may result in less runoff in ga hillslope the above mentioned discussion indicate that hydrological connectivity has a strong influence on hillslope runoff bracken croke 2007 sen et al 2010 other studies in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes also reported that hillslope connectivity is influenced by rainfall characteristics and soil hydraulic conductivity sen et al 2010 reaney et al 2007 they concluded that the lower conductivity zones mainly generated runoff at the beginning of the event moreover they mentioned that runoff is positively associated with rainfall intensity these phenomena are also observed in the present study for lesser himalayan hillslopes smith et al 2010 observed the stronger correlation between maximum rainfall intensity and runoff than the mean rainfall intensity smith et al 2010 and wainwright parsons 2002 discussed the role of surface resistance on hillslope runoff and observed that vegetation cover increases the re infiltration and breaks the hydrological connectivity over the hillslope which was also observed in the present study for ga hillslope cammeraat 2002 discussed the connectivity of runoff generating and runoff absorbing area and influence of vegetation initial soil moisture condition and rainfall intensity on the process of hydrological connectivity the vegetated area showed more infiltration contrast to bare crusted soil due to more surface resistance the organised vegetation pattern creates runoff absorbing zone over the hillslope which results in low runoff at the outlet the same impact of vegetation on surface runoff and infiltration was also observed in grassed hillslope of the present study 4 2 correlation analysis we used soil moisture variability to understand the hillslope hydrological connectivity famiglietti et al 1998 studied the soil moisture variability and its correlation with the topographic wetness index twi and soil properties in rattlesnake hill of texas usa the poor correlation was observed during high intensity rainfall event which was also noticed in the present study fig 16 this clearly shows that the topography have no significant effect during high intensity rainfall moreover they witnessed the negative correlation between slope component of twi and soil moisture because of infiltration excess runoff the present study also described the negative correlation between twi and soil moisture in infiltration excess dominated hillslope further they noticed the higher correlation value during dry season too minet et al 2011 measured soil moisture in five infiltration excess dominated agricultural fields of central belgium and luxembourg using a proximal off ground gpr system three out of five agricultural fields showed negative correlation with twi and the highest negative correlation was observed in walsdorf field in which driest part was situated near the field outlet in the present study also hillslope drainage lines were mostly located in low conductivity zones in ga hillslope and in low and medium conductivity zones in agf hillslope thus soil moisture variability of ga hillslope showed strong negative correlation with twi in comparison to agf hillslope in dry season the difference in correlation between agro forested and grassed hillslope can also be explained by runoff generating capacity of each hillslope the agf hillslope recorded more runoff at outlet thus resulted in high correlation in contrast to ga hillslope during wet season in most of the studies the coefficient of determination value rarely exceeded 0 5 and mainly ranged from 0 to 0 4 buchanan et al 2014 burt butcher 1985 tague et al 2010 western et al 2004 but in the present study the correlation value raised up to 0 8 which can be justified by usage of fine resolution dem of 0 5 m buchanan et al 2014 schmidt persson 2003 tague et al 2010 famiglietti et al 1998 also studied the soil moisture correlation with particle size distribution and porosity which are the indirect measure of soil hydraulic conductivity but unfortunately they did not have hydraulic conductivity data from correlation analysis they stated that soil moisture variability is highly correlated with soil hydraulic conductivity during wet condition but not saturated condition same revelation was also verified in the present study heterogeneous distribution of soil hydraulic conductivity significantly influence the soil moisture movement during wet season comparison to dry season the present study also observed notable dropped in correlation during dry season figs 14 15 4 3 practical implications detailed hillslope scale instrumentation in the lesser himalayan watershed is the first step towards creating hydrological data networks in the indian himalayan region ihr this ongoing project has generated better plot and hillslope scale hydrological process understanding in the himalayan region however more replication in this type of studies are required in future these datasets can be used to develop the conceptual hillslope models no hydrological connectivity was witnessed previously in the indian himalayan region ihr bracken et al 2013 the understanding of correlation analysis can be used for modelling and predicting of spatial variation in soil moisture and thus hillslope runoff further hillslope hydrological research can be up scaled to watershed scale 5 conclusions rainfall intensity soil hydraulic conductivity initial soil moisture condition and vegetation have a strong influence on hillslope hydrological connectivity only the high intensity rainfall converted 1 5 of rainfall into runoff otherwise the low and medium intensity rain events lead to less than 1 of runoff at the outlet the lower and upper portion of hillslope mainly contributed towards runoff but the upper portion runoff re infiltrated in middle portion due to high soil hydraulic conductivity and surface resistance particularly in grassed hillslope moreover the high conductivity zones show higher soil moisture slope during maximum rainfall intensity in comparison to lower conductivity zone on the basis of soil moisture rise in different conductivity zones this study identified the runoff contributing areas out of 72 topographic wetness index twi formulations the twi formed by the combination of rho8 and dsi 60cm found to be optimal followed by mmdg and dsi 1m for elaborating hillslope scale soil moisture dynamics further we identified the correlation between the spatial variability of soil moisture and optimal twi in grassed and agro forested hillslope the correlation obtained from this analysis has been helpful for understanding hillslope hydrological processes the negative correlation observed between twi and soil moisture in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes was explained by the presence of main streamline in low conductivity zones no correlation was observed between twi and soil moisture during high intensity rainfall peak twi was able to explain better soil moisture variation in the dry season than the wet season runoff generation amount has a direct influence on the correlation coefficient i e more runoff less moisture results high negative correlation between twi and soil moisture in agf hillslope than the ga hillslope under wet conditions however during dry seasons correlation strength of ga hillslope was stronger than the agf hillslope moreover it was found that soil moisture was positively correlated with soil hydraulic conductivity in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes and the strongest correlation strength was observed during mid wet season the dominant influence on hillslope soil moisture depends on degree of wetness conditions this detailed understanding of hillslope hydrological processes will help to develop the concept for watershed scale processes understanding declaration of

6016,this study demonstrated the spatiotemporal variation in runoff generating areas in grassed and agro forested hillslopes of lesser himalaya using soil moisture soil hydraulic conductivity and rainfall datasets nine rainfall events of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes were analysed and found that only high intensity rainfall events were able to convert 1 5 of runoff at the outlet the extremely low patch of soil hydraulic conductivity 5 mm h was located at the outlet in agro forested hillslope whereas similar low soil hydraulic conductivity patch is located at the end portion in a grassed hillslope therefore the grassed hillslope generated less runoff than the agro forested hillslope due to its surface resistance and heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity the runoff generated from the upper part of hillslope re infiltrated into the middle part due to higher soil hydraulic conductivity during low and medium intensity rainfall conditions major runoff contribution was observed from low conductivity zones of the hillslope moreover we analysed the correlation of spatial variation in soil moisture with topographic wetness index twi and soil hydraulic conductivity in two different landuse conditions to examine the predictive potential of these attributes during the wet and dry season the optimal formulation of twi was obtained from 72 different combinations using linear mixed effects modelling the correlation between optimal twi formulation and soil moisture was found to be negative as the main streamline is located near low conductivity zones furthermore the correlation between twi and soil moisture is stronger in the dry season than the wet season in comparison to grass cover hillslope agro forested landuse system shows better negative correlation between soil moisture and twi during the wet season as the agro forested hillslope produced more runoff than the grassed hillslope the correlation strength of soil hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture was strongest after mid of the wet season which is directly correlated to the moisture content of hillslopes keywords lesser himalayan hillslopes hydrological connectivity soil moisture variability mixed effects modelling topographic wetness index twi data scarce region 1 introduction soil moisture significantly impacts ecological i e species type and nutrient characteristics and hydrological i e runoff and drought landscape processes foremost among these impacts is the role that soil moisture plays in connecting hillslopes to streams the mechanisms by which hydrologic connectivity occurs varies with terrain and climate a comprehensive understanding of hydrologic connectivity its impact on ecohydrological functions and the implications for efficient watershed scale management therefore relies on a body of knowledge generated from studies in a broad range of hydrologic settings many studies have been carried out to understand the connection between runoff generation and soil moisture patterns in saturation excess dominated regions bracken et al 2013 but very few studies have explained the same correlation in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes or at watershed scales in this study we investigate hydrologic connectivity of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes of the lesser himalaya hydrological connectivity occurs when water moves from one point to another point on a hillslope causing runoff bracken and croke 2007 sen et al 2010 and depends on the spatial variability of soil water content wilson et al 2016 mcnamara et al 2005 and micro topographic conditions i e slope and vegetation of hillslopes ali and roy 2009 the existence of hydrological connectivity however is transient for example mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 stated that hillslopes were not connected to the streams at early stages of a rain event but runoff will generate after satisfying the infiltration capacities of the hillslope on longer hillslopes the chance of re infiltration disturbs the hydrological connectivity this re infiltration process is driven by soil infiltration capacity and topographic conditions although hydrologic connectivity is most commonly associated with landscapes that generate runoff by saturation excess both the infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanisms are driven by saturation one from the top and another from the bottom respectively mcdonnell 2013 when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil the infiltration excess runoff takes place horton 1933 sen et al 2008 when groundwater reaches the ground surface saturation excess runoff occurs sarkar et al 2015 conducted the plot scale runoff experiments under artificial rainfall conditions using sheet flow generator and also in natural circumstances to understand the runoff generation processes in wet sub tropics nanda et al 2018 studied the dominant runoff generation processes at plot and hillslope scale under artificial and natural rainfall conditions respectively and found infiltration excess as the dominant runoff process moreover they observed that initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall intensity have a significant impact on runoff hydrograph but prediction of soil moisture is a complex phenomenon and need lots of input data to set up a hydrologic modelling framework buchanan et al 2014 in this scenario topographic indices are an easier and simpler way to predict finer resolution soil moisture over the landscape but famiglietti et al 1998 mentioned that the strength of the correlation of any soil or topographic indices with soil moisture varies seasonally so one predictive index is not enough for predicting soil moisture during both dry and wet season in the present study we analyse the soil moisture correlation with both topographic index i e topographic wetness index twi and soil attribute i e soil hydraulic conductivity spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity influences the hillslope runoff processes and spatial variation in soil moisture sen et al 2010 the topographic controls on soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity are commonly related to the topographic wetness index twi as proposed by beven and kirkby 1979 the twi is related to contributing drainage area and slope that predicts a landscapes susceptibility to saturation numerous studies have demonstrated that soil moisture and the twi are correlated depending on climate vegetation cover and geology buchanan et al 2014 tague et al 2010 western et al 2004 although the twi was developed for catchment dominated by saturation excess it is reasonable to assume that the twi is related to hydrologic processes in infiltration excess catchments as well few studies however have investigated the use of twi as a predictor of hydrologic processes in catchments where infiltration excess is dominant minet et al 2011 interestingly the correlation may be positive or negative depending on the runoff generating areas of infiltration excess dominated systems minet et al 2011 usage of topographic input in modelling of soil moisture is an effective approach to estimate the hillslope hydrologic behaviour bronstert and bárdossy 1999 because of the strong relationship between twi and soil moisture ali and roy 2009 suggested a fine resolution digital elevation model dem for accurate interpretation of terrain conditions however the quality of topographic information extracted from dems depends not only on the quality of the dem but on the algorithms used to analyse the dem for example the upslope area draining to a point in a watershed has been computed using various algorithms bauer et al 1985 fairfield leymarie 1991 freeman 1991 lea 1992 moore et al 1991 o callaghan mark 1984 seibert mcglynn 2007 tarboton 1997 qin et al 2011 the slope can also be computed in many ways as well resulting in scores of different ways to compute the twi there is considerable potential therefore that the choice of algorithms for computing the twi could bias observed relationships between twi soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity in this study we implemented a method to optimize the twi calculation using mixed effects modelling many studies on flow process connectivity buda et al 2009 gomi et al 2008 sen et al 2010 smith et al 2010 and soil moisture connectivity ali roy 2009 james roulet 2007 western et al 1998 have been carried out in different locations of world but no study has been witnessed in the indian himalayan region ihr except the one from the current research group nanda et al 2018 more importantly infiltration excess dominated hillslopes have received little attention the present study elucidates new insight to identify the hillslope hydrological connectivity in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes using high resolution soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity data during natural rainfall condition seasonal soil moisture variability has a strong influence on runoff processes and hydrological connectivity thus the role of soil moisture variability on hydrological connectivity and runoff generation processes are studied in the first part of this paper and then we go for correlation of soil moisture variability with topographic and soil attributes especially in limited data availability conditions prediction of soil moisture in both dry and wet seasons is challenging considering the discussions above the present study addresses the following questions i does hydrological connectivity of lesser himalayan hillslopes explain the runoff generating and runoff absorbing areas under two different landuse conditions ii is the topographic wetness index twi able to describe the soil moisture variability of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes and iii does the correlation between soil hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture explain the hillslope scale soil moisture variability temporal and spatial dynamics of soil moisture and hillslope runoff were monitored to understand the hydrological connectivity and spatial correlation of soil moisture with topography different combinations of flow direction and slope algorithms were used in the mixed modelling approach to formulate optimal twi combination for predicting the soil moisture during wet and dry season 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area two lesser himalayan hillslopes were chosen for hydrological monitoring in the tehri garhwal region of india the hillslopes are located at north and south aspect of aglar watershed fig 1 a the average annual rainfall of aglar watershed is 1200 mm the maximum portion of rainfall i e 2000 mm to 2100 mm occurs during the monsoon season june to september the winter minimum temperature goes down to 5 c however the summer temperature rises to 40 c the highest altitude of watershed is dominated by deodar cedrus deodar trees followed by oak and pine trees pant and roy 1990 due to more solar radiation the south aspect of the watershed has degraded land cover features having gravely soil structure and shallow soil depth in comparison to the north aspect saha and singh 1991 nanda et al 2018 thus the south aspect of watershed is dominated with plants from the cactaceae family and native grasses whereas the north aspect of watershed is majorly dominated with agricultural lands and forests in this study the selected south aspect hillslope is mainly covered by native grasses ga whereas north aspect hillslope is dominated by a mixture of fallow and forest land agf bhimal grewia optiva semal bombax ceiba hisalu rubus ellipticus sm tree species are found in agf hillslope bhimal is a multipurpose agro forestry tree majorily used for wood fuel and fodder semal is a medicinal tree which is useful for skin care and healing wounds hisalu is a wild fruit also known as yellow himalayan raspberry 2 2 hydrologic measurements hillslopes were instrumented with 10 soil moisture sensors 5 decagon and 5 odyssey at a depth of 15 20 cm to capture the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture fig 1b decagon meter environment usa sensor measures the dielectric constant of the soil to estimate volumetric water content in this study the em50 logger along with 5tm decagon sensor was used to record both soil temperature and moisture simulataneously similarly odyssey dataflow systems ltd new zealand sensor also works on dielectric constant of the soils to record the soil moisture field and lab calibration was performed for odyssey and decagon soil moisture sensors respectively moreover hs flume with odyssey water level sensor has been used in both the sites to record the hillslope runoff depth at the outlet soil moisture and runoff data were recorded at 5 min temporal resolution rainwise tipping bucket raingauges rainwise inc usa were used to record rainfall data the data collection started in the 2017 monsoon i e june 2017 hillslopes are surveyed with real time kinematic rtk global positioning system gps to understand the detailed topography of hillslopes the observed data were used to create the 0 5 m resolution digital elevation model dem of hillslopes the elevation variation of ga hillslope was ranged between 1267 m and 1270 m whereas for agf hillslope the elevation was within the range of 1142 m to 1147 m the mean slope gradient of ga and agf hillslope was 14 4 and 20 7 respectively 2 3 selection of rain events the events were chosen on the basis of rainfall characteristics and data availability the agro forested agf hillslope and grassed ga hillslope have received 1018 mm and 963 mm of rainfall in monsoon 2017 the five minute rainfall peak varies between 12 mm h to 103 mm h for agf hillslope and 36 mm h to 109 mm h for ga hillslope six rainfall events from agf hillslope table 1 and four rainfall event from ga hillslope were selected for understanding hydrological connectivity table 2 2 4 derivation of hillslope hydrological connectivity hillslope connectivity was assessed using the soil hydraulic conductivity soil moisture runoff and rainfall data at primary level high medium and low hydraulic conductivity zones were identified to verify the spatial variation in hillslope infiltration patterns we used a basic assumption i e high soil moisture rise represents high infiltration and less runoff to identify whether the contributing area of a particular soil moisture sensor generates runoff or not further the spread network of soil moisture sensors was used to identify the runoff absorbing and runoff generating areas of each hillslope 2 5 determining soil hydraulic conductivity soil hydraulic conductivity has a significant impact on the hydrological characterises of hillslopes in situ infiltration experiments were conducted at 4 4 m grid along the hillslopes using compact size decagon mini disk infiltrometer to estimate hydraulic conductivity more details about the mini disk infiltrometer is available at decagon web manual decagon devices inc pullman wa the volume of water infiltrated was recorded at a constant time lag at each sampling point zhang method 1997 was used to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 1 i c 1 t c 2 t c1 cm s 1 and c2 cm s 1 2 stands for hydraulic conductivity and soil sorptivity parameters respectively and i cm and t sec represents cumulative infiltration and time respectively c1 is the slope gradient of plot which has a value between cumulative infiltration and square root of time hydraulic conductivity can be calculated as follows 2 k c 1 a value of a is a function of van

components h o is the suction head and r o is the mini disk radius in the present study n and α values are taken as 1 89 and 0 075 cm 1 respectively inverse distance weighted idw technique was used to develop spatial soil hydraulic conductivity maps fig 2 the variation in hydraulic conductivity was within the 2 mm h to 23 mm h for agf hillslope and 2 mm h to 34 mm h for ga hillslope areas near to the outlets have low value of hydraulic conductivity whereas middle portions of hillslopes have higher values fig 2 the percentage of area covered under each hydraulic conductivity group is presented in table 3 for both hillslope the results of hydraulic conductivity experiments are used to derive the high medium and low conductivity zones which will be useful to study the hydrological connectivity of hillslopes further we have analysed the correlation between soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity 2 6 topographic wetness index twi estimation this study addresses the link between soil moisture distribution and topographic wetness index twi the estimation of twi depends on the selection of flow accumulation algorithm and slope algorithm twi can be stated as beven kirkby 1979 4 twi l n u t a n β the notation αu represents upslope contributing area per unit contour length and β is the slope term m m one of the aims of this study is to analyse the influence of different flow accumulation algorithms and slope algorithms on the correlation between twi and volumetric water content vwc of soil nine different methods of flow accumulation algorithm and four different slope calculation methods were selected to construct 72 combinations of twi further linear mixed effect modelling was used to find best twi formulation 2 7 slope calculation method four slope calculation methods namely i maximum triangle slope mts tarboton 1997 ii least square fitted plane lsfp horn 1981 iii second degree polynomial sdp zevenbergen thorne 1987 iv downslope index hjerdt et al 2004 were used in this study since the first three methods only consider the targeted grid and its neighbourhood these can be termed as local slope methods the downslope index dsi estimates the hydraulic gradient by determining the hillslope length ld that water must move to lose a certain amount of potential energy d hjerdt et al 2004 the slope calculated using dsi method is more reasonable than other local methods because it allows downslope controls on local soil moisture conditions dsi is sensitive to the selection of d thus in the present study we have chosen 5 different values of d i e 5 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 1 m total eight slope types were used to estimate different combination of twi all slope analyses were conducted in open source saga gis system for automated geoscientific analyses saga gis was developed by the research team of j böhner and o conrad the saga gis development centre is located at institute of geography university of hamburg germany olaya 2004 the latest version of saga gis saga 6 3 0 is used in our study 2 8 flow accumulation algorithm the upslope contributing area can be calculated by different flow direction algorithms existing flow direction algorithms can be broadly classified as majorly as single flow direction sfd and multiple flow direction mfd approaches as their name implies sfd and mfd direct all flow to single downslope cell and multiple downslope cells respectively this study uses four sfd algorithms including i kinematic routing algorithm kra lea 1992 ii d8 o callaghan mark 1984 iii digital elevation model networks demon

multiple triangular flow direction md seibert mcglynn 2007 ix multiple flow direction based on maximum downslope gradient mmdg qin et al 2011 with different slope calculations described above to estimate twi all flow accumulation analyses were carried out in saga gis conrad et al 2015 2 9 mixed effects modelling out of 72 twi formulations the optimal formulation of twi was identified using linear mixed effects modelling mixed effect models contain both random effects and fixed effects in this study sample ids and sampling dates were considered as random effect and twi and hillslope ids as fixed effect criteria for mixed effects modelling the optimal model was validated with observed hillslope soil moisture by computing correlation coefficient akaike information criterion aic was used to evaluate the relative performance of 72 twis combination aic is an estimator of relative goodness fit of a model for a given data set and the lower aic value represents the best model akaike 1974 akaike 1973 the relative performance of slope and flow accumulation algorithms were tested by plotting violin plot and by performing pairwise comparison i e keeping one parameter constant and another one variable moreover δaic akaike weights aicw i and evidence ratios e ratio were calculated to identify best fitting twi formulation the δ aic can be calculated as the difference between the ith model aic i and the optimal twi model aic opt 5 δ a i c aic i aic opt the δ aic values can be better interpreted by akaike weights which are calculated as 6 aic wi e x p δ aic i 2 z 1 z e x p δ aic z 2 for a z sets of the model 7 eratio aicw opt aicw j where aicw opt is the akaike weight of the optimal twi model and j stands for indexes of the reaming akaike weights all the statistical calculations are carried out in lme4 package of r statistical programme bates et al 2011 r development core team 2011 3 results two lesser himalayan hillslopes were selected to understand the hydrological connectivity of hillslopes and to analyse how realistically topographic wetness index twi estimates the soil moisture distribution of infiltration excess dominated hillslopes 3 1 hydrological connectivity analysis the agro forested agf hillslope which has a mixture of fallow and forested land cover generated more runoff than the grassed ga hillslope tables 1 and 2 the vegetation cover of ga hillslope plays a critical role in reducing the runoff however 60 area of agf hillslope is fallow which results in higher runoff conversion in comparison to ga hillslope both the hillslopes are dominated by infiltration excess runoff nanda et al 2018 sen and nanda 2019 the high intensity rainfall causes a high percentage of runoff conversion at the outlet table 1 table 2 but an exception was observed during the onset of the monsoon when the soil moisture condition was very low for example the 26 06 17 rainfall event converted less than 1 of runoff at the outlet although the rainfall peak was quite high moreover for low and medium intensity events the runoff coefficient was less than 1 for both hillslopes figs 3 4 and 5 present the spatial variability of runoff generating areas during high intensity rainfall events for the agro forested hillslope agf when soil moisture peaked to high values it was assumed that a significant portion of water was infiltrated therefore a low runoff can be expected from the contributing area of that particular soil moisture sensor the spatial variation maps of the percentage change in soil moisture from base to the peak of the rising limb were developed by inverse distance weighted idw method to understand the spatial and temporal variability of runoff generating areas the higher percentage change in soil moisture represents more infiltration and less runoff from that particular contributing areas and vice versa the results obtained from this analysis are presented using arrows for visual representation purpose i e temporal variation in runoff is indicated by the arrows and the thickness of the arrow represents the relative amount of runoff fig 3 a 4a and 5a the direction of arrows was derived from 0 5 m resolution dem the 5 min maximum rainfall intensities 79 mm h to 103 mm h of high intensity rainfall events are much higher than the hillslope hydraulic conductivity but the average rainfall intensity for high intensity events was ranged between 13 mm h to 31 mm h the maximum amount of rain water infiltrated into high hydraulic conductivity zones in comparison to low and medium conductivity zones at the beginning of the rainfall during the 10 07 2017 event the high conductivity zone showed a 200 rise in volumetric water content whereas low conductivity zone showed only 35 to 45 rise in volumetric water content spatial variability of runoff generating areas depends on spatial variation in soil hydraulic conductivity the first runoff peak at 18 45 of 10 07 2017 event i e 4 4 mm h was lower than the second runoff peak of this event i e 7 8 mm h at 21 40 fig 4 b c the maximum rainfall intensity which occurred at the starting of the event did not generate peak runoff i e at 18 45 pm but the rainfall at 21 40 pm occurred after a significant amount of rain generated the maximum amount of runoff this was the longest event of the 2017 monsoon which continued for 6 hr and generated 5 of runoff at the outlet of the hillslope a similar spatial trend of runoff generation was observed during 12 07 2017 rainfall event which has a runoff coefficient value of 1 02 fig 5 b at the beginning of the rainfall the low and medium conductivity areas generated more runoff which are represented by thicker arrows fig 4a and 5a than high conductivity areas however runoff generated from medium conductivity areas which are located above the high conductivity areas were re infiltrated into that high conductivity zones the sm6 soil moisture sensor shows less rise in soil moisture which indicates the possibility of runoff generation from that location but the sm8 sensor which is placed few meters downslope the sm6 sensor shows the highest soil moisture peak above mentioned phenomena concluded that the runoff generated from sm6 zone re infiltrated at sm8 zone fig 4e and 5d at the peak rainfall intensity those high and low conductivity areas were connected to the outlet meanwhile an exception in runoff generation was observed during 26 06 2017 event which initial soil moisture was ranged from 0 054 m3 m3 to 0 158 m3 m3 during the peak rainfall intensity maximum amount of rainfall was infiltrated at an upper and middle portion of hillslope fig 3b which results due to very dry soil condition as the rainfall continued a small amount of runoff was generated at the lower and upper portion of the hillslope the runoff generated at an upper portion of hillslope re infiltrated at the lower portion fig 3c as the infiltration was at peak rate which results in very less amount of runoff at the outlet 1 the slope of the soil moisture rising limb indicates the infiltrating pattern of hillslope patches i e whether it is quick or gradual at a particular location the quick rise in soil moisture was observed in high conductivity zone whereas a gradual rise in moisture was noticed in low conductivity zones fig 3e 4e and 5d moreover the slope of the soil moisture rising limb is greater in high conductivity areas than the low conductivity areas the spatial and temporal variation in runoff during low and medium intensity rainfall for agro forested agf hillslope is presented in figs 6 7 and 8 the average rainfall intensity of low and medium intensity rainfall was 3 0 mm h and 8 4 mm h respectively at the initial phase of rainfall no runoff was generated at the outlet of hillslope due to infiltration at the lower portion of hillslope fig 7b and 8b the 31st july event did not develop significant hydrological connectivity for a long period of time and thus generated very less amount of runoff fig 6b and 6c during that event the low rainfall intensity was less than the soil hydraulic conductivity in most of the time steps at the first time step all moisture sensors showed a rise in vwc but at the second time step 4 40 some sensor point sm2 sm3 sm4 sm7 and sm8 showed a decrease in vwc in comparison to first time step time of the peak rainfall intensity has an influence on runoff characteristics of the hillslope since the 4th rainfall peak of 31st august occurred after a significant amount of total rainfall it generated more runoff 0 47 mm h in comparison to 1st rainfall peak 0 16 mm h which happened at the beginning of the event moreover the 31st august 4th rainfall peak showed higher runoff peak comparison to 3rd rainfall peak the percentage rise in soil moisture decreased over time at low conductivity zones of hillslope i e at sensor location sm1 sm2 and sm5 which are located at a lower portion of hillslope result more runoff at the outlet during 4th rainfall peak in comparison to the 3rd peak similarly on 28th august event during the first rainfall peak 3 15 am infiltration rate was higher in comparison to second rainfall peak 3 30 am which was also reflected on corresponding runoff peak the re infiltration process was also observed during these rainfall events similarly for grassed ga hillslope the spatial and temporal variability of runoff in form of a percentage of soil moisture change is presented in figs 9 10 and 11 the hydrological phenomena of the ga hillslope were different from agf hillslope table 1 and table 2 the average rainfall intensity varied from 10 mm h to 19 mm h during high intensity rainfall events the high intensity rainfall event generated low runoff volume through the dry period due to low soil moisture conditions fig 9d the soil moisture rise ranged from 18 to 440 just after the maximum rainfall intensity the highest soil moisture rise was recorded in high conductivity zones sm6 however the high intensity event of july month recorded 1 2 of runoff conversion at the outlet the average rainfall of medium intensity rainfall events fig 11 varied from 6 7 to 7 2 mm h which was greater than the hydraulic conductivity of some patches of low conductivity zones 10 mm h during a medium intensity rain event the runoff peak was generated after a significant amount of rainfall not suddenly after the rainfall peak as the peak took place at the beginning of the event fig 10d on 9th august rainfall occurred at an intensity of 12 mm h to 26 4 mm h from 4 10 am to 4 25 am this rainfall intensity generated runoff from low conductivity zones which were indicated by less soil moisture rise in that zones fig 10b the runoff generated from low conductivity zones re infiltrated on their pathways so results low runoff conversion at the outlet 1 the ga hillslope allows more water to re infiltrate by putting a surface resistance the soil moisture sensor showed a significant increase in soil moisture over the hillslope after 4 30 am due to low intensity rainfall 4 mm h and re infiltration of runoff at middle of the hillslope sm 5 and sm3 which was generated from end of the hillslope during the runoff peak fig 10c the delayed runoff was observed in ga hillslope which may result due to high surface resistance in comparison to agf hillslope fig 10d and 11d in both the medium intensity event of ga hillslope the difference between occurrence of rainfall peak and runoff peak was ranges from 10 to 20 min similarly it can be seen from fig 11b that after the maximum intensity of rainfall the low conductivity zones started generating runoff whereas the medium conductivity zones showed a significant amount of infiltration after few minutes of runoff peak the sensors recorded rise in soil moisture all over the landscape fig 11c the vegetation cover of ga hillslope reduced the surface runoff velocity thus results delay response of soil moisture at each sensor point and runoff at hillslope outlet especially during medium intensity rainfall 3 2 correlation of soil moisture with topographic wetness index and soil hydraulic conductivity the understanding derived from hydrological connectivity analysis stated that spatial variability of soil moisture influences the hillslope runoff processes soil moisture condition over the hillslope decides the infiltration capacity of a natural system during rainfall events in infiltration excess dominated hillslope the runoff contributing areas are influenced by initial soil moisture condition hydraulic conductivity zones of hillslope and rainfall intensities moreover soil moisture may have direct or inverse relation with topographic wetness index twi and this behaviour of soil moisture can be explained by the location of runoff contributing areas thus in this section we will explore how the topography and soil hydraulic conductivity influences the soil moisture variability of hillslopes 3 2 1 selection of optimal twi formulation this section presents the optimal formulation of twi among 72 different combinations of twi using linear mixed effects modelling violin plots illustrate relationships between aic and slope algorithms fig 12 and aic and flow accumulation of algorithms fig 13 violin plot is similar to the box plot and shows not only the percentile values 25 50 and 75 but also the distribution patterns of datasets the more negative aic value represents more promising twi model it can be seen from violin plots that the distributions of downslope index dsi with the distance parameter 60 cm second degree polynomial sdp and dsi 1m performed better than the other slope algorithms followed by least square fitted plane lfp dsi 20cm and dsi 5cm fig 12 moreover dsi 20cm and 5cm also shows similar aic distribution pattern the best twi formulation resulted from dsi 60cm slope method as it showed lowest aic value fig 12 the aic distribution suggests that rho8 and mmdg flow direction algorithms have a better fitting with hillslope soil moisture in comparison to other flow direction algorithms fig 13 the multiple flow direction mfd algorithms namely mmdg md and md show a similar type of aic distribution moreover after rho8 method the above mentioned mfd algorithms formulated optimal twi combination respectively table 4 it can be inferred from table 4 that the combination of rho8 and dsi 60 cm formulated best twi model which can be assured by its lowest aic value 602 87 and highest aic weight 0 14 meanwhile evidence ratio of model 2 and model 3 are less than 3 which shows little proof that model 1 is better than these models the akaike weights of the different models indicate that model 1 is 2 3 2 8 3 5 and 4 6 times more likely to be the best model than the model 2 model 3 model 4 and model 5 respectively similarly twi formulated with mmdg algorithm performed 1 25 and 1 6 times better than the md and md respectively the optimal twi model 1 values will be used in next section to analyse the correlation between soil moisture and topography 3 2 2 correlation analysis we analysed the daily soil moisture correlation with twi and hydraulic conductivity which will help us to illustrate the evolution of correlation from wet season to dry season no previous studies described soil moisture correlation analysis at this fine temporal resolution in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes it can be seen from fig 14 b and 15b that correlation between soil moisture and twi is negative which indicates that the points with high twi values tends to have lowest soil moisture it is to be noted that the hillslope drainage lines are mainly located at low and medium conductivity zones which may results in low soil moisture content at drainage lines in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes soil is quite dry during non monsoon seasons which result stronger negative correlation with twi in comparison to the wet season strength of this correlation dropped remarkably during high intensity rainfall events which can be verified by plotting correlation values in 5 min temporal scale fig 16 these fine resolution analysis implied that the correlation strength almost reached to 0 during high intensity rainfall peak however during dry season soil moisture and twi are strongly correlated having correlation coefficient 0 70 for agf and 0 91 for ga hillslope the ga hillslope shows stronger negative correlation with twi in comparison to agf hillslope however soil moisture has positive correlation with the soil hydraulic conductivity as high conductivity zones infiltrate more water in comparison to low conductivity zones as discussed earlier in section 3 1 hillslope soil moisture variability was strongly influenced by soil hydraulic conductivity in infiltration excess dominated hillslope at the beginning of the wet season the correlation strength is less than 0 4 fig 14c and 15c and this strength raised markedly after mid of the wet season as the hillslope contains more moisture during mid and end of the wet season the possible reason for getting higher correlation values may be due to the moisture holding of the soil at the beginning of the wet season all soil layers have low moisture content which increases with the passing of time water from the top soil layer drains and wet the deeper layers of soil therefore top soil do not hold much moisture during initial period for wet season however due to the moisture being stored at deeper layers during mid wet season water gets slower in the draining to downward layers therefore high soil moisture values can be observed over the mid of the monsoon fig 14a 15a these high soil moisture values results in higher correlation values with the hydraulic conductivity these arguments can be verified by analysing 5 min temporal scale correlation between soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity figs 17 and 18 analysis of 5 min data reveals that the correlation between soil hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture increases significantly just after every high intensity rainfall peak figs 17 and 18 fine scale correlation analysis of agf hillslope on 10th july 2017 event elucidated that correlation strength was quite low at the beginning of the wet season 0 3 however it raised instantaneously i e near to 1 only during high intensity rainfall peak but again returned to previous state after passing of rainfall peaks fig 17a these values of correlation were found to be very high as compared to the daily scale the reason for such behaviour is that the relationship between soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity at a higher temporal resolution is very unstable in other words this means that during rainfall peak the correlation increases very rapidly and further decreases after short time lag this decreased correlation while averaging on daily scale decreases the daily correlation values significantly even during high rainfall condition at the beginning of the wet season it can be seen from 31st august correlation plot that the correlation strength is greater than equal to 0 6 throughout the events as the soil retained more moisture in comparison to 10th july event fig 17b which results higher daily correlation value in month of august similar correlation pattern was also observed for ga hillslope fig 18a 18b for 26th june event the correlation value was observed to be less than equal to 0 2 before and few minutes after the rainfall peak whereas for 31st august event the minimum correlation value is 0 69 the grassed ga hillslope shows better correlation than the agro forested agf hillslope as the surface resistance of ga allows more water to infiltrate in high and medium conductivity zones correlation strength of soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity follows the trend of soil moisture however the twi follows opposite pattern 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological connectivity detailed analysis of all events indicated the spatial and temporal variation in runoff generating areas depends on the variability of hydraulic conductivity rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture conditions soil moisture rise was more in high conductivity zones in comparison to low conductivity zones at the beginning of the rainfall event indicating that the generation of runoff mainly from low conductivity zones as rainfall proceeds the instantaneous peak of soil moisture occurs in high conductivity zones at maximum rainfall intensity and then quickly recedes during high intensity events the maximum rainfall intensity tends to be greater than soil hydraulic conductivity of hillslope significant runoff conversion occurs at the outlet in comparison to low and medium intensity rainfall soil moisture rise was evenly distributed over hillslope during low and medium intensity events which result low runoff conversion at the outlet 1 the vegetation cover of ga hillslope allows more water to infiltrate results less hillslope runoff in comparison to agf hillslope bracken et al 2013 moreover extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity 5 mm h patches located near an outlet in agf hillslope whereas it was located at end portion in ga hillslope this may result in less runoff in ga hillslope the above mentioned discussion indicate that hydrological connectivity has a strong influence on hillslope runoff bracken croke 2007 sen et al 2010 other studies in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes also reported that hillslope connectivity is influenced by rainfall characteristics and soil hydraulic conductivity sen et al 2010 reaney et al 2007 they concluded that the lower conductivity zones mainly generated runoff at the beginning of the event moreover they mentioned that runoff is positively associated with rainfall intensity these phenomena are also observed in the present study for lesser himalayan hillslopes smith et al 2010 observed the stronger correlation between maximum rainfall intensity and runoff than the mean rainfall intensity smith et al 2010 and wainwright parsons 2002 discussed the role of surface resistance on hillslope runoff and observed that vegetation cover increases the re infiltration and breaks the hydrological connectivity over the hillslope which was also observed in the present study for ga hillslope cammeraat 2002 discussed the connectivity of runoff generating and runoff absorbing area and influence of vegetation initial soil moisture condition and rainfall intensity on the process of hydrological connectivity the vegetated area showed more infiltration contrast to bare crusted soil due to more surface resistance the organised vegetation pattern creates runoff absorbing zone over the hillslope which results in low runoff at the outlet the same impact of vegetation on surface runoff and infiltration was also observed in grassed hillslope of the present study 4 2 correlation analysis we used soil moisture variability to understand the hillslope hydrological connectivity famiglietti et al 1998 studied the soil moisture variability and its correlation with the topographic wetness index twi and soil properties in rattlesnake hill of texas usa the poor correlation was observed during high intensity rainfall event which was also noticed in the present study fig 16 this clearly shows that the topography have no significant effect during high intensity rainfall moreover they witnessed the negative correlation between slope component of twi and soil moisture because of infiltration excess runoff the present study also described the negative correlation between twi and soil moisture in infiltration excess dominated hillslope further they noticed the higher correlation value during dry season too minet et al 2011 measured soil moisture in five infiltration excess dominated agricultural fields of central belgium and luxembourg using a proximal off ground gpr system three out of five agricultural fields showed negative correlation with twi and the highest negative correlation was observed in walsdorf field in which driest part was situated near the field outlet in the present study also hillslope drainage lines were mostly located in low conductivity zones in ga hillslope and in low and medium conductivity zones in agf hillslope thus soil moisture variability of ga hillslope showed strong negative correlation with twi in comparison to agf hillslope in dry season the difference in correlation between agro forested and grassed hillslope can also be explained by runoff generating capacity of each hillslope the agf hillslope recorded more runoff at outlet thus resulted in high correlation in contrast to ga hillslope during wet season in most of the studies the coefficient of determination value rarely exceeded 0 5 and mainly ranged from 0 to 0 4 buchanan et al 2014 burt butcher 1985 tague et al 2010 western et al 2004 but in the present study the correlation value raised up to 0 8 which can be justified by usage of fine resolution dem of 0 5 m buchanan et al 2014 schmidt persson 2003 tague et al 2010 famiglietti et al 1998 also studied the soil moisture correlation with particle size distribution and porosity which are the indirect measure of soil hydraulic conductivity but unfortunately they did not have hydraulic conductivity data from correlation analysis they stated that soil moisture variability is highly correlated with soil hydraulic conductivity during wet condition but not saturated condition same revelation was also verified in the present study heterogeneous distribution of soil hydraulic conductivity significantly influence the soil moisture movement during wet season comparison to dry season the present study also observed notable dropped in correlation during dry season figs 14 15 4 3 practical implications detailed hillslope scale instrumentation in the lesser himalayan watershed is the first step towards creating hydrological data networks in the indian himalayan region ihr this ongoing project has generated better plot and hillslope scale hydrological process understanding in the himalayan region however more replication in this type of studies are required in future these datasets can be used to develop the conceptual hillslope models no hydrological connectivity was witnessed previously in the indian himalayan region ihr bracken et al 2013 the understanding of correlation analysis can be used for modelling and predicting of spatial variation in soil moisture and thus hillslope runoff further hillslope hydrological research can be up scaled to watershed scale 5 conclusions rainfall intensity soil hydraulic conductivity initial soil moisture condition and vegetation have a strong influence on hillslope hydrological connectivity only the high intensity rainfall converted 1 5 of rainfall into runoff otherwise the low and medium intensity rain events lead to less than 1 of runoff at the outlet the lower and upper portion of hillslope mainly contributed towards runoff but the upper portion runoff re infiltrated in middle portion due to high soil hydraulic conductivity and surface resistance particularly in grassed hillslope moreover the high conductivity zones show higher soil moisture slope during maximum rainfall intensity in comparison to lower conductivity zone on the basis of soil moisture rise in different conductivity zones this study identified the runoff contributing areas out of 72 topographic wetness index twi formulations the twi formed by the combination of rho8 and dsi 60cm found to be optimal followed by mmdg and dsi 1m for elaborating hillslope scale soil moisture dynamics further we identified the correlation between the spatial variability of soil moisture and optimal twi in grassed and agro forested hillslope the correlation obtained from this analysis has been helpful for understanding hillslope hydrological processes the negative correlation observed between twi and soil moisture in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes was explained by the presence of main streamline in low conductivity zones no correlation was observed between twi and soil moisture during high intensity rainfall peak twi was able to explain better soil moisture variation in the dry season than the wet season runoff generation amount has a direct influence on the correlation coefficient i e more runoff less moisture results high negative correlation between twi and soil moisture in agf hillslope than the ga hillslope under wet conditions however during dry seasons correlation strength of ga hillslope was stronger than the agf hillslope moreover it was found that soil moisture was positively correlated with soil hydraulic conductivity in infiltration excess dominated hillslopes and the strongest correlation strength was observed during mid wet season the dominant influence on hillslope soil moisture depends on degree of wetness conditions this detailed understanding of hillslope hydrological processes will help to develop the concept for watershed scale processes understanding declaration of

arithmetic of 106 84 mm fig 2 variations on average temperature fig 2a presented a seasonal cycle with low values during april to september and high values during october to march rh values were similar to the long term trend with the exception of 2014 whereby rh was lower than long term trend fig 2b precipitation amounts from 2014 to 2017 presented a large variation compared to the long term trend total 1461 mm in 2014 total precipitation was significantly lower than the long term total 890 mm with a net decrease of 30 in the wet season resulting in a strong drought over the southeast portion of the brazilian territory coelho et al 2016 precipitation amounts from 2015 to 2017 were similar to long term record 1430 mm 1397 mm and 1462 mm respectively presenting a moderate surplus during the dry season april and may fig 2c 4 2 isotopic composition of daily precipitation the isotopic composition of precipitation n 300 with total precipitation 0 2 mm presented a large variation

precipitation δ18o 6 during the wet season and enriched during the dry season δ18o 1 fig 4 a in agreement to seasonal variation based on monthly weighted isotopic composition fig 4b santos et al 2019a on monthly basis a negative and strong correlation between δ18o and amount precipitation r 0 69 was observed while a weak correlation between δ18o and monthly temperature r 0 28 was observed as previously mentioned by santos et al 2019a on daily basis variations presented a clear v shaped pattern with enriched values occurring mainly between july and august and depleted values between november february enrichment during wet to dry transitions reached values up to 5 fig 4c δ18o exhibited a weak spearman correlation with local meteorological parameters including on site amount precipitation prec r 0 20 and ambient temperature temp r 0 04 fig 5 stronger correlations were observed with regional parameters relative humidity rh tr r 0 52 and rainfall rainfall tr r 0 35 along the trajectory similar correlations were observed with δ2h due to large degree of collinearity between the isotopologues fig 5 in additional correlations for dry and wet season revealed no differences between the meteorological variables and isotopic values 5 discussions the strong drought at the beginning of 2014 is explained by the occurrence of a high pressure system over the southeast of brazil and a reduced number of sacz passages during summer coelho et al 2016 between 2015 and 2017 the occurrence of enso nov 14 may 16 and la niña august december 16 and october december 17 events affected the climatic conditions over the study area overall enso effects associated with the large scale processes and moisture transport vuille and werner 2005 santos et al 2019b over the isotopic composition of precipitation at seasonal and interannual scales were no significant la niña impacts over precipitation patterns are still unclear coelho et al 2002 barros et al 2008 however enso influence was significant for d excess values as observed in the lmwls variations as well as in the kruskal wallis tests performed the observed lower d excess values in 2014 were associated to the drought conditions and the atmospheric moisture available with a decrease in the evapotranspiration flux from amazonia region fig 1 sm reflected in the lowest values for rh fig 2b and amount precipitation fig 2c jasechko et al 2013 explained the decrease in d excess values as a result of a net decrease in terrestrial evapotranspiration along to the air masses pathways over the land surface changes in evapotranspiration fluxes along the air mass pathways do not explain the lowest d excess values observed in 2017 when heavy rainfall events were observed fig 4c and rh measured in the surface were higher than the observed in 2014 deuterium excess values in 2017 were most likely associated with variations in sst a negative anomaly of the sst over the moisture source fig 1 sm may be responsible for the lower observed values as proposed by jouzel et al 2013 as expected strong negative correlations between δ18o and amount precipitation were reported on monthly basis fig 4b vuille 2003 rozanski et al 1993 santos et al 2019a however on daily basis the correlation is reduced r 0 20 suggesting a direct link to cloud scale dynamics kurita et al 2009 the observed daily seasonal variations may be explained by other key drivers rather than the classical amount effect risi et al 2008 kurita et al 2009 aggarwal et al 2016 these other climatic controls may be associated to different moisture sources and transport of air masses atmospheric systems and rainfall type produce the seasonal variability over the isotopic composition of precipitation the moisture transport of air masses simulated by the hysplit model revealed that back trajectories for depleted rains δ18o 6 are mostly influenced by moisture transported from the amazon basin via llj and sacz the latter is evidenced by numerous trajectories up to 50 of them coming from central brazil 50 w 15 s toward the rainfall collection site fig 6 a the atmospheric composite analysis by ncep ncar reanalysis data shows that depleted rains were formed in an atmospheric environment with large availability of moisture as illustrated by precipitable water fig 6b and specific humidity fig 6c maps with lower olr values fig 6d and upward air motion fig 6e indicating lower level convergence and rain formation over the western amazonia and southeastern regions of brazil the convergence and upward motion resulted in moisture incorporation during the transport of air masses the lowest olr values coincided with negative values of omega 500 hpa over an area between the amazonia region and the southeast of brazil suggesting significant sacz activity overall the action of frontal systems combined with convective processes and stratiform rain formation resulted in depleted isotopic signatures of precipitation for enriched rains δ18o 1 the atlantic ocean appears as a more important moisture source with most of the trajectories coming from this region 35 w 15 s and passing over the northeastern region of brazil fig 7 a this moisture transport pattern occurred mainly during winter when the sash was closer to the continent and the moisture availability and specific humidity in the atmosphere were much lower when compared to the more depleted rains fig 7b and 7c the upward air motions were weaker occurring only in the southern and part of southeastern regions of brazil fig 7e sacz events were absent fig 7d and 7e due to a decrease in humidity transport from the amazonia region and the disorganization of the bh convective rains were formed in a relative drier atmosphere resulting in more enriched rainfall observed precipitation presented values between δ18o 6 and 1 fig 4b suggesting that both amazon and northeast moisture sources are associated to the observed variations fig 8 a they are associated to the same atmospheric processes of the depleted rains with decrease of sacz activity fig 8d and 8e however the moisture availability fig 8b and 8c is lower due to different atmospheric flow thus the large variability of δ18o values is explained by a combination of factors associated with the isotopic processes of the lower moisture availability and mixed moisture source finally the strong correlation between the isotopic composition and regional features such as rh tr and rainfall tr confirmed the important role of air masses transport available moisture and its residence time lawrence et al 2004 cobb et al 2007 aggarwal et al 2012 and the land evapotranspiration flux in the rainfall isotopic variability rozanski et al 1993 aggarwal et al 2012 of southeastern brazil 6 conclusion the isotopic composition of precipitation in the southeast region of brazil is mainly influenced by regional moisture recirculation processes as represented in the lmwl the distribution of δ18o values and the correlations with regional atmospheric parameters these recirculation processes occurring at different timescales resulted in interannual and seasonal variability in the isotopic ratios of rainfall depleted isotopic rainfall resulted from vapor recirculation processes in an atmosphere with large available moisture originated predominantly in the amazon basin the vapor recirculation occurs during the period of heating of the continental surface followed by the formation of frontal systems large influence of sacz ultimately resulting in large scale precipitation enriched rains occurred during the period of lower moisture availability from the atlantic ocean and mainly during a decrease of evapotranspiration flux from the amazonia basin with lower continental surface temperatures incursions of cold fronts and formation of convective rains our results highlight the importance of moisture availability and transport over continent in combination with different atmospheric systems as the most important key drivers affecting the isotopic composition of precipitation in southeastern brazil which has been confirmed by the correlation matrix with strong correlations between isotopes values and relative humidity along hysplit trajectory similarly d excess variations underpinned the influence of moisture availability variations and ssts in the atlantic ocean the weak correlation between δ18o and local meteorological parameters revealed the need of the detailed cloud domain information to constraint on site isotope variations this work

6017,climatic factors controlling seasonal and interannual changes of stable isotope composition in precipitation remains understudied across the tropics daily isotopic measurements of rainfall 2014 2017 rio claro southeast of brazil were used to identify the climatic factors governing the isotopic variability overall precipitation presented large variations ranging between 18 36 and 4 89 for δ18o 136 to 43 4 for δ2h and 11 8 to 26 6 for d excess the local meteoric water line δ2h 8 05 0 1 δ18o 13 08 0 5 indicated a strong influence of moisture recirculation along the transport of air masses during the summer wet season high moisture content prevailed in the atmosphere the latter was associated with recycled moisture from amazonia region due to the influence of the south atlantic convergence zone and frontal systems resulting in depleted precipitation δ18o 6 during the winter dry season the combination of cold fronts and minimal moisture transport from the amazonia region resulted in more enriched rainfall δ18o 1 atmospheric recirculation processes along the moisture pathway were also reflected on the seasonal d excess variation the strong correlation of δ18o and

an arithmetic mean of 21 2 c σ relative humidity rh ranged from 48 oct 14 to 83 july 13 with arithmetic mean of 71 7 and monthly precipitation ranged from 0 mm july 17 to 328 mm feb 15 with mean arithmetic of 106 84 mm fig 2 variations on average temperature fig 2a presented a seasonal cycle with low values during april to september and high values during october to march rh values were similar to the long term trend with the exception of 2014 whereby rh was lower than long term trend fig 2b precipitation amounts from 2014 to 2017 presented a large variation compared to the long term trend total 1461 mm in 2014 total precipitation was significantly lower than the long term total 890 mm with a net decrease of 30 in the wet season resulting in a strong drought over the southeast portion of the brazilian territory coelho et al 2016 precipitation amounts from 2015 to 2017 were similar to long term record 1430 mm 1397 mm and 1462 mm respectively presenting a moderate surplus during the dry season april and may fig 2c 4 2 isotopic composition of daily precipitation the isotopic composition of precipitation n 300 with total precipitation 0 2 mm presented a large variation δ18o values ranged from 18 36 to 4 89 mean value of 4 32 3 75 δ2h ranged from 136 to 43 4 mean value of 21 76 30 74 and d excess varied from 11 8 to 26 54 12 84 5 32 weighted average values were greater than the arithmetic mean 5 81 and 32 91 for δ18o and δ2h respectively annual variability in isotopic composition was characterized by small variations for δ18o δ2h and d excess averages values in 2017 more depleted and lower d excess values 5 16 30 55 10 74 were observed fig 3 b c d kruskal wallis statistical test indicated no significant differences between 2014 and 16 annual values for δ18o δ2h and d excess significant differences were reported only among the years in the d excess values with regard to 2017 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 05 0 1 δ18o 13 08 0 5 presented a slope similar to and an intercept slightly greater than the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 10 annual mwls plotted closely to the gmwl and lmwl with slopes between 7 7 and 8 3 and intercepts greater than 12 except for 2017 9 2 when the slope was closer to the gmwl fig 3a 4 3 seasonal variation in isotopic values the range of δ18o values was characterized by more depleted precipitation δ18o 6 during the wet season and enriched during the dry season δ18o 1 fig 4 a in agreement to seasonal variation based on monthly weighted isotopic composition fig 4b santos et al 2019a on monthly basis a negative and strong correlation between δ18o and amount precipitation r 0 69 was observed while a weak correlation between δ18o and monthly temperature r 0 28 was observed as previously mentioned by santos et al 2019a on daily basis variations presented a clear v shaped pattern with enriched values occurring mainly between july and august and depleted values between november february enrichment during wet to dry transitions reached values up to 5 fig 4c δ18o exhibited a weak spearman correlation with local meteorological parameters including on site amount precipitation prec r 0 20 and ambient temperature temp r 0 04 fig 5 stronger correlations were observed with regional parameters relative humidity rh tr r 0 52 and rainfall rainfall tr r 0 35 along the trajectory similar correlations were observed with δ2h due to large degree of collinearity between the isotopologues fig 5 in additional correlations for dry and wet season revealed no differences between the meteorological variables and isotopic values 5 discussions the strong drought at the beginning of 2014 is explained by the occurrence of a high pressure system over the southeast of brazil and a reduced number of sacz passages during summer coelho et al 2016 between 2015 and 2017 the occurrence of enso nov 14 may 16 and la niña august december 16 and october december 17 events affected the climatic conditions over the study area overall enso effects associated with the large scale processes and moisture transport vuille and werner 2005 santos et al 2019b over the isotopic composition of precipitation at seasonal and interannual scales were no significant la niña impacts over precipitation patterns are still unclear coelho et al 2002 barros et al 2008 however enso influence was significant for d excess values as observed in the lmwls variations as well as in the kruskal wallis tests performed the observed lower d excess values in 2014 were associated to the drought conditions and the atmospheric moisture available with a decrease in the evapotranspiration flux from amazonia region fig 1 sm reflected in the lowest values for rh fig 2b and amount precipitation fig 2c jasechko et al 2013 explained the decrease in d excess values as a result of a net decrease in terrestrial evapotranspiration along to the air masses pathways over the land surface changes in evapotranspiration fluxes along the air mass pathways do not explain the lowest d excess values observed in 2017 when heavy rainfall events were observed fig 4c and rh measured in the surface were higher than the observed in 2014 deuterium excess values in 2017 were most likely associated with variations in sst a negative anomaly of the sst over the moisture source fig 1 sm may be responsible for the lower observed values as proposed by jouzel et al 2013 as expected strong negative correlations between δ18o and amount precipitation were reported on monthly basis fig 4b vuille 2003 rozanski et al 1993 santos et al 2019a however on daily basis the correlation is reduced r 0 20 suggesting a direct link to cloud scale dynamics kurita et al 2009 the observed daily seasonal variations may be explained by other key drivers rather than the classical amount effect risi et al 2008 kurita et al 2009 aggarwal et al 2016 these other climatic controls may be associated to different moisture sources and transport of air masses atmospheric systems and rainfall type produce the seasonal variability over the isotopic composition of precipitation the moisture transport of air masses simulated by the hysplit model revealed that back trajectories for depleted rains δ18o 6 are mostly influenced by moisture transported from the amazon basin via llj and sacz the latter is evidenced by numerous trajectories up to 50 of them coming from central brazil 50 w 15 s toward the rainfall collection site fig 6 a the atmospheric composite analysis by ncep ncar reanalysis data shows that depleted rains were formed in an atmospheric environment with large availability of moisture as illustrated by precipitable water fig 6b and specific humidity fig 6c maps with lower olr values fig 6d and upward air motion fig 6e indicating lower level convergence and rain formation over the western amazonia and southeastern regions of brazil the convergence and upward motion resulted in moisture incorporation during the transport of air masses the lowest olr values coincided with negative values of omega 500 hpa over an area between the amazonia region and the southeast of brazil suggesting significant sacz activity overall the action of frontal systems combined with convective processes and stratiform rain formation resulted in depleted isotopic signatures of precipitation for enriched rains δ18o 1 the atlantic ocean appears as a more important moisture source with most of the trajectories coming from this region 35 w 15 s and passing over the northeastern region of brazil fig 7 a this moisture transport pattern occurred mainly during winter when the sash was closer to the continent and the moisture availability and specific humidity in the atmosphere were much lower when compared to the more depleted rains fig 7b and 7c the upward air motions were weaker occurring only in the southern and part of southeastern regions of brazil fig 7e sacz events were absent fig 7d and 7e due to a decrease in humidity transport from the amazonia region and the disorganization of the bh convective rains were formed in a relative drier atmosphere resulting in more enriched rainfall observed precipitation presented values between δ18o 6 and 1 fig 4b suggesting that both amazon and northeast moisture sources are associated to the observed variations fig 8 a they are associated to the same atmospheric processes of the depleted rains with decrease of sacz activity fig 8d and 8e however the moisture availability fig 8b and 8c is lower due to different atmospheric flow thus the large variability of δ18o values is explained by a combination of factors associated with the isotopic processes of the lower moisture availability and mixed moisture source finally the strong correlation between the isotopic composition and regional features such as rh tr and rainfall tr confirmed the important role of air masses transport available moisture and its residence time lawrence et al 2004 cobb et al 2007 aggarwal et al 2012 and the land evapotranspiration flux in the rainfall isotopic variability rozanski et al 1993 aggarwal et al 2012 of southeastern brazil 6 conclusion the isotopic composition of precipitation in the southeast region of brazil is mainly influenced by regional moisture recirculation processes as represented in the lmwl the distribution of δ18o values and the correlations with regional atmospheric parameters these recirculation processes occurring at different timescales resulted in interannual and seasonal variability in the isotopic ratios of rainfall depleted isotopic rainfall resulted from vapor recirculation processes in an atmosphere with large available moisture originated predominantly in the amazon basin the vapor recirculation occurs during the period of heating of the continental surface followed by the formation of frontal systems large influence of sacz ultimately resulting in large scale precipitation enriched rains occurred during the period of lower moisture availability from the atlantic ocean and mainly during a decrease of evapotranspiration flux from the amazonia basin with lower continental surface temperatures incursions of cold fronts and formation of convective rains our results highlight the importance of moisture availability and transport over continent in combination with different atmospheric systems as the most important key drivers affecting the isotopic composition of precipitation in southeastern brazil which has been confirmed by the correlation matrix with strong correlations between isotopes values and relative humidity along hysplit trajectory similarly d excess variations underpinned the influence of moisture availability variations and ssts in the atlantic ocean the weak correlation between δ18o and local meteorological parameters revealed the need of the detailed cloud domain information to constraint on site isotope variations this work ultimately contributes to the generation of rainfall isotope data that can be used in future paleoclimatic interpretations and a better understanding of groundwater recharge processes within one of

6018,carbon dioxide co2 emissions from rivers are a vital part of the global carbon budget however data from subtropical areas especially in the headwater streams are scare spatiotemporal dynamics and drives of partial pressure of co2 pco2 and water air co2 fluxes fco2 in a monsoonal headwater stream jinshui river of the yangtze were unraveled our findings suggested that natural process i e hydrology co2 outgassing and lithology and human activities were recognized as significant players in regulating the variability of riverine pco2 the mean pco2 was significantly higher in the dry season 1562 975 µatm than the wet season 834 639 µatm seasonal trends of pco2 were controlled by in situ biogenic activities and rainfall events the slight fluctuations of pco2 from upstream to downstream along main stem implied the mixed influences of distinct water environments and anthropogenic disturbance correlation analysis showed that environmental factors i e temperature ph tn and doc were relevant to pronounced spatial and seasonal variability of pco2 we highlighted that high water air co2 flux was estimated at 343 413 mmol m2 d dry 542 477 mmol m2 d vs wet 192 278 mmol m2 d in the monsoonal headwater stream and the watershed scale carbon budget demonstrated carbon loss via atmospheric exchange was 1 2 times the riverine dissolved carbon export our results would fill a large gap in the headwater stream of the yangtze and help to accurately estimate the regional to global co2 outgassing from rivers to the atmosphere keywords carbon degassing the yangtze river partial pressure of co2 spatial temporal variation water air gas exchange 1 introduction river networks cover 0 2 0 3 of the land surface yet are thought to play a crucial biogeochemical role in the global carbon cycling butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 river carbon export acts as a pathway linking land and the ocean besides the fluvial discharge it also degases carbon dioxide co2 to the atmosphere via the water air interface wallin et al 2013 numerous studies demonstrated that a majority of freshwater ecosystems tended to be supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium indicating a significant source of atmospheric co2 cole et al 2007 li et al 2012 abril et al 2014 borges et al 2015 ran et al 2015a recent estimates indicated an evasion of 0 56 1 8 pg c co2 y from global rivers and streams aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 highly variable estimations and large uncertainty of regional to global estimates of co2 fluxes implied lacking of complete spatiotemporal coverage of basic data therefore the quantification of co2 efflux from rivers to the atmosphere at catchment scale is extremely important in evaluating carbon budget at regional to global scales partial pressure of aqueous co2 in rivers is recognized as an important parameter in estimating co2 outgassing it represents the direction and intensity of gas exchange at the water to air interface and also reflects both in situ carbon dynamics and biogeochemical processes in the catchment terrestrial ecosystems aucour et al 1999 richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 li et al 2013 2018 the sources of aqueous co2 in rivers originated largely from mineralization decomposition of terrestrial organic matter and aquatic respiration yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 moreover drivers of pco2 dynamics in inland waters were complex and influenced by the physical chemical and biological factors beaulieu et al 2013 peter et al 2014 worldwide studies on rivers demonstrated higher pco2 levels than the atmosphere above the water surface including the amazon richey et al 2002 abril et al 2014 ottawa the mississippi rivers dubois et al 2010 and the yangtze lu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 ran et al 2017 suggesting a great potential of co2 emission richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 li et al 2013 2018 however few studies have examined pco2 in headwater streams in asia lee et al 2017 marx et al 2017 juhlke et al 2019 indeed rivers with 100 m width made up 90 for the total length of river networks and might account for 80 of the co2 outgassing flux within individual basin mayorga et al 2005 rasera et al 2008 tributaries were moreover likely to have higher co2 fluxes because that more rapid mixing with the benthic substrate and high turbulence might accelerate the water to air carbon exchange dinsmore et al 2011 hence pco2 and co2 degassing fluxes in whole river system could be misestimated if the estimation was conducted only on large main stem river systems it is urgent to better quantify carbon evasion in the river systems using high spatial resolution samplings especially in streams current studies on carbon export in the yangtze river systems focused on large main stem and demonstrated high pco2 and thus high carbon emissions li et al 2012 2018 huang et al 2015 ran et al 2015a 2017 liu et al 2017 so far little was reported about co2 emission from low order of tributaries in this region especially in the headwater streams however headwater streams tended to show high co2 emissions due to a strong hydrologic connection with steep topography crawford et al 2013 therefore the computation of riverine co2 evasion of the entire yangtze basin would be under estimated using the field data in the main stem we thus performed a high spatial resolution investigation on aqueous pco2 in a monsoonal headwater stream the jinshui river of the yangtze previous studies focused on water quality tan et al 2017 heavy metals li and zhang 2010 carbon isotope in particulate matter wang et al 2015 and nitrogen li et al 2009 our main objectives were to 1 examine the spatiotemporal variability of pco2 and the water air interface co2 flux and 2 unravel the underlying drivers of these dynamics we test the hypotheses of 1 obvious spatiotemporal shifts in pco2 due to mixed effects of natural and anthropogenic contributions and 2 higher co2 emission rate in the headwater stream 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the jinshui river 31 16 34 45 n 107 40 108 10 e is a headwater stream of the

was characterized by obvious variations in pco2 fig 4 a and supplementary tables s1 and s2 the pco2 spanned more than one order of magnitude across the catchment ranging between 100 µatm and 4000 µatm approximately 85 sampling sites were greater than that of the atmosphere 410 µatm the total mean pco2 was 1147 874 µatm being about triple times the atmospheric pco2 fig 4a from upstream to downstream a slightly decrease in pco2 was observed as water flows it is worth noting that the instantaneous maximum 4180 µatm and minimum 110 µatm of pco2 occurred in site 3 in the upper stream and site 12 in the downstream respectively the pco2 averages were comparable between main stem 1171 935 µatm and tributary 1079 679 µatm with lager variations in the main stem in addition the median pco2 in the main

than the average of 834 639 µatm in the wet season 110 3406 µatm the under saturated pco2 samples 410 µatm primarily occurred in the high flow period moreover it is worthwhile that the significant

slightly higher in the tributaries 256 mmol m2 d than the main stem 224 mmol m2 d fig 4b there was a clearly seasonal variation in fco2 with much higher average in the dry season 542 447 mmol m2 d than the wet season 193 278 mmol m2 d p 0 001 by mann whitney u test fig 4b there were larger variations of fco2 in the dry season 44 to 1960 mmol m2 d than in the wet season 152 to 1286 mmol m2 d table s1 4 discussion 4 1 controls on aqueous pco2 the aqueous pco2 was positively related to influx of soil co2 in situ respiration and decomposition of organic carbon whereas conversely linked to the photosynthesis and co2 evasion from water to air yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 2013 these key processes that were governed by a variety of factors including aquatic environment basin characteristics hydro climatology davies et al 2003 gruber et al 2004 li et al 2013 2018 peter et al 2014 resulted in the clear seasonal and spatial pco2 shifts fig 4a table s1 consistent with our first hypothesis our findings showed much higher pco2 values in the dry season than the wet season fig 4a table s1 this pattern was similar to the temporal changes in other monsoonal rivers such as longchuan river in upper yangtze li et al 2012 and mekong river li et al 2013 previous studies reported that effects of rainfall events on pco2 depended on soil components and rainfall intensity yao et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 marotta et al 2010 li et al 2012 2013 in the wet season with proper temperature and wetted soils via precipitation bacterial activities could promote soil respiration and thus increased soil co2 flushing yao et al 2007 peter et al 2014 varol and li 2017 biodegradation and decomposition of the labile fractions toward the top soil layers via runoff marotta et al 2010 ran et al 2015b were also an important source for dissolved co2 however monsoonal rains particularly heavy rainfall concentrated during may october after a long dry period in the basin 1 2 0 6 m s in wet season vs 0 7 0 6 m s in dry season the long term and high intensity flood season had offset the contribution of soil co2 flushing inputs and the dilution was more remarkable in controlling riverine pco2 this was reflected by the negative relationships of pco2 flow velocity in the wet season r 0 37 p 0 05 table 1 yao et al 2007 li et al 2013 2018 ran et al 2015b varol and li 2017 therefore pco2 levels were significantly higher in the dry season with respect to the wet season fig 4 supplementary table s1 dilution of precipitation on riverine pco2 was also substantiated by monthly shifts of pco2 oct aug jun table s1 the more storms in the monsoonal summer season resulted in lowest level in june much higher level occurred in october as rainfall decreased furthermore in situ respiration and degradation of organic materials that occur in parallel more or less contributed to the monthly and seasonal variability of pco2 wolfgang et al 1996 yao et al 2007 delille 2012 lu et al 2012 li et al 2013 though the significant relationships between pco2 and do were not found table 1 moreover the regional lithology coupled with hydrograph was another potential reason for regulating aquatic pco2 suchet et al 2003 hartmann et al 2009 nienhauser 2015 thorley et al 2015 the significant influence of bed rock weathering on alkalinity was found in global rivers suchet et al 2003 hartmann et al 2009 humborg et al 2010 thorley et al 2015 particularly the abundant carbonates could sustain riverine high pco2 super saturation suchet et al 2003 goudie and viles 2012 although this process was normally ignored for regional riverine pco2 studies in our study with widespread presence of silicates bedrock geology he et al 2011 low rate of the silicate weathering potentially showed limited contribution to the elevated alkalinity and pco2 overall temporal dynamics of water pco2 were contributed by physical and biogeochemical processes mentioned above anthropogenic activities have been proposed as an important driver in sustaining spatial heterogeneity of aquatic pco2 gruber et al 2004 salam and noguchi 2005 yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 human practices not only increased carbon and nutrient inputs into rivers but also altered surrounding environments gruber et al 2004 salam and noguchi 2005 olah et al 2011 in our study pco2 increased when rivers flowed through densely populated areas i e site 3 with much higher pco2 average site 3 had highest tp and higher tn fig 4a previous studies also reported elevated nutrient concentrations caused by urbanization disturbances increased the in situ respiration and further boosted the pco2 level in the rivers as indicated by significant relationships of pco2 tn table 1 davies et al 2003 on the other hand limited urban and agriculture lands were distributed along the river networks more nutrients substances entered the river downstream bu et al 2015 chen 2017 as a result of increases in the nutrient loads photosynthesis in the aquatic ecosystem might be boosted and thus decreased the pco2 level davies et al 2003 wang et al 2007 li et al 2014 which could explain lower pco2 in site 12 site 12 showed highest tn and higher tp fig 4a the increasing loads of organic matter and nutrients due to anthropogenic inputs could change the dynamics of photosynthesis and respiration in aquatic ecosystems resulting in heterogeneous patterns of pco2 in heterotrophic rivers falkowski 1994 tare et al 2003 controls of increased c and nutrients from human activities on pco2 and fluvial net productivity chla plankton gross primarily production and respiration are urgently unraveled under the global environmental change 4 2 correlations with environmental factors we intended to provide insights into couplings between environmental factors and riverine pco2 dynamics using multivariate statistics a weak correlation was found in dry season table 1 this was in good agreement with previous studies pinho et al 2016 ni et al 2019 collinearity of hydrological regime biological processes and water quality masked their relationships pinho et al 2016 ni et al 2019 channel hydrology partly controlled riverine pco2 as observed in the yangtze and yellow river systems yao et al 2007 ran et al 2015b as reflected by the significant seasonal pco2 variability fig 4a table s1 our study found that varied patterns existed between pco2 and flow velocity with significant negative correlations in wet season r 0 37 p 0 05 table 1 the fact cloud be partially explained by the different effects of rainfall on riverine pco2 yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 peter et al 2014 in the early season before the large flood pco2 increased nonlinearly with increasing river discharge that carried soil co2 however the concentrated precipitation would dilute riverine pco2 afterwards 1 2 0 6 m s in wet season vs 0 7 0 6 m s in dry season yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 peter et al 2014 besides the dilution effect the fast flow velocity and thus increasing water turbulence understandably enhanced the gas transfer velocity and co2 degassing as well as reduced metabolisms i e in situ respiration and decomposition of organic carbon wanninkhof 1992 tremblay 2005 yao et al 2007 lapierre et al 2013 further resulting in lower pco2 nutrient concentrations greatly affected by urbanization and human activities directly or indirectly altered the balance of aquatic biological co2 production and consumption process falkowski 1994 faria et al 2012 li et al 2012 in the jinshui river significant associations between pco2 and tn r 0 33 p 0 05 in the wet season suggested that the respiration would be stimulated by elevated tn concentration and thus increased pco2 falkowski 1994 faria et al 2012 li et al 2012 the multiple linear regression analyses showed that the dependent variable of pco2 was a function of independent variables tn and twater pco2 261 0twater 71 1tn 1814 7 r2 0 29 p 0 01 while the variance explained was not high this could support the above view that tn and twater regulated the riverine pco2 table 1 however collinearity of physical and biogeochemical characteristics may be masked in the dry season pco2 tn r 0 07 p 0 05 pco2 twater r 0 12 p 0 05 pinho et al 2016 ni et al 2019 our findings therefore highlighted the importance of hydrology i e precipitation and runoff in understanding riverine pco2 which were in good agreement with previous observations strobl et al 2009 ni et al 2019 4 3 comparison with other water areas numerous studies showed that most of the world s rivers were supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmosphere helie et al 2002 salam and noguchi 2005 humborg et al 2010 wang et al 2011 li et al 2012 2018 raymond et al 2012 wang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 nienhauser 2015 lee et al 2017 liu et al 2017 marx et al 2017 ran et al 2017 the water air co2 exchange was closely relevant to gas transfer velocity jähne et al 1987 wanninkhof 1992 alin et al 2011 the gas transfer velocity is highly dependent on several factors such as wind speed flow velocity channel slope and water depth jähne et al 1987 aucour et al 1999 raymond et al 2012 gaalfalk et al 2014 hence the magnitude of k varied considerably as these physical controls drastically changed jähne et al 1987 raymond et al 2012 gaalfalk et al 2014 in this study the k values varied from 4 9 to 24 5 m d with an average of 11 1 4 5 m d higher than the value used in the st lawrence 3 6 m d yang et al 1996 and longchuan river 1 9 m d li et al 2012 table 2 however our k value fell within the range of a complication of global data raymond et al 2012 looman et al 2016 and was comparable to the k from floating chamber method in the river networks of yangtze li et al 2019 and yellow rivers ran et al 2015b due to the differences in catchment physical characteristics and water chemistry discrepancies in the controls and maintenance mechanisms of pco2 resulted in highly variable co2 flux ca 8 559 mmol m2 d table 2 it was noticeable that the lower order stream might have much higher evasion rate of co2 owing to the more rapid mixing with the benthic substrate and high turbulence which largely enhanced the gas transfer velocity dinsmore et al 2011 this view was evidenced by our study consistent with the second hypothesis the jinshui river exhibited higher fco2 mean 343 413 mmol m2 d than the average in nature rivers as well as other rivers table 2 estimating that the water surface area of the jinshui river covers 0 4 of the land area in the drainage basin the river with a water surface area about 3 96 km2 released an average annual flux of 5 96 109 g c co2 y to the atmosphere mean co2 flux 343 413 mmol m2 d the annual exports of dic and doc from the jinshui river were 3 93 109 g c y and 1 04 109 g c y respectively surface runoff of 8 6 m3 s is considered chen 2017 previous studies found that the dic fluxes were attributed to soil respiration and mineral weathering meybeck 1982 telmer and veizer 1999 the carbon loss via water air interface exchange was 118 2 of the riverine dissolved carbon discharge dic doc and this percentage was much higher than most of the world s rivers such as st lawrence 1 0 yang et al 1996 mississippi 89 3 dubois et al 2010 and yangtze rivers 38 8 ni et al 2019 and lower than the amazon river 768 6 richey et al 2002 while it was comparable to the yukong river 117 3 striegl et al 2012 supplementary table s3 thus the high co2 flux from the monsoonal headstream to the atmosphere was critical for quantifying the co2 budget of the river 5 conclusion there is an increasing consensus that co2 degassing from inland waters to atmosphere contributes significantly to regional and global carbon cycle our study stressed the importance of co2 efflux from headwater streams pco2 averaged 1147 874 µatm and 83 of samplings were supersaturated with co2 in the jinshui river the river therefore acted as an atmospheric co2 source with an average of 343 413 mmol m2 d the estimated emission 5 96 109 g c co2 y was about 1 2 times of riverine dissolved carbon delivery the pronounced spatiotemporal shifts of pco2 were largely contributable to hydrology human activities and in situ biological process there were strong relationships between aqueous pco2 and water temperature and total nitrogen in the wet season but very weak relations in the dry season more attention should be paid to underline the key drivers of riverine pco2 and the importance of co2 evasion from headwater streams in the regional to global carbon cycles declaration of competing

6018,carbon dioxide co2 emissions from rivers are a vital part of the global carbon budget however data from subtropical areas especially in the headwater streams are scare spatiotemporal dynamics and drives of partial pressure of co2 pco2 and water air co2 fluxes fco2 in a monsoonal headwater stream jinshui river of the yangtze were unraveled our findings suggested that natural process i e hydrology co2 outgassing and lithology and human activities were recognized as significant players in regulating the variability of riverine pco2 the mean pco2 was significantly higher in the dry season 1562 975 µatm than the wet season 834 639 µatm seasonal trends of pco2 were controlled by in situ biogenic activities and rainfall events the slight fluctuations of pco2 from upstream to downstream along main stem implied the mixed influences of distinct water environments and anthropogenic disturbance correlation analysis showed that environmental factors i e temperature ph tn and doc were relevant to pronounced spatial and seasonal variability of pco2 we highlighted that high water air co2 flux was estimated at 343 413 mmol m2 d dry 542 477 mmol m2 d vs wet 192 278 mmol m2 d in the monsoonal headwater stream and the watershed scale carbon budget demonstrated carbon loss via atmospheric exchange was 1 2 times the riverine dissolved carbon export our results would fill a large gap in the headwater stream of the yangtze and help to accurately estimate the regional to global co2 outgassing from rivers to the atmosphere keywords carbon degassing the yangtze river partial pressure of co2 spatial temporal variation water air gas exchange 1 introduction river networks cover 0 2 0 3 of the land surface yet are thought to play a crucial biogeochemical role in the global carbon cycling butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 river carbon export acts as a pathway linking land and the ocean besides the fluvial discharge it also degases carbon dioxide co2 to the atmosphere via the water air interface wallin et al 2013 numerous studies demonstrated that a majority of freshwater ecosystems tended to be supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium indicating a significant source of atmospheric co2 cole et al 2007 li et al 2012 abril et al 2014 borges et al 2015 ran et al 2015a recent estimates indicated an evasion of 0 56 1 8 pg c co2 y from global rivers and streams aufdenkampe et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 highly variable estimations and large uncertainty of regional to global estimates of co2 fluxes implied lacking of complete spatiotemporal coverage of basic data therefore the quantification of co2 efflux from rivers to the atmosphere at catchment scale is extremely important in evaluating carbon budget at regional to global scales partial pressure of aqueous co2 in rivers is recognized as an important parameter in estimating co2 outgassing it represents the direction and intensity of gas exchange at the water to air interface and also reflects both in situ carbon dynamics and biogeochemical processes in the catchment terrestrial ecosystems aucour et al 1999 richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 li et al 2013 2018 the sources of aqueous co2 in rivers originated largely from mineralization decomposition of terrestrial organic matter and aquatic respiration yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 moreover drivers of pco2 dynamics in inland waters were complex and influenced by the physical chemical and biological factors beaulieu et al 2013 peter et al 2014 worldwide studies on rivers demonstrated higher pco2 levels than the atmosphere above the water surface including the amazon richey et al 2002 abril et al 2014 ottawa the mississippi rivers dubois et al 2010 and the yangtze lu et al 2012 liu et al 2016 ran et al 2017 suggesting a great potential of co2 emission richey et al 2002 yao et al 2007 li et al 2013 2018 however few studies have examined pco2 in headwater streams in asia lee et al 2017 marx et al 2017 juhlke et al 2019 indeed rivers with 100 m width made up 90 for the total length of river networks and might account for 80 of the co2 outgassing flux within individual basin mayorga et al 2005 rasera et al 2008 tributaries were moreover likely to have higher co2 fluxes because that more rapid mixing with the benthic substrate and high turbulence might accelerate the water to air carbon exchange dinsmore et al 2011 hence pco2 and co2 degassing fluxes in whole river system could be misestimated if the estimation was conducted only on large main stem river systems it is urgent to better quantify carbon evasion in the river systems using high spatial resolution samplings especially in streams current studies on carbon export in the yangtze river systems focused on large main stem and demonstrated high pco2 and thus high carbon emissions li et al 2012 2018 huang et al 2015 ran et al 2015a 2017 liu et al 2017 so far little was reported about co2 emission from low order of tributaries in this region especially in the headwater streams however headwater streams tended to show high co2 emissions due to a strong hydrologic connection with steep topography crawford et al 2013 therefore the computation of riverine co2 evasion of the entire yangtze basin would be under estimated using the field data in the main stem we thus performed a high spatial resolution investigation on aqueous pco2 in a monsoonal headwater stream the jinshui river of the yangtze previous studies focused on water quality tan et al 2017 heavy metals li and zhang 2010 carbon isotope in particulate matter wang et al 2015 and nitrogen li et al 2009 our main objectives were to 1 examine the spatiotemporal variability of pco2 and the water air interface co2 flux and 2 unravel the underlying drivers of these dynamics we test the hypotheses of 1 obvious spatiotemporal shifts in pco2 due to mixed effects of natural and anthropogenic contributions and 2 higher co2 emission rate in the headwater stream 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the jinshui river 31 16 34 45 n 107 40 108 10 e is a headwater stream of the

was characterized by obvious variations in pco2 fig 4 a and supplementary tables s1 and s2 the pco2 spanned more than one order of magnitude across the catchment ranging between 100 µatm and 4000 µatm approximately 85 sampling sites were greater than that of the atmosphere 410 µatm the total mean pco2 was 1147 874 µatm being about triple times the atmospheric pco2 fig 4a from upstream to downstream a slightly decrease in pco2 was observed as water flows it is worth noting that the instantaneous maximum 4180 µatm and minimum 110 µatm of pco2 occurred in site 3 in the upper stream and site 12 in the downstream respectively the pco2 averages were comparable between main stem 1171 935 µatm and tributary 1079 679 µatm with lager variations in the main stem in addition the median pco2 in the main stem 1128 µatm was higher than the tributary 852 µatm fig 4a significant seasonal changes in pco2 were observed fig 4a the pco2 averaged 1562 975 µatm in the dry season 295 4180 µatm 2 fold higher than the average of 834 639 µatm in the wet season 110 3406 µatm the under saturated pco2 samples 410 µatm primarily occurred in the high flow period moreover it is worthwhile that the significant seasonal variations occurred in the main stem p 0 01 rather than in the tributaries p 0 12 3 4 water atmosphere co2 fluxes co2 areal flux via water air interface showed remarkable spatiotemporal variations fig 4b and supplementary tables s1 and s2 the fco2 was on average 343 413 mmol m2 d using the entire data including main stem and tributaries the fco2 along the main stem varied between 208 218 mmol m2 d site 12 and 937 825 mmol m2 d site 3 fig 4b the average fco2 was slightly higher in the main stem 352 443 mmol m2 d than in the tributaries 316 217 mmol m2 d the median fco2 was however slightly higher in the tributaries 256 mmol m2 d than the main stem 224 mmol m2 d fig 4b there was a clearly seasonal variation in fco2 with much higher average in the dry season 542 447 mmol m2 d than the wet season 193 278 mmol m2 d p 0 001 by mann whitney u test fig 4b there were larger variations of fco2 in the dry season 44 to 1960 mmol m2 d than in the wet season 152 to 1286 mmol m2 d table s1 4 discussion 4 1 controls on aqueous pco2 the aqueous pco2 was positively related to influx of soil co2 in situ respiration and decomposition of organic carbon whereas conversely linked to the photosynthesis and co2 evasion from water to air yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 2013 these key processes that were governed by a variety of factors including aquatic environment basin characteristics hydro climatology davies et al 2003 gruber et al 2004 li et al 2013 2018 peter et al 2014 resulted in the clear seasonal and spatial pco2 shifts fig 4a table s1 consistent with our first hypothesis our findings showed much higher pco2 values in the dry season than the wet season fig 4a table s1 this pattern was similar to the temporal changes in other monsoonal rivers such as longchuan river in upper yangtze li et al 2012 and mekong river li et al 2013 previous studies reported that effects of rainfall events on pco2 depended on soil components and rainfall intensity yao et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 marotta et al 2010 li et al 2012 2013 in the wet season with proper temperature and wetted soils via precipitation bacterial activities could promote soil respiration and thus increased soil co2 flushing yao et al 2007 peter et al 2014 varol and li 2017 biodegradation and decomposition of the labile fractions toward the top soil layers via runoff marotta et al 2010 ran et al 2015b were also an important source for dissolved co2 however monsoonal rains particularly heavy rainfall concentrated during may october after a long dry period in the basin 1 2 0 6 m s in wet season vs 0 7 0 6 m s in dry season the long term and high intensity flood season had offset the contribution of soil co2 flushing inputs and the dilution was more remarkable in controlling riverine pco2 this was reflected by the negative relationships of pco2 flow velocity in the wet season r 0 37 p 0 05 table 1 yao et al 2007 li et al 2013 2018 ran et al 2015b varol and li 2017 therefore pco2 levels were significantly higher in the dry season with respect to the wet season fig 4 supplementary table s1 dilution of precipitation on riverine pco2 was also substantiated by monthly shifts of pco2 oct aug jun table s1 the more storms in the monsoonal summer season resulted in lowest level in june much higher level occurred in october as rainfall decreased furthermore in situ respiration and degradation of organic materials that occur in parallel more or less contributed to the monthly and seasonal variability of pco2 wolfgang et al 1996 yao et al 2007 delille 2012 lu et al 2012 li et al 2013 though the significant relationships between pco2 and do were not found table 1 moreover the regional lithology coupled with hydrograph was another potential reason for regulating aquatic pco2 suchet et al 2003 hartmann et al 2009 nienhauser 2015 thorley et al 2015 the significant influence of bed rock weathering on alkalinity was found in global rivers suchet et al 2003 hartmann et al 2009 humborg et al 2010 thorley et al 2015 particularly the abundant carbonates could sustain riverine high pco2 super saturation suchet et al 2003 goudie and viles 2012 although this process was normally ignored for regional riverine pco2 studies in our study with widespread presence of silicates bedrock geology he et al 2011 low rate of the silicate weathering potentially showed limited contribution to the elevated alkalinity and pco2 overall temporal dynamics of water pco2 were contributed by physical and biogeochemical processes mentioned above anthropogenic activities have been proposed as an important driver in sustaining spatial heterogeneity of aquatic pco2 gruber et al 2004 salam and noguchi 2005 yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 human practices not only increased carbon and nutrient inputs into rivers but also altered surrounding environments gruber et al 2004 salam and noguchi 2005 olah et al 2011 in our study pco2 increased when rivers flowed through densely populated areas i e site 3 with much higher pco2 average site 3 had highest tp and higher tn fig 4a previous studies also reported elevated nutrient concentrations caused by urbanization disturbances increased the in situ respiration and further boosted the pco2 level in the rivers as indicated by significant relationships of pco2 tn table 1 davies et al 2003 on the other hand limited urban and agriculture lands were distributed along the river networks more nutrients substances entered the river downstream bu et al 2015 chen 2017 as a result of increases in the nutrient loads photosynthesis in the aquatic ecosystem might be boosted and thus decreased the pco2 level davies et al 2003 wang et al 2007 li et al 2014 which could explain lower pco2 in site 12 site 12 showed highest tn and higher tp fig 4a the increasing loads of organic matter and nutrients due to anthropogenic inputs could change the dynamics of photosynthesis and respiration in aquatic ecosystems resulting in heterogeneous patterns of pco2 in heterotrophic rivers falkowski 1994 tare et al 2003 controls of increased c and nutrients from human activities on pco2 and fluvial net productivity chla plankton gross primarily production and respiration are urgently unraveled under the global environmental change 4 2 correlations with environmental factors we intended to provide insights into couplings between environmental factors and riverine pco2 dynamics using multivariate statistics a weak correlation was found in dry season table 1 this was in good agreement with previous studies pinho et al 2016 ni et al 2019 collinearity of hydrological regime biological processes and water quality masked their relationships pinho et al 2016 ni et al 2019 channel hydrology partly controlled riverine pco2 as observed in the yangtze and yellow river systems yao et al 2007 ran et al 2015b as reflected by the significant seasonal pco2 variability fig 4a table s1 our study found that varied patterns existed between pco2 and flow velocity with significant negative correlations in wet season r 0 37 p 0 05 table 1 the fact cloud be partially explained by the different effects of rainfall on riverine pco2 yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 peter et al 2014 in the early season before the large flood pco2 increased nonlinearly with increasing river discharge that carried soil co2 however the concentrated precipitation would dilute riverine pco2 afterwards 1 2 0 6 m s in wet season vs 0 7 0 6 m s in dry season yao et al 2007 li et al 2012 peter et al 2014 besides the dilution effect the fast flow velocity and thus increasing water turbulence understandably enhanced the gas transfer velocity and co2 degassing as well as reduced metabolisms i e in situ respiration and decomposition of organic carbon wanninkhof 1992 tremblay 2005 yao et al 2007 lapierre et al 2013 further resulting in lower pco2 nutrient concentrations greatly affected by urbanization and human activities directly or indirectly altered the balance of aquatic biological co2 production and consumption process falkowski 1994 faria et al 2012 li et al 2012 in the jinshui river significant associations between pco2 and tn r 0 33 p 0 05 in the wet season suggested that the respiration would be stimulated by elevated tn concentration and thus increased pco2 falkowski 1994 faria et al 2012 li et al 2012 the multiple linear regression analyses showed that the dependent variable of pco2 was a function of independent variables tn and twater pco2 261 0twater 71 1tn 1814 7 r2 0 29 p 0 01 while the variance explained was not high this could support the above view that tn and twater regulated the riverine pco2 table 1 however collinearity of physical and biogeochemical characteristics may be masked in the dry season pco2 tn r 0 07 p 0 05 pco2 twater r 0 12 p 0 05 pinho et al 2016 ni et al 2019 our findings therefore highlighted the importance of hydrology i e precipitation and runoff in understanding riverine pco2 which were in good agreement with previous observations strobl et al 2009 ni et al 2019 4 3 comparison with other water areas numerous studies showed that most of the world s rivers were supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmosphere helie et al 2002 salam and noguchi 2005 humborg et al 2010 wang et al 2011 li et al 2012 2018 raymond et al 2012 wang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 nienhauser 2015 lee et al 2017 liu et al 2017 marx et al 2017 ran et al 2017 the water air co2 exchange was closely relevant to gas transfer velocity jähne et al 1987 wanninkhof 1992 alin et al 2011 the gas transfer velocity is highly dependent on several factors such as wind speed flow velocity channel slope and water depth jähne et al 1987 aucour et al 1999 raymond et al 2012 gaalfalk et al 2014 hence the magnitude of k varied considerably as these physical controls drastically changed jähne et al 1987 raymond et al 2012 gaalfalk et al 2014 in this study the k values varied from 4 9 to 24 5 m d with an average of 11 1 4 5 m d higher than the value used in the st lawrence 3 6 m d yang et al 1996 and longchuan river 1 9 m d li et al 2012 table 2 however our k value fell within the range of a complication of global data raymond et al 2012 looman et al 2016 and was comparable to the k from floating chamber method in the river networks of yangtze li et al 2019 and yellow rivers ran et al 2015b due to the differences in catchment physical characteristics and water chemistry discrepancies in the controls and maintenance mechanisms of pco2 resulted in highly variable co2 flux ca 8 559 mmol m2 d table 2 it was noticeable that the lower order stream might have much higher evasion rate of co2 owing to the more rapid mixing with the benthic substrate and high turbulence which largely enhanced the gas transfer velocity dinsmore et al 2011 this view was evidenced by our study consistent with the second hypothesis the jinshui river exhibited higher fco2 mean 343 413 mmol m2 d than the average in nature rivers as well as other rivers table 2 estimating that the water surface area of the jinshui river covers 0 4 of the land area in the drainage basin the river with a water surface area about 3 96 km2 released an average annual flux of 5 96 109 g c co2 y to the atmosphere mean co2 flux 343 413 mmol m2 d the annual exports of dic and doc from the jinshui river were 3 93 109 g c y and 1 04 109 g c y respectively surface runoff of 8 6 m3 s is considered chen 2017 previous studies found that the dic fluxes were attributed to soil respiration and mineral weathering meybeck 1982 telmer and veizer 1999 the carbon loss via water air interface exchange was 118 2 of the riverine dissolved carbon discharge dic doc and this percentage was much higher than most of the world s rivers such as st lawrence 1 0 yang et al 1996 mississippi 89 3 dubois et al 2010 and yangtze rivers 38 8 ni et al 2019 and lower than the amazon river 768 6 richey et al 2002 while it was comparable to the yukong river 117 3 striegl et al 2012 supplementary table s3 thus the high co2 flux from the monsoonal headstream to the atmosphere was critical for quantifying the co2 budget of the river 5 conclusion there is an increasing consensus that co2 degassing from inland waters to atmosphere contributes significantly to regional and global carbon cycle our study stressed the importance of co2 efflux from headwater streams pco2 averaged 1147 874 µatm and 83 of samplings were supersaturated with co2 in the jinshui river the river therefore acted as an atmospheric co2 source with an average of 343 413 mmol m2 d the estimated emission 5 96 109 g c co2 y was about 1 2 times of riverine dissolved carbon delivery the pronounced spatiotemporal shifts of pco2 were largely contributable to hydrology human activities and in situ biological process there were strong relationships between aqueous pco2 and water temperature and total nitrogen in the wet season but very weak relations in the dry season more attention should be paid to underline the key drivers of riverine pco2 and the importance of co2 evasion from headwater streams in the regional to global carbon cycles declaration of competing

6019,monitoring data collected from rivers are used to support assessments of the quality of the river environment and help decision makes formulate appropriate management plans therefore accurate and precise estimates of constituent fluxes in streams and rivers are important however seasonal errors have not received enough attention and the published results have rarely been verified by other methods in this study the error associated with sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly 8 weekly and seven load estimation algorithms were examined seasonal and annual total n loads were estimated and wavelet coherence was used as a reference in order to reduce the contingency of the results three years data were used and total n with 17 53 particulate n 58 70 no3 n and 23 77 other dissolved n fractions was chosen to reflect water quality parameters results indicated that 2 weekly sampling frequency and algorithm f linear interpolation are sufficient for evaluating the characters of annual total n load in fengyu river watershed with 5 rmse root mean square error there was a large rmse 3 97 44 66 in summer with a high cv coefficient variation 35 2 for total n concentration these results can serve as a useful reference for decision makes who need to establish monitoring programmes in watersheds with similar characteristics keywords total n monitoring measurement uncertainty load estimation sampling frequency 1 introduction in recent decades numerous monitoring projects have been conducted to assess water quality degradation in riverine systems hudnell 2010 richards et al 2008 vörösmarty and meybeck 2004 walling and webb 1996 such monitoring programs have been conducted to i assess current water quality conditions roygard et al 2012 ii distinguish between point and non point pollutant sources roygard et al 2012 iii provide data for watershed modeling gassman et al 2007 ullrich and volk 2010 iv report field boundary conditions and monitoring time to evaluate long term trends in river loads brauer et al 2009 king and harmel 2003 and v evaluate the effectiveness of best management practices to guide policy and management decisions brauer et al 2009 king and harmel 2003 lennartz et al 2010 snelder et al 2017 ideally the uncertainty of monitoring data in terms of accuracy and precision would be minimized by using appropriate collection and analysis methods and estimates of the uncertainty would be reported alongside the data to guide data users birgand et al 2010 harmel et al 2009 moatar et al 2013 however the error in annual constituent load estimates relative to the true reference load may reach 100 in some cases which limits the usefulness of the data walling and webb 1981 yen et al 2016 there are several potential sources of measurement uncertainty in river monitoring streamflow measurements sample collection methods how samples are preserved and stored sample analysis procedures and the algorithms used to estimate loads harmel et al 2006 rode and suhr 2007 yanai et al 2015 among these sources sample collection under typical scenarios has potential for the greatest contribution of uncertainty accounting for 4 50 of cumulative probable uncertainty harmel et al 2006 the flow measurement technology has reached a good level the streamflow measurements error σ flow flow between 5 and 10 at seven usgs gages can be classified as good jiang et al 2014 in addition cv coefficient variation of sample collection being 6 for the pollutant concentration distributed cross section was uniformly martin et al 1992 there may be a further loss of 0 5 if oxidized nitrogen concentration larger than 0 1 mg l during sample preservation and storage kotlash and chessman 1998 as well there was a cv of 3 7 4 when an ic ion chromatography method was used in lab analysis rode and suhr 2007 jiang et al 2014 in general river discharge q data is measured continuously or near continuously by in situ devices e g stage discharge sensors that convert measured data to discharge data according to the site specific relationship between stage and discharge horowitz 2003 horowitz 2008 on the other hand water constituents concentration data are usually collected discretely e g weekly to monthly due to the limited manpower and financial resources cassidy and jordan 2011 jones et al 2012 therefore several computational methods e g averaging interpolation regression rating curve have been developed and used to estimate loads from flow data and discrete water quality measurements birgand et al 2010 johnes 2007 kronvang and bruhn 1996 preston et al 1989 quilbé et al 2006 gitau et al 2016 selection of a load estimation algorithm depends on various characteristics such as i constituent measured ii stream characteristics richards and holloway 1987 and iii sampling regime aulenbach and hooper 2006 snelder et al 2017 many studies have evaluated the error in river load estimation considering sampling frequencies and load calculation algorithms table 1 some methods such as interpolation moatar and meybeck 2005 williams et al 2015 regression guo et al 2002 and hspf zamyadi et al 2007 were used to calculate a high temporal resolution database i e sub daily or daily as a reference of true load for error calculation even a weekly database was sometimes used as a reference guo et al 2002 stenback et al 2011 however errors for constituent load estimation are susceptible to hydrological characteristics including concentration discharge relationships snelder et al 2017 bfi base flow index and fi flashiness index jones et al 2012 kerr et al 2016 moatar et al 2013 stelzer and likens 2006 and watershed characteristics such as population density and size horowitz et al 2015 johnes 2007 available data are difficult to be generalized because of variability factors such as unique characteristics and special stream hydrological regimes of study areas different algorithms different pollutants and study durations affect results birgand et al 2010 cassidy and jordan 2011 defew et al 2013 johnes 2007 moatar and meybeck 2005 the degree of bias is greater at smaller streams or upland watersheds due to the more responsive and varying hydrologic conditions coynel et al 2004 duvert et al 2011 johnes 2007 jones et al 2012 in these sites for examples low frequency sampling cannot capture rapid hydrologic responses coynel et al 2004 moatar et al 2006 stelzer and likens 2006 so brief monitoring durations e g single season or year also increase error in annual load estimation aulenbach and hooper 2006 guo et al 2002 robertson and roerish 1999 in addition estimates of seasonal loads are often less accurate than those of annual loads in forested streams upland draining or wetland draining kerr et al 2016 when estimating dissolved reactive p drp and no3 n loads in a tile drained watershed the uncertainty associated with the summer estimates was generally greater than that for the other three seasons williams et al 2015 furthermore load estimation for agricultural watersheds is more challenging than forested watersheds because of higher levels of temporal and spatial variability kelly et al 2018 for instance the timing of fertilizer applications relative to high streamflow periods in late spring or early summer contributes to large seasonal differences carpenter et al 2015 renwick et al 2008 richards and baker 2002 royer et al 2006 the primary goal of this work was to quantify the error in seasonal and annual total n loads as affected by sample collection frequencies and load estimation algorithms in a small agricultural headwater watershed since constituent flux data are critical in environmental assessments such as watershed modeling johnson et al 2015 yen et al 2014 yuan et al 2018 chen et al 2019 it is also important to examine the effects of the hydrologic monitoring periods e g annual or seasonal in the evaluation of errors in load determination total n was selected as the contaminant of interest for this study because no3 n and nh4 n are easily affected by ph and temperature specifically four objectives were defined i to quantify error in annual total n loads estimation as affected by sampling frequency ii to evaluate the performance of seven load estimation algorithms and iii to evaluate the impact on error by capturing high flow events iv to assess the impact of different sampling frequencies on seasonal total n loads estimation and wavelet coherence was used as a reference 2 methodology 2 1 site description in this study effects of sampling strategies and algorithms on stream nutrient loads was investigated using stream total n and discharge data as shown in fig 1 all

stage height data a we300 american global water inc california usa measurement accuracy 1 meteorological sensor was installed to collect weather data e g solar radiation air temperature rainfall paired with the bubbler gage every 30 min water quality samples were collected manually on a daily frequency and total n concentrations were determined by an acid persulfate digestion colorimetric method gb11894 89 national environmental protection agency 1996 water samples were collected manually on a 5 daily frequency from november through april since 2014 stream discharge was calculated based on the stage discharge relationship equation to ensure the frequency of water quality and stream flow data were consistent three years daily total n concentrations data 2011 2013 were chosen and average daily discharge data were calculated fig 2 a the range of discharge was 0 62 17 66 m3 s with the 90th percentile of discharge was 4 82 m3 s and the 95th percentile was 6 27 m3 s the number of days during 2011 2013 with flow reaching the 90th percentile was 112 while 56 days reached 95th percentile total n concentration ranged from 0 30 to 3 73 mg l with the highest concentration occurring in summer the high values of discharge and total n concentrations both occurred in june to september fig 2a however there was a weak relationship between discharge and total n concentration r2 0 1 fig 2c in addition the proportion of particulate n and dissolved n in total n were 17 53 and 82 47 58 70 no3 n and 23 77 other dissolved n fractions fig 2b and the particulate n content in four seasons was summer 26 09 fall 20 74 spring 12 55 winter 10 64 while that for no3 n was fall 62 57 winter 61 78 spring 58 37 summer 52 17 fig 2b 2 3 estimation of reference loads theoretically high resolution data are required to compare the effect of sampling frequencies and estimation algorithms on load estimations harmel and king 2005 however it is extremely difficult to collect detailed nutrient loads data because of limited personnel hours financial resources and other factors thus in most studies reference or true loads datasets are based on sub daily to weekly data in this study daily total n concentrations mg l and mean daily stream flow m3 s were considered to be sufficient to represent the reference true river loads t by using eq 1 1 l t k i 1 n c i q i where l t is reference true annual river load t k is conversion factor to account for the period of load estimation and measurement units c i and q i are the constituent concentration mg l and mean daily river discharge m3 s measured on the ith day 2 4 load estimation algorithms in this study three types of several common loads estimation algorithms were evaluated averaging interpolation regression rating curve averaging algorithms use average data to represent the time period interpolation algorithms assume that data concentration and discharge are represented by instantaneous sampling regression extrapolation procedures depend on an empirical relationship and changed rules about concentration and discharge moatar and meybeck 2005 seven algorithms table 3 were used to estimate total n loads as described previously moatar and meybeck 2005 walling and webb 1981 1985 algorithms a and d used time weighted mean concentration values with dilution effects at high flows algorithms b and c used discharge weighted concentration data algorithms e f and g applied the basic definition of flux the reliability of algorithms a and d expressed the performance difference on the time weighted values of the mean concentrations and the discharge weighted values while the performance of algorithms b c and e relied on the representativeness of the discharge weighted mean concentration derived from river sampling algorithms c d and e employed the mean flow values during the period and daily discharge values were used to approximate the period mean in algorithms a and b webb et al 1997 these methods may cause loads to be over or under estimated and these algorithms estimate loads in a given time period with differing procedures to relate concentration and discharge data 2 5 sampling frequency scenarios sampling frequency scenarios were developed to determine how frequency affects the bias and precision of load estimations for each of the seven algorithms in this study six sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly and 8 weekly were adopted which produced 3 7 14 30 42 and 56 scenarios in short given a sampling interval of n days there were n scenarios due to the varying sampling initial date constituent concentrations may be greatest on the rising arm of the hydrograph during high flow events with the potential for dilution after the first flush jiang et al 2010 vanni et al 2001 often due to the strong associations between flow rate and concentration carpenter et al 2015 littlewood 1995 on the other hand substantial suspended sediment transport may only occur during high flow periods gao and josefson 2012 the complex relationships between concentration and discharge rate certainly affect load estimation error aulenbach et al 2016 kelly et al 2018 there is reliable evidence that the annual fluxes of constituents of river are dominated by high flow events horowitz 2008 horowitz 2013 therefore we added sampling at high flow 90th to represent the influence of high discharge events on load estimation 2 6 statistical measures of sampling error in nutrient load estimates error is defined as the difference between the reference load and the estimated load birgand et al 2010 to compared the errors associated with sampling frequency and load estimation algorithms the reference load was calculated based on actual daily measurements and the accuracy percent bias precision standard deviation sd and performance root mean square error rmse were determined they are normalized by the measured true load preston et al 1989 the sd of load estimation was calculated as follows 2 s d j 1 n l j l 2 n l t 100 where lj is estimated load kg l is average estimated load kg lt is measured load kg calculated from daily database and n is the number of datasets the bias of load estimation was calculated as follows stelzer and likens 2006 toor et al 2008 3 b i a s l e l t l t 100 where le is estimated load kg lt is measured load kg calculated from daily database when evaluating the load estimation accuracy and precision were found to have inverse relationships walling and webb 1981 for tradeoffs between accuracy i e bias and precision i e sd the rmse was proposed as follows dolan et al 1981 haggard et al 2003 preston et al 1989 4 rmse bias 2 sd 2 3 results 3 1 loads estimation with different sampling frequencies and algorithms in the fengyu river watershed reference true total n load was 272 7 t for the 3 yr period 2011 2013 with 45 2 t 87 7 t and 139 8 t for year 1 2 and 3 respectively as can be seen from fig 3 variations of the estimation substantially increased with the decreases of sampling frequency the estimated results from algorithm g were far from the line true value indicating relatively poor performance to obtain an error within 11 based on harmel et al 2006 the 2 weekly sampling frequency was acceptable for all methods expect g to obtain an error within the uncertainty range of the 5 true load based on shih et al 2016 the weekly sampling frequency with algorithms e and f or the 3 daily sampling frequency for algorithms b and c are necessary the error of different algorithms for total n load estimation was influenced by the sampling frequency and the algorithms had an obviously influence on the error distribution fig 4 the relationships between the bias indices b90 b50 and b10 for total n load estimation and six sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly 8 weekly was analyzed and presented in a series of informative graphics fig 4 algorithm a with the 80 probability had a bias within 10 0 when the sampling frequency was more than 2 weekly and a bias within 15 when the frequency was more than 6 weekly the b50 was about 5 for all studied sampling frequencies algorithms b and c the range of bias had 80 probability to be greater than 20 when the sampling frequency less than 2 weekly algorithm d was the best of all these algorithms with the range of b90 b10 was 10 5 for the most frequencies and its underestimation mostly occured at the sampling frequency was less 4 weekly algorithm e did not show evident over or under estimation but the b50 had a slightly decrease with the sampling interval increasing algorithm f with the range of b90 b10 between 15 and 10 had a secondly best estimation agorithm g mostly underestimated the total n load in this study area for all studied sampling frequencies 3 2 accuracy precision and performance for sampling frequencies and estimation algorithms seven load estimates algorithms a b c d e f and g were used to evaluate the effect of several conventional sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly 8 weekly on total n flux over three years at xialongmen station the accuracy i e bias precision i e sd and combined performance rmse were quantified fig 5 in general the precision of total n load estimation decreased the increase of sd value with sampling interval increasing and the same trends were found for bias and rmse fig 5a c the difference increased among these seven algorithms with sampling interval increasing algorithms d and g provided most precise sd 10 estimation among all sampling frequencies algorithms a and e had the moderate precision and a sd 10 when the sampling frequency was more than 4 weekly algorithms b and c had the high sd value sd 10 when the sampling frequency was less than 2 weekly as to the accuracy the bias from algorithm b and c had a sharply increase as the sampling interval was more than two weeks therefore it can be concluded that algorithms b and c may not be suitable for estimating constituent loads in such a small headwater watershed when sampling frequency was less than 2 weekly algorithm g had a consistent but large bias about 14 for all sampling frequencies whereas algorithm d had a small and stable bias 4 6 6 7 algorithms e and f had the lower bias 4 when the sampling frequency was more than 2 weekly the rmse was used as an evaluation indicator of the combined performance there was a small gap in rmse within other 6 algorithms if sampling intervals was less than two weeks algorithm g was not suitable to be applied for this small agriculture watershed with a rmse range of 13 1 17 1 for the 3 daily frequency there was no significant difference in the performances of algorithms a b c d e and f fig 5c when the sampling frequency was more than 2 weekly algorithm f was the best rmse 5 2 when sampling frequency was less than 2 weekly the performance gap of the seven load estimation algorithms became wider and algorithm d had the best performance rmse 10 meanwhile algorithm b and c had poor combined performances when the frequency less than weekly and rmse sharply increased rmse 10 when frequency was less than 2 weekly algorithms f and d provided the two best estimations when the frequency was less than 2 weekly and algorithms a and e presented mediocre performance 3 3 evaluation of high flow sampling to study the influence of targeted high flow events sampling on load estimation sampling at high flow 90th percentile of daily flows was added to the conventional sampling frequencies fig 5d f the precision was improved for all algorithms and sampling frequencies by adding the targeted high flow sampling in addition the amplitude of sd values decreased with the frequency change fig 5a d algorithms b and c had the large improvement in their precision with the average sd values decreased 9 4 and 8 5 respectively algorithm e became the most precise average sd was 0 7 followed by algorithm d average sd was 1 0 and f average sd was 1 5 however the bias values of all algorithms except f average bias value decreased by 3 5 increased for the high flow sampling and algorithms a b and c had the worse accuracy with bias 20 fig 5b e in addition when the high flow sampling was conducted the statistical performance rmse of algorithms a b and c was poor fig 5c f on the other hand algorithm d showed improvements at the 3 daily and weekly frequency algorithm f showed improvements at all frequencies with better performance among all the frequencies as shown above algorithm f was the best algorithm with the rmse range being 1 4 5 1 followed by algorithm d the range of rmse was 1 5 11 1 when the high flow sampling was conducted fig 5c f 3 4 seasonal error the largest measured total n loads occurred in the summer with 42 16 t total n accounting for 46 of the annual total load followed by the 26 of the total load in fall fig 6 b the average discharge in fall was the highest at 3 58 m3 s followed by 3 33 m3 s in summer fig 6a the flow in these two seasons accounted for 35 7 and 33 2 of the annual flow respectively in the fengyu river watershed fertilizers were usually applied in summer the discharge was at a relatively high level in this season and it was expected to has the highest total n load thus based on results described in section 3 2 algorithm f was used to quantify seasonal errors associated with infrequent sampling 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly and 8 weekly when the conventional sampling frequencies were used load estimations for summer showed the poorest performance for all sampling frequencies fig 6c with the rmse values for four seasons were 1 61 20 51 winter 0 87 25 29 spring 3 97 44 66 summer and 1 04 32 89 fall the average rmse in summer was 20 4 while the average rmse was 14 2 in fall 12 0 in spring and 8 5 in winter therefore rmse value in summer was 8 8 higher than the average of the other three seasons if the sampling frequency was less than 4 weekly the rmse values for four seasons were all more than 11 the added high flow sampling obviously improved the performance for load estimation in summer and fall with 6 2 for average rmse value in summer and 7 1 in fall compared to the conventional sampling frequencies added high flow sampling improved the rmse value by 14 2 in summer and 7 1 in fall wavelet coherence was used as a reference for setting the sampling frequency fig 7 the wavelet analysis can further disclose detailed signals both from frequency and time domains by the fourier transform and can appropriately analyze detailed temporal patterns of nonstationary hydrological and water quality signals over different temporal scales kang and lin 2007 from the wavelet coherence analysis of annual flow and total n concentration in the fengyu river watershed fig 7 it was found that the strong coherence of flow and total n was at 48 days fig 7c if monthly loads were of interest the strong coherence occurred at 4 days fig 7a and at about 14 days for three months fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty of total n loads estimation from this small agricultural headwater watershed it has been found that the accuracy decreases with the decreasing of sampling frequency for nitrate load estimation birgand et al 2010 the load estimation of total n had the same trend in this small agricultural watershed with the average rmse in 3 daily weekly 2 weekly and monthly being 5 6 7 7 9 and 13 7 in addition with the monthly sampling the errors rmse for total n 6 6 20 4 had a smaller range than for nitrate 4 26 orthophosphate 5 33 and particulate p 6 18 but a larger range than for total p 13 42 moatar and meybeck 2005 furthermore the precision for monthly sampling frequency was 8 8 for total n while it was 13 for no3 n 20 for total p 26 for orthophosphate and 34 for particulate p moatar and meybeck 2005 runoff of the fengyu river watershed was found to be dominated by groundwater with a high bfi 0 85 and a low population density 162 persons per square kilometer such characteristics would have caused catchments to have a relatively low rmse on load estimation johnes 2007 however it would be inadequate to use annual pollutant load estimation for achieving some required monitoring purposes such as for assessing current water quality conditions roygard et al 2012 providing data for watershed modeling gassman et al 2007 ullrich and volk 2010 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and evaluating effectiveness of best management practices to guide policy and management decisions what s more estimating seasonal solute loads is often less accurate than estimating annual load in forested streams upland draining or wetland draining kerr et al 2016 a previous study found that intense storm events in the summer produced higher variability in nutrient concentrations in a tile draining watershed and led to greater uncertainty for drp and no3 n load estimation but as compared to other seasons only a small fraction 10 of annual nutrient loading occurred during the summer williams et al 2015 in the fengyu river watershed the largest measured total n loads occurred in the summer accounting for 46 of the annual total load and 33 2 of the annual flow fig 6a b in this study the sorting order for average rmse in four seasons was as follows summer 20 4 fall 14 2 spring 12 0 winter 8 5 in the fengyu river watershed there was a weak c q relationship r2 0 1 fig 2c the c q correlation was strongest in the fall followed by the summer and winter fig 8 the c q relationship can not explain the high error in such a small agriculture and groundwater dominated watershed however the three year average cv values of the total n concentrations for the four seasons were 35 2 in summer 30 8 in fall 27 4 in spring and 23 9 in winter the same seasonal order as for the rmse values fig 9 therefore the variation of the total n concentration may be the main reason to cause different seasonal errors 4 2 selecting an algorithm for total n loads estimation to inform watershed intensive monitoring programs of contaminant fluxes are commonly conducted however the influence of sampling strategy and load estimation algorithms should be considered in designing and implementing such projects previous studies have recommended algorithm e to estimate nitrate flux which requires relationships between constituent concentration and flow and a great deal of data for algorithm e birgand et al 2010 williams et al 2015 also algorithm f performed better performance than algorithm e for total n and total p in small agriculture catchments but performance was not as good in larger basins kronvang and bruhn 1996 algorithm d was the best for total p especially for particulate p moatar and meybeck 2005 and overestimation due to dilution at high flows was likely elwan et al 2018 kronvang and bruhn 1996 jiang et al 2014 studied three load calculation methods i e loadest load estimator ad ci all days concentration interpolated algorithm f in this paper and md fc measured days flow weighted concentration found the cv values were 39 7 15 7 and 24 5 respectively similarly a linear interpolation of concentrations algorithm f in this paper was the best among seven studied algorithms moatar and meybeck 2005 williams et al 2015 previous research typically concluded that algorithms which estimate concentrations based on flow algorithm e and interpolation algorithm f were preferred for estimating n loads in rivers elwan et al 2018 jiang et al 2014 moatar and meybeck 2005 williams et al 2015 the present study of a small agricultural headwater watershed produced similar results at the conventional 2 weekly sampling frequency algorithm e and f had the lower rmse values with 6 0 for algorithm e and 5 2 for algorithm f after the high discharge flow samplings 90th was added precision of all algorithms was improved along with the number of samples however the bias for algorithms a b c e became larger for the increased weight of high flow sampling with a high total n concentration overall algorithm f had the best performance 4 3 selecting a sampling strategy for total n loads estimation relative to load estimation algorithms a f sampling frequencies have a larger impact on producing accurate and precise annual load estimation a case study in the netherlands by de vries and klavers 1994 indicated that riverine fluxes of pollutants monitoring strategy first calculation methods second moreover a study found that decreasing the sampling frequency for total p and total n from daily to 3 daily would save an approximately 50 cost kovács et al 2012 thus the sampling frequency should be thoroughly considered before determining the reliability of estimates it was suggested that the sampling interval of 15 days for nitrate 10 days for orthophosphate p and total p and about 5 days for particulate p can obtain a precision of 10 in a large mixed land use watershed 36970 km2 moatar and meybeck 2005 to have 10 accuracy in tile drained fields or watersheds the frequency can be adapted with 13 26 h for drp and 2 7 17 5 days for no3 n williams et al 2015 in the present study we concluded that a conventional 2 weekly sampling frequency could be sufficient for estimating annual constituent loads with about 5 rmse value for algorithm f but this frequency would not be adequate for analyzing hydrologic periods or seasonal characteristics which had about 17 of average rmse value for summer from the wavelet coherence analysis of annual flow and total n concentrations in the fengyu river watershed fig 7 the strong coherence of flow and total n was at 48 days this indicated that 48 daily sampling frequency could be used if only the annual load was of interest however variations within the year could be lost when the sampling frequency was set at 42 daily the best performance rmse of annual load estimation was 10 2 obviously the performance of 48 daily would be worse if monthly loads were of interest the strong coherence occurred at 4 days fig 7a but such frequency sampling substantially increases costs based on these results the sampling frequency should be set between 4 and 48 daily to balance cost and performance considerations the strong coherence of flow and total n was at 48 days if three months loads are of interest the strong coherence occurred at about 14 days therefore the conventional 2 weekly sampling frequency could be a good choice previous researches suggested that the required sampling frequency depends on the characters of watersheds johnes 2007 especially the hydrological conditions jones et al 2012 and concentration behavior littlewood 1995 hydrology based sampling schemes were most accurate for loads estimation horowitz et al 2015 the river monitoring sampling need to capture as many high flow events as possible and cover at least 80 85 of the range of local annual water discharge hooper et al 2001 horowitz 2008 as is known to all the hydrological variation has a strong relationship with weather condition and high discharge events often occur after rainfall hence the sampling strategy can be decided by referring to the weather forecast 5 conclusion in the present study the analysis based on daily database for three years 2011 2013 has shown substantial error by using infrequent sampling to estimate the load of total n sampling with lower frequency may lead to reduction of the result reliability in addition performance from different load estimation algorithms also varied accordingly the best algorithm and sampling frequency in this small headwater agriculture watershed are algorithm f with 2 weekly sampling frequency the summer season has the highest error by using conventional sampling frequency after addition of high discharge sampling to the sampling events the performance of load estimates in summer and fall obviously improved in addition the precision sd can be improved for all the adopted algorithms and the algorithm f was the best option for load estimates engineers and scientists can take advantage of the given work to enhance the quality of future projects especially on infrastructure development and modeling design valuable financial resources can also be saved and concentrated on more relevant sampling approaches to avoid unnecessary wastes

6019,monitoring data collected from rivers are used to support assessments of the quality of the river environment and help decision makes formulate appropriate management plans therefore accurate and precise estimates of constituent fluxes in streams and rivers are important however seasonal errors have not received enough attention and the published results have rarely been verified by other methods in this study the error associated with sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly 8 weekly and seven load estimation algorithms were examined seasonal and annual total n loads were estimated and wavelet coherence was used as a reference in order to reduce the contingency of the results three years data were used and total n with 17 53 particulate n 58 70 no3 n and 23 77 other dissolved n fractions was chosen to reflect water quality parameters results indicated that 2 weekly sampling frequency and algorithm f linear interpolation are sufficient for evaluating the characters of annual total n load in fengyu river watershed with 5 rmse root mean square error there was a large rmse 3 97 44 66 in summer with a high cv coefficient variation 35 2 for total n concentration these results can serve as a useful reference for decision makes who need to establish monitoring programmes in watersheds with similar characteristics keywords total n monitoring measurement uncertainty load estimation sampling frequency 1 introduction in recent decades numerous monitoring projects have been conducted to assess water quality degradation in riverine systems hudnell 2010 richards et al 2008 vörösmarty and meybeck 2004 walling and webb 1996 such monitoring programs have been conducted to i assess current water quality conditions roygard et al 2012 ii distinguish between point and non point pollutant sources roygard et al 2012 iii provide data for watershed modeling gassman et al 2007 ullrich and volk 2010 iv report field boundary conditions and monitoring time to evaluate long term trends in river loads brauer et al 2009 king and harmel 2003 and v evaluate the effectiveness of best management practices to guide policy and management decisions brauer et al 2009 king and harmel 2003 lennartz et al 2010 snelder et al 2017 ideally the uncertainty of monitoring data in terms of accuracy and precision would be minimized by using appropriate collection and analysis methods and estimates of the uncertainty would be reported alongside the data to guide data users birgand et al 2010 harmel et al 2009 moatar et al 2013 however the error in annual constituent load estimates relative to the true reference load may reach 100 in some cases which limits the usefulness of the data walling and webb 1981 yen et al 2016 there are several potential sources of measurement uncertainty in river monitoring streamflow measurements sample collection methods how samples are preserved and stored sample analysis procedures and the algorithms used to estimate loads harmel et al 2006 rode and suhr 2007 yanai et al 2015 among these sources sample collection under typical scenarios has potential for the greatest contribution of uncertainty accounting for 4 50 of cumulative probable uncertainty harmel et al 2006 the flow measurement technology has reached a good level the streamflow measurements error σ flow flow between 5 and 10 at seven usgs gages can be classified as good jiang et al 2014 in addition cv coefficient variation of sample collection being 6 for the pollutant concentration distributed cross section was uniformly martin et al 1992 there may be a further loss of 0 5 if oxidized nitrogen concentration larger than 0 1 mg l during sample preservation and storage kotlash and chessman 1998 as well there

other hand water constituents concentration data are usually collected discretely e g weekly to monthly due to the limited manpower and financial resources cassidy and jordan 2011 jones et al 2012 therefore several computational methods e g averaging interpolation regression rating curve have been developed and used to estimate loads from flow data and discrete water quality measurements birgand et al 2010 johnes 2007 kronvang and bruhn 1996 preston et al 1989 quilbé et al 2006 gitau et al 2016 selection of a load estimation algorithm depends on various characteristics such as i

different algorithms different pollutants and study durations affect results birgand et al 2010 cassidy and jordan 2011 defew et al 2013 johnes 2007 moatar and meybeck 2005 the degree of bias is greater at smaller streams or upland watersheds due to the more responsive and varying hydrologic conditions coynel et al 2004 duvert et al 2011 johnes 2007 jones et al 2012 in these sites for examples low frequency sampling cannot capture rapid hydrologic responses coynel et al 2004 moatar et al 2006 stelzer and likens 2006 so brief monitoring durations e g single season or year also increase error in annual load estimation aulenbach and hooper 2006 guo et al 2002 robertson and roerish 1999 in addition estimates of seasonal loads are often less accurate than those of annual loads in forested streams upland draining or wetland draining kerr et al 2016 when estimating dissolved reactive p drp and no3 n loads in a tile drained watershed the uncertainty associated with the summer estimates was generally greater than that for the other three seasons williams et al 2015 furthermore load estimation for agricultural watersheds is more challenging than forested watersheds because of higher levels of temporal and spatial variability kelly et al 2018 for instance the timing of fertilizer applications relative to high streamflow periods in late spring or early summer contributes to large seasonal differences carpenter et al 2015 renwick et al 2008 richards and baker 2002 royer et al 2006 the primary goal of this work was to quantify the error in seasonal and annual total n loads as affected by sample collection frequencies and load estimation algorithms in a small agricultural headwater watershed since constituent flux data are critical in environmental assessments such as watershed modeling johnson et al 2015 yen et al 2014 yuan et al 2018 chen et al 2019 it is also important to examine the effects of the hydrologic monitoring periods e g annual or seasonal in the evaluation of errors in load determination total n was selected as the contaminant of interest for this study because no3 n and nh4 n are easily affected by ph and temperature specifically four objectives were defined i to quantify error in annual total n loads estimation as affected by sampling frequency ii to evaluate the performance of seven load estimation algorithms and iii to evaluate the impact on error by capturing high flow events iv to assess the impact of different sampling frequencies on seasonal total n loads estimation and wavelet coherence was used as a reference 2 methodology 2 1 site description in this study effects of sampling strategies and algorithms on stream nutrient loads was investigated using stream total n and discharge data as shown in fig 1 all data were collected from a small agricultural headwater watershed table 2 the fengyu river watershed 99 85861 100 0294 e 25 88000 26 09778 n elevation range 2082 3615 m asl this region has distinct wet and dry seasons due to its subtropical plateau monsoon climate the average annual air temperature is 13 9 c and average rainfall over the last five years was 1328 mm data from xialongmen

which more than 70 of the annual precipitation occurs this watershed located in the mountainous areas of southwest china with average slope of 19 main soil types are brown soil 26 1 and fuscous soil

region and agriculture in valley plain there are no industrial zones and scattered farming is prevalent the basin has a dense artificial channel network for irrigation the base flow index bfi which represents the proportion of base flow to total runoff is 0 85 as determined by a digital filtering method baseflow model based on lyne hollick algorithm in addition stream flashiness index fi which

paired with the bubbler gage every 30 min water quality samples were collected manually on a daily frequency and total n concentrations were determined by an acid persulfate digestion colorimetric method gb11894 89 national environmental protection agency 1996 water samples were collected manually on a 5 daily frequency from november through april since 2014 stream discharge was calculated based on the stage discharge relationship equation to ensure the frequency of water quality and stream flow data were consistent three years daily total n concentrations data 2011 2013 were chosen and average daily discharge data were calculated fig 2 a the range of discharge was 0 62 17 66 m3 s with the 90th percentile of discharge was 4 82 m3 s and the 95th percentile was 6 27 m3 s the number of days during 2011 2013 with flow reaching the 90th percentile was 112 while 56 days reached 95th percentile total n concentration ranged from 0 30 to 3 73 mg l with the highest concentration occurring in summer the high values of discharge and total n concentrations both occurred in june to september fig 2a however there was a weak relationship between discharge and total n concentration r2 0 1 fig 2c in addition the proportion of particulate n and dissolved n in total n were 17 53 and 82 47 58 70 no3 n and 23 77 other dissolved n fractions fig 2b and the particulate n content in four seasons was summer 26 09 fall 20 74 spring 12 55 winter 10 64 while that for no3 n was fall 62 57 winter 61 78 spring 58 37 summer 52 17 fig 2b 2 3 estimation of reference loads theoretically high resolution data are required to compare the effect of sampling frequencies and estimation algorithms on load estimations harmel and king 2005 however it is extremely difficult to collect detailed nutrient loads data because of limited personnel hours financial resources and other factors thus in most studies reference or true loads datasets are based on sub daily to weekly data in this study daily total n concentrations mg l and mean daily stream flow m3 s were considered to be sufficient to represent the reference true river loads t by using eq 1 1 l t k i 1 n c i q i where l t is reference true annual river load t k is conversion factor to account for the period of load estimation and measurement units c i and q i are the constituent concentration mg l and mean daily river discharge m3 s measured on the ith day 2 4 load estimation algorithms in this study three types of several common loads estimation algorithms were evaluated averaging interpolation regression rating curve averaging algorithms use average data to represent the time period interpolation algorithms assume that data concentration and discharge are represented by instantaneous sampling regression extrapolation procedures depend on an empirical relationship and changed rules about concentration and discharge moatar and meybeck 2005 seven algorithms table 3 were used to estimate total n loads as described previously moatar and meybeck 2005 walling and webb 1981 1985 algorithms a and d used time weighted mean concentration values with dilution effects at high flows algorithms b and c used discharge weighted concentration data algorithms e f and g applied the basic definition of flux the reliability of algorithms a and d expressed the performance difference on the time weighted values of the mean concentrations and the discharge weighted values while the performance of algorithms b c and e relied on the representativeness of the discharge weighted mean concentration derived from river sampling algorithms c d and e employed the mean flow values during the period and daily discharge values were used to approximate the period mean in algorithms a and b webb et al 1997 these methods may cause loads to be over or under estimated and these algorithms estimate loads in a given time period with differing procedures to relate concentration and discharge data 2 5 sampling frequency scenarios sampling frequency scenarios were developed to determine how frequency affects the bias and precision of load estimations for each of the seven algorithms in this study six sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly and 8 weekly were adopted which produced 3 7 14 30 42 and 56 scenarios in short given a sampling interval of n days there were n scenarios due to the varying sampling initial date constituent concentrations may be greatest on the rising arm of the hydrograph during high flow events with the potential for dilution after the first flush jiang et al 2010 vanni et al 2001 often due to the strong associations between flow rate and concentration carpenter et al 2015 littlewood 1995 on the other hand substantial suspended sediment transport may only occur during high flow periods gao and josefson 2012 the complex relationships between concentration and discharge rate certainly affect load estimation error aulenbach et al 2016 kelly et al 2018 there is reliable evidence that the annual fluxes of constituents of river are dominated by high flow events horowitz 2008 horowitz 2013 therefore we added sampling at high flow 90th to represent the influence of high discharge events on load estimation 2 6 statistical measures of sampling error in nutrient load estimates error is defined as the difference between the reference load and the estimated load birgand et al 2010 to compared the errors associated with sampling frequency and load estimation algorithms the reference load was calculated based on actual daily measurements and the accuracy percent bias precision standard deviation sd and performance root mean square error rmse were determined they are normalized by the measured true load preston et al 1989 the sd of load estimation was calculated as follows 2 s d j 1 n l j l 2 n l t 100 where lj is estimated load kg l is average estimated load kg lt is measured load kg calculated from daily database and n is the number of datasets the bias of load estimation was calculated as follows stelzer and likens 2006 toor et al 2008 3 b i a s l e l t l t 100 where le is estimated load kg lt is measured load kg calculated from daily database when evaluating the load estimation accuracy and precision were found to have inverse relationships walling and webb 1981 for tradeoffs between accuracy i e bias and precision i e sd the rmse was proposed as follows dolan et al 1981 haggard et al 2003 preston et al 1989 4 rmse bias 2 sd 2 3 results 3 1 loads estimation with different sampling frequencies and algorithms in the fengyu river watershed reference true total n load was 272 7 t for the 3 yr period 2011 2013 with 45 2 t 87 7 t and 139 8 t for year 1 2 and 3 respectively as can be seen from fig 3 variations of the estimation substantially increased with the decreases of sampling frequency the estimated results from algorithm g were far from the line true value indicating relatively poor performance to obtain an error within 11 based on harmel et al 2006 the 2 weekly sampling frequency was acceptable for all methods expect g to obtain an error within the uncertainty range of the 5 true load based on shih et al 2016 the weekly sampling frequency with algorithms e and f or the 3 daily sampling frequency for algorithms b and c are necessary the error of different algorithms for total n load estimation was influenced by the sampling frequency and the algorithms had an obviously influence on the error distribution fig 4 the relationships between the bias indices b90 b50 and b10 for total n load estimation and six sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly 8 weekly was analyzed and presented in a series of informative graphics fig 4 algorithm a with the 80 probability had a bias within 10 0 when the sampling frequency was more than 2 weekly and a bias within 15 when the frequency was more than 6 weekly the b50 was about 5 for all studied sampling frequencies algorithms b and c the range of bias had 80 probability to be greater than 20 when the sampling frequency less than 2 weekly algorithm d was the best of all these algorithms with the range of b90 b10 was 10 5 for the most frequencies and its underestimation mostly occured at the sampling frequency was less 4 weekly algorithm e did not show evident over or under estimation but the b50 had a slightly decrease with the sampling interval increasing algorithm f with the range of b90 b10 between 15 and 10 had a secondly best estimation agorithm g mostly underestimated the total n load in this study area for all studied sampling frequencies 3 2 accuracy precision and performance for sampling frequencies and estimation algorithms seven load estimates algorithms a b c d e f and g were used to evaluate the effect of several conventional sampling frequencies 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly 8 weekly on total n flux over three years at xialongmen station the accuracy i e bias precision i e sd and combined performance rmse were quantified fig 5 in general the precision of total n load estimation decreased the increase of sd value with sampling interval increasing and the same trends were found for bias and rmse fig 5a c the difference increased among these seven algorithms with sampling interval increasing algorithms d and g provided most precise sd 10 estimation among all sampling frequencies algorithms a and e had the moderate precision and a sd 10 when the sampling frequency was more than 4 weekly algorithms b and c had the high sd value sd 10 when the sampling frequency was less than 2 weekly as to the accuracy the bias from algorithm b and c had a sharply increase as the sampling interval was more than two weeks therefore it can be concluded that algorithms b and c may not be suitable for estimating constituent loads in such a small headwater watershed when sampling frequency was less than 2 weekly algorithm g had a consistent but large bias about 14 for all sampling frequencies whereas algorithm d had a small and stable bias 4 6 6 7 algorithms e and f had the lower bias 4 when the sampling frequency was more than 2 weekly the rmse was used as an evaluation indicator of the combined performance there was a small gap in rmse within other 6 algorithms if sampling intervals was less than two weeks algorithm g was not suitable to be applied for this small agriculture watershed with a rmse range of 13 1 17 1 for the 3 daily frequency there was no significant difference in the performances of algorithms a b c d e and f fig 5c when the sampling frequency was more than 2 weekly algorithm f was the best rmse 5 2 when sampling frequency was less than 2 weekly the performance gap of the seven load estimation algorithms became wider and algorithm d had the best performance rmse 10 meanwhile algorithm b and c had poor combined performances when the frequency less than weekly and rmse sharply increased rmse 10 when frequency was less than 2 weekly algorithms f and d provided the two best estimations when the frequency was less than 2 weekly and algorithms a and e presented mediocre performance 3 3 evaluation of high flow sampling to study the influence of targeted high flow events sampling on load estimation sampling at high flow 90th percentile of daily flows was added to the conventional sampling frequencies fig 5d f the precision was improved for all algorithms and sampling frequencies by adding the targeted high flow sampling in addition the amplitude of sd values decreased with the frequency change fig 5a d algorithms b and c had the large improvement in their precision with the average sd values decreased 9 4 and 8 5 respectively algorithm e became the most precise average sd was 0 7 followed by algorithm d average sd was 1 0 and f average sd was 1 5 however the bias values of all algorithms except f average bias value decreased by 3 5 increased for the high flow sampling and algorithms a b and c had the worse accuracy with bias 20 fig 5b e in addition when the high flow sampling was conducted the statistical performance rmse of algorithms a b and c was poor fig 5c f on the other hand algorithm d showed improvements at the 3 daily and weekly frequency algorithm f showed improvements at all frequencies with better performance among all the frequencies as shown above algorithm f was the best algorithm with the rmse range being 1 4 5 1 followed by algorithm d the range of rmse was 1 5 11 1 when the high flow sampling was conducted fig 5c f 3 4 seasonal error the largest measured total n loads occurred in the summer with 42 16 t total n accounting for 46 of the annual total load followed by the 26 of the total load in fall fig 6 b the average discharge in fall was the highest at 3 58 m3 s followed by 3 33 m3 s in summer fig 6a the flow in these two seasons accounted for 35 7 and 33 2 of the annual flow respectively in the fengyu river watershed fertilizers were usually applied in summer the discharge was at a relatively high level in this season and it was expected to has the highest total n load thus based on results described in section 3 2 algorithm f was used to quantify seasonal errors associated with infrequent sampling 3 daily weekly 2 weekly 4 weekly 6 weekly and 8 weekly when the conventional sampling frequencies were used load estimations for summer showed the poorest performance for all sampling frequencies fig 6c with the rmse values for four seasons were 1 61 20 51 winter 0 87 25 29 spring 3 97 44 66 summer and 1 04 32 89 fall the average rmse in summer was 20 4 while the average rmse was 14 2 in fall 12 0 in spring and 8 5 in winter therefore rmse value in summer was 8 8 higher than the average of the other three seasons if the sampling frequency was less than 4 weekly the rmse values for four seasons were all more than 11 the added high flow sampling obviously improved the performance for load estimation in summer and fall with 6 2 for average rmse value in summer and 7 1 in fall compared to the conventional sampling frequencies added high flow sampling improved the rmse value by 14 2 in summer and 7 1 in fall wavelet coherence was used as a reference for setting the sampling frequency fig 7 the wavelet analysis can further disclose detailed signals both from frequency and time domains by the fourier transform and can appropriately analyze detailed temporal patterns of nonstationary hydrological and water quality signals over different temporal scales kang and lin 2007 from the wavelet coherence analysis of annual flow and total n concentration in the fengyu river watershed fig 7 it was found that the strong coherence of flow and total n was at 48 days fig 7c if monthly loads were of interest the strong coherence occurred at 4 days fig 7a and at about 14 days for three months fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty of total n loads estimation from this small agricultural headwater watershed it has been found that the accuracy decreases with the decreasing of sampling frequency for nitrate load estimation birgand et al 2010 the load estimation of total n had the same trend in this small agricultural watershed with the average rmse in 3 daily weekly 2 weekly and monthly being 5 6 7 7 9 and 13 7 in addition with the monthly sampling the errors rmse for total n 6 6 20 4 had a smaller range than for nitrate 4 26 orthophosphate 5 33 and particulate p 6 18 but a larger range than for total p 13 42 moatar and meybeck 2005 furthermore the precision for monthly sampling frequency was 8 8 for total n while it was 13 for no3 n 20 for total p 26 for orthophosphate and 34 for particulate p moatar and meybeck 2005 runoff of the fengyu river watershed was found to be dominated by groundwater with a high bfi 0 85 and a low population density 162 persons per square kilometer such characteristics would have caused catchments to have a relatively low rmse on load estimation johnes 2007 however it would be inadequate to use annual pollutant load estimation for achieving some required monitoring purposes such as for assessing current water quality conditions roygard et al 2012 providing data for watershed modeling gassman et al 2007 ullrich and volk 2010 guo et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and evaluating effectiveness of best management practices to guide policy and management decisions what s more estimating seasonal solute loads is often less accurate than estimating annual load in forested streams upland draining or wetland draining kerr et al 2016 a previous study found that intense storm events in the summer produced higher variability in nutrient concentrations in a tile draining watershed and led to greater uncertainty for drp and no3 n load estimation but as compared to other seasons only a small fraction 10 of annual nutrient loading occurred during the summer williams et al 2015 in the fengyu river watershed the largest measured total n loads occurred in the summer accounting for 46 of the annual total load and 33 2 of the annual flow fig 6a b in this study the sorting order for average rmse in four seasons was as follows summer 20 4 fall 14 2 spring 12 0 winter 8 5 in the fengyu river watershed there was a weak c q relationship r2 0 1 fig 2c the c q correlation was strongest in the fall followed by the summer and winter fig 8 the c q relationship can not explain the high error in such a small agriculture and groundwater dominated watershed however the three year average cv values of the total n concentrations for the four seasons were 35 2 in summer 30 8 in fall 27 4 in spring and 23 9 in winter the same seasonal order as for the rmse values fig 9 therefore the variation of the total n concentration may be the main reason to cause different seasonal errors 4 2 selecting an algorithm for total n loads estimation to inform watershed intensive monitoring programs of contaminant fluxes are commonly conducted however the influence of sampling strategy and load estimation algorithms should be considered in designing and implementing such projects previous studies have recommended algorithm e to estimate nitrate flux which requires relationships between constituent concentration and flow and a great deal of data for algorithm e birgand et al 2010 williams et al 2015 also algorithm f performed better performance than algorithm e for total n and total p in small agriculture catchments but performance was not as good in larger basins kronvang and bruhn 1996 algorithm d was the best for total p especially for particulate p moatar and meybeck 2005 and overestimation due to dilution at high flows was likely elwan et al 2018 kronvang and bruhn 1996 jiang et al 2014 studied three load calculation methods i e loadest load estimator ad ci all days concentration interpolated algorithm f in this paper and md fc measured days flow weighted concentration found the cv values were 39 7 15 7 and 24 5 respectively similarly a linear interpolation of concentrations algorithm f in this paper was the best among seven studied algorithms moatar and meybeck 2005 williams et al 2015 previous research typically concluded that algorithms which estimate concentrations based on flow algorithm e and interpolation algorithm f were preferred for estimating n loads in rivers elwan et al 2018 jiang et al 2014 moatar and meybeck 2005 williams et al 2015 the present study of a small agricultural headwater watershed produced similar results at the conventional 2 weekly sampling frequency algorithm e and f had the lower rmse values with 6 0 for algorithm e and 5 2 for algorithm f after the high discharge flow samplings 90th was added precision of all algorithms was improved along with the number of samples however the bias for algorithms a b c e became larger for the increased weight of high flow sampling with a high total n concentration overall algorithm f had the best performance 4 3 selecting a sampling strategy for total n loads estimation relative to load estimation algorithms a f sampling frequencies have a larger impact on producing accurate and precise annual load estimation a case study in the netherlands by de vries and klavers 1994 indicated that riverine fluxes of pollutants monitoring strategy first calculation methods second moreover a study found that decreasing the sampling frequency for total p and total n from daily to 3 daily would save an approximately 50 cost kovács et al 2012 thus the sampling frequency should be thoroughly considered before determining the reliability of estimates it was suggested that the sampling interval of 15 days for nitrate 10 days for orthophosphate p and total p and about 5 days for particulate p can obtain a precision of 10 in a large mixed land use watershed 36970 km2 moatar and meybeck 2005 to have 10 accuracy in tile drained fields or watersheds the frequency can be adapted with 13 26 h for drp and 2 7 17 5 days for no3 n williams et al 2015 in the present study we concluded that a conventional 2 weekly sampling frequency could be sufficient for estimating annual constituent loads with about 5 rmse value for algorithm f but this frequency would not be adequate for analyzing hydrologic periods or seasonal characteristics which had about 17 of average rmse value for summer from the wavelet coherence analysis of annual flow and total n concentrations in the fengyu river watershed fig 7 the strong coherence of flow and total n was at 48 days this indicated that 48 daily sampling frequency could be used if only the annual load was of interest however variations within the year could be lost when the sampling frequency was set at 42 daily the best performance rmse of annual load estimation was 10 2 obviously the performance of 48 daily would be worse if monthly loads were of interest the strong coherence occurred at 4 days fig 7a but such frequency sampling substantially increases costs based on these results the sampling frequency should be set between 4 and 48 daily to balance cost and performance considerations the strong coherence of flow and total n was at 48 days if three months loads are of interest the strong coherence occurred at about 14 days therefore the conventional 2 weekly sampling frequency could be a good choice previous researches suggested that the required sampling frequency depends on the characters of watersheds johnes 2007 especially the hydrological conditions jones et al 2012 and concentration behavior littlewood 1995 hydrology based sampling schemes were most accurate for loads estimation horowitz et al 2015 the river monitoring sampling need to capture as many high flow events as possible and cover at least 80 85 of the range of local annual water discharge hooper et al 2001 horowitz 2008 as is known to all the hydrological variation has a strong relationship with weather condition and high discharge events often occur after rainfall hence the sampling strategy can be decided by referring to the weather forecast 5 conclusion in the present study the analysis based on daily database for three years 2011 2013 has shown substantial error by using infrequent sampling to estimate the load of total n sampling with lower frequency may lead to reduction of the result reliability in addition performance from different load estimation algorithms also varied accordingly the best algorithm and sampling frequency in this small headwater agriculture watershed are algorithm f with 2 weekly sampling frequency the summer season has the highest error by using conventional sampling frequency after addition of high discharge sampling to the sampling events the performance of load estimates in summer and fall obviously improved in addition the precision sd can be improved for all the adopted algorithms and the algorithm f was the best option for load estimates engineers and scientists can take advantage of the given work to enhance the quality of future projects especially on infrastructure development and modeling design valuable financial resources can also be saved and concentrated on more relevant sampling approaches to avoid unnecessary wastes
