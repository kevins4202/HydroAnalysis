21910,cfd simulations are conducted to study the wake field behind a marine propeller in open water conditions at various advance coefficients the local variables velocity pressure and the wake structure characteristics are analyzed extensively using mean root mean square rms and fourier analysis of data the integral variables forces moments and their correlations with local variables are also investigated additionally the iterative and grid verification studies are conducted to evaluate numerical uncertainty of the simulations the results showed good agreement between the integral variables obtained by the simulations and those of experiments available in the literature which confirmed the validity of the computational method employed in this work fourier analysis studies on integral variables showed that the rotation of the whole propeller determines the fluctuation of side forces at high j while at low j mostly rotation of individual blades affects the side forces the

introduction detailed understanding of flow behavior in the wake field downstream a marine propeller of a vessel is of vital importance to evaluate the propulsion performance in seaway in addition it is of interest as one of the main factors for fuel consumption of ships to meet the requirement for minimum energy efficiency level measured by an energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi these technical measures are regulated by the international maritime organization s imo marine environment protection committee mepc to indicate the use of energy efficient equipment studies on the flow around propellers have focused on a wide range of aspects including cavitation zhu 2015 aktas et al 2016 choong et al 2018 regener et al 2018 propeller inflow sadat hosseini et al 2014 huyer and snarski 2003 propeller free surface wave interaction paik et al 2005 sadat hosseini et al 2013 li et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2018 rad et al 2019 and propeller rudder interaction carrica et al 2012 he et al 2017 mofidi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 additionally wake field and characteristics have been investigated in several studies cotroni et al 2000 wu et al 2013 muscari et al 2017 felli et al 2018 gong et al 2018 posa et al 2019 among the wake field studies felli et al 2011 experimentally investigated the mechanism of tip and hub vortices evolution in the transitional and far field regions their results suggested that the tip vortex breaks down at a certain distance from the propeller manifesting itself as a spiral with an irregular shape the location of transition to instability strongly depends on spiral to spiral distance as previously reported by okulov 2004 in addition the number of blades affects the onset of tip vortex instability location through influencing the spiral to spiral distance the authors also observed that perturbation resulting from the destabilization of tip vortices can cause the hub vortex to become unstable however the breakdown of tip vortices occurs prior to that of hub vortices and thus the hub vortices should be independent of the blade number and the advance coefficient based on this observation it is concluded that there should be a cause effect relationship between the tip and hub vortex destabilizations in a similar study by di felice et al 2009 the wake field characteristics of a propeller were evaluated at three advance coefficients of j 0 65 0 74 and 0 85 experimentally and numerically the mechanism of destabilization of vortices suggested in this study is such that each tip vortex interacts with its succeeding blade wake provoking interaction between the spirals which in turn transitions to the instability of the propeller wake di felice et al 2009 stated that an increase in advance ratio reduces the amplitude at blade frequency in the power spectral density of velocity signal at the tip vortex location ascribing to the turbulent diffusion effect and the cascade energy transfer process from the blade to the shaft harmonic involved in the instability mechanism baek et al 2015 conducted a similar study for advance ratios ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 a different number of recognizable vorticity groups in downstream is determined for different advance ratios at low j three separate regions including hub vortices blade passage vortices and tip vortices exist while there is no discernible boundary between the hub and blade passage regions at high j additionally an increase in advance ratio increases the distance between pairs of helical tip vortices which manifests itself as separated tip vortex cores on a plane passing through the helical tip vortices furthermore baek et al 2015 showed that the shrinkage rate of tip vortices by moving away from propeller decreases as j grows such that the shrinkage rate at low j range is almost five times the rate at high j range further information on detailed vortex behavior may be found in the study of paik et al 2007 in which the spatial evolution of a propeller wake is analyzed it is proven that galilean decomposition method can detect tip hub and blade passage vortices galilean method uses the principle of decomposing the instantaneous velocity into a constant convection velocity and a fluctuation velocity a range of convection velocities are considered to extract the fluctuating velocities and identify vortex cores traveling near the specified convection velocities apart from that the longitudinal distribution of radial and axial velocity components is used to understand the vorticity behavior for instance identifying velocity jumps in the longitudinal distribution of radial velocity at several radiuses suggests the presence of blade passage vorticity as the propeller model used in this study has the maximum pitch ratio at r r 0 7 a change of sign and shape in velocity jump occurs at this location additionally the tip vortex trajectory indicates strong contraction until x d 0 53 and oscillations afterward due to interaction with blade passage vortices in addition to the foregoing topics in wake field investigation some studies have focused on the propeller s geometrical parameters role wang et al 2018 investigated the correlation between the skew of the propellers and the blade passage vortex wake evolution for dtmb propeller they employed the sst k ω turbulence model to study the relationship between the blade passage vortex and the geometry of the propeller for four different propeller models with different skew angles other geometrical parameters such as the number of blades diameter and design advance ratios were chosen to be the same for all models their study revealed that the increase in the skew angle vanished blade root vortices and rebelled against the contraction of blade passage vortex as the skew increase weakens blade to blade interaction it leads to the diminution of the tip vortex destabilization and hub vortex deformation kumar and mahesh 2017 studied the evolution of a five bladed propeller wake from the near field to the far field using a les turbulence model it has been shown that the blade trailing edge wake becomes destabilized in the near field due to kelvin helmholtz instabilities resulting in the formation of small vortical structures the tip vortices remain stable in the near field even though they are detached from the blade passage vortices however the mutual induction between the tip vortices and interaction with the blade passage vortical structures eventually destabilize of the tip vortices in the far field keller et al 2017 conducted les simulations of a five bladed propeller in forward mode of operation with a focus on wake dynamics and flow generated sound they showed that the instability is derived by the interaction between tip vortices and blade trailing wake the spectra of average phase locked radial velocity were plotted at several probes at the tip vortex hub vortex and mid blade vortex regions the spectra plotted at tip vortices region show dominant peak at shaft frequency along with distinct frequency peaks ascribed to the complex tip and blade vortices interactions the spectra in the hub vortex region show that they pose higher energy at frequencies lower than that of the shaft in the near field the aim of the present work is to expand the previous studies for further investigation of the wake field of a propeller in the open water condition by means of simulations at various advance coefficients the in house cfdfoam solver is used for the simulations the integral variables forces moments are validated against the experimental data the local variables velocity pressure and vortical structures in the wake field are analyzed extensively using mean root mean square rms and fourier analysis additionally the iterative and grid verification studies are conducted to evaluate the numerical uncertainty of the simulations the analysis is focused on understanding the way local flow and integral variables are influenced by the advance coefficient and finding out possible connections between them the contribution of propeller tip blade and hub interaction with the flow to the wake field is studied in detail and compared at three different j 2 cfd method our in house code cfdfoam is used for the cfd computations the cfdfoam has been built around openfoam which employs a cell centered finite volume method but is designed for ship hydrodynamic applications using either absolute or relative inertial coordinate system with non deforming and deforming control volumes the code utilizes conventional body fitted methods as well as immersed boundary methods for moving morphing boundaries and offers various turbulence models volume of fluid for free surface capturing and 6dof capabilities kingora and sadat 2019 for the current simulations absolute inertial earth fixed coordinates are employed with sst k ω turbulence model using no wall function the coupled pressure and velocity are solved using piso the 6dof rigid body equations of motion are not solved as propeller motion is prescribed to rotate at n 20 rev s 2 1 propeller geometry we conduct our studies for the propeller of a containership developed by korean research institute and ocean engineering kriso the propeller has 5 blades rotating clockwise when seen from the stern the propeller diameter in full scale is 7 9 m with a hub ratio of 0 18 and blade ratio area of 0 8 the experiments were conducted tokyo 2015 for the model with the scale ratio of 1 37 9 the experiments were performed for various advance ratio while the rotating velocity of the propeller was kept constant at n 20 rev s the body plan of the model is shown in fig 1 and the main particulars of the model are listed in table 1 the coordinate system is located at the center of propeller with x pointing toward the suction side upstream y to starboard and z upward the axis of rotation is aligned with the x axis 2 2 computational domain boundary conditions and grids the computational domain has a circular cylinder shape extending from 2 5d x 4 5d with a diameter of 6 5d where d is the diameter of the propeller the center of the propeller is located at x y z 0 0 0 as shown in fig 2 boundary conditions consist of the velocity boundary condition for the inlet zero gradient boundary condition for the outlet slip wall for the surrounding surface and no slip wall on the propeller details of boundary conditions are described in table 2 the grid system consists of a single block and overset capability was not used thus the whole domain rotates at the same speed with the propeller to avoid harming deforming the quality of the grid while the propeller rotates to avoid strong numerical dissipation and capture the features of the vortex system the grid sizes in the domain are designed carefully for the fine grid the block consists of 30 m tetrahedral volume elements where the propeller s surface mesh has 270 k grid points there are 95 and 220 grid points per chord and span of the propeller respectively a cylindrical refinement block with 15 m points is designed around the propeller to capture the wakes depicted in fig 3 the block has a diameter of 1 8d and a length of 4 5d starting at x 0 6d and ending at x 3 9d therefore the refinement block fully covers the wake region up to the near the outlet boundary of the computational domain the block has about 590 and 720 grid points in streamwise and azimuthal directions respectively the medium and coarse grid systems are also generated for the grid verification study where the average cell size is reduced by a factor of 2 from fine to medium and medium to coarse grids the coarse and medium grids consist of 4 and 11 million cells respectively the grid is designed in such a way that average y on the propeller s surface for all simulations is less than 1 the grid points for the fine medium and coarse grids are decomposed on 112 80 and 56 cpus respectively for parallel processing fig 3 shows the grid system in the domain and on the propeller surface 2 3 simulation conditions and analysis methods the simulations are carried out for a propeller in open water condition i e far from the free surface and with uniform inflow velocity the simulations are conducted for the propeller rotating at the constant velocity n 20 r e v s

defined as 6 k t x y z f x y z ρ n 2 d 4 7 k q x y z m x y z ρ n 2 d 5 where f and m denote dimensional force and moment respectively the efficiency is also calculated as 8 η j k t x 2 π k q x the

amplitude and p ε n is the corresponding phase for the n th frequency ω n the mean and harmonic amplitudes were also evaluated for the local flow including velocity and pressure the mean of local variables is evaluated for both phase locked and out of phase conditions in phase lock the local flow variables such as velocity at a selected phase of the propeller are only used to compute the mean value in out of phase condition the velocity in the field over a complete cycle of propeller is averaged additionally the root mean square rms is investigated for example rms for the velocity time history u ti is calculated based on eq 14 14 r m s i 1 n u t i u 2 n based on the local flow the propeller thrust t p can be estimated using the change in momentum flux across boundaries of a control

study the iterative and grid uncertainties are investigated for j 0 4 the iterative uncertainty is evaluated using grid g1 the grid verification study is conducted using grid triplets g3 g2 and g1 with rg 2 verification variables are the mean values of ktx and kqx i e the shaft thrust and torque as well as the propeller efficiency the iterative uncertainty listed in table 3 shows relatively small values for the mean value of the thrust and torque about 0 03 s1 for ktx and 0 04 s1 for kqx also uni for the mean value is acceptably small compared to the grid uncertainties ung and ε12 g the average iterative uncertainty is about uni 0 035 s1 showing the results are insensitive to the iterative errors the grid study indicates monotonic convergence for k t x with r g 0 50 while monotonic divergence was observed for k q x with r g 1 17 for k t x ε 12 g and un g are 0 001 and 0 9 respectively and the order of accuracy p g 2 00 is obtained which is consistent with the theoretical order of discretization scheme therefore the grid study shows a very small grid uncertainty for k t x the total numerical uncertainty is computed using eq 5 showing average un sn 1 03 s1 for the verification variables this confirms reasonably small numerical uncertainty for the fine grid thus the fine grid was used for all the studies 4 results and discussions 4 1 studies on integral variables fig 4 depicts time histories for all components of thrust and torque respectively for some of the advance coefficients simulations have been performed for a longer time to assure convergence the results show large oscillations on the time history for y and z components of thrust and torque whereas the x component fluctuation is negligibly small the level of y and z fluctuations depends on the advance ratio and become fairly large for j values greater than 0 7 yet the largest y and z components are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the x component for a better understanding of the trends of predicted time histories the mean values are investigated as shown in fig 5 a the mean values are only plotted for the loads in x direction as the others are zero due to the axisymmetric condition of the propeller it can be observed that increasing the advance ratio decreases the mean x force and moment the predicted values are validated against the experimental data tokyo 2015 the details on this comparison are provided in table 4 efd experimental fluid dynamics column shows values obtained from experiments at the same condition as demonstrated in the table thrust has the average error of only 1 27 over all cases with various j values while the average error for torque is 5 17 the efficiency has a larger average of error 6 13 compared to those for k t x and k q x the trend for efficiency is well predicted showing a maximum value around j 0 7 similar to the experimental data table 4 also lists the mean value comparison with the experimental data for the grid verification studies conducted at j 0 4 considering the grid verification cases the average of all error values for the coarse grid is 4 13 dropping to 3 70 for the medium grid and 3 51 for the fine grid suggesting a better agreement with the data for the fine grid simulation to understand the source of the resultant mean x force moment fig 5 b shows the contribution of the pressure and friction on the force moment as well the friction component changes slightly with increasing advance coefficient as reynolds numbers are not exactly the same among all cases even though the propeller rpm is kept fixed for various j cases different inlet velocities among cases change the velocity of the flow past the blades surfaces and local reynolds number yet the influence of the variation of the friction loads on the trends of total loads is just negligible in fact the friction force moment is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of the pressure such that the pressure loads mainly dictate the trends of the total propeller forces and moments fourier analysis of the predicted time series is also reported in fig 6 to investigate the existing oscillations on forces and moments using eqs 9 13 the analysis reveals large 1st 4th 5th and 20th harmonics notably 1st harmonic corresponds to the frequency of the rotation of the whole propeller ω 125 7 rad s or n 20 round s and 5th harmonic corresponds to one blade rotation frequency ω 628 rad s for k t x dominant oscillation amplitudes appear at 4th and 20th harmonics with the 4th harmonic amplitude being smaller than the 20th harmonic for cases with j 0 75 except for j 0 6 the inexistence of large 1st harmonic amplitude suggests that blades dictate the level of the unsteadiness in the x force nevertheless the amplitudes of these fluctuations are very small as shown by the time series in fig 4 for k t y and k t z 1st and 5th harmonic amplitudes are dominant with 5th harmonic amplitude becoming the larger amplitude for lower j values therefore the whole propeller contributes to the fluctuations of side forces at high j values while the interaction of blade turbulences affects side forces at low j values it seems the fluctuations of y and z components are linked to the maximum propeller efficiency since the peak of the 1st harmonic amplitudes for y and z loads occurs at a speed close to j 0 7 where the propeller efficiency is maximum 4 2 studies on local variables fig 7 demonstrates the mean and root mean square rms contours of normalized streamwise velocity u u 0 on a plane located at a distance of 0 2 d downstream the propeller for low mid and high advance coefficients j 0 1 0 4 and 0 8 using eqs 9 and 14 the horizontal and vertical axes are normalized with the propeller diameter such that x 0 5 0 5 correspond to the locations of the propeller s tip as j becomes larger the mean contours show a larger area with u u0 being close to unity this indicates a better propeller performance for j 0 8 according to eq 18 which is consistent with the propeller efficiency calculated based on the integral variables propeller thrust and torque shown in fig 5 a reduction of rms values or fluctuations at high j cases also suggests a better performance for j 0 8 compared to j 0 1 and 0 4 the rms distributions also reveal the vortical structures and their strength in the flow field for j 0 1 the maximum rms values occur close to the hub and tip correlated with the hub and tip vortices for mid and high j the rms value close to the tip gradually weakens and becomes stronger near to the hub fig 8 shows phase locked θ 0 mean and rms contours of normalized streamwise velocity to understand the effect of each blade on the flow field for each blade the mean streamwise velocity in the propeller wake is highest around 0 7r and reduces by moving toward the root or tip rms contours reveal the velocity fluctuation generated around each blade the roots of blades generate more fluctuations at high j while the trailing edge of blades and blades tips cause more fluctuations at low j fig 9 depicts average phase locked θ 0 velocity and vorticity distribution for the three cases on z 0 plane the velocity illustrates the wake pattern at each j for j 0 1 the wake width is quite constant until increases suddenly at x d 1 5 downstream the propeller at this point the tip vortex tube destabilizes and oscillates as shown in the vorticity distribution this vortex breakdown is observed for mid and high j cases but occurs further away from the propeller roughly at x d 2 5 for j 0 4 and x d 3 for j 0 8 the frequency of the tip vortex tube oscillations is much smaller than the frequency of the propeller rotation thus the instability could be due to the shear instability in the flow field rather than being correlated directly to the propeller rpm the vorticity distribution shows the wake of the propeller hub which has a significantly larger width for higher j cases this causes a tremendous interaction between the hub and blade passage vortical structures for j 0 8 the mixing of the hub and blade passage vortices affects the tip vortical structures far from the propeller interestingly the period of the hub vortex is about five times larger than the blade passage and tip vortices confirming that the hub vortex pattern is generated by the rotation of the whole propeller fig 10 shows the mean and rms of velocity profiles along the solution domain mean velocity profiles become flat as j increases showing a better propulsion performance for higher j cases as discussed before apart from this the profile becomes smooth as the distance from the propeller increases which is due to the decay of tip and hub effects as demonstrated for the velocity in fig 9 at low j the peak locations of the mean velocity profile in the regions close to the propeller and downstream are very different i e y d 0 45 d and y d 0 25 d respectively while the peak location at various regions is quite the same for highest j this shows a stronger contraction rate for the wake field at lower j values the profiles of rms of velocity indicate two peak locations for the near wake field one around y d 0 7 and another near the hub the level of fluctuations decreases as the flow moves away from the propeller at j 0 1 and j 0 8 demonstrated by the fact that the profiles become smooth for j 0 4 however strong fluctuation at far field can be still observed this is because the initial vortex cloud induced by the sudden rotation of the propeller has not left the solution domain yet the decay of the maximum velocity values is shown in fig 11 a the velocity drops very fast for j 0 1 as the flow is washed away from the propeller while the velocity values remain intact at high j fig 11 b gives a similar conclusion for the difference between the minimum and maximum velocity values fig 12 demonstrates line contours and traces of tip hub and blade passage vortices for the three cases at phase θ 0 deg fig 12 a indicates the tip helical vortices generated from each propeller cycle at low j case interact and form a large vortical structure or a vortex cloud for high j the tip helical vortices generated by each propeller cycle can be separately identified these tip helical vortices are more stretched in the transverse direction than the longitudinal direction resembling a drop form the hub vortex system shows scattered rings at all j values with more irregular shapes at j 0 8 in fig 12 b the traces of the center of tip vortices suggest that the distance between the location of their formation and the blades tips is proportional to the value of the advance coefficient as j increases the tip vortices form at a larger radial distance from the propeller the vortices travel downstream while slowly moving toward the axis of the rotation unlike the tip vortices the hub vortices move away from the axis of the rotation which leads to an interaction between the tip and hub vortices after traveling a short distance downstream the propeller fig 13 expands figs 9 and 11 a studies for zero propeller phase to more phases to investigate the phase effect on the vortical structures at j 0 1 the phase slightly affects the shape of the tip helical vortices and the phase location of the hub vortices but the blade passage vortical structures remain the same for different propeller phases at j 0 4 only the phase of the hub vortices varies for different propeller phases and the tip and blade passage vortical structures are unaffected at high j the blade passage and hub vortices are mixed and thus only two distinct tip and hub blade vortices are observed the location and shape of the new hub blade vortex system depend on the propeller phase in order to further clarify the advance coefficient effect on vorticity shown in fig 13 it would be helpful to evaluate the change in vorticity versus the distance from the propeller and its evolution fig 14 left side depicts variation in tip blade passage and hub vortices versus distance x d along the plotted straight lines for phase θ 0 at an instant based on what represented in fig 14 a it can be observed that tip vortices line at high j display a more oscillating behavior than low j which is in agreement with fig 13 showing that tip vortices at j 0 8 are discrete helical vortices while the distance between helical vortices reduces at j 0 1 0 4 merging and forming a vortex cloud in addition the tip vortex has a larger magnitude at low j the vortex plotted along the blade passage vortex line also demonstrates an oscillating vortex strength at all advance coefficients the wavelength of the blade passage vortex oscillations is different for different j values since it is dominated by the combination of the tangential speed rpm and axial inflow speed however the blade passage vortex has almost the same magnitude for the three j cases similar to the tip vortices the blade passage vortex strength reduces by traveling away from the propeller the change in hub vortex shown in fig 14 c clearly represents the merging blade passage and hub vortices effect on hub vortex at high j thus the vortex strength appears to be much more irregular than mid and low j to understand the time evolution of the vortical structures fig 14 right side represents the time history of three cells each located in one of tip blade passage and hub vortex regions a comparison between fig 14 a b and c indicates that the change in tip vortex versus time is much less than those of blade passage and hub considering the j 0 8 case the difference between its minimum and maximum values for tip blade passage and hub vortices are 23 87 and 45 respectively the same trend for low and mid j suggests that the blade passage vortex region is strongly affected by propeller s rotation while the tip vortex gets the least influence the most irregular changes occur for the hub vortex indicating that it is the region mostly affected by the turbulent nature of the flow regarding fig 14 b we observe that the amplitude of oscillations increases significantly from low to mid j while it experiences less growth from mid to high j which shows that the effect of inflow velocity on blade passage vortex magnitude becomes insignificant as j grows however the inverse behavior is demonstrated by tip vortex in fig 14 a for which the change from mid to high j is much larger than low to mid j the q criterion iso surface is shown in fig 15 for the three cases the difference between the hub vortex of j 0 8 case and the other two discussed of fig 13 is clearly visible in this figure this difference is ascribed to a merge of the blade passage and hub vortices as explained before additionally we observe that the tip helical vortices at low j merge and form a vortex cloud while as j increases it forms separated helical vortices it can be inferred that at low j tip vortex is the dominant vortical structure in the flow field but as the inflow velocity and consequently the advance coefficient increases the hub vortex becomes dominant this is strongly correlated with fig 7 where rms of velocity is shown in fig 7 strong velocity fluctuation at tip and hub regions were observed at low j at mid j fluctuations strength at the tip is decreased and instead it is intensified at the hub and finally at high j hub region fluctuation has become dominant taking a closer look at the right side of fig 15 the tip vortex trajectory prior to breakdown implies considerably different behavior for three cases for the first five vortex cores the distance between the two succeeding tip vortex cores along with their radial distance from the propeller shaft are shown in fig 16 a and b respectively pair 1 refers to cores 1 and 2 and pair 2 refers to cores 2 and 3 and so on fig 16 a suggests that the increase in j leads the tip helical vortices spacing to become more regular as previously shown in fig 15 fig 16 b shows at high j the tip vortex contraction occurs at the fixed rate as it travels away from the propeller while low and mid j show an irregular pattern of contraction fast fourier transform of velocity is depicted in fig 17 contours show the magnitude of amplitude fft u u 0 at two exciting frequencies ω 125 7 r a d s left side propeller s frequency and ω 628 5 r a d s right side one blade s frequency this figure confirms the blade passage and tip vortices cause velocity fluctuations at blade s frequency while the hub vortex induces fluctuation at the whole propeller frequency as mentioned in the discussion of fig 15 at low j and high j the tip and hub vortices are dominant respectively this trend is visible in the fft contours as well considering the left side of fig 17 large amplitude regions shift toward the propeller s hub as j increases suggesting that at the whole propeller frequency the hub s role becomes dominant at high j on the other hand the velocity oscillations at blade s frequency show passage and tip effects may be recognized easily at high j in agreement with vortical structures shown in fig 15 while at low j vortex clouds are formed by blades resulting in a unified highlighted region in fig 17 a additionally the figure reveals the extent to which the blades have a remarkable effect on the flow downstream the propeller which is a distance of about x d 2 from the propeller while we expect to have exciting frequencies at shaft frequency 125 7 rad s and blade frequency 628 5 rad s two other exciting frequencies at 502 7 rad s 4th harmonic and 2514 rad s 20th harmonics were also recognized in the flow field fft of velocity are also plotted at these two frequencies represented in fig 18 the contours at 4th harmonic left side indicate that the dominance of these frequencies originates from the complex interaction between hub blade passage and tip vortices as it is a five bladed propeller this will be repeated five times between two subsequent occurrences at 4th harmonic leading to raising 20th harmonic in which again the three vortex groups have manifested their effect yet further investigation is required to understand the details of such an interaction between the aforementioned vortex groups 5 conclusion the advance coefficient effect on a marine propeller s wake filed behavior was studied computationally the local flow was investigated by calculating mean rms and fft of velocity on several locations for three advance coefficients including j 0 1 0 4 and 0 8 in addition loads on the propeller including forces and moments were investigated on a wide range of advance coefficients for integral variables good agreement with the available experimental data was shown for various advance ratios the maximum propeller efficiency is achieved at around j 0 7 where the maximum fluctuations in the time history of side forces and moments are observed fft study on forces and moments revealed that 4th and 20th harmonics amplitudes are larger than that of 1st in x component of forces and moments side forces fluctuations are mostly influenced by the whole propeller rotation at low j and the blade rotation at high j resulting in a dominant 1st and 5th harmonic amplitude for low and high j respectively the peak of the 1st harmonic amplitude for y and z components of forces and moments occurs at j 0 7 revealing that there is a link between the side loads fluctuations and the maximum propeller efficiency the local flow investigation is carried out on several slices on x and y planes as well as specific points in the flow field the more uniform velocity mean contour as well as smaller rms magnitudes at high j comparing to low j suggests better performance at j 0 8 which is consistent with the propeller curve obtained in the integral variables study section while at low j strong fluctuations occur at both hub and tip locations at high j only the region close to the hub pose significant fluctuations this observation is repeated in the average phase locked velocity and vorticity contours where mixing of blade passage and hub vortices at high j makes the hub vortex significantly larger than the tip vortex the results indicated the tip vortices contract less at high j with a constant rate unlike low j additionally the interaction of tip vortices at low j develops a vortex cloud while at high j the tip vortex is comprised of helical vortices the results suggest that the blade vortex region gets the most influence of the propeller s rotation and the tip vortex region gets the least moreover vorticity contours suggest the tip vortex breakdown occurs at x d 1 5 x d 2 5 and x d 3 for low mid and high j respectively fft of the velocity field confirmed the fact that the strong 1st harmonic fluctuation appears near the propeller only in the hub regions at high j suggesting the hub vortex is due to the whole propeller rotation and it becomes strong only at high j furthermore 5th harmonic fluctuation appears just in the region of the tip and blade passage vortices showing blade rotation generates these two vortices credit authorship contribution statement morteza heydari

21910,cfd simulations are conducted to study the wake field behind a marine propeller in open water conditions at various advance coefficients the local variables velocity pressure and the wake structure characteristics are analyzed extensively using mean root mean square rms and fourier analysis of data the integral variables forces moments and their correlations with local variables are also investigated additionally the iterative and grid verification studies are conducted to evaluate numerical uncertainty of the simulations the results showed good agreement between the integral variables obtained by the simulations and those of experiments available in the literature which confirmed the validity of the computational method employed in this work fourier analysis studies on integral variables showed that the rotation of the whole propeller determines the fluctuation of side forces at high j while at low j mostly rotation of individual blades affects the side forces the

introduction detailed understanding of flow behavior in the wake field downstream a marine propeller of a vessel is of vital importance to evaluate the propulsion performance in seaway in addition it is of interest as one of the main factors for fuel consumption of ships to meet the requirement for minimum energy efficiency level measured by an energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi these technical measures are regulated by the international maritime organization s imo marine environment protection committee mepc to indicate the use of energy efficient equipment studies on the flow around propellers have focused on a wide range of aspects including cavitation zhu 2015 aktas et al 2016 choong et al 2018 regener et al 2018 propeller inflow sadat hosseini et al 2014 huyer and snarski 2003 propeller free surface wave interaction paik et al 2005 sadat hosseini et al 2013 li et al 2015 tavakoli et al 2018 rad et al 2019 and propeller rudder interaction carrica et al 2012 he et al 2017 mofidi et al 2018 wang et al 2019 additionally wake field and characteristics have been investigated in several studies cotroni et al 2000 wu et al 2013 muscari et al 2017 felli et al 2018 gong et al 2018 posa et al 2019 among the wake field studies felli et al 2011 experimentally investigated the mechanism of tip and hub vortices evolution in the transitional and far field regions their results suggested that the tip vortex breaks down at a certain distance from the propeller manifesting itself as a spiral with an irregular shape the location of transition to instability strongly depends on spiral to spiral distance as previously reported by okulov 2004 in addition the number of blades affects the onset of tip vortex instability location through influencing the spiral to spiral distance the authors also observed that perturbation resulting from the destabilization of tip vortices can cause the hub vortex to become unstable however the breakdown of tip vortices occurs prior to that of hub vortices and thus the hub vortices should be independent of the blade number and the advance coefficient based on this observation it is concluded that there should be a cause effect relationship between the tip and hub vortex destabilizations in a similar study by di felice et al 2009 the wake field characteristics of a propeller were evaluated at three advance coefficients of j 0 65 0 74 and 0 85 experimentally and numerically the mechanism of destabilization of vortices suggested in this study is such that each tip vortex interacts with its succeeding blade wake provoking interaction between the spirals which in turn transitions to the instability of the propeller wake di felice et al 2009 stated that an increase in advance ratio reduces the amplitude at blade frequency in the power spectral density of velocity signal at the tip vortex location ascribing to the turbulent diffusion effect and the cascade energy transfer process from the blade to the shaft harmonic involved in the instability mechanism baek et al 2015 conducted a similar study for advance ratios ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 a different number of recognizable vorticity groups in downstream is determined for different advance ratios at low j three separate regions including hub vortices blade passage vortices and tip vortices exist while there is no discernible boundary between the hub and blade passage regions at high j additionally an increase in advance ratio increases the distance between pairs of helical tip vortices which manifests itself as separated tip vortex cores on a plane passing through the helical tip vortices furthermore baek et al 2015 showed that the shrinkage rate of tip vortices by moving away from propeller decreases as j grows such that the shrinkage rate at low j range is almost five times the rate at high j range further information on detailed vortex behavior may be found in the study of paik et al 2007 in which the spatial evolution of a propeller wake is analyzed it is proven that galilean decomposition method can detect tip hub and blade passage vortices galilean method uses the principle of decomposing the instantaneous velocity into a constant convection velocity and a fluctuation velocity a range of convection velocities are considered to extract the fluctuating velocities and identify vortex cores traveling near the specified convection velocities apart from that the longitudinal distribution of radial and axial velocity components is used to understand the vorticity behavior for instance identifying velocity jumps in the longitudinal distribution of radial velocity at several radiuses suggests the presence of blade passage vorticity as the propeller model used in this study has the maximum pitch ratio at r r 0 7 a change of sign and shape in velocity jump occurs at this location additionally the tip vortex trajectory indicates strong contraction until x d 0 53 and oscillations afterward due to interaction with blade passage vortices in addition to the foregoing topics in wake field investigation some studies have focused on the propeller s geometrical parameters role wang et al 2018 investigated the correlation between the skew of the propellers and the blade passage vortex wake evolution for dtmb propeller they employed the sst k ω turbulence model to study the relationship between the blade passage vortex and the geometry of the propeller for four different propeller models with different skew angles other geometrical parameters such as the number of blades diameter and design advance ratios were chosen to be the same for all models their study revealed that the increase in the skew angle vanished blade root vortices and rebelled against the contraction of blade passage vortex as the skew increase weakens blade to blade interaction it leads to the diminution of the tip vortex destabilization and hub vortex deformation kumar and mahesh 2017 studied the evolution of a five bladed propeller wake from the near field to the far field using a les turbulence model it has been shown that the blade trailing edge wake becomes destabilized in the near field due to kelvin helmholtz instabilities resulting in the formation of small vortical structures the tip vortices remain stable in the near field even though they are detached from the blade passage vortices however the mutual induction between the tip vortices and interaction with the blade passage vortical structures eventually destabilize of the tip vortices in the far field keller et al 2017 conducted les simulations of a five bladed propeller in forward mode of operation with a focus on wake dynamics and flow generated sound they showed that the instability is derived by the interaction between tip vortices and blade trailing wake the spectra of average phase locked radial velocity were plotted at several probes at the tip vortex hub vortex and mid blade vortex regions the spectra plotted at tip vortices region show dominant peak at shaft frequency along with distinct frequency peaks ascribed to the complex tip and blade vortices interactions the spectra in the hub vortex region show that they pose higher energy at frequencies lower than that of the shaft in the near field the aim of the present work is to expand the previous studies for further investigation of the wake field of a propeller in the open water condition by means of simulations at various advance coefficients the in house cfdfoam solver is used for the simulations the integral variables forces moments are validated against the experimental data the local variables velocity pressure and vortical structures in the wake field are analyzed extensively using mean root mean square rms and fourier analysis additionally the iterative and grid verification studies are conducted to evaluate the numerical uncertainty of the simulations the analysis is focused on understanding the way local flow and integral variables are influenced by the advance coefficient and finding out possible connections between them the contribution of propeller tip blade and hub interaction with the flow to the wake field is studied in detail and compared at three different j 2 cfd method our in house code cfdfoam is used for the cfd computations the cfdfoam has been built around openfoam which employs a cell centered finite volume method but is designed for ship hydrodynamic applications using either absolute or relative inertial coordinate system with non deforming and deforming control volumes the code utilizes conventional body fitted methods as well as immersed boundary methods for moving morphing boundaries and offers various turbulence models volume of fluid for free surface capturing and 6dof capabilities kingora and sadat 2019 for the current simulations absolute inertial earth fixed coordinates are employed with sst k ω turbulence model using no wall function the coupled pressure and velocity are solved using piso the 6dof rigid body equations of motion are not solved as propeller motion is prescribed to rotate at n 20 rev s 2 1 propeller geometry we conduct our studies for the propeller of a containership developed by korean research institute and ocean engineering kriso the propeller has 5 blades rotating clockwise when seen from the stern the propeller diameter in full scale is 7 9 m with a hub ratio of 0 18 and blade ratio area of 0 8 the experiments were conducted tokyo 2015 for the model with the scale ratio of 1 37 9 the experiments were performed for various advance ratio while the rotating velocity of the propeller was kept constant at n 20 rev s the body plan of the model is shown in fig 1 and the main particulars of the model are listed in table 1 the coordinate system is located at the center of propeller with x pointing toward the suction side upstream y to starboard and z upward the axis of rotation is aligned with the x axis 2 2 computational domain boundary conditions and grids the computational domain has a circular cylinder shape extending from 2 5d x 4 5d with a diameter of 6 5d where d is the diameter of the propeller the center of the propeller is located at x y z 0 0 0 as shown in fig 2 boundary conditions consist of the velocity boundary condition for the inlet zero gradient boundary condition for the outlet slip wall for the surrounding surface and no slip wall on the propeller details of boundary conditions are described in table 2 the grid system consists of a single block and overset capability was not used thus the whole domain rotates at the same speed with the propeller to avoid harming deforming the quality of the grid while the propeller rotates to avoid strong numerical dissipation and capture the features of the vortex system the grid sizes in the domain are designed carefully for the fine grid the block consists of 30 m tetrahedral volume elements where the propeller s surface mesh has 270 k grid points there are 95 and 220 grid points per chord and span of the propeller respectively a cylindrical refinement block with 15 m points is designed around the propeller to capture the wakes depicted in fig 3 the block has a diameter of 1 8d and a length of 4 5d starting at x 0 6d and ending at x 3 9d therefore the refinement block fully covers the wake region up to the near the outlet boundary of the computational domain the block has about 590 and 720 grid points in streamwise and azimuthal directions respectively the medium and coarse grid systems are also generated for the grid verification study where the average cell size is reduced by a factor of 2 from fine to medium and medium to coarse grids the coarse and medium grids consist of 4 and 11 million cells respectively the grid is designed in such a way that average y on the propeller s surface for all simulations is less than 1 the grid points for the fine medium and coarse grids are decomposed on 112 80 and 56 cpus respectively for parallel processing fig 3 shows the grid system in the domain and on the propeller surface 2 3 simulation conditions and analysis methods the simulations are carried out for a

amplitude and p ε n is the corresponding phase for the n th frequency ω n the mean and harmonic amplitudes were also evaluated for the local flow including velocity and pressure the mean of local variables is evaluated for both phase locked and out of phase conditions in phase lock the local flow variables such as velocity at a selected phase of the propeller are only used to compute the mean value in out of phase condition the velocity in the field over a complete cycle of propeller is averaged additionally the root mean square rms is investigated for example rms for the velocity time history u ti is calculated based on eq 14 14 r m s i 1 n u t i u 2 n based on the local flow the propeller thrust t p can be estimated using the change in momentum flux across boundaries of a control

study the iterative and grid uncertainties are investigated for j 0 4 the iterative uncertainty is evaluated using grid g1 the grid verification study is conducted using grid triplets g3 g2 and g1 with rg 2 verification variables are the mean values of ktx and kqx i e the shaft thrust and torque as well as the propeller efficiency the iterative uncertainty listed in table 3 shows relatively small values for the mean value of the thrust and torque about 0 03 s1 for ktx and 0 04 s1 for kqx also uni for the mean value is acceptably small compared to the grid uncertainties ung and ε12 g the average iterative uncertainty is about uni 0 035 s1 showing the results are insensitive to the iterative errors the grid study indicates monotonic convergence for k t x with r g 0 50 while monotonic divergence was observed for k q x with r g 1 17 for k t x ε 12 g and un g are 0 001 and 0 9 respectively and the order of accuracy p g 2 00 is obtained which is consistent with the theoretical order of discretization scheme therefore the grid study shows a very small grid uncertainty for k t x the total numerical uncertainty is computed using eq 5 showing average un sn 1 03 s1 for the verification variables this confirms reasonably small numerical uncertainty for the fine grid thus the fine grid was used for all the studies 4 results and discussions 4 1 studies on integral variables fig 4 depicts time histories for all components of thrust and torque respectively for some of the advance coefficients simulations have been performed for a longer time to assure convergence the results show large oscillations on the time history for y and z components of thrust and torque whereas the x component fluctuation is negligibly small the level of y and z fluctuations depends on the advance ratio and become fairly large for j values greater than 0 7 yet the largest y and z components are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the x component for a better understanding of the trends of predicted time histories the mean values are investigated as shown in fig 5 a the mean values are only plotted for the loads in x direction as the others are zero due to the axisymmetric condition of the propeller it can be observed that increasing the advance ratio decreases the mean x force and moment the predicted values are validated against the experimental data tokyo 2015 the details on this comparison are provided in table 4 efd experimental fluid dynamics column shows values obtained from experiments at the same condition as demonstrated in the table thrust has the average error of only 1 27 over all cases with various j values while the average error for torque is 5 17 the efficiency has a larger average of error 6 13 compared to those for k t x and k q x the trend for efficiency is well predicted showing a maximum value around j 0 7 similar to the experimental data table 4 also lists the mean value comparison with the experimental data for the grid verification studies conducted at j 0 4 considering the grid verification cases the average of all error values for the coarse grid is 4 13 dropping to 3 70 for the medium grid and 3 51 for the fine grid suggesting a better agreement with the data for the fine grid simulation to understand the source of the resultant mean x force moment fig 5 b shows the contribution of the pressure and friction on the force moment as well the friction component changes slightly with increasing advance coefficient as reynolds numbers are not exactly the same among all cases even though the propeller rpm is kept fixed for various j cases different inlet velocities among cases change the velocity of the flow past the blades surfaces and local reynolds number yet the influence of the variation of the friction loads on the trends of total loads is just negligible in fact the friction force moment is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that of the pressure such that the pressure loads mainly dictate the trends of the total propeller forces and moments fourier analysis of the predicted time series is also reported in fig 6 to investigate the existing oscillations on forces and moments using eqs 9 13 the analysis reveals large 1st 4th 5th and 20th harmonics notably 1st harmonic corresponds to the frequency of the rotation of the whole propeller ω 125 7 rad s or n 20 round s and 5th harmonic corresponds to one blade rotation frequency ω 628 rad s for k t x dominant oscillation amplitudes appear at 4th and 20th harmonics with the 4th harmonic amplitude being smaller than the 20th harmonic for cases with j 0 75 except for j 0 6 the inexistence of large 1st harmonic amplitude suggests that blades dictate the level of the unsteadiness in the x force nevertheless the amplitudes of these fluctuations are very small as shown by the time series in fig 4 for k t y and k t z 1st and 5th harmonic amplitudes are dominant with 5th harmonic amplitude becoming the larger amplitude for lower j values therefore the whole propeller contributes to the fluctuations of side forces at high j values while the interaction of blade turbulences affects side forces at low j values it seems the fluctuations of y and z components are linked to the maximum propeller efficiency since the peak of the 1st harmonic amplitudes for y and z loads occurs at a speed close to j 0 7 where the propeller efficiency is maximum 4 2 studies on local variables fig 7 demonstrates the mean and root mean square rms contours of normalized streamwise velocity u u 0 on a plane located at a distance of 0 2 d downstream the propeller for low mid and high advance coefficients j 0 1 0 4 and 0 8 using eqs 9 and 14 the horizontal and vertical axes are normalized with the propeller diameter such that x 0 5 0 5 correspond to the locations of the propeller s tip as j becomes larger the mean contours show a larger area with u u0 being close to unity this indicates a better propeller performance for j 0 8 according to eq 18 which is consistent with the propeller efficiency calculated based on the integral variables propeller thrust and torque shown in fig 5 a reduction of rms values or fluctuations at high j cases also suggests a better performance for j 0 8 compared to j 0 1 and 0 4 the rms distributions also reveal the vortical structures and their strength in the flow field for j 0 1 the maximum rms values occur close to the hub and tip correlated with the hub and tip vortices for mid and high j the rms value close to the tip gradually weakens and becomes stronger near to the hub fig 8 shows phase locked θ 0 mean and rms contours of normalized streamwise velocity to understand the effect of each blade on the flow field for each blade the mean streamwise velocity in the propeller wake is highest around 0 7r and reduces by moving toward the root or tip rms contours reveal the velocity fluctuation generated around each blade the roots of blades generate more fluctuations at high j while the trailing edge of blades and blades tips cause more fluctuations at low j fig 9 depicts average phase locked θ 0 velocity and vorticity distribution for the three cases on z 0 plane the velocity illustrates the wake pattern at each j for j 0 1 the wake width is quite constant until increases suddenly at x d 1 5 downstream the propeller at this point the tip vortex tube destabilizes and oscillates as shown in the vorticity distribution this vortex breakdown is observed for mid and high j cases but occurs further away from the propeller roughly at x d 2 5 for j 0 4 and x d 3 for j 0 8 the frequency of the tip vortex tube oscillations is much smaller than the frequency of the propeller rotation thus the instability could be due to the shear instability in the flow field rather than being correlated directly to the propeller rpm the vorticity distribution shows the wake of the propeller hub which has a significantly larger width for higher j cases this causes a tremendous interaction between the hub and blade passage vortical structures for j 0 8 the mixing of the hub and blade passage vortices affects the tip vortical structures far from the propeller interestingly the period of the hub vortex is about five times larger than the blade passage and tip vortices confirming that the hub vortex pattern is generated by the rotation of the whole propeller fig 10 shows the mean and rms of velocity profiles along the solution domain mean velocity profiles become flat as j increases showing a better propulsion performance for higher j cases as discussed before apart from this the profile becomes smooth as the distance from the propeller increases which is due to the decay of tip and hub effects as demonstrated for the velocity in fig 9 at low j the peak locations of the mean velocity profile in the regions close to the propeller and downstream are very different i e y d 0 45 d and y d 0 25 d respectively while the peak location at various regions is quite the same for highest j this shows a stronger contraction rate for the wake field at lower j values the profiles of rms of velocity indicate two peak locations for the near wake field one around y d 0 7 and another near the hub the level of fluctuations decreases as the flow moves away from the propeller at j 0 1 and j 0 8 demonstrated by the fact that the profiles become smooth for j 0 4 however strong fluctuation at far field can be still observed this is because the initial vortex cloud induced by the sudden rotation of the propeller has not left the solution domain yet the decay of the maximum velocity values is shown in fig 11 a the velocity drops very fast for j 0 1 as the flow is washed away from the propeller while the velocity values remain intact at high j fig 11 b gives a similar conclusion for the difference between the minimum and maximum velocity values fig 12 demonstrates line contours and traces of tip hub and blade passage vortices for the three cases at phase θ 0 deg fig 12 a indicates the tip helical vortices generated from each propeller cycle at low j case interact and form a large vortical structure or a vortex cloud for high j the tip helical vortices generated by each propeller cycle can be separately identified these tip helical vortices are more stretched in the transverse direction than the longitudinal direction resembling a drop form the hub vortex system shows scattered rings at all j values with more irregular shapes at j 0 8 in fig 12 b the traces of the center of tip vortices suggest that the distance between the location of their formation and the blades tips is proportional to the value of the advance coefficient as j increases the tip vortices form at a larger radial distance from the propeller the vortices travel downstream while slowly moving toward the axis of the rotation unlike the tip vortices the hub vortices move away from the axis of the rotation which leads to an interaction between the tip and hub vortices after traveling a short distance downstream the propeller fig 13 expands figs 9 and 11 a studies for zero propeller phase to more phases to investigate the phase effect on the vortical structures at j 0 1 the phase slightly affects the shape of the tip helical vortices and the phase location of the hub vortices but the blade passage vortical structures remain the same for different propeller phases at j 0 4 only the phase of the hub vortices varies for different propeller phases and the tip and blade passage vortical structures are unaffected at high j the blade passage and hub vortices are mixed and thus only two distinct tip and hub blade vortices are observed the location and shape of the new hub blade vortex system depend on the propeller phase in order to further clarify the advance coefficient effect on vorticity shown in fig 13 it would be helpful to evaluate the change in vorticity versus the distance from the propeller and its evolution fig 14 left side depicts variation in tip blade passage and hub vortices versus distance x d along the plotted straight lines for phase θ 0 at an instant based on what represented in fig 14 a it can be observed that tip vortices line at high j display a more oscillating behavior than low j which is in agreement with fig 13 showing that tip vortices at j 0 8 are discrete helical vortices while the distance between helical vortices reduces at j 0 1 0 4 merging and forming a vortex cloud in addition the tip vortex has a larger magnitude at low j the vortex plotted along the blade passage vortex line also demonstrates an oscillating vortex strength at all advance coefficients the wavelength of the blade passage vortex oscillations is different for different j values since it is dominated by the combination of the tangential speed rpm and axial inflow speed however the blade passage vortex has almost the same magnitude for the three j cases similar to the tip vortices the blade passage vortex strength reduces by traveling away from the propeller the change in hub vortex shown in fig 14 c clearly represents the merging blade passage and hub vortices effect on hub vortex at high j thus the vortex strength appears to be much more irregular than mid and low j to understand the time evolution of the vortical structures fig 14 right side represents the time history of three cells each located in one of tip blade passage and hub vortex regions a comparison between fig 14 a b and c indicates that the change in tip vortex versus time is much less than those of blade passage and hub considering the j 0 8 case the difference between its minimum and maximum values for tip blade passage and hub vortices are 23 87 and 45 respectively the same trend for low and mid j suggests that the blade passage vortex region is strongly affected by propeller s rotation while the tip vortex gets the least influence the most irregular changes occur for the hub vortex indicating that it is the region mostly affected by the turbulent nature of the flow regarding fig 14 b we observe that the amplitude of oscillations increases significantly from low to mid j while it experiences less growth from mid to high j which shows that the effect of inflow velocity on blade passage vortex magnitude becomes insignificant as j grows however the inverse behavior is demonstrated by tip vortex in fig 14 a for which the change from mid to high j is much larger than low to mid j the q criterion iso surface is shown in fig 15 for the three cases the difference between the hub vortex of j 0 8 case and the other two discussed of fig 13 is clearly visible in this figure this difference is ascribed to a merge of the blade passage and hub vortices as explained before additionally we observe that the tip helical vortices at low j merge and form a vortex cloud while as j increases it forms separated helical vortices it can be inferred that at low j tip vortex is the dominant vortical structure in the flow field but as the inflow velocity and consequently the advance coefficient increases the hub vortex becomes dominant this is strongly correlated with fig 7 where rms of velocity is shown in fig 7 strong velocity fluctuation at tip and hub regions were observed at low j at mid j fluctuations strength at the tip is decreased and instead it is intensified at the hub and finally at high j hub region fluctuation has become dominant taking a closer look at the right side of fig 15 the tip vortex trajectory prior to breakdown implies considerably different behavior for three cases for the first five vortex cores the distance between the two succeeding tip vortex cores along with their radial distance from the propeller shaft are shown in fig 16 a and b respectively pair 1 refers to cores 1 and 2 and pair 2 refers to cores 2 and 3 and so on fig 16 a suggests that the increase in j leads the tip helical vortices spacing to become more regular as previously shown in fig 15 fig 16 b shows at high j the tip vortex contraction occurs at the fixed rate as it travels away from the propeller while low and mid j show an irregular pattern of contraction fast fourier transform of velocity is depicted in fig 17 contours show the magnitude of amplitude fft u u 0 at two exciting frequencies ω 125 7 r a d s left side propeller s frequency and ω 628 5 r a d s right side one blade s frequency this figure confirms the blade passage and tip vortices cause velocity fluctuations at blade s frequency while the hub vortex induces fluctuation at the whole propeller frequency as mentioned in the discussion of fig 15 at low j and high j the tip and hub vortices are dominant respectively this trend is visible in the fft contours as well considering the left side of fig 17 large amplitude regions shift toward the propeller s hub as j increases suggesting that at the whole propeller frequency the hub s role becomes dominant at high j on the other hand the velocity oscillations at blade s frequency show passage and tip effects may be recognized easily at high j in agreement with vortical structures shown in fig 15 while at low j vortex clouds are formed by blades resulting in a unified highlighted region in fig 17 a additionally the figure reveals the extent to which the blades have a remarkable effect on the flow downstream the propeller which is a distance of about x d 2 from the propeller while we expect to have exciting frequencies at shaft frequency 125 7 rad s and blade frequency 628 5 rad s two other exciting frequencies at 502 7 rad s 4th harmonic and 2514 rad s 20th harmonics were also recognized in the flow field fft of velocity are also plotted at these two frequencies represented in fig 18 the contours at 4th harmonic left side indicate that the dominance of these frequencies originates from the complex interaction between hub blade passage and tip vortices as it is a five bladed propeller this will be repeated five times between two subsequent occurrences at 4th harmonic leading to raising 20th harmonic in which again the three vortex groups have manifested their effect yet further investigation is required to understand the details of such an interaction between the aforementioned vortex groups 5 conclusion the advance coefficient effect on a marine propeller s wake filed behavior was studied computationally the local flow was investigated by calculating mean rms and fft of velocity on several locations for three advance coefficients including j 0 1 0 4 and 0 8 in addition loads on the propeller including forces and moments were investigated on a wide range of advance coefficients for integral variables good agreement with the available experimental data was shown for various advance ratios the maximum propeller efficiency is achieved at around j 0 7 where the maximum fluctuations in the time history of side forces and moments are observed fft study on forces and moments revealed that 4th and 20th harmonics amplitudes are larger than that of 1st in x component of forces and moments side forces fluctuations are mostly influenced by the whole propeller rotation at low j and the blade rotation at high j resulting in a dominant 1st and 5th harmonic amplitude for low and high j respectively the peak of the 1st harmonic amplitude for y and z components of forces and moments occurs at j 0 7 revealing that there is a link between the side loads fluctuations and the maximum propeller efficiency the local flow investigation is carried out on several slices on x and y planes as well as specific points in the flow field the more uniform velocity mean contour as well as smaller rms magnitudes at high j comparing to low j suggests better performance at j 0 8 which is consistent with the propeller curve obtained in the integral variables study section while at low j strong fluctuations occur at both hub and tip locations at high j only the region close to the hub pose significant fluctuations this observation is repeated in the average phase locked velocity and vorticity contours where mixing of blade passage and hub vortices at high j makes the hub vortex significantly larger than the tip vortex the results indicated the tip vortices contract less at high j with a constant rate unlike low j additionally the interaction of tip vortices at low j develops a vortex cloud while at high j the tip vortex is comprised of helical vortices the results suggest that the blade vortex region gets the most influence of the propeller s rotation and the tip vortex region gets the least moreover vorticity contours suggest the tip vortex breakdown occurs at x d 1 5 x d 2 5 and x d 3 for low mid and high j respectively fft of the velocity field confirmed the fact that the strong 1st harmonic fluctuation appears near the propeller only in the hub regions at high j suggesting the hub vortex is due to the whole propeller rotation and it becomes strong only at high j furthermore 5th harmonic fluctuation appears just in the region of the tip and blade passage vortices showing blade rotation generates these two vortices credit authorship contribution statement morteza heydari

21911,this paper highlights linear and nonlinear waves under the influence of surficial structural stiffness and inertia the main focus is on the waves in a thin elastic plate floating on the water surface a numerical simulation method combining smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the finite element method is developed to predict the waves propagating in the thin elastic plate for validation the simulation results are compared to those obtained through a numerical method based on the linear potential theory for linear regular wave cases when the incident wave amplitude was increased the waves nonlinearity was observed in the simulation results the nonlinear waves characteristics are elucidated through a mathematical solution derived in a similar manner to stokes wave theory a significant difference is confirmed through comparisons with the conventional nonlinear free surface wave the positive peak was higher than the negative peak due to nonlinearity in one frequency range while it was the opposite in the other frequency range the nonlinear wave s amplitude increased divergently at the frequency between the two frequency ranges overall it is shown that the mathematical solution effectively explains the characteristics of the nonlinear waves in the elastic plate observed in the numerical simulations keywords nonlinear wave vlfs coupling sph fem stokes expansion 1 introduction when water waves interact with a floating thin elastic plate the incident wave that passes under the floating elastic plate will likely undergo property changes due to the interaction effects this problem may be found among coupled issues such as a large floating runway a floating ice sheet a mega scale solar energy platform on the water surface etc in fact this issue has long been studied in terms of hydroelasticity in this study a nonlinear hydroelasticity issue involving a thin elastic plate interacting with the waves is addressed suzuki 2005 illustrated the behavior of a very large floating structure vlfs which may be modeled as a thin elastic plate floating on the water surface a vlfs may be used to create a floating airport floating port facility floating bridge floating fuel coal storage facility floating city etc the first vlfs was launched off of yokohama in tokyo bay and was used to demonstrate that such a structure can function as a floating airport isobe 1999 while wang et al 2008 reported a floating structure for a space creation built in singapore more recently a project involving floating bridges emerged in norway in which varying types of floating bridges were considered statens vegvese meanwhile an international ship and offshore structures congress committee report 2006 summarized the current state of the art vlfss a huge sized structure will have deflection waves interacting with the fluid surrounding it as a result of the so called hydroelasticity effects hydroelasticity effects have long been the focus of vlfs related studies among these ohmatsu 1997 formulated the hydroelastic behavior of a pontoon type vlfs by adopting a domain decomposition method subsequently extending the method to cases where the vlfs was surrounded by breakwaters elsewhere kashiwagi 1998 adopted a b spline scheme within a pressure distribution method and an eigen function expansion method to improve computation efficiency while seto et al 2005 developed an integrated code to analyze the wave induced response of a vlfs in their method the fluid structure interaction fsi problem was formulated within a frequency domain using the domain decomposition method and the finite element method fem with consideration of the sea bottom topography finally based on the boundary element method utsunomiya et al 2001 proposed a fast multipole method to improve simulation efficiency for the wave induced response of a vlfs within a complex geometry in these studies the deflection and free surface waves were assumed to be small in amplitude and the formulations were produced by considering only linear terms these assumptions were both convenient and advantageous for understanding the overall behavior of a vlfs within the linearity context in terms of reducing the calculation cost by solving the equations in the frequency domain while maintaining accuracy meanwhile the nonlinear behavior of a floating thin elastic plate is also a concern a vlfs in extreme sea states must be clarified from a risk analysis viewpoint which will ensure the linear assumptions provide significant constraints for understanding the floating elastic plate s behavior in extreme waves a weakly nonlinear hydroelastic analysis for vlfs was proposed by belibassakis and athanassoulis 2006 their research focused on the variable bathymetry regions nonlinear influence more recently vanden broeck and parau 2011 reported a theoretical approach for nonlinear hydroelastic waves under ice sheets in their model the ice sheet was regarded as an elastic flexible plate without considering the inertia influence elsewhere suzuki 2001 discussed the risk aspect of vlfss and the target safety level a vlfs must be designed with a sufficiently high safety factor under appropriate design loads or sea states the appropriate safety factor level can be calibrated based on the risk analysis results the vlfs designers may have to prove that the structural damage is minor or limited under severe sea loads with the return period well over the design life to this end a nonlinear analysis that can follow the structure s behavior in severe conditions is necessary such attempts were made by fujikubo et al 2003a 2003b who adopted special nonlinear finite elements known as isum elements to investigate the collapse behavior of a pontoon type vlfs the vlfs was modeled as a flat plate strengthened by several stiffeners here the vlfs s buckling and yielding were investigated while the hydrodynamic interactions were ignored elsewhere liu and sakai 1997 and liu et al 2002 investigated the propagation characteristics of nonlinear waves on a vlfs based on the nonlinear potential theory while chen et al 2003 developed a hydroelasticity theory while taking the plate s large deflection into account here the linear potential theory was adopted and coupled one of the present authors iijima has previously focused on investigating the vlfs s nonlinear collapse behavior under severe wave loads where not only the elastic structural response but also the plastic structural response and post ultimate structural response were addressed in iijima and fujikubo 2018a an analysis model was developed to predict a vlfs s collapse behavior with the whole structure segmented into two beams connected via a nonlinear rotational spring representing the deformations in elastic and plastic ranges the results of the vlfs s collapse behavior were validated through the tank test results we also recently introduced an elasto plastic beam approach to follow a more realistic collapse behavior iijima et al 2018 while an analytical solution was developed to clarify the vlfs s collapse behavioral characteristics iijima and fujikubo 2018b however the wave model adopted in these studies was limited to the linear version nonlinear wave modeling associated with the large amplitude of motion and deformation must be implemented within the analysis code for more accurate predictions of a vlfs s behavior when subjected to severe sea states computational fluid dynamics cfd has recently been developed and has become prevalent in addressing various oceanic problems by directly solving the navier stokes equation the nonlinear influence which is omitted in potential theories such as nonlinear free surface green water seabed topography and vortex formation theories can be taken into account the eulerian grid based model is used widely to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure on vessels and offshore structures a numerical model based on a two way coupling methodology involving star ccm and ls dyna was proposed to analyze the hydroelastic behavior in relation to ships takami et al 2018 however compared with that involving ship structures vlfs related research based on the eulerian grid based model is limited lee et al 2003 used the composite grid method to clarify the influence of an anti motion device on a vlfs s motion the grid based model usually involves a distortion issue and a huge amount of computational work is needed to renew the mesh in the free surface or the fsi surface in view of this the particle method has undergone rapid development in recent decades as an alternative fluid model where given that it is a lagrangian meshless method the distortion problem is no longer an issue as such the particle method may be more appropriate for nonlinear hydroelastic analysis hermange et al 2016 validated their smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph fem coupling model using an elastic gate test while ma et al 2017 proposed and validated an alternative coupling model involving sph and nonlinear fem for a beam impact test this paper discusses the nonlinear deflection behavior of a thin elastic plate with large amplitude a numerical simulation method combining sph and fem is developed and applied to this problem the whole structure is discretized into beam elements the predictions obtained through the developed method are compared to those obtained via the linear potential theory based method proposed by one of the present authors see appendix c in iijima and fujikubo 2018a the linear potential theory result was validated using the model test results in terms of elastic and plastic deflection one advantage of the developed sph fem model is that it can account for nonlinear fluid dynamics second order waves are observed in the simulation results both on the free surface and the thin elastic plate for waves with large amplitudes the nonlinear waves characteristics in terms of surficial structural stiffness and inertia are elucidated via a mathematical solution derived in a similar manner with stokes waves it is shown that the mathematical solution effectively explains the nonlinear waves in the thin elastic plate observed in the numerical simulations 2 the coupled sph fem model in this study a coupled sph fem model was developed to provide insight into the hydroelastic behavior of the thin elastic plate on the water surface for illustration the two dimensional numerical water tank established in the sph fem model for the following discussion is shown in fig 1 along with the definition of the coordinate system used in the simulation the fluid model based on sph is summarized in appendix a the fem based structure model can be found in appendix b in this research we considered one dimensional beam floating on the surface in vertical x z plane so that the axial stiffness and torsional stiffness were ignored the hydrodynamic model based on sph was weakly coupled with the beam element model in a time domain based on the partitioned coupling scheme the free surface of sph fluid model was governed by the deformation of floating structure based on the assumption that the fluid particle cannot pernitrate the solid boundary the structural deformation could be obtained by the hydrodynamic force solved by sph model the force and displacement velocity were transferred in the physical contact interface between the fluid and the structure for each iteration the whole structure was discretized to many floating rigid hulls consisting of multiple boundary particles fig 2 by integrating all the fluid force on the boundary particles solved via sph the external fluid force acting on each hull could be obtained all hulls were connected to the neighboring node of the beam element the flowchart of the sph fem coupling is presented in fig 3 the hydrodynamic force f sph on the center of the hull node could be calculated by integrating all the forces acting on the boundary particles in the sph model meanwhile the force due to the structural stiffness f beam on the nodes could be obtained in terms of beam element stiffness k see appendix b according to equation f b e a m k x x represents the displacement of the centers of the floating hulls in this research as the two dimensional issue was investigated x consists of lateral displacement and angular deformation the unbalanced force f sph f beam was used to calculate the acceleration velocity and displacement of the hulls finally the dynamic one dimensional beam equation based on conventional euler bernoulli beam theory eq 1 could be discretized as the equation of motion for floating hulls as shown in eq 2 1 m 2 w t 2 e i 4 w x 4 q 2 m x f s p h f b e a m where m w e i q are the mass per unit length beam deflection bending stiffness and external load m is the mass matrix it should be noted that in eq 2 the structural damping could also be taken into account however to simplify the problem the structural damping influence is neglected in the following discussion once the information on the hulls was updated the new locations of the boundary particles on the hulls could be obtained accordingly finally the updated information on the hulls and particles was used to calculate the next time step or the corrector phase as shown in fig 3 to obtain better numerical stability the explicit second order predictor corrector scheme was used in this research monaghan 2005 3 analytical solution for nonlinear waves in a floating elastic plate the nonlinear wave influence should be considered since most structure failure occurs when the wave height becomes severe many research studies e g tsubogo and okada 1997 tsubogo 1998 have developed the linear theoretical models for waves interacting the vlfs while neglecting the nonlinear components under kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions to the best of our knowledge there is no theoretical model for interpreting nonlinear waves in a thin elastic plate with finite wave motion amplitude assuming the structure is infinitely long the second order two dimensional wave concerning surficial structural stiffness and inertia was mathematically investigated based on the taylor series expansion and the perturbation series approach the resonance period for the second order wave related to surficial structural stiffness and inertia was derived according to the proposed nonlinear theoretical model unlike with the conventional stokes wave theory newman 1972 and stokes 1849 while the existence of symmetric waves one with a steeper peak and another with a steeper trough was also proven 3 1 equations for kinematic condition and dynamic condition under the influence of surficial structural stiffness and inertia a two dimensional thin elastic plate or pontoon type vlfs with infinite length was adopted here fig 4 to provide surficial structural stiffness and inertia the whole vlfs was modeled as a uniform beam with negligibly small draft which was floating on the water surface in a vertical two dimensional plane the x axis was taken along the vlfs while the z axis was taken as positive upward the coordinate system origin was located at the still water surface level based on the assumption of incompressible and irrotational flow laplace s equation 2 ϕ 0 should still be satisfied ϕ denotes the potential function the void cavity between the structure and the water and the water penetration across the structure were not considered denoting the vlfs deflection in the z direction as w x t regardless of the horizontal displacement of the vlfs the body boundary condition could be defined by assigning the vlfs deflection velocity as the same as that of the water wave elevation then the kinematic boundary condition on the free surface z η x t where η is wave elevation could be derived as in eq 3 3 d w d η ϕ z on z η x t the dynamic condition can be modified as 4 ϕ

perturbation series approach and taylor series expansion according to the perturbation approach which is based on the assumption that each perturbation component can be represented by the relevant

neglected both j 1 and j 2 reduce to g and γ equals 1 then equations 17 and 18 are equivalent to the conventional stokes wave solutions stokes 1849 meanwhile eq 18 can be simplified to eq 17 when the water depth h becomes infinite the convergence rate can be defined as the ratio of the second order wave amplitude to the first order wave amplitude at z 0 19 r η 2 η 1 1 2 a 1 k 1 β eq 19 also stands for infinite water depth when δ 1 according to eq 19 it can be found that except for δ 1 which is the same as with the stokes wave theory another divergence condition exists when considering the influences of structural stiffness and inertia which can be defined as δ 2 γ 1 this means that even for deep water conditions the waves in the thin elastic plate may have a large nonlinear component that cannot be explained through the conventional stokes wave theory this nonlinearity can be significant even though a k 1 and δ 1 the resonance period can be solved according to eq 20 in which a

wave component was much smaller than the first order wave component therefore when the incoming wave period is close to the resonance period the proposed theoretical model can only qualitatively predict the first and second order waves in the thin elastic plate on the other hand the fully nonlinear sph fem model can quantitatively predict the first and second order waves in the thin elastic plate when the incoming wave period is located around the resonance period 4 results and discussion the validation work for the proposed sph fem model was first carried out in terms of the linear defection which involved comparing this with the results obtained by another numerical tool iijima and fujikubo 2018a the validation results can be found in appendix b 4 1 two dimensional stokes wave by sph before numerically investigating the second order waves in a thin elastic plate the nonlinear wave generated by the sph model was first validated in terms of the conventional stokes wave theory the thin elastic plate is not considered here the numerical water tank shown in fig 1 without the vlfs model was used to generate the nonlinear wave while the piston type wavemaker with sinusoidal horizontal movement was adopted the generated wave period was 2 s and the first order wave amplitude was 0 05 m which is located exactly in the regime of the second order stokes wave theory fig 5 shows the wave elevation comparison between the sph simulation results and the stokes wave theory it is demonstrated that the second order stokes wave can be predicted effectively by the sph model 4 2 ratio between the first and second order components of nonlinear deflection waves in the theoretical discussion about the nonlinear waves in a floating thin elastic plate the initial hypothesis is the model has an infinite length then the wave that propagates along the plate excluding the effects from the ends is focused on in order to derive a theoretical solution for the second order waves in the elastic plate this may be justifiable since the disturbances from both ends are eliminated when the wave progresses far enough from the ends suzuki 2005 corresponding to the above assumption the vlfs model used appendix b was increased in length by 10 times the original size so that the finite length influence could be eliminated especially for the midship parts meanwhile to exclude the shallow water s influence the numerical tank depth was increased from 0 45 to 0 8 m the same structure stiffness and density were adopted the main parameters of the vlfs model used in this section are summarized in table 1 based on the stokes wave theory and the proposed theoretical wave model with the influence of structural stiffness and inertia eq 19 the ratio between the second order and first order wave amplitude see fig 6 was calculated for a constant water depth of 0 8 m the horizontal axis represents the regular incoming wave period the ratio between the second order and the first order wave amplitude depends on the latter and here the first order wave amplitude was assumed to be 10 cm according to eq 20 the resonance period for waves in the thin elastic plate is 2 07 s for wave periods located around the 2 07 s mark the second order wave amplitude is much larger than the prediction results based on the conventional stokes wave theory it is clear that when the wave period is larger than the resonance period the ratio is positive thus considering the second order wave influence the crests and troughs of the waves on the thin elastic plate become steeper and flatter respectively positive wave in this paper this phenomenon is similar to that found in the conventional stokes wave theory however when the wave period is smaller than the resonance period a negative ratio occurs and the waves in the thin elastic plate have a flatter crest and steeper trough negative wave in this paper which is impossible according to the conventional stokes wave theory corresponding numerical simulations based on sph fem were carried out with regular incoming wave periods of between 1 7 and 2 7 s in accordance with madsen s equation madsen 1971 the wave maker was controlled to generate the regular incoming wave with a wave amplitude of 10 cm the deflection wave elevation or vlfs vertical displacement in the mid span of the vlfs wem obtained from the sph fem model was checked due to the influence of the vlfs s structural stiffness and inertia the first order wem amplitudes can be much smaller than the incoming wave amplitude of 10 cm the first and second order wem amplitudes was obtained based on the fourier transformation of the 100 s simulation results from the sph fem model for example regarding the cases with incoming wave periods of 2 1 and 2 2 s the first order amplitude of wem was 0 016 and 0 026 m respectively while the second order amplitudes of wem was 0 025 and 0 027 m respectively based on the first and second order wem amplitudes the ratio between the second order and the first order amplitudes could be identified the same results presented in fig 6 are replotted in fig 7 but with a different vertical axis the new vertical axis corresponds to the ratio between the second order amplitude and half of the square of the first order amplitude character ratio such that the new vertical axis was independent of the first order amplitude then the character ratios obtained by the sph fem model could be plotted in the same figure the resonance period of the waves in the thin elastic plate could also be predicted by the sph fem model and was located between 2 1 and 2 2 s the discrepancy between the resonance period and the corresponding character ratio between the sph fem results and the theoretical solution can be attributed to 1 in the sph fem a vlfs with a finite length of 60 m was used while in the theoretical model the length of the vlfs was assumed to be infinite 2 based on the perturbation approach the theoretical model could only predict the first and second order amplitude qualitatively when the incoming wave period was located around the resonance period for the cases with an incoming wave period larger than 2 2 s or smaller than 2 1 s the correlation in terms of the character ratio between the sph fem results and theoretical results was much better in addition the sph fem model confirmed the existence of a positive wave and a negative wave when the incoming wave period was larger or smaller than the resonance period which was the exact phenomenon predicted by the theoretical model 4 3 time history of the nonlinear deflection waves as a sample the time domain results of the sph fem model with incoming wave periods equal to 2 1 and 2 2 s are presented in figs 8 and 9 where both the incoming wave elevation and the corresponding wem are plotted it is interesting to note that the wave trough is sharp due to the superposition of the second order term for the wave with a period of 2 1 s while the wave crest is sharp for the wave with a period of 2 2 s this can be explained by the sign of the parameter β which is related to the second order term in eq 18 this can be also understood from fig 7 the parameter β is negative for the wave period of 2 1 s while it is positive for the wave period of 2 2 s in these figures the incoming wave time histories which were measured at a point located between the wave generator and the elastic plate are presented for comparison the positive peaks of the incoming wave are always sharp while the troughs are flattened 4 4 nonlinear structural loads regarding the structural response the vertical bending moment vbm can be determined through the second derivative of the deflection of the thin elastic plate with respect to coordinate x then the ratio between second order and first order vbm amplitude can be derived as in eq 21 21 r v b m m 2 m 1 e i 2 η 2 x 2 e i 2 η 1 x 2 4 r where r represents the ratio between the second order and first order wave amplitude given by eq 19 the vbm s second order component increased fourfold compared with the deflection of the thin elastic plate this could have a significant influence on structural strength corresponding to figs 8 and 9 figs 10 and 11 present the vbms obtained through sph fem simulation and the dominant second order vbm can be observed the second order term has an almost equivalent amplitude to the first order term in these cases 5 conclusions this work provides new insight into nonlinear waves in terms of the surficial structural stiffness and inertia on the water surface a floating thin elastic plate that deforms with a large amplitude was investigated a numerical analysis method for the fsi issue was first developed the developed method adopted sph for the fluid domain and fem for the structural domain the solutions in the two domains were weakly coupled to evaluate the fsi s behavior then the method was applied to a floating thin elastic plate subjected to small waves the results were then compared with the potential theory based method that was developed and validated by one of the present authors furthermore the method was extensively applied to severe regular wave cases and the behavior under severe sea conditions was discussed a theoretical model for the nonlinear waves in terms of surficial structural stiffness and inertia was derived in a similar way to the stokes wave theory and the results from the sph fem model were compared with those from the theoretical model the following conclusions can be stated 1 the agreement between the proposed sph fem model and the linear diffraction theory based model was quite satisfactory in terms of linear response 2 the nonlinearity of the waves in the floating thin elastic plate was different from the conventional stokes waves there was a critical period in which the second order response became unstably large the frequency was interpreted as a coupled nonlinear resonance of the thin elastic plate to the second order loads associated with the large deflection but was different from the ordinary structural resonance the resonance period can be derived according to the proposed theoretical model when the wave period gets close to the resonance period the theoretical model convergence cannot be maintained and significant higher order response can appear 3 a positive wave with a steeper crest and a flatter trough was found in the floating thin elastic plate when the incoming wave period was larger than the resonance period a negative wave with a flatter crest and a steeper trough appeared when the incoming wave period was smaller than the resonance period 4 the nonlinear waves in the floating thin elastic plate predicted by the proposed theoretical model showed a fair agreement with those predicted by the sph fem model with respect to the resonance period and the onset of positive negative waves the validity of the proposed theoretical and numerical models was demonstrated in terms of interpreting the nonlinear wave properties in the floating thin elastic plate 5 the second order term of the vbm was four times larger than that of the deflection in the thin elastic plate as the high order vbm contributes more to the structural load the nonlinear vbm should be considered during the structural design phase in real cases the second order term resonance may not appear to the same extent as predicted by the theoretical model because of the damping terms which were not accounted for in the present development the second order wave in the floating elastic plate discussed here should be confirmed by comparing it with the tank test results credit authorship contribution statement chong ma conceptualization data

stress tensor in coordinate directions i and j since the weakly compressible sph wcsph model was used in this research the particles pressure field exhibited large oscillation due to eq a7 which is the seventh order function of density while more accurate and more stable pressure could be obtained by the incompressible sph model xenakis et al 2015 solving the poisson equation for pressure is much more time consuming than for tait s equation thus to overcome the pressure noise problem the diffusive term according to the deltasph molteni and colagrossi 2009 method was used in this research according to the deltasph method an additional laplacian of the density field was added to the continuity equation eq a5 a11 d ρ d t ρ v 2 δ φ h c 0 ρ b ρ a r a b a w a b r a b 2 m b ρ b where δ φ is the diffusive coefficient appendix b fem model in this research conventional beam elements based on euler bernoulli theory were used to represent the structure deformation the stiffness matrix k of each beam element was obtained based on the assumption that the beam s transverse displacement can be represented by a cubic function for each beam element the coordinate x was taken along the beam with the left end of the beam at x 0 node 1 and the right end at x 1 node 2 the interpolating function for the lateral displacement between the two nodes eq b1 and that for the angular deformation eq

validation of the sph fem model the proposed sph fem model was validated with respect to the elastic plate s linear deflection a scaled model of a realistic vlfs design with a scale ratio of 1 100 was used a more detailed description of the model can be found in fujikubo et al 2003b and iijima and fujikubo 2018a the parameters for this scaled model are presented in table c1 the sph fem numerical

theory iijima and fujikubo 2018a the vlfs model s hydroelastic behavior under regular wave conditions was investigated the wave amplitude was set as 1 cm and a wave circular frequency of from 3 rad s to 6 rad s was selected fig c1 shows snapshots of the regular wave tests fig c1 snapshots of regular wave test fig c1 the vertical displacement distribution along the vlfs longitudinal direction is shown in fig c2 the positions x 3 and x 3 represent the weather side and the lee side of the vlfs model respectively the horizontal axis and vertical axis correspond to the displacement location and the ratio between the vertical displacement amplitude and wave amplitude respectively it is clear that the vertical displacement amplitude on both ends of the vlfs model had the largest value but it decreased dramatically when the displacement location became further from the end then the vertical displacement amplitude showed some fluctuation regarding the location the vertical displacement amplitude fluctuation decreased with the decrease in wave circular frequency similar conclusions can be also found in liu et al 2002 for both the sph fem and the panel fem models similar results can be obtained for different wave frequencies when we take a closer look the results from the sph fem model appear to be smaller towards the leeside of the structure here it is understood that the fictitious viscosity effects and the smoothing length effects that reside in the sph formulation caused this difference the wave amplitude itself decreased slightly towards the leeside of the tank this problem may be partially resolved with a finer sph mesh and a longer smoothing length guilcher et al 2007 the appropriate particle size must also be selected by considering the balance between simulation time and analysis accuracy users guide for dualsphysics code 2016 following the comparison it was concluded that the sph modeling used herein was sufficient for predicting the vlfs model s

21911,this paper highlights linear and nonlinear waves under the influence of surficial structural stiffness and inertia the main focus is on the waves in a thin elastic plate floating on the water surface a numerical simulation method combining smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the finite element method is developed to predict the waves propagating in the thin elastic plate for validation the simulation results are compared to those obtained through a numerical method based on the linear potential theory for linear regular wave cases when the incident wave amplitude was increased the waves nonlinearity was observed in the simulation results the nonlinear waves characteristics are elucidated through a mathematical solution derived in a similar manner to stokes wave theory a significant difference is confirmed through comparisons with the conventional nonlinear free surface wave the positive peak was higher than the negative peak due to nonlinearity in one frequency range while it was the opposite in the other frequency range the nonlinear wave s amplitude increased divergently at the frequency between the two frequency ranges overall it is shown that the mathematical solution effectively explains the characteristics of the nonlinear waves in the elastic plate observed in the numerical simulations keywords nonlinear wave vlfs coupling sph fem stokes expansion 1 introduction when water waves interact with a floating thin elastic plate the incident wave that passes under the floating elastic plate will likely undergo property changes due to the interaction effects this problem may be found among coupled issues such as a large floating runway a floating ice sheet a mega scale solar energy platform on the water surface etc in fact this issue has long been studied in terms of hydroelasticity in this study a nonlinear hydroelasticity issue involving a thin elastic plate interacting with the waves is addressed suzuki 2005 illustrated the behavior of a very large floating structure vlfs which may be modeled as a thin elastic plate floating on the water surface a vlfs may be used to create a floating airport floating port facility floating bridge floating fuel coal storage facility floating city etc the first vlfs was launched off of yokohama in tokyo bay and was used to demonstrate that such a structure can function as a floating airport isobe 1999 while wang et al 2008 reported a floating structure for a space creation built in singapore more recently a project involving floating bridges emerged in norway in which varying types of floating bridges were considered statens vegvese meanwhile an international ship and offshore structures congress committee report 2006 summarized the current state of the art vlfss a huge sized structure will have deflection waves interacting with the fluid surrounding it as a result of the so called hydroelasticity effects hydroelasticity effects have long been the focus of vlfs related studies among these ohmatsu 1997 formulated the hydroelastic behavior of a pontoon type vlfs by adopting a domain decomposition method subsequently extending the method to cases where the vlfs was surrounded by breakwaters elsewhere kashiwagi 1998 adopted a b spline scheme within a pressure distribution method and an eigen function expansion method to improve computation efficiency while seto et al 2005 developed an integrated code to analyze the wave induced response of a vlfs in their method the fluid structure interaction fsi problem was formulated within a frequency domain using the domain decomposition method and the finite element method fem with consideration of the sea bottom topography finally based on the boundary element method utsunomiya et al 2001 proposed a fast multipole method to improve simulation efficiency for the wave induced response of a vlfs within a complex geometry in these studies the deflection and free surface waves were assumed to be small in amplitude and the formulations were produced by considering only linear terms these assumptions were both convenient and advantageous for understanding the overall behavior of a vlfs within the linearity context in terms of reducing the calculation cost by solving the equations in the frequency domain while maintaining accuracy meanwhile the nonlinear behavior of a floating thin elastic plate is also a concern a vlfs in extreme sea states must be clarified from a risk analysis viewpoint which will ensure the linear assumptions provide significant constraints for understanding the floating elastic plate s behavior in extreme waves a weakly nonlinear hydroelastic analysis for vlfs was proposed by belibassakis and athanassoulis 2006 their research focused on the variable bathymetry regions nonlinear influence more recently vanden broeck and parau 2011 reported a theoretical approach for nonlinear hydroelastic waves under ice sheets in their model the ice sheet was regarded as an elastic flexible plate without considering the inertia influence elsewhere suzuki 2001 discussed the risk aspect of vlfss and the target safety level a vlfs must be designed with a sufficiently high safety factor under appropriate design loads or sea states the appropriate safety factor level can be calibrated based on the risk analysis results the vlfs designers may have to prove that the structural damage is minor or limited under severe sea loads with the return period well over the design life to this end a nonlinear analysis that can follow the structure s behavior in severe conditions is necessary such attempts were made by fujikubo et al 2003a 2003b who adopted special nonlinear finite elements known as isum elements to investigate the collapse behavior of a pontoon type vlfs the vlfs was modeled as a flat plate strengthened by several stiffeners here the vlfs s buckling and yielding were investigated while the hydrodynamic interactions were ignored elsewhere liu and sakai 1997 and liu et al 2002 investigated the propagation characteristics of nonlinear waves on a vlfs based on the nonlinear potential theory while chen et al 2003 developed a hydroelasticity theory while taking the plate s large deflection into account here the linear potential theory was adopted and coupled one of the present authors iijima has previously focused on investigating the vlfs s nonlinear collapse behavior under severe wave loads where not only the elastic structural response but also the plastic structural response and post ultimate structural response were addressed in iijima and fujikubo 2018a an analysis model was developed to predict a vlfs s collapse behavior with the whole structure segmented into two beams connected via a nonlinear rotational spring representing the deformations in elastic and plastic ranges the results of the vlfs s collapse behavior were validated through the tank test results we also recently introduced an elasto plastic beam approach to follow a more realistic collapse behavior iijima et al 2018 while an analytical solution was developed to clarify the vlfs s collapse behavioral characteristics iijima and fujikubo 2018b however the wave model adopted in these studies was limited to the linear version nonlinear wave modeling associated with the large amplitude of motion and deformation must be implemented within the analysis code for more accurate predictions of a vlfs s behavior when subjected to severe sea states computational fluid dynamics cfd has recently been developed and has become prevalent in addressing various oceanic problems by directly solving the navier stokes equation the nonlinear influence which is omitted in potential theories such as nonlinear free surface green water seabed topography and vortex formation theories can be taken into account the eulerian grid based model is used widely to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure on vessels and offshore structures a numerical model based on a two way coupling methodology involving star ccm and ls dyna was proposed to analyze the hydroelastic behavior in relation to ships takami et al 2018 however compared with that involving ship structures vlfs related research based on the eulerian grid based model is limited lee et al 2003 used the composite grid method to clarify the influence of an anti motion device on a vlfs s motion the grid based model usually involves a distortion issue and a huge amount of computational work is needed to renew the mesh in the free surface or the fsi surface in view of this the particle method has undergone rapid development in recent decades as an alternative fluid model where given that it is a lagrangian meshless method the distortion problem is no longer an issue as such the particle method may be more appropriate for nonlinear hydroelastic analysis hermange et al 2016 validated their smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph fem coupling model using an elastic gate test while ma et al 2017 proposed and validated an alternative coupling model involving sph and nonlinear fem for a beam impact test this paper discusses the nonlinear deflection behavior of a thin elastic plate with large amplitude a numerical simulation method combining sph and fem is developed and applied to this problem the whole structure is discretized into beam elements the predictions obtained through the developed method are compared to those obtained via the linear potential theory based method proposed by one of the present authors see appendix c in iijima and fujikubo 2018a the linear potential theory result was validated using the model test results in terms of elastic and plastic deflection one advantage of the developed sph fem model is that it can account for nonlinear fluid dynamics second order waves are observed in the simulation results both on the free surface and the thin elastic plate for waves with large amplitudes the nonlinear waves characteristics in terms of surficial structural stiffness and inertia are elucidated via a mathematical solution derived in a similar manner with stokes waves it is shown that the mathematical solution effectively explains the nonlinear waves in the thin elastic plate observed in the numerical simulations 2 the coupled sph fem model in this study a coupled sph fem model was developed to provide insight into the hydroelastic behavior of the thin elastic plate on the water surface for illustration the two dimensional numerical water tank established in the sph fem model for the following discussion is shown in fig 1 along with the definition of the coordinate system used in the simulation the fluid model based on sph is summarized in appendix a the fem based structure model can be found in appendix b in this research we considered one dimensional beam floating on the surface in vertical x z plane so that the axial stiffness and torsional stiffness were ignored the hydrodynamic model based on sph was weakly coupled with the beam element model in a time domain based on the partitioned coupling scheme the free surface of sph fluid model was governed by the deformation of floating structure based on the assumption that the fluid particle cannot pernitrate the solid boundary the structural deformation could be obtained by the hydrodynamic force solved by sph model the force and displacement velocity were transferred in the physical contact interface between the fluid and the structure for each iteration the whole structure was discretized to many floating rigid hulls consisting of multiple boundary particles fig 2 by integrating all the fluid force on the boundary particles solved via sph the external fluid force acting on each hull could be obtained all hulls were connected to the neighboring node of the beam element the flowchart of the sph fem coupling is presented in fig 3 the hydrodynamic force f sph on the center of the hull node could be calculated by integrating all the forces acting on the boundary particles in the sph model meanwhile the force due to the structural stiffness f beam on the nodes could be obtained in terms of beam element stiffness k see appendix b according to equation f b e a m k x x represents the displacement of the centers of the floating hulls in this research as the two dimensional issue was investigated x consists of lateral displacement and angular deformation the unbalanced force f sph f beam was used to calculate the acceleration velocity and displacement of the hulls finally the dynamic one dimensional beam equation based on conventional euler bernoulli beam theory eq 1 could be discretized as the equation of motion for floating hulls as shown in eq 2 1 m 2 w t 2 e i 4 w x 4 q 2 m x f s p h f b e a m where m w e i q are the mass per unit length beam deflection bending stiffness and external load m is the mass matrix it should be noted that in eq 2 the structural damping could also be taken into account however to simplify the problem the structural damping influence is neglected in the following discussion once the information on the hulls was updated the new locations of the boundary particles on the hulls could be obtained accordingly finally the updated information on the hulls and particles was used to calculate the next time step or the corrector phase as shown in fig 3 to obtain better numerical stability the explicit second order predictor corrector scheme was used in this research monaghan 2005 3 analytical solution for nonlinear waves in a floating elastic plate the nonlinear wave influence should be considered since most structure failure occurs when the wave height becomes severe many research studies e g tsubogo and okada 1997 tsubogo 1998 have developed the linear theoretical models for waves interacting the vlfs while neglecting the nonlinear components under kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions to the best of our knowledge there is no theoretical model for interpreting nonlinear waves in a thin elastic plate with finite wave motion amplitude assuming the structure is infinitely long the second order two dimensional wave concerning surficial structural stiffness and inertia was mathematically investigated based on the taylor series expansion and the perturbation series approach the resonance period for the second order wave related to surficial structural stiffness and inertia was derived according to the proposed nonlinear theoretical model unlike with the conventional stokes wave theory newman 1972 and stokes 1849 while the existence of symmetric waves one with a steeper peak and another with a steeper trough was also proven 3 1 equations for kinematic condition and dynamic condition under the influence of surficial structural stiffness and inertia a two dimensional thin elastic plate or pontoon type vlfs with infinite length was adopted here fig 4 to provide surficial structural stiffness and inertia the whole vlfs was modeled as a uniform beam with negligibly small draft which was floating on the water surface in a vertical two dimensional plane the x axis was taken along the vlfs while the z axis was taken as positive upward the coordinate system origin was located at the still water surface level based on the assumption of incompressible and irrotational flow laplace s equation 2 ϕ 0 should still be satisfied ϕ denotes the potential function the void cavity between the structure and the water and the water penetration across the structure were not considered denoting the vlfs deflection in the z direction as w x t regardless of the horizontal displacement of the vlfs the body boundary condition could be defined by assigning the vlfs deflection velocity as the same as that of the water wave elevation then the kinematic boundary condition on the free surface z η x t where η is wave elevation could be derived as in eq 3 3 d w d η ϕ z on z η x t the dynamic condition can be modified as 4 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ ϕ m ρ 2 η t 2 e i ρ 4 η x 4 g η 0 on z η x t where m is the mass of the vlfs per unit length and e i is the structural bending stiffness operator d represents the substantial derivative 3 2

neglected both j 1 and j 2 reduce to g and γ equals 1 then equations 17 and 18 are equivalent to the conventional stokes wave solutions stokes 1849 meanwhile eq 18 can be simplified to eq 17 when the

for infinite water depth when δ 1 according to eq 19 it can be found that except for δ 1 which is the same as with the stokes wave theory another divergence condition exists when considering the influences of structural stiffness and inertia which can be defined as δ 2 γ 1 this means that even for deep water conditions the waves in the thin elastic plate may have a large nonlinear component that cannot be explained through the conventional stokes wave theory this nonlinearity can be significant even though a k 1 and δ 1 the resonance period can be solved according to eq 20 in which a significant nonlinear wave should be observed 20 δ 2 γ 1 o r 3 c o t h 2 k 1 h 1 ω 1 2 m 1 15 c o t h 2 k 1 h k 1 4 e i ρ g 0 equations 17 19 were derived based on the assumption that the second order wave component was much smaller than the first order wave component therefore when the incoming wave period is close to the resonance period the proposed theoretical model can only qualitatively predict the first and second order waves in the thin elastic plate on the other hand the fully nonlinear sph fem model can quantitatively predict the first and second order waves in the thin elastic plate when the incoming wave period is located around the resonance period 4 results and discussion the validation work for the proposed sph fem model was first carried out in terms of the linear defection which involved comparing this with the results obtained by another numerical tool iijima and fujikubo 2018a the validation results can be found in appendix b 4 1 two dimensional stokes wave by sph before numerically investigating the second order waves in a thin elastic plate the nonlinear wave generated by the sph model was first validated in terms of the conventional stokes wave theory the thin elastic plate is not considered here the numerical water tank shown in fig 1 without the vlfs model was used to generate the nonlinear wave while the piston type wavemaker with sinusoidal horizontal movement was adopted the generated wave period was 2 s and the first order wave amplitude was 0 05 m which is located exactly in the regime of the second order stokes wave theory fig 5 shows the wave elevation comparison between the sph simulation results and the stokes wave theory it is demonstrated that the second order stokes wave can be predicted effectively by the sph model 4 2 ratio between the first and second order components of nonlinear deflection waves in the theoretical discussion about the nonlinear waves in a floating thin elastic plate the initial hypothesis is the model has an infinite length then the wave that propagates along the plate excluding the effects from the ends is focused on in order to derive a theoretical solution for the second order waves in the elastic plate this may be justifiable since the disturbances from both ends are eliminated when the wave progresses far enough from the ends suzuki 2005 corresponding to the above assumption the vlfs model used appendix b was increased in length by 10 times the original size so that the finite length influence could be eliminated especially for the midship parts meanwhile to exclude the shallow water s influence the numerical tank depth was increased from 0 45 to 0 8 m the same structure stiffness and density were adopted the main parameters of the vlfs model used in this section are summarized in table 1 based on the stokes wave theory and the proposed theoretical wave model with the influence of structural stiffness and inertia eq 19 the ratio between the second order and first order wave amplitude see fig 6 was calculated for a constant water depth of 0 8 m the horizontal axis represents the regular incoming wave period the ratio between the second order and the first order wave amplitude depends on the latter and here the first order wave amplitude was assumed to be 10 cm according to eq 20 the resonance period for waves in the thin elastic plate is 2 07 s for wave periods located around the 2 07 s mark the second order wave amplitude is much larger than the prediction results based on the conventional stokes wave theory it is clear that when the wave period is larger than the resonance period the ratio is positive thus considering the second order wave influence the crests and troughs of the waves on the thin elastic plate become steeper and flatter respectively positive wave in this paper this phenomenon is similar to that found in the conventional stokes wave theory however when the wave period is smaller than the resonance period a negative ratio occurs and the waves in the thin elastic plate have a flatter crest and steeper trough negative wave in this paper which is impossible according to the conventional stokes wave theory corresponding numerical simulations based on sph fem were carried out with regular incoming wave periods of between 1 7 and 2 7 s in accordance with madsen s equation madsen 1971 the wave maker was controlled to generate the regular incoming wave with a wave amplitude of 10 cm the deflection wave elevation or vlfs vertical displacement in the mid span of the vlfs wem obtained from the sph fem model was checked due to the influence of the vlfs s structural stiffness and inertia the first order wem amplitudes can be much smaller than the incoming wave amplitude of 10 cm the first and second order wem amplitudes was obtained based on the fourier transformation of the 100 s simulation results from the sph fem model for example regarding the cases with incoming wave periods of 2 1 and 2 2 s the first order amplitude of wem was 0 016 and 0 026 m respectively while the second order amplitudes of wem was 0 025 and 0 027 m respectively based on the first and second order wem amplitudes the ratio between the second order and the first order amplitudes could be identified the same results presented in fig 6 are replotted in fig 7 but with a different vertical axis the new vertical axis corresponds to the ratio between the second order amplitude and half of the square of the first order amplitude character ratio such that the new vertical axis was independent of the first order amplitude then the character ratios obtained by the sph fem model could be plotted in the same figure the resonance period of the waves in the thin elastic plate could also be predicted by the sph fem model and was located between 2 1 and 2 2 s the discrepancy between the resonance period and the corresponding character ratio between the sph fem results and the theoretical solution can be attributed to 1 in the sph fem a vlfs with a finite length of 60 m was used while in the theoretical model the length of the vlfs was assumed to be infinite 2 based on the perturbation approach the theoretical model could only predict the first and second order amplitude qualitatively when the incoming wave period was located around the resonance period for the cases with an incoming wave period larger than 2 2 s or smaller than 2 1 s the correlation in terms of the character ratio between the sph fem results and theoretical results was much better in addition the sph fem model confirmed the existence of a positive wave and a negative wave when the incoming wave period was larger or smaller than the resonance period which was the exact phenomenon predicted by the theoretical model 4 3 time history of the nonlinear deflection waves as a sample the time domain results of the sph fem model with incoming wave periods equal to 2 1 and 2 2 s are presented in figs 8 and 9 where both the incoming wave elevation and the corresponding wem are plotted it is interesting to note that the wave trough is sharp due to the superposition of the second order term for the wave with a period of 2 1 s while the wave crest is sharp for the wave with a period of 2 2 s this can be explained by the sign of the parameter β which is related to the second order term in eq 18 this can be also understood from fig 7 the parameter β is negative for the wave period of 2 1 s while it is positive for the wave period of 2 2 s in these figures the incoming wave time histories which were measured at a point located between the wave generator and the elastic plate are presented for comparison the positive peaks of the incoming wave are always sharp while the troughs are flattened 4 4 nonlinear structural loads regarding the structural response the vertical bending moment vbm can be determined through the second derivative of the deflection of the thin elastic plate with respect to coordinate x then the ratio between second order and first order vbm amplitude can be derived as in eq 21 21 r v b m m 2 m 1 e i 2 η 2 x 2 e i 2 η 1 x 2 4 r where r represents the ratio between the second order and first order wave amplitude given by eq 19 the vbm s second order component increased fourfold compared with the deflection of the thin elastic plate this could have a significant influence on structural strength corresponding to figs 8 and 9 figs 10 and 11 present the vbms obtained through sph fem simulation and the dominant second order vbm can be observed the second order term has an almost equivalent amplitude to the first order term in these cases 5 conclusions this work provides new insight into nonlinear waves in terms of the surficial structural stiffness and inertia on the water surface a floating thin elastic plate that deforms with a large amplitude was investigated a numerical analysis method for the fsi issue was first developed the developed method adopted sph for the fluid domain and fem for the structural domain the solutions in the two domains were weakly coupled to evaluate the fsi s behavior then the method was applied to a floating thin elastic plate subjected to small waves the results were then compared with the potential theory based method that was developed and validated by one of the present authors furthermore the method was extensively applied to severe regular wave cases and the behavior under severe sea conditions was discussed a theoretical model for the nonlinear waves in terms of surficial structural stiffness and inertia was derived in a similar way to the stokes wave theory and the results from the sph fem model were compared with those from the theoretical model the following conclusions can be stated 1 the agreement between the proposed sph fem model and the linear diffraction theory based model was quite satisfactory in terms of linear response 2 the nonlinearity of the waves in the floating thin elastic plate was different from the conventional stokes waves there was a critical period in which the second order response became unstably large the frequency was interpreted as a coupled nonlinear resonance of the thin elastic plate to the second order loads associated with the large deflection but was different from the ordinary structural resonance the resonance period can be derived according to the proposed theoretical model when the wave period gets close to the resonance period the theoretical model convergence cannot be maintained and significant higher order response can appear 3 a positive wave with a steeper crest and a flatter trough was found in the floating thin elastic plate when the incoming wave period was larger than the resonance period a negative wave with a flatter crest and a steeper trough appeared when the incoming wave period was smaller than the resonance period 4 the nonlinear waves in the floating thin elastic plate predicted by the proposed theoretical model showed a fair agreement with those predicted by the sph fem model with respect to the resonance period and the onset of positive negative waves the validity of the proposed theoretical and numerical models was demonstrated in terms of interpreting the nonlinear wave properties in the floating thin elastic plate 5 the second order term of the vbm was four times larger than that of the deflection in the thin elastic plate as the high order vbm contributes more to the structural load the nonlinear vbm should be considered during the structural design phase in real cases the second order term resonance may not appear to the same extent as predicted by the theoretical model because of the damping terms which were not accounted for in the present development the second order wave in the floating elastic plate discussed here should be confirmed by comparing it with the tank test results credit authorship contribution statement chong ma conceptualization data

the seventh order function of density while more accurate and more stable pressure could be obtained by the incompressible sph model xenakis et al 2015 solving the poisson equation for pressure is much more time consuming than for tait s equation thus to overcome the pressure noise problem the diffusive term according to the deltasph molteni and colagrossi 2009 method was used in this research

the diffusive coefficient appendix b fem model in this research conventional beam elements based on euler bernoulli theory were used to represent the structure deformation the stiffness matrix k of each beam element was obtained based on the assumption that the beam s transverse displacement can be represented by a cubic function for each beam element the coordinate x was taken along the beam

validation of the sph fem model the proposed sph fem model was validated with respect to the elastic plate s linear deflection a scaled model of a realistic vlfs design with a scale ratio of 1 100 was used a more detailed description of the model can be found in fujikubo et al 2003b and iijima and fujikubo 2018a the parameters for this scaled model are presented in table c1 the sph fem numerical

theory iijima and fujikubo 2018a the vlfs model s hydroelastic behavior under regular wave conditions was investigated the wave amplitude was set as 1 cm and a wave circular frequency of from 3 rad s to 6 rad s was selected fig c1 shows snapshots of the regular wave tests fig c1 snapshots of regular wave test fig c1 the vertical displacement distribution along the vlfs longitudinal direction is shown in fig c2 the positions x 3 and x 3 represent the weather side and the lee side of the vlfs model respectively the horizontal axis and vertical axis correspond to the displacement location and the ratio between the vertical displacement amplitude and wave amplitude respectively it is clear that the vertical displacement amplitude on both ends of the vlfs model had the largest value but it decreased dramatically when the displacement location became further from the end then the vertical displacement amplitude showed some fluctuation regarding the location the vertical displacement amplitude fluctuation decreased with the decrease in wave circular frequency similar conclusions can be also found in liu et al 2002 for both the sph fem and the panel fem models similar results can be obtained for different wave frequencies when we take a closer look the results from the sph fem model appear to be smaller towards the leeside of the structure here it is understood that the fictitious viscosity effects and the smoothing length effects that reside in the sph formulation caused this difference the wave amplitude itself decreased slightly towards the leeside of the tank this problem may be partially resolved with a finer sph mesh and a longer smoothing length guilcher et al 2007 the appropriate particle size must also be selected by considering the balance between simulation time and analysis accuracy users guide for dualsphysics code 2016 following the comparison it was concluded that the sph modeling used herein was sufficient for predicting the vlfs model s

21912,typical industry models for offshore wind turbines with fixed substructures are based on decoupled models between the wind turbine and the substructure it is proved that the complete dynamic response of the structure can only be captured with coupled models in this paper a fully coupled model for offshore wind turbines with jacket support is presented the computational model allows to obtain an accurate response of the whole structure and the dynamic interaction between all the elements it also allows to reproduce particular effects such as the aerodynamic damping without the need for artificial damping ratios which would be needed in decoupled models typical environmental offshore conditions are integrated in the model and the response of the structure is obtained by means of a non linear time integration algorithm in order to include the effect of the continuous rotation of the blades a cost efficient approach for the determination of fatigue damage in the joints of the jackets is proposed it is based on short time simulations which allow to accurately estimate the long term damage in general the estimation shows a good agreement when compared to the damage values obtained by performing the whole time interval simulation keywords dynamic analysis fixed substructures coupled models fatigue estimation 1 introduction structural analysis of offshore wind turbines owts and their substructures is one of the major challenges in offshore engineering it is subjected to uncertainties related to loads environmental conditions and fatigue damage assessment and there is not an agreement on how the structural model must be built the problem is inherently dynamic and the analysis must capture the full interaction among all the elements of the owt relatively long time intervals of the structural behavior need to be analyzed in order to capture the full dynamic response of the structure and the development of long period cycles of strains and stresses dnv os j101 2010 additionally the accurate representation of the offshore environmental conditions requires the consideration of a great number of different load cases checking the feasibility of the designs and being able to estimate the fatigue damage during the whole design life is an extremely demanding task y terms of computational resources evaluating the dynamic interaction between elements is only accomplished by building coupled models where all the parts that form the owt substructure tower rotor nacelle assembly and blades are taken into account however this is not always possible since it involves larger computational effort traditionally wind turbine design and substructure design are performed by different engineers and analyzed individually seidel 2010 for this reason decoupled models where the aerodynamic calculations and effects are separated from the rest of the structure are usually preferred ashish and selvam 2013 ong et al 2014 abhinav and saha 2015 lai et al 2016 wei et al 2017 hence the masses of the blades hub and nacelle are lumped at the top of the tower and the global resultant forces and moments are considered at the same location a comparison of the structural responses between coupled and decoupled models can be found in hasselbach et al 2013 several discrepancies in movements stresses and fatigue damage can be observed one of the major drawbacks of decoupled models is the consideration of the aerodynamic damping ad kuhn 2001 hansen 2015 in schafhirt and muskulus 2018 the authors compare different methods to account for aerodynamic damping in decoupled simulations calibrating them with coupled integrated analysis the trend is significantly different for floating wind turbines fwt where the coupled response is essential in ren et al 2015 authors propose a numerical model to capture the full dynamic response under wind and waves of a spar torus combination system for a fwt the work also addresses the long term fatigue damage estimation of the mooring line in ma et al 2019 a coupled model is also presented for a different type of fwt a numerical analysis of a serbuoys tlp platform is presented and the results are compared against experimental data dynamic analysis was traditionally used for offshore petroleum structures in the nineties williams et al 1998 and generally adopted by most approaches for owt elshafey et al 2009 raheem 2013 vorpahl et al 2013 ren et al 2014 passon and branner 2014 nevertheless substantial effort is devoted in an attempt to develop alternative static analysis techniques that allow to approximate the response of the structure either by quasi static analysis equivalent static loads esl or dynamic amplification factors daf wei et al 2014 gong and chen 2015 chen et al 2016 there is also a parallel trend to solve the structure in the frequency domain harte et al 2012 myers et al 2015 wang et al 2017 a comparison between time domain analysis and spectral analysis can be found in mohammadi et al 2016 concluding that the response at specific hot spots is highly overestimated when using spectral methods and the time domain analysis is always preferable typical time history analyses for the assessment of fatigue in offshore steel structures are extremely resource demanding it must be simplified in order to increase the computational efficiency one aforementioned approach is the analysis in the frequency domain yeter et al 2015 huang 2017 while others seek to lighten the computing resources needed by the time history analysis by reducing the number of load cases by lumping them into those that contribute more to fatigue kvittem and moan 2015 zwick and muskulus 2015 or by using approximated approaches as damage equivalent loads del stieng et al 2015 an interesting approach can be found in dong et al 2011 where authors fit statistical distributions of the hot spot stresses for jacket type substructures under wind and wave conditions what allows to quantify their contribution to the fatigue damage in this paper a fully coupled model for offshore wind turbines and the structural analysis of jacket type foundations considering the rotation of the blades is presented the analysis is solved in the time domain a non linear integration method is used to account for the geometrical variations of the structure due to rotation additionally a simplified and efficient method is proposed for the evaluation of the fatigue damage produced at the hot spots during the whole design life of the structure 2 structural model and loading conditions 2 1 structural properties and dynamics the coupled owt model must integrate all the individual sub structures and their mutual interactions in this paper beam elements are used to model every single part of the structure however the turbine tower might be more accurately modeled using shell elements additionally the nacelle is obviously not a beam nevertheless the use of more complex models for particular elements of the owt would improve the quality of the response data only for those specific elements and not the global dynamic behavior of the structure and the dynamic interaction between elements in the proposed model depicted in fig 1 each structural element is then determined by its mass through a consistent mass matrix m cheng 2001 by its stiffness through its stiffness matrix k and by a rayleigh damping matrix c using a 2 damping ratio iso19902 2007 2013 the jacket substructure used in the numerical examples is modeled using 124 elements the aerodynamic part of the structure used in this paper is defined in jonkman et al 2009 both tower and blades are discretized in multiple elements with different geometrical and aerodynamic properties although the shape of the blade varies continuously from the rotor to the tip the used discretized elements have constant averaged properties in their length the weight 17 74 t of each blade is uniformly distributed along the span 9 different elements are used for the tower and 50 for each blade the nacelle is also modeled by means of beam elements the properties of each section are defined to match the mass and stiffness of the real nacelle the hub is substituted by a 56 78 t point mass the three dimensional framed structure of the jacket is taken from vemula et al 2010 it is a 65 65 meters high steel structure designed for a water depth of 50 m each element is defined by its mechanical properties flooded legs marine growth and hydrodynamic added mass are considered in the model the transition piece is a concrete block of 666 t in top of the jacket this part is modeled by means of beam elements matching the properties of the actual piece 2 2 environmental loads modeling in addition to the self weight of all structural members and buoyancy of the submerged bars of the jacket wind and wave loads are considered in the model waves act on the elements under the mean sea level and the wave surface wind is considered acting on the tower and blades and its effect over the non submerged part of the jacket is neglected since its influence on the structural and dynamic response of the structure is negligible in comparison with the combined effect of waves and wind on the tower and the blades wind forces on the blades are usually computed with the blade element momentum method bem as it was mentioned before most formulations rely on decoupled models where these forces are computed with separated aero servo elastic models in this paper forces are calculated and applied at each point of the discretized blade using its particular aerodynamic properties and wind speed at that specific location a deep explanation for the bem method can be found in burton et al 2001 hau 2006 and hansen 2015 but some details are given here for better a understanding the wind velocity at the actuator disk u d and its relation to the upstream velocity u can be computed using betz s momentum theory as seen in fig 2 these velocities can thus be expressed as 1 u d u 1 2 a where a is the so called axial induction factor that relates the upstream velocity and the velocity at the disk the pressure on the blades makes them rotate due to their aerodynamic design converting the loss of axial momentum into the torque exerted on the rotor disk an equal and opposite torque is then imposed on the air generating a rotating motion that is opposite to that of the blades this change in the tangential velocity is also expressed by means of a tangential induction factor a the tangential velocity experienced by the blade element is then 2 ω ω r 1 a where r is the radial distance to the blade element and ω the rotor angular speed the aerodynamics of the blade element are depicted in fig 3 where u d denotes the velocity of the wind at the airfoil and r is the resultant of the flow direction on the airfoil d and l are the drag and lift forces respectively f τ and f n are the projected forces on the tangential and normal axes considering the axes of the turbine α is the angle of attack and β is the pitch angle given that the induction factors are not known we have to assume initial values and calculate the drag and lift forces according to an iterative process as 1 initialize a 0 and a 0 2 using the pitch angle β and the inflow angle γ calculate the angle of attack α γ β 3 select the drag and lift coefficients c d c l for the computed angle of attack and the particular airfoil section 4 project coefficients in normal and tangential directions 3 c n c d sin γ c l cos γ c τ c d cos γ c l sin γ 5 update induction factors hansen 2015 4 a 1 4 sin 2 γ f σ c n 1 a 1 4 sin γ cos γ f σ c τ 1 6 repeat from step 2 until convergence expressions of 4 account for effects like the prandtl s blade tip loss and a discrete number of blades through the tip loss factor f and the chord solidity σ burton et al 2001 the above process allows to compute the tangential and normal force at each point of the blades however in up wind mounted rotors a phenomenon called tower dam appears the effect is a reduction of wind speed acting on the blade whenever it passes close to the tower of the owt dolan and lehn 2006 5 u d u d 1 d t 2 π d x d x 2 d y 2 where d t is the diameter of the tower and d x and d y are the distances between the passing blade and the tower in global axes as depicted in fig 7 the output torque and thrust using the described methodology can be compared with that of jonkman et al 2009 results are plotted in fig 4 the impact of the tower dam effect on the total torque is shown in fig 5 on the other hand forces due to waves on the jacket members are computed using morison s formula morison et al 1950 for submerged slender cylinders considering the kinematic properties of the waves given by the selected wave theory airy 2nd order stokes 5th order stokes chakrabarti 2005 it is worth mentioning that morison s formula is accepted for flow perpendicular to the cylinder 6 f n x t π 4 ρ c m d 2 s x t 1 2 ρ c d d s x t s x t where f n is the perpendicular force experienced by the cylinder per unit of length ρ is the water density c m and c d are the inertia and drag coefficients d is the diameter of the element and s x t and s x t are the velocity and acceleration of the particles of the waves in the normal direction to the element since elements of the jacket are not normal to the waves direction of propagation accelerations and velocities of the particles of the waves need to be projected on the local axes of each element in order to get the two normal components with respect to the inclined submerged member forces due to the sea current are not accounted for but can be included in the model by modifying the particle velocities it should be noted that in order to add the sea current velocity to the particle velocities only the component inline with the waves is used it also alters the apparent wave period a full description on how to include sea current in the calculations can be found in chakrabarti 2005 since the model is based on beam elements the process of computing the wave forces at each element fig 6 is as follows 1 discretize the element in n sub elements 2 compute velocities and accelerations from waves at those discretized points in global axes x y z 3 project those velocities and accelerations on the local axes of the elements x y z 4 use morison s formula to compute the normal forces on the element in the local y and z axes f y x t and f z x t 5 integrate forces along the length of the element to obtain the resultant forces f y and f z 6 calculate the point of application of the resultant force that will be later needed for the equivalent nodal forces and moments of the beam model 7 project the forces to the global axes to obtain f x x y z t f y x y z t and f z x y z t most models separate the computation of wind loads and wave loads commonly they are computed by using different codes and in decoupled models in this paper all the computations are merged in one unique model and code allowing for a complete control over all the parameters of the environment or the structure and obtaining a direct response due to a variation of any characteristic this allows for a direct consideration of the aerodynamic damping as explained in the following section 3 non linear time history analysis 3 1 reference frame and integration scheme as in any fe formulation the model is defined under a global reference frame x y z whereas every element of the structure is also particularly described in a local frame x y z different for each element however the fully coupled model developed and the rotation of the blades needs a special definition of the local reference frame in order to maintain the principal axes of the non axisymmetric sections of the blades local axes y and z are defined from the axis of rotation of the turbine in this case global x axis e z e x e x e y e z e x this guarantees that the z axis is always in the y z plane and the orientation of the principal axis of the sections is preserved since the structure is subjected to large rotations matrices m c and k change between time steps and the integration of the dynamic equation m u c u k u f needs to be performed by a non linear algorithm in this case displacements of the structure are solved by means of the non linear newmark time integration scheme given the original newmark scheme newmark 1959 7 m u k 1 c u k 1 k u k 1 f k 1 where 8 u k 1 u k δ t u k δ t 2 2 1 2 β u k 2 β u k 1 u k 1 u k δ t 1 γ u

δ u δ u u k 1 u k 1 δ u u k 1 u k 1 δ u and the residual 10 r f k 1 m u k 1 c u k 1 k u k 1 then newton iterations are performed on the residual considering a linearized increment δ r such that r δ r

thus 13 δ r δ t 2 β k δ t γ c m k δ u then solving for r δ r 0 the following equation has to be solved iteratively 14 r k δ u fig 8 shows schematically the structural analysis of the coupled owt note that at every time step the structural matrices need to be recalculated and thereby the whole dynamic system needs to be re assembled also since the displacements vector u involves different units of measure movements and rotations that can differ in their order of magnitude typical convergence criterion may fall as they may indicate convergence because displacements dominate the norm while rotations might still be far from the right result in this case the convergence criteria proposed in chopra 1995 and shown in the following is used 15 δ r k 1 t δ u k 1 r k 1 t δ u k ε 3 2 rotation effects and aerodynamic damping rotation of the blades carries several physical implications that have an impact in the way the structure and its response are accurately modeled the most important effects would be the gyroscopic and centrifugal stiffening effect hamdi et al 2014 centrifugal stiffening is a nonlinear effect that takes into account that the centrifugal forces acting on a rotating deformed element have a restoring effect and thus stiffen the structure the additional stiffness can be modeled as a geometric stiffness matrix using the centrifugal force over the elements which depends on the mass rotational speed and distance to the center of rotation nevertheless both the gyroscopic effect and the centrifugal stiffening depend directly on the speed of rotation of the elements thus their influence is more acute in high speed applications and rotating machinery than in wind turbines in fact according to burton et al 2001 changes in the first natural frequency of a single blade do not exceed 0 5 for this reason both effects are neglected in this work fig 9 shows how the information on displacements of the blades has to be considered between time steps based on the presented integration scheme the method uses the information of displacements velocities and accelerations at step k to obtain those at step k 1 since the solution of the dynamic equation is performed in the global reference frame displacements obtained at step k do not represent the deformed shape of the blade at step k 1 the deformed shape rotates along with the blade and thus displacement velocity and acceleration vectors have to be rotated to be referred again to the global reference frame as 16 u y k u y k cos θ k u z k sin θ k u z k u y k sin θ k u z k cos θ k where as seen in fig 9 u y k and u z k are the displacements of the blade at step k referred to global axes and u y k and u z k are the displacements obtained at step k referred to global axes with the blade at the rotated position at step k 1 those displacements are the initial condition for the solution of the dynamic equation at step k 1 one major advantage of fully coupled models is the direct consideration of the aerodynamic damping aerodynamic damping schematically explained in fig 10 is a source of damping generated by the movement of the turbine the wind acting on the blades generates a thrust force t that produces displacements u with a certain speed u and acceleration ü of those movements thus the apparent speed in the wind direction experienced by the airfoil is reduced or increased by the deformation speed u therefore the modified apparent speed derives in a change in the angle of attack of the airfoil α that change derives in a change in the thrust force that always works against the movement of the blade consequently the real thrust force experienced by the rotor is smaller than that considered initially similarly when the blades undergo the opposite movement the displacement speed adds to the velocity of the wind increasing the apparent speed suffered increasing the angle of attack drag and lift forces and finally the thrust force in both cases the exerted thrust is modified by an increment or decrement of the thrust force δ t that works against the motion of the blades producing a reduction of the displacements that effect is called aerodynamic damping classical decoupled models introduce this phenomenon with a damping ratio coefficient ξ a e r o a better way to fully consider the aerodynamic damping and its impact on every section of the structure is by constructing a coupled model in this paper the wind speed experienced by the airfoil is modified according to the velocity of the displacements and thus the aerodynamic damping is automatically considered thus at each newton iteration of the nonlinear newmark integration scheme the apparent velocity of the wind u a p is recalculated with the displacement velocity of the previous iteration integrated coupled simulations allow to accurately obtain the response of the structure while considering the full effect of the aerodynamic damping in schafhirt and muskulus 2018 authors present formulas to calculate the aerodynamic damping ratio needed for decoupled simulations however it seems impossible to match every single environmental situation and the dynamic interaction produced in every possible case capturing accurately the dynamic interaction between the owt elements and the actual dynamic response is of major importance the aerodynamic damping affects directly the amplitude of the displacements suffered by the structure and those cyclic deformations have a severe impact on the fatigue damage produced on the support structures of the wind turbines 4 long term fatigue damage assessment most designs of offshore steel structures are fatigue driven therefore the fatigue damage experienced specially at the welds of the joints of the frame structures must be carefully addressed the most extended and recommended method to calculate fatigue damage in support structures of owt is based on the s n curves or wöhler curves dnv rp c203 2011 basically the curves provide the fatigue limits for a given type of structure and environment based on experimental data the limit is given as the maximum number of cycles n that the steel joint can bear until failure at a certain stress level s in this work the s n approach is used and the cycles and stress ranges are obtained from the time record of stresses using the rainflow counting algorithm endo et al 1974 astm e1049 85 2011 e1 2011 the nominal stresses obtained through the time integration and the fe formulation are scaled using stress concentration factors scf to account for the excessive accumulation of stresses at the joints dnv rp c203 2011 thus the fatigue damage of load case l is computed as 17 d j l 1 a i 1 k n i j t j t r k m δ σ i j m where n i j and δ σ i j are the number of cycles and amplitude of stresses for the hot spot j t j is the thickness of the element and t r a reference thickness a k and m are parameters of the s n curves dnv rp c203 2011 k is the number of stress blocks considered representative of the stresses time record the parameter k should be carefully selected so that the stress range blocks do not miss any important cycle that produces a significant fatigue damage for a given number of load cases considered in the structure l c the total fatigue damage is computed as 18 d j t l 1 l c p l 1 a i 1 k n i j t j t r k m δ σ i j m where p l is the probability of occurrence of load case l it is also important to give special care to the resolution of the stress record given by the time integration the time step δ t should also be selected such that there is not a loss of information of the stress signal the use of a very small δ t and many range blocks k guarantees enough resolution and representation however those parameters should be balanced and set in accordance to the load excitation suffered by the structure and to its stress response in order to improve efficiency however the main challenge in assessing fatigue damage is not how many stress blocks are sufficient nor what size of time step is needed for enough resolution the problem is that time domain based fatigue computation relies upon simulating a certain time interval usually a few minutes of structural behavior and accumulate the damage produced in that specific window but in fact what has to be guaranteed is that the damage on the joint is kept within limits during the whole design life of the structure e g 20 years the palmgren miner rule assumes that fatigue damage accumulates linearly and that it is independent from the moment of appearance so a number of cycles of a given stress range would produce the same fatigue damage at any time of the design life zwick and muskulus 2015 stieng and muskulus 2018 from that hypothesis we can build a linear extrapolation model to estimate the damage at any point of the design life from short time simulations the length of the simulations cannot be drastically shortened there must be a balance so the simulations are the shortest but long enough in order to allow a complete development of all the stress cycles including high period cycles in this work the linear extrapolation proposed is build upon 300 and 600 s simulations a 600 s simulation is run taking an intermediate damage point at 300 s and then at the end again based on those two damages for each hot spot of the structure the damage at any time is estimated as 19 d life d 300 d 600 d 300 300 t life 300 using the proposed extrapolation the model guarantees three basic conditions the extrapolation is based on sufficient data the extrapolation is based on long enough damage recordings allowing the loads and the structural response to be completely developed and high period cycles are not cut out the 300 and 600 s simulations remain on the computationally manageable window in terms of computing time and data storage 5 numerical results numerical results regarding the impact of the aerodynamic damping in the coupled model and the accuracy of the estimated fatigue are presented in this section the simulation tool build in this work has been validated against the results of popko et al 2014 5 1 jacket and owt reference model the upwind reference jacket is used as model structure vorpahl et al 2012 the reference completely describes the geometry and the mechanical properties of a bottom clamped four legged jacket marine growth flooded legs and particular scfs are considered for each specific type of joint of the jacket a simplified transition piece consisting in a solid concrete block is used for simplicity reasons the wind turbine model is taken from jonkman et al 2009 which describes the properties of the tower rotor nacelle assembly hub and the 61 5 meters blades each blade is divided in 50 elements and individual mechanical and aerodynamic properties are given for each section all the properties of the model can be consulted in the cited references the results of the proposed numerical model including the environmental load modeling have been tested against outputs provided in jonkman et al 2009 vorpahl et al 2012 and popko et al 2014 forces and displacements fields using different loading conditions also provided in vorpahl et al 2013 have been compared with the in house code of this paper with general agreement figs 11 and 12 plot a comparative view for the shear force at mudline computed with the proposed model versus that computed with the fast and fedem codes and for displacements of the jacket in particular points selected as output sensors 5 2 aerodynamic damping as explained in section 3 2 there is a reduction in the displacements that is produced by the so called aerodynamic damping fig 13 shows the time record for the displacements of the hub node in the global x axis the plot shows the displacements obtained with the proposed model that automatically considers the aerodynamic damping vs the displacements obtained without it in order to remove the effect of the aerodynamic damping from the model the velocity of displacement of the blades is neglected in both plots a test load case combining wave and wind actions has been used for the left hand plot wind was set to a hub speed of 8 m s and for the right hand plot up to 18 m s in both cases the speed of rotation of the blades was set in accordance to the speed of the wind as exposed in jonkman et al 2009 the figure shows a significant discrepancy of movements between the model with and without the aerodynamic damping movements for the case considering the aerodynamic damping are lower as it was predicted however the aerodynamic damping has an impact beyond the simple reduction of movements fig 13 also shows that not only the maximum displacements are reduced but the shape of the dynamic response is changed strictly speaking this implies a change in the number of cycles and amplitude of the stresses produced on the structure thus a difference in the produced fatigue damage appears as it can be seen in fig 14 fatigue values are displayed separately for each type of joint t y x and k fig 14 shows the resulting fatigue damage in the structure under simplified load cases for that reason the damage values shown are significantly below failure for in place real conditions the tendency is the same the non consideration of the aerodynamic damping in the computational model clearly augments the fatigue damage computed or estimated therefore designs would be oversized thus the effect of aerodynamic damping needs to be included as accurate as possible to increase the efficiency of the designs and specially for optimization purposes 5 3 fatigue life prediction in this paper a method for the estimation of long term fatigue damage is presented the method is based on linear extrapolation of the data collected from shorter simulations in this case 300 and 600 s this section is intended to show the accuracy of the proposed method comparing the results of the estimated damage with those obtained by simulating the whole time interval in this case the damage extrapolated from the 300 and 600 s simulation is compared to the damaged obtained simulating the full time history response of 1 year several load cases with waves ranging from 2 to 10 meters high and winds speeds from 2 to almost 50 m s have been tested fig 15 shows the comparison between the computed and the estimated damage for the three type of joints of the oc4 jacket the plot shows that there is a good agreement in general between both results computed and estimated the average error in the estimation is only a 5 26 it is worth mention that separating the results in the three type of nodes allowed to isolate the accuracy of the estimation method for each kind of joint it is particularly relevant that for the x type joints the average error in the estimation was only a 0 4993 the methodology has been tested for different loading conditions including different wave heights and periods different wind speeds and variable incoming directions with similar results the accuracy of the estimated damage can be improved by discretely increasing the so called bin size li and choung 2017 of the rainflow counting method the bin size defines how many divisions are taken in the cycle counting history or in other words the level of discretization of the stress amplitudes along the stress record the number is related to the size of the rainflow matrix a larger bin size means a higher precision in genera but also a higher computational cost current offshore standards recommend a bin size of at least 20 fig 16 shows a box plot of the error in the estimated damage changing the bin size of the rainflow counting process between 20 30 40 50 and 100 while increasing the bin size seems to reduce the error slightly the higher the bin size the more outlier results appear in addition that is not the only effect that can be seen in fig 16 error for bin sizes 30 40 and 50 are similarly close however for a too small bin size of 20 the error is higher with positive value which means an under estimation of the fatigue damage however for a too large bin size of 100 the error is high again but with negative value meaning an over estimation of the fatigue damage in this case for bin sizes of 20 and 100 the stress response of the structure is being over smoothed and under smoothed respectively when the signal is being over smoothed small damaging cycles are lost when the signal is being under smoothed by using too large bin sizes noise in the signal of the stress response is accounted for damage from the computational point of view the grew in the bin size did not significantly affect the cpu time in fact the gap between all the cases was smaller than 10 s while the total cpu time needed to evaluate the response and compute the damage was on the order of 10000 s 6 conclusions in this paper a computational model for the simulation of fully coupled offshore wind turbines with jacket foundations including all the structural elements is presented the coupled model and the proposed non linear time integration scheme are able to simulate the full dynamic response of the structure capturing all the possible dynamic interactions between the substructure the tower of the turbine and the blades it also allows the integration of all the environmental loads in the same computational core and the consideration of the rotation of the blades with the desired angular speed depending on the incoming wind velocity the coupled model exposes the importance of the aerodynamic damping and the reduction in displacements experienced that can derive in a significantly different fatigue damage along time regarding fatigue in this paper an estimation method for the assessment of long term damage from short term simulations is proposed the results using the 300 and 600 s simulations are compared against full interval simulations with good agreement of the linear extrapolation what allows an efficient treatment of the accumulated fatigue and alleviates the computational burden of fatigue life design in real offshore structures

21912,typical industry models for offshore wind turbines with fixed substructures are based on decoupled models between the wind turbine and the substructure it is proved that the complete dynamic response of the structure can only be captured with coupled models in this paper a fully coupled model for offshore wind turbines with jacket support is presented the computational model allows to obtain an accurate response of the whole structure and the dynamic interaction between all the elements it also allows to reproduce particular effects such as the aerodynamic damping without the need for artificial damping ratios which would be needed in decoupled models typical environmental offshore conditions are integrated in the model and the response of the structure is obtained by means of a non linear time integration algorithm in order to include the effect of the continuous rotation of the blades a cost efficient approach for the determination of fatigue damage in the joints of the jackets is proposed it is based on short time simulations which allow to accurately estimate the long term damage in general the estimation shows a good agreement when compared to the damage values obtained by performing the whole time interval simulation keywords dynamic analysis fixed substructures coupled models fatigue estimation 1 introduction structural analysis of offshore wind turbines owts and their substructures is one of the major challenges in offshore engineering it is subjected to uncertainties related to loads environmental conditions and fatigue damage assessment and there is not an agreement on how the structural model must be built the problem is inherently dynamic and the analysis must capture the full interaction among all the elements of the owt relatively long time intervals of the structural behavior need to be analyzed in order to capture the full dynamic response of the structure and the development of long period cycles of strains and stresses dnv os j101 2010 additionally the accurate representation of the offshore environmental conditions requires the consideration of a great number of different load cases checking the feasibility of the designs and being able to estimate the fatigue damage during the whole design life is an extremely demanding task y terms of computational resources evaluating the dynamic interaction between elements is only accomplished by building coupled models where all the parts that form the owt substructure tower rotor nacelle assembly and blades are taken into account however this is not always possible since it involves larger computational effort traditionally wind turbine design and substructure design are performed by different engineers and analyzed individually seidel 2010 for this reason decoupled models where the aerodynamic calculations and effects are separated from the rest of the structure are usually preferred ashish and selvam 2013 ong et al 2014 abhinav and saha 2015 lai et al 2016 wei et al 2017 hence the masses of the blades hub and nacelle are lumped at the top of the tower and the global resultant forces and moments are considered at the same location a comparison of the structural responses between coupled and decoupled models can be found in hasselbach et al 2013 several discrepancies in movements stresses and fatigue damage can be observed one of the major drawbacks of decoupled models is the consideration of the aerodynamic damping ad kuhn 2001 hansen 2015 in schafhirt and muskulus 2018 the authors compare different methods to account for aerodynamic damping in decoupled simulations calibrating them with coupled integrated analysis the trend is significantly different for floating wind turbines fwt where the coupled response is essential in ren et al 2015 authors propose a numerical model to capture the full dynamic response under wind and waves of a spar torus combination system for a fwt the work also addresses the long term fatigue damage estimation of the mooring line in ma et al 2019 a coupled model is also presented for a different type of fwt a numerical analysis of a serbuoys tlp platform is presented and the results are compared against experimental data dynamic analysis was traditionally used for offshore petroleum structures in the nineties williams et al 1998 and generally adopted by most approaches for owt elshafey et al 2009 raheem 2013 vorpahl et al 2013 ren et al 2014 passon and branner 2014 nevertheless substantial effort is devoted in an attempt to develop alternative static analysis techniques that allow to approximate the response of the structure either by quasi static analysis equivalent static loads esl or dynamic amplification factors daf wei et al 2014 gong and chen 2015 chen et al 2016 there is also a parallel trend to solve the structure in the frequency domain harte et al 2012 myers et al 2015 wang et al 2017 a comparison between time domain analysis and spectral analysis can be found in mohammadi et al 2016 concluding that the response at specific hot spots is highly overestimated when using spectral methods and the time domain analysis is always preferable typical time history analyses for the assessment of fatigue in offshore steel structures are extremely resource demanding it must be simplified in order to increase the computational efficiency one aforementioned approach is the analysis in the frequency domain yeter et al 2015 huang 2017 while others seek to lighten the computing resources needed by the time history analysis by reducing the number of load cases by lumping them into those that contribute more to fatigue kvittem and moan 2015 zwick and muskulus 2015 or by using approximated approaches as damage equivalent loads del stieng et al 2015 an interesting approach can be found in dong et al 2011 where authors fit statistical distributions of the hot spot stresses for jacket type substructures under wind and wave conditions what allows to quantify their contribution to the fatigue damage in this paper a fully coupled model for offshore wind turbines and the structural analysis of jacket type foundations considering the rotation of the blades is presented the analysis is solved in the time domain a non linear integration method is used to account for the geometrical variations of the structure due to rotation additionally a simplified and efficient method is proposed for the evaluation of the fatigue damage produced at the hot spots during the whole design life of the structure 2 structural model and loading conditions 2 1 structural properties and dynamics the coupled owt model must integrate all the individual sub structures and their mutual interactions in this paper beam elements are used to model every single part of the structure however the turbine tower might be more accurately modeled using shell elements additionally the nacelle is obviously not a beam nevertheless the use of more complex models for particular elements of the owt would improve the quality of the response data only for those specific elements and not the global dynamic behavior of the structure and the dynamic interaction between elements in the proposed model depicted in fig 1 each structural element is then determined by its mass through a consistent mass matrix m cheng 2001 by its stiffness through its stiffness matrix k and by a rayleigh damping matrix c using a 2 damping ratio iso19902 2007 2013 the jacket substructure used in the numerical examples is modeled using 124 elements the aerodynamic part of the structure used in this paper is defined in jonkman et al 2009 both tower and blades are discretized in multiple elements with different geometrical and aerodynamic properties although the shape of the blade varies continuously from the rotor to the tip the used discretized elements have constant averaged properties in their length the weight 17 74 t of each blade is uniformly distributed along the span 9 different elements are used for the tower and 50 for each blade the nacelle is also modeled by means of beam elements the properties of each section are defined to match the mass and stiffness of the real nacelle the hub is substituted by a 56 78 t point mass the three dimensional framed structure of the jacket is taken from vemula et al 2010 it is a 65 65 meters high steel structure designed for a water depth of 50 m each element is defined by its mechanical properties flooded legs marine growth and hydrodynamic added mass are considered in the model the transition piece is a concrete block of 666 t in top of the jacket this part is modeled by means of beam elements matching the properties of the actual piece 2 2 environmental loads modeling in addition to the self weight of all structural members and buoyancy of the submerged bars of the jacket wind and wave loads are considered in the model waves act on the elements under the mean sea level and the wave surface wind is considered acting on the tower and blades and its effect over the non submerged part of the jacket is neglected since its influence on the structural and dynamic response of the structure is negligible in comparison with the combined effect of waves and wind on the tower and the blades wind forces on the blades are usually computed with the blade element momentum method bem as it was mentioned before most formulations rely on decoupled models where these forces are computed with separated aero servo elastic models in this paper forces are calculated and applied at each point of the discretized blade using its particular aerodynamic properties and wind speed at that specific location a deep explanation for the bem method can be found in burton et al 2001 hau 2006 and hansen 2015 but some details are given here for better a understanding the wind velocity at the actuator disk u d and its relation to the upstream velocity u can be computed using betz s momentum theory as seen in fig 2 these velocities can thus be expressed as 1 u d u 1 2 a where a is the so called axial induction factor that relates the upstream velocity and the velocity at the disk the pressure on the blades makes them rotate due to their aerodynamic design converting the loss of axial momentum into the torque exerted on the rotor disk an equal and opposite torque is then imposed on the air generating a rotating motion that is opposite to that of the blades this change in the tangential velocity is also expressed by means of a tangential induction factor a the tangential velocity experienced by the blade element is then 2 ω ω r 1 a where r is the radial distance to the blade element and ω the rotor angular speed the aerodynamics of the blade element are depicted in fig 3 where u d denotes the velocity of the wind at the airfoil and r is the resultant of the flow direction on the airfoil d and l are the drag and lift forces respectively f τ and f n are the projected forces on the tangential and normal axes considering the axes of the turbine α is the angle of attack and β is the pitch angle given that the induction factors are not known we have to assume initial values and calculate the drag and lift forces according to an iterative process as 1 initialize a 0 and a 0 2 using the pitch angle β and the inflow angle γ calculate the angle of attack α γ β 3 select the drag and lift coefficients c d c l for the computed angle of attack and the particular airfoil section 4 project coefficients in normal and tangential directions 3 c n c d sin γ c l cos γ c τ c d cos γ c l sin γ 5 update induction factors hansen 2015 4 a 1 4 sin 2 γ f σ c n 1 a 1 4 sin γ cos γ f σ c τ 1 6 repeat from step 2 until convergence expressions of 4 account for effects like the prandtl s blade tip loss and a discrete number of blades through the tip loss factor f and the chord solidity σ burton et al 2001 the above process allows to compute the tangential and normal force at each point of the blades however in up wind mounted rotors a phenomenon called tower dam appears the effect is a reduction of wind speed acting on the blade whenever it passes close to the tower of the owt dolan and lehn 2006 5 u d u d 1 d t 2 π d x d x 2 d y 2 where d t is the diameter of the tower and d x and d y are the distances between the passing blade and the tower in global axes as depicted in fig 7 the output torque and thrust using the described methodology can be compared with that of jonkman et al 2009 results are plotted in fig 4 the impact of the tower dam effect on the total torque is shown in fig 5 on the other hand forces due to waves on the jacket members are computed using morison s formula morison et al 1950 for submerged slender cylinders considering the kinematic properties of the waves given by the selected wave theory airy 2nd order stokes 5th order stokes chakrabarti 2005 it is worth mentioning that morison s formula is accepted for flow perpendicular to the cylinder 6 f n x t π 4 ρ c m d 2 s x t 1 2 ρ c d d s x t s x t where f n is the perpendicular force experienced by the cylinder per unit of length ρ is the water density c m and c d are the inertia and drag coefficients d is the diameter of the element and s x t and s x t are the velocity and acceleration of the particles of the waves in the normal direction to the element since elements of the jacket are not normal to the waves direction of propagation accelerations and velocities of the particles of the waves need to be projected on the local axes of each element in order to get the two normal components with respect to the inclined submerged member forces due to the sea current are not accounted for but can be included in the model by modifying the particle velocities it should be noted that in order to add the sea current velocity to the particle velocities only the component inline with the waves is used it also alters the apparent wave period a full description on how to include sea current in the calculations can be found in chakrabarti 2005 since the model is based on beam elements the process of computing the wave forces at each element fig 6 is as follows 1 discretize the element in n sub elements 2 compute velocities and accelerations from waves at those discretized points in global axes x y z 3 project those velocities and accelerations on the local axes of the elements x y z 4 use morison s formula to compute the normal forces on the element in the local y and z axes f y x t and f z x t 5 integrate forces along the length of the element to obtain the resultant forces f y and f z 6 calculate the point of application of the resultant force that will be later needed for the equivalent nodal forces and moments of the beam model 7 project the forces to the global axes to obtain f x x y z t f y x y z t and f z x y z t most models separate the computation of wind loads and wave loads commonly they are computed by using different codes and in decoupled models in this paper all the computations are merged in one unique model and code allowing for a complete control over all the parameters of the environment or the structure and obtaining a direct response due to a variation of any characteristic this allows for a direct consideration of the aerodynamic damping as explained in the following section 3 non linear time history analysis 3 1 reference frame and integration scheme as in any fe formulation the model is defined under a global reference frame x y z whereas every element of the structure is also particularly described in a local frame x y z different for each element however the fully coupled model developed and the rotation of the blades needs a special definition of the local reference frame in order to maintain the principal axes of the non axisymmetric sections of the blades local axes y and z are defined from the axis of rotation of the turbine in this case global x axis e z e x e x e y e z e x this guarantees that the z axis is always in the y z plane and the orientation of the principal axis of the sections is preserved since the structure is subjected to large rotations matrices m c and k change between time steps and the integration of the dynamic equation m u c u k u f needs to be performed by a non linear algorithm in this case displacements of the structure are solved by means of the non linear newmark time integration scheme given the original newmark scheme newmark 1959 7 m u k 1 c u k 1 k u k 1 f k 1 where 8 u k 1 u k δ t u k δ t 2 2 1 2 β u k 2 β u k 1 u k 1 u k δ t 1 γ u k γ u k 1 we can define the acceleration at step k 1 as u k 1 u k δ u then displacements and velocities of 8 lead to 9 u k 1 u k δ t u k δ t 2 2 u k u k 1 δ t 2 β δ u δ u u k 1 u k δ t u k u k 1 δ t γ δ u δ u u k 1 u k 1 δ u u k 1 u k 1 δ u and the residual 10 r f k 1 m u k 1 c u k 1 k u k 1 then newton iterations are performed on the residual considering a linearized increment δ r such that r δ r 0 where the nonlinear contribution can be obtained as 11 δ r r u δ u r u δ u r u δ u r u δ t 2 β δ u r u δ t γ δ u r u δ u δ t 2 β r u δ t γ r u r u δ u from eq 10 we set that 12 r u k r u c r u m and thus 13 δ r δ t 2 β k δ t γ c m k δ u then solving for r δ r 0 the following equation has to be solved iteratively 14 r k δ u fig 8 shows schematically the structural analysis of the coupled owt note that at every time step the structural matrices need to be recalculated and thereby the whole dynamic system needs to be re assembled also since the displacements vector u involves different units of measure movements and rotations that can differ in their order of magnitude typical convergence criterion may fall as they may indicate convergence because displacements dominate the norm while rotations might still be far from the right result in this case the convergence criteria proposed in chopra 1995 and shown in the following is used 15 δ r k 1 t δ u k 1 r k 1 t δ u k ε 3 2 rotation effects and aerodynamic damping rotation of the blades carries several physical implications that have an impact in the way the structure and its response are accurately modeled the most important effects would be the gyroscopic and centrifugal stiffening effect hamdi et al 2014 centrifugal stiffening is a nonlinear effect that takes into account that the centrifugal forces acting on a rotating deformed element have a restoring effect and thus stiffen the structure the additional stiffness can be modeled as a geometric stiffness matrix using the centrifugal force over the elements which depends on the mass rotational speed and distance to the center of rotation nevertheless both the gyroscopic effect and the centrifugal stiffening depend directly on the speed of rotation of the elements thus their influence is more acute in high speed applications and rotating machinery than in wind turbines in fact according to burton et al 2001 changes in the first natural frequency of a single blade do not exceed 0 5 for this reason both effects are neglected in this work fig 9 shows how the information on displacements of the blades has to be considered between time steps based on the presented integration scheme the method uses the information of displacements velocities and accelerations at step k to obtain those at step k 1 since the solution of the dynamic equation is performed in the global reference frame displacements obtained at step k do not represent the deformed shape of the blade at step k 1 the deformed shape rotates along with the blade and thus displacement velocity and acceleration vectors have to be rotated to be referred again to the global reference frame as 16 u y k u y k cos θ k u z k sin θ k u z k u y k sin θ k u z k cos θ k where as seen in fig 9 u y k and u z k are the displacements of the blade at step k referred to global axes and u y k and u z k are the displacements obtained at step k referred to global axes with the blade at the rotated position at step k 1 those displacements are the initial condition for the solution of the dynamic equation at step k 1 one major advantage of fully coupled models is the direct consideration of the aerodynamic damping aerodynamic damping schematically explained in fig 10 is a source of damping generated by the movement of the turbine the wind acting on the blades generates a thrust force t that produces displacements u with a certain speed u and acceleration ü of those movements thus the apparent speed in the wind direction experienced by the airfoil is reduced or increased by the deformation speed u therefore the modified apparent speed derives in a change in the angle of attack of the airfoil α that change derives in a change in the thrust force that always works against the movement of the blade consequently the real thrust force experienced by the rotor is smaller than that considered initially similarly when the blades undergo the opposite movement the displacement speed adds to the velocity of the wind increasing the apparent speed suffered increasing the angle of attack drag and lift forces and finally the thrust force in both cases the exerted thrust is modified by an increment or decrement of the thrust force δ t that works against the motion of the blades producing a reduction of the displacements that effect is called aerodynamic damping classical decoupled models introduce this phenomenon with a damping ratio coefficient ξ a e r o a better way to fully consider the aerodynamic damping and its impact on every section of the structure is by constructing a coupled model in this paper the wind speed experienced by the airfoil is modified according to the velocity of the displacements and thus the aerodynamic damping is automatically considered thus at each newton iteration of the nonlinear newmark integration scheme the apparent velocity of the wind u a p is recalculated with the displacement velocity of the previous iteration integrated coupled simulations allow to accurately obtain the response of the structure while considering the full effect of the aerodynamic damping in schafhirt and muskulus 2018 authors present formulas to calculate the aerodynamic damping ratio needed for decoupled simulations however it seems impossible to match every single environmental situation and the dynamic interaction produced in every possible case capturing accurately the dynamic interaction between the owt elements and the actual dynamic response is of major importance the aerodynamic damping affects directly the amplitude of the displacements suffered by the structure and those cyclic deformations have a severe impact on the fatigue damage produced on the support structures of the wind turbines 4 long term fatigue damage assessment most designs of offshore steel structures are fatigue driven therefore the fatigue damage experienced specially at the welds of the joints of the frame structures must be carefully addressed the most extended and recommended method to calculate fatigue damage in support structures of owt is based on the s n curves or wöhler curves dnv rp c203 2011 basically the curves provide the fatigue limits for a given type of structure and environment based on experimental data the limit is given as the maximum number of cycles n that the steel joint can bear until failure at a certain stress level s in this work the s n approach is used and the cycles and stress ranges are obtained from the time record of stresses using the rainflow counting algorithm endo et al 1974 astm e1049 85 2011 e1 2011 the nominal stresses obtained through the time integration and the fe formulation are scaled using stress concentration factors scf to account for the excessive accumulation of stresses at the joints dnv rp c203 2011 thus the fatigue damage of load case l is computed as 17 d j l 1 a i 1 k n i j t j t r k m δ σ i j m where n i j and δ σ i j are the number of cycles and amplitude of stresses for the hot spot j t j is the thickness of the element and t r a reference thickness a k and m are parameters of the s n curves dnv rp c203 2011 k is the number of stress blocks considered representative of the stresses time record the parameter k should be carefully selected so that the stress range blocks do not miss any important cycle that produces a significant fatigue damage for a given number of load cases considered in the structure l c the total fatigue damage is computed as 18 d j t l 1 l c p l 1 a i 1 k n i j t j t r k m δ σ i j m where p l is the probability of occurrence of load case l it is also important to give special care to the resolution of the stress record given by the time integration the time step δ t should also be selected such that there is not a loss of information of the stress signal the use of a very small δ t and many range blocks k guarantees enough resolution and representation however those parameters should be balanced and set in accordance to the load excitation suffered by the structure and to its stress response in order to improve efficiency however the main challenge in assessing fatigue damage is not how many stress blocks are sufficient nor what size of time step is needed for enough resolution the problem is that time domain based fatigue computation relies upon simulating a certain time interval usually a few minutes of structural behavior and accumulate the damage produced in that specific window but in fact what has to be guaranteed is that the damage on the joint is kept within limits during the whole design life of the structure e g 20 years the palmgren miner rule assumes that fatigue damage accumulates linearly and that it is independent from the moment of appearance so a number of cycles of a given stress range would produce the same fatigue damage at any time of the design life zwick and muskulus 2015 stieng and muskulus 2018 from that hypothesis we can build a linear extrapolation model to estimate the damage at any point of the design life from short time simulations the length of the simulations cannot be drastically shortened there must be a balance so the simulations are the shortest but long enough in order to allow a complete development of all the stress cycles including high period cycles in this work the linear extrapolation proposed is build upon 300 and 600 s simulations a 600 s simulation is run taking an intermediate damage point at 300 s and then at the end again based on those two damages for each hot spot of the structure the damage at any time is estimated as 19 d life d 300 d 600 d 300 300 t life 300 using the proposed extrapolation the model guarantees three basic conditions the extrapolation is based on sufficient data the extrapolation is based on long enough damage recordings allowing the loads and the structural response to be completely developed and high period cycles are not cut out the 300 and 600 s simulations remain on the computationally manageable window in terms of computing time and data storage 5 numerical results numerical results regarding the impact of the aerodynamic damping in the coupled model and the accuracy of the estimated fatigue are presented in this section the simulation tool build in this work has been validated against the results of popko et al 2014 5 1 jacket and owt reference model the upwind reference jacket is used as model structure vorpahl et al 2012 the reference completely describes the geometry and the mechanical properties of a bottom clamped four legged jacket marine growth flooded legs and particular scfs are considered for each specific type of joint of the jacket a simplified transition piece consisting in a solid concrete block is used for simplicity reasons the wind turbine model is taken from jonkman et al 2009 which describes the properties of the tower rotor nacelle assembly hub and the 61 5 meters blades each blade is divided in 50 elements and individual mechanical and aerodynamic properties are given for each section all the properties of the model can be consulted in the cited references the results of the proposed numerical model including the environmental load modeling have been tested against outputs provided in jonkman et al 2009 vorpahl et al 2012 and popko et al 2014 forces and displacements fields using different loading conditions also provided in vorpahl et al 2013 have been compared with the in house code of this paper with general agreement figs 11 and 12 plot a comparative view for the shear force at mudline computed with the proposed model versus that computed with the fast and fedem codes and for displacements of the jacket in particular points selected as output sensors 5 2 aerodynamic damping as explained in section 3 2 there is a reduction in the displacements that is produced by the so called aerodynamic damping fig 13 shows the time record for the displacements of the hub node in the global x axis the plot shows the displacements obtained with the proposed model that automatically considers the aerodynamic damping vs the displacements obtained without it in order to remove the effect of the aerodynamic damping from the model the velocity of displacement of the blades is neglected in both plots a test load case combining wave and wind actions has been used for the left hand plot wind was set to a hub speed of 8 m s and for the right hand plot up to 18 m s in both cases the speed of rotation of the blades was set in accordance to the speed of the wind as exposed in jonkman et al 2009 the figure shows a significant discrepancy of movements between the model with and without the aerodynamic damping movements for the case considering the aerodynamic damping are lower as it was predicted however the aerodynamic damping has an impact beyond the simple reduction of movements fig 13 also shows that not only the maximum displacements are reduced but the shape of the dynamic response is changed strictly speaking this implies a change in the number of cycles and amplitude of the stresses produced on the structure thus a difference in the produced fatigue damage appears as it can be seen in fig 14 fatigue values are displayed separately for each type of joint t y x and k fig 14 shows the resulting fatigue damage in the structure under simplified load cases for that reason the damage values shown are significantly below failure for in place real conditions the tendency is the same the non consideration of the aerodynamic damping in the computational model clearly augments the fatigue damage computed or estimated therefore designs would be oversized thus the effect of aerodynamic damping needs to be included as accurate as possible to increase the efficiency of the designs and specially for optimization purposes 5 3 fatigue life prediction in this paper a method for the estimation of long term fatigue damage is presented the method is based on linear extrapolation of the data collected from shorter simulations in this case 300 and 600 s this section is intended to show the accuracy of the proposed method comparing the results of the estimated damage with those obtained by simulating the whole time interval in this case the damage extrapolated from the 300 and 600 s simulation is compared to the damaged obtained simulating the full time history response of 1 year several load cases with waves ranging from 2 to 10 meters high and winds speeds from 2 to almost 50 m s have been tested fig 15 shows the comparison between the computed and the estimated damage for the three type of joints of the oc4 jacket the plot shows that there is a good agreement in general between both results computed and estimated the average error in the estimation is only a 5 26 it is worth mention that separating the results in the three type of nodes allowed to isolate the accuracy of the estimation method for each kind of joint it is particularly relevant that for the x type joints the average error in the estimation was only a 0 4993 the methodology has been tested for different loading conditions including different wave heights and periods different wind speeds and variable incoming directions with similar results the accuracy of the estimated damage can be improved by discretely increasing the so called bin size li and choung 2017 of the rainflow counting method the bin size defines how many divisions are taken in the cycle counting history or in other words the level of discretization of the stress amplitudes along the stress record the number is related to the size of the rainflow matrix a larger bin size means a higher precision in genera but also a higher computational cost current offshore standards recommend a bin size of at least 20 fig 16 shows a box plot of the error in the estimated damage changing the bin size of the rainflow counting process between 20 30 40 50 and 100 while increasing the bin size seems to reduce the error slightly the higher the bin size the more outlier results appear in addition that is not the only effect that can be seen in fig 16 error for bin sizes 30 40 and 50 are similarly close however for a too small bin size of 20 the error is higher with positive value which means an under estimation of the fatigue damage however for a too large bin size of 100 the error is high again but with negative value meaning an over estimation of the fatigue damage in this case for bin sizes of 20 and 100 the stress response of the structure is being over smoothed and under smoothed respectively when the signal is being over smoothed small damaging cycles are lost when the signal is being under smoothed by using too large bin sizes noise in the signal of the stress response is accounted for damage from the computational point of view the grew in the bin size did not significantly affect the cpu time in fact the gap between all the cases was smaller than 10 s while the total cpu time needed to evaluate the response and compute the damage was on the order of 10000 s 6 conclusions in this paper a computational model for the simulation of fully coupled offshore wind turbines with jacket foundations including all the structural elements is presented the coupled model and the proposed non linear time integration scheme are able to simulate the full dynamic response of the structure capturing all the possible dynamic interactions between the substructure the tower of the turbine and the blades it also allows the integration of all the environmental loads in the same computational core and the consideration of the rotation of the blades with the desired angular speed depending on the incoming wind velocity the coupled model exposes the importance of the aerodynamic damping and the reduction in displacements experienced that can derive in a significantly different fatigue damage along time regarding fatigue in this paper an estimation method for the assessment of long term damage from short term simulations is proposed the results using the 300 and 600 s simulations are compared against full interval simulations with good agreement of the linear extrapolation what allows an efficient treatment of the accumulated fatigue and alleviates the computational burden of fatigue life design in real offshore structures

21913,this paper investigates the relationship between bunker fuel consumption and the speed of container ships although there are different models existing in the literature and in the industry they do not always seem to match the actual maritime conditions the existing models work well in middle speed levels but they fail at the low and high speed ends unless the parameters in the exponent of the function are changed besides the problem of missing a general formulation the parameters seem to change with speed therefore in this paper a new approach is introduced to illustrate the dependance between bunker fuel consumption and speed and it is tested by formulating the exponent of the function variable stochastic criteria are used to compare the new generalized model with common models using real operating data keywords maritime transportation bunker fuel consumption real data statistical analysis 1 introduction for realistic planning of ship operations it is of major importance to model the dependance between various ship related parameters and or other appropriate variables especially the effects of speed on bunker fuel consumption is important for two reasons first bunker fuel cost and thus bunker fuel consumption constitutes the larger part of operational expenses opex see notteboom 2006 and golias et al 2009 the literature provides different values for the percentage of the bunker fuel cost in the total opex the values range from 50 gelareh and meng 2010 to 60 golias et al 2009 and even up to 75 ronen 2011 showing in any case that bunker fuel costs are the most important component of the total opex its share depends on several other costs such as time charter levels the bunker fuel strategy of the liner company and the bunker fuel price as reported by many authors including stopford 2008 a second reason is that all calculations for air emissions are based on the bunker fuel consumption which makes the prediction of this parameter significant in line with the trend to stricter regulations this issue will gain in importance in the near future therefore a realistic and accurate calculation of consumption is of vital significance as planning and changing of schedule are decided depending on the costs and thus on the consumption aberrations between calculations and reality lead to failed decisions resulting in millions of dollars in losses or avoidable air emissions many authors such as notteboom 2006 ronen 2011 and wang et al 2013 assume that bunker fuel consumption of the main engine depends on vessel speed and ship characteristics in general every vessel even if it has the same characteristics i e ships built based on the same design from the same shipyard as others develops an individual speed consumption profile lewis 1988 claims that three additional factors influence the consumption maintenance i e the condition of the main engine and other components of the propulsion system as well as the condition of the hull exposed to the sea and elements the operating profile i e cargo load ballast trim and bunker fuel quality and environmental conditions i e weather and sea state in contrast notteboom 2006 ronen 2011 and wang et al 2013 ignore factors such as draught wind current and sea state which makes their approach questionable the distance to be steamed requires speed over the ground however the data collected to examine consumption is based on the speed through the water which depends on factors such as wind and sea state however for the development of a speed consumption function a sufficient volume of data is collected that includes all these effects over the long term hence all factors are implied and already weighted based on their impact it may be possible to collect data in such a way as to examine the dependance of consumption on these factors however the challenge of using these dependencies for future forecasts is that these factors can neither be controlled nor predicted in the long term the most vital and manageable long term factors are the speed and the characteristics of a vessel assuming that other factors such as sea state and wind do not differ in the long term the data can be used to predict the future average bunker fuel consumption of a vessel therefore the assumption that the consumption of a vessel is well determined by its speed and design is realistic and reasonable the design of a realistic generalized speed consumption function that is valid for all speeds is the main objective of this paper the following is structured into five sections section 1 presents a short introduction section 2 gives an overview of the literature with a focus on the inconsistency of the existing models and current formulations in section 3 the new approach is described and introduced in section 4 a comparison of the different formulations is presented and analysed on the basis of a real dataset section 5 presents the conclusion 2 literature review every 10 years a group of authors publishes papers about vessel s routing and scheduling ronen 1983 1993 and christiansen et al 2004 2013 gendreau and potvin 2004 emphasize the importance of fleet management bunker fuel cost is the product of bunker fuel unit price and consumption the former can be quite volatile depending on supply and demand issues in the bunker fuel market fortunately stefanakos and schinas 2014 present a forecast system that seeks to address the volatility most authors tend to agree that consumption is mainly influenced by the characteristics of the vessel and its operating speed however determining a formula for the bunker fuel speed consumption relationship is a topic of active discussion wang and meng 2012a describe a procedure to generate a bunker fuel speed consumption function by regression several authors such as ronen 1982 corbett et al 2009 fagerholt et al 2010 psaraftis and kontovas 2010 ronen 2011 norstad et al 2011 qi and song 2012 wang et al 2013 and yin et al 2014 consider a cubic function as a good approximation for the dependance of daily consumption at a specific speed function 1 cubic speed consumption dependance used in the industry for the main engine consumption per day in tons 1 f c v q a c q v 3 where a c q is a parameter which is calculated for each vessel q by cubic regression v is the speed in knots for reasons of simplicity this function will be called c function hereafter however the exponent is a point of widely discussion for example the applied exponent of wang and meng 2012a is at a value between 2 7 and 3 3 depending on the vessel size du et al 2011 uses the exponent of 3 5 for feeder container ships 4 0 for medium sized container ships and 4 5 for jumbo container ships function 2 fractional rational description of speed consumption dependance of the main engine per day in tons 2 f f v q a f q v b f q where a f q and b f q are parameters which are calculated for each vessel q by fractional rational regression this function is called f function hereafter obviously function 1 is just a special case of function 2 for b f q 3 authors such as notteboom 2006 wang and meng 2012b and wang et al 2013 cluster different vessel designs to estimate the bunker fuel consumption by capacity kristensen and lützen 2013 claim that normally the propulsion power the resistance and the total propulsive efficiency are determined empirically and expound ways of calculation therefore since other factors like the shape of the hull below the waterline also influence bunker fuel consumption kristensen and lützen 2013 suggest every vessel design should be investigated individually additionally psaraftis and kontovas 2013 state that a cubic function is invalid for low speed in the work of kontovas and psaraftis 2011 exponents of 4 0 and in the case of any speed higher than 20 knots even greater exponents are used 3 speed consumption function 3 1 development of a new speed consumption function as previously noted in sections 1 and 2 many factors influence the bunker fuel consumption of main engines on container ships the best way to develop a reliable speed consumption function is by collecting real data about the speed and the corresponding consumption and then using regression to detect the function as described in section 2 this dependance is mostly used in form of function 1 or function 2 with different values for b f q dependent on the vessel size however two main critical points from the literature still appear first all polynomial functions with a fixed exponent are invalid for low speed shown by psaraftis and kontovas 2013 second authors such as kontovas and psaraftis 2011 explain that in case of higher speed the exponent also increases in this paper an approach is provided that integrates all these critics by formulating a generalized function with parameters valid for all speeds based on the previous discussion it is concluded that the exponent depends on vessel dimensions and speed thus it is proposed that the speed consumption function is described as an exponential function with vessel design as a constant and speed as a variable in the exponent the basis can be chosen arbitrarily as this varies only the fit parameters not the curve itself in this paper euler s number e was taken as the basis to simplify later calculation so this function will be called e function hereafter function 3 exponential description of speed consumption dependance of the main engine per day in tons 3 f e v q a e q e b e q v where a e q and b e q are parameters calculated for each vessel q by exponential regression fig 1 shows a comparison between the two functions 2 and 3 the curves are similar in the middle but differences are obvious at the edges usually vessels steam with moderate speed in the middle but market and environmental conditions or political regulation frames may lead to different basic speeds and the edges of the curves become important thus a generalized function valid for all speeds like the e function is clearly an advantage therefore the consumption at low and at high speeds will be vital for determining the quality of the regression of the functions the use of functions representing daily consumption dependent on speed is common in literature like the functions 1 2 and 3 as described in section 1 the aim of this paper is to calculate the consumption of a vessel not the consumption per day is needed but the consumption on a whole voyage as in liner shipping the stretches and thus the distances are fixed it is sensible to evaluate the consumption per nautical mile not per day only then it is possible to determine the consumption on the stretch as a function of the speed so an optimal speed can be calculated that minimizes the consumption and thus bunker fuel costs and emissions by dividing the daily consumption from function 3 by the daily performance in steamed miles the consumption is given in the form of bunker fuel consumption per nautical mile this leads to the following function function 4 consumption of the main engine per nautical mile in tons 4 f e v q a e q e b e q v n v where n is the number of hours in the measured period in the case of daily data n equals 24 h 3 2 characteristics of the speed consumption function a number of authors such as ronen 2011 and du et al 2011 investigated optimal bunker fuel consumption in a given timeframe and distance wang et al 2013 proved that minimal consumption is achieved by maintaining at a constant speed by using the characteristics of the non decreasing speed consumption curve where consumption increases with a higher speed or conversely decreases with a lower speed the latter view is one of the premises used by operators for implementing slow steaming operating at slower speeds the described functions 1 2 and 3 show these characteristics however function 4 does not fulfil the requirements in the proof of wang et al 2013 as it indicates section wise decrease of consumption for higher speeds therefore this paper presents a new proof based on the previously noted e function which is not based on the assumption of a non decreasing speed consumption curve obviously the parameters a e q and b e q from functions 3 and 4 are never negative or zero fig 2a illustrates this graphically and explains why a e q and b e q have to be positive to provide positive consumption with an increasing slope the next step involves finding a speed that leads to the minimum consumption per nautical mile based on function 4 lemma 3 1 the slower a vessel sails the less bunker fuel per nautical mile is consumed on the voyage as long as v 1 b e q the proof of lemma 3 1 can be found in appendix and is illustrated in fig 2b the important result of lemma 3 1 is that for any v 1 b e q a speed v exists with v v and f v f v therefore any speed below 1 b e q is inefficient as a decrease in v leads to a increase in consumption and will not be considered thus the restricted domain for the speed v in this thesis is defined as v r 1 b e q v v m a x where v m a x is the maximum speed of the vessel the next lemma shows that it is not possible to save the bunker fuel by steaming slow on one stretch of the voyage and speeding up on another part of the voyage lemma 3 2 the bunker fuel consumption is minimal per nautical mile by proceeding at a constant speed the proof of lemma 3 2 can also be found in appendix so although the proof of wang et al 2013 is not valid for function 4 it is proved that a constant speed leads to minimal consumption per nautical mile with a given available time combining these ideas leads to the conclusion of theorem 3 1 theorem 3 1 independent of the design of vessel the parameters a e q and b e q are always strictly positive any speed v 1 b e q is inefficient the minimal bunker fuel consumption per nautical mile and total round voyage rv is achieved by operating at an optimal speed v o p t d t while d is the total voyage distance and t is the total voyage time the greater the number and or duration of the deviation from the optimal speed the more inefficient the performance is theorem 3 1 is proven by lemmas 3 1 and 3 2 resulting from theorem 3 1 bunker fuel consumption is minimized by steaming at a constant speed for the given distance and timeframe 4 comparing the different approaches to evaluate the ability of the three approaches introduced in sections 2 and 3 namely the c function f function and the e function a test case is created consisting of real data from different vessels using different cases of regression helps to examine the optimum parameter for the curves developed for each of the functions to compare the quality of the resulting curves three different criteria are used which are explained later akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and cook s distance 4 1 test set up the used real data consist of speed and bunker fuel consumption data from the daily reports of three different vessels to eliminate extreme values only reports for one whole day 24 h on sea with a wind speed of less than 4 beaufort and a current speed of less than 4 knots are considered these data have been collected between january 2011 and september 2015 the general specifications of the vessels are taken from equasis 2018 and are provided in table 1 matlab s curve fitting toolbox is used to determine the optimal parameters of each of the three functions for the three example vessels the optimal parameters for the different approaches can be found in table 2 fig 3 shows the data points and the resulting fit of the f and e functions for vessel ii as expected the two functions have similar curves in the middle speed range where most points are found however the two functions diverge at the edges here the e function s gradient is higher at high speeds and the differences from the real data are smaller at both low and high speed operating conditions 4 2 criteria in this paper the decisive aspects are represented by the variances resulting from deviations between the models and the collected data to compare the models different criteria are formulated which include the variance variances akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic cook s distance the values for these criteria are calculated and compared to judge the quality of the fits and thus to examine the best model variance of the residuals the first criterion is the variance of the residuals of all three functions the variance is examined by using the values of the residuals of the models as shown by burnham and anderson 2004 5 σ 2 i ϵ i 2 p where σ 2 is the variance of the residuals ϵ i the residuals and p the number of data points table 3 shows the results for the different functions which can be now used to judge the quality of the fits for the three vessels as described in sections 2 and 3 the c function is only a special case of the f function when the exponent has a value of 3 and so is always dominated by the f function therefore bigger values of residuals and the variances are expected for the c function which can be seen in the table for all investigated vessels the sum of residuals and variances are less for the e function than for the f function this demonstrates the better approximation by the use of the e function in order to explore the reasons for this result further criteria are introduced aic and bic two different criteria are introduced the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic these criteria can be defined by taken from burnham and anderson 2004 6 aic k p ln σ 2 2 k 7 bic k p ln σ 2 2 k ln p where p is again the number of data points σ 2 is the variance of the residuals and k is the number of parameter defined in sections 2 and 3 generally the criteria can be described by likelihood functions but due to the use of least squares the variance can be used instead as shown in burnham and anderson 2004 in general lower values of aic and bic refer to small aberrations between the real data and the function and thus the quality of a fit can be recognized by a small value however for the interpretation of the values the other impacts on the criteria must also be considered as ln p is more than 1 for all estimated vessels bic is always higher than aic for e function and f function k equals 2 while for c function k equals 1 hence the increase in bic for c function is less than for the other functions as the values of aic and bic depend on the number of data points p which varies for the three vessels shown in table 2 their heights differ significantly from each other for vessel ii the most data points are available which also means that the values of the criteria are the highest so a comparison between the different vessels is not sensible in summary for each vessel the values for the criteria are examined and compared for the three functions and the lowest shows the best approximation of the data table 4 shows the results for the different fits which can be used now to judge the quality of the different fits for the three vessels as already described the c function always shows bigger deviations than the f function as it is just a special case therefore the values of aic will always be higher for the c function than for the f function in contrast bic favours functions with fewer parameters and thus the c function might have more favourable results however in this test case bic is less for f function in the investigated cases in summary for the c function which is currently the most used function the quality of data is always inferior to the f function thus for further analysis only e function and f function will be investigated a comparison of the values of aic and bic shows lowest values for the e function meaning the e function curve reflects the data best to clarify this and to examine the differences between the functions cook s distance is calculated in the next subsection cook s distances in the literature cook s distances are used to determine points that have a huge effect on the regression curve such as erroneous measurement and typing mistakes as a result cook s distances can be used to visualize aberrations between real data and regression curves e g at the edges and thus the quality of the fits mathematically cook s distance d i is defined as the sum of all the changes in the regression model when point i is removed from it as formulated in cook 1977 8 d i σ 2 p s 2 where s 2 is the mean squared error of the regression model fig 4 illustrates the results of cook s distance for the e and f functions the data is ordered in a row as described in section 3 1 the results are about the same in the middle of the curves thus in the middle of the curves the data quality is almost the same for both functions as fig 4a and b show however two aspects are observed at the edges first the number of points with a big cook s distance is higher for the f function second the cook s distances of these points are higher than those using the e function therefore it is statistically shown that based on the three vessel cases the e function regression offers a better approximation for the relation between speed and bunker fuel consumption than the f and c functions which are the most prominently used functions in the maritime industry 5 conclusion this paper introduces a new model the e function to establish a relationship between speed and bunker fuel consumption of a vessel as a generalized function owing to justified criticism in the published papers a new universal speed bunker fuel consumption function is proposed with an exponent including speed as a variable and parameters for the design of the vessel here with the implementation of the e function a mathematically elegant way is found and it is thus possible to evaluate the characteristics of the new function this novel approach solves the basic problems by a generalized formulation including parameters that are no longer dependent on speed to clarify the impact three cases based on real data are used for numerical examples using different criteria such as aic bic and cook s distance the results unequivocally show that by exponential regression a more precise speed consumption function is provided in these cases with the larger size of a ship these effects increase as well however due to a lack of data a correct evaluation can only be performed at a later stage as discussed a realistic and accurate formulation of the speed consumption function is of vital importance for the planning and changing of schedules failed decisions can result in millions of dollars in losses or increased air emissions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement we gratefully acknowledge the support of comtide ug co kg for providing the data appendix proof of lemma 3 1 proof the function f v a e b v c v is given to find the minimum of the function f v a b v 1 e b v c v 2 0 therefore the minimum is reached for v 1 b q to prove that the point is a minimum v 1 b q is inserted in f v a b 2 v 2 2 a b v 2 a e b v c v 3 as the result is always positive the point v 1 b q is always a minimum therefore for any speed below v 1 b q the function f v is strictly monotonically increasing proof of lemma 3 2 proof if the first derivation function f v is strictly monotonically increasing and the second derivation function f v has no zero value then it is obvious that by splitting up the routes in fast and slow tracks more bunker fuel will be consumed on the fast track than saved on the slow track and the constant speed is the most efficient per nautical mile f v a b v 1 e b v c v 2 f v a b 2 v 2 2 a b

makes f v negative or zero

fuel cost and thus bunker fuel consumption constitutes the larger part of operational expenses opex see notteboom 2006 and golias et al 2009 the literature provides different values for the percentage of the bunker fuel cost in the total opex the values range from 50 gelareh and meng 2010 to 60 golias et al 2009 and even up to 75 ronen 2011 showing in any case that bunker fuel costs are the most important component of the total opex its share depends on several other costs such as time charter levels the bunker fuel strategy of the liner company and the bunker fuel price as reported by many

reasonable the design of a realistic generalized speed consumption function that is valid for all speeds is the main objective of this paper the following is structured into five sections section 1 presents a short introduction section 2 gives an overview of the literature with a focus on the inconsistency of the existing models and current formulations in section 3 the new approach is described and introduced in section 4 a comparison of the different formulations is presented and analysed on the basis of a real dataset section 5 presents the conclusion 2 literature review every 10 years a

fuel cost is the product of bunker fuel unit price and consumption the former can be quite volatile depending on supply and demand issues in the bunker fuel market fortunately stefanakos and schinas 2014 present a forecast system that seeks to address the volatility most authors tend to agree that consumption is mainly influenced by the characteristics of the vessel and its operating speed however determining a formula for the bunker fuel speed consumption relationship is a topic of active discussion wang and meng 2012a describe a procedure to generate a bunker fuel speed consumption function by regression several authors such as ronen 1982 corbett et al 2009 fagerholt et al 2010 psaraftis and kontovas 2010 ronen 2011 norstad et al 2011 qi and song 2012 wang et al 2013 and yin et al 2014 consider a cubic function as a good approximation for the dependance of daily consumption at a specific speed function 1 cubic speed consumption dependance used in the industry for the main engine consumption per day in tons 1 f c v q a c q v 3 where a c q is a parameter which is calculated for each vessel q by cubic regression v is the speed in knots for reasons of simplicity this function will be called c function hereafter however the exponent is a point of widely discussion for example the applied exponent of wang and meng 2012a is at a value between 2 7 and 3 3 depending on the vessel size du et al 2011 uses the exponent of 3 5 for feeder container ships 4 0 for medium sized container ships and 4 5 for jumbo container ships function 2 fractional rational description of speed consumption dependance of the main engine per day in tons 2 f f v q a f q v b f q where a f q and b f q are parameters which are calculated for each vessel q by fractional rational regression this function is called f function hereafter obviously function 1 is just a special case of function 2 for b f q 3 authors such as notteboom 2006 wang and meng 2012b and wang et al 2013 cluster different vessel designs to estimate the bunker fuel consumption by capacity kristensen and lützen 2013 claim that normally the propulsion power the resistance and the total propulsive efficiency are determined empirically and expound ways of calculation therefore since other factors like the shape of the hull below the waterline also influence bunker fuel consumption kristensen and lützen 2013 suggest every vessel design should be investigated individually additionally psaraftis and kontovas 2013 state that a cubic function is invalid for low speed in the work of kontovas and psaraftis 2011 exponents of 4 0 and in the case of any speed higher than 20 knots even greater exponents are used 3 speed consumption function 3 1 development of a new speed consumption function as previously noted in sections 1 and 2 many factors influence the bunker fuel consumption of main engines on container ships the best way to develop a reliable speed consumption function is by collecting real data about the speed and the corresponding consumption and then using regression to detect the function as described in section 2 this dependance is mostly used in form of function 1 or function 2 with different values for b f q dependent on the vessel size however two main critical points from the literature still appear first all polynomial functions with a fixed exponent are invalid for low speed shown by psaraftis and kontovas 2013 second authors such as kontovas and psaraftis 2011 explain that in case of higher speed the exponent also increases in this paper an approach is provided that integrates all these critics by formulating a generalized function with parameters valid for all speeds based on the previous discussion it is concluded that the exponent depends on vessel dimensions and speed thus it is proposed that the speed consumption function is described as an exponential function with vessel design as a constant and speed as a variable in the exponent the basis can be chosen arbitrarily as this varies only the fit parameters not the curve itself in this paper euler s number e was taken as the basis to simplify later calculation so this function will be called e function hereafter function 3 exponential description of speed consumption dependance of the main engine per day in tons 3 f e v q a e q e b e q v where a e q and b e q are parameters calculated for each vessel q by exponential regression fig 1 shows a comparison between the two functions 2 and 3 the curves are similar in the middle but differences are obvious at the edges usually vessels steam with moderate speed in the middle but market and environmental conditions or political regulation frames may lead to different basic speeds and the edges of the curves become important thus a generalized function valid for all speeds like the e function is clearly an advantage therefore the consumption at low and at high speeds will be vital for determining the quality of the regression of the functions the use of functions representing daily consumption dependent on speed is common in literature like the functions 1 2 and 3 as described in section 1 the aim of this paper is to calculate the consumption of a vessel not the consumption per day is needed but the consumption on a whole voyage as in liner shipping the stretches and thus the distances are fixed it is sensible to evaluate the consumption per nautical mile not per day only then it is possible to determine the consumption on the stretch as a function of the speed so an optimal speed can be calculated that minimizes the consumption and thus bunker fuel costs and emissions by dividing the daily consumption from function 3 by the daily performance in steamed miles the consumption is given in the form of bunker fuel consumption per nautical mile this leads to the following function function 4 consumption of the main engine per nautical mile in tons 4 f e v q a e q e b e q v n v where n is the number of hours in the measured period in the case of daily data n equals 24 h 3 2 characteristics of the speed consumption function a number of authors such as ronen 2011 and du et al 2011 investigated optimal bunker fuel consumption in a given timeframe and distance wang et al 2013 proved that minimal consumption is achieved by maintaining at a constant speed by using the characteristics of the non decreasing speed consumption curve where consumption increases with a higher speed or conversely decreases with a lower speed the latter view is one of the premises used by operators for implementing slow steaming operating at slower speeds the described functions 1 2 and 3 show these characteristics however function 4 does not fulfil the requirements in the proof of wang et al 2013 as it indicates section wise decrease of consumption for higher speeds therefore this paper presents a new proof based on the previously noted e function which is not based on the assumption of a non decreasing speed consumption curve obviously the parameters a e q and b e q from functions 3 and 4 are never negative or zero fig 2a illustrates this graphically and explains why a e q and b e q have to be positive to provide positive consumption with an increasing slope the next step involves finding a speed that leads to the minimum consumption per nautical mile based on function 4 lemma 3 1 the slower a vessel sails the less bunker fuel per nautical mile is consumed on the voyage as long as v 1 b e q the proof of lemma 3 1 can be found in appendix and is illustrated in fig 2b the important result of lemma 3 1 is that for any v 1 b e q a speed v exists with v v and f v f v therefore any speed below 1 b e q is inefficient as a decrease in v leads to a increase in consumption and will not be considered thus the restricted domain for the speed v in this thesis is defined as v r 1 b e q v v m a x where v m a x is the maximum speed of the vessel the next lemma shows that it is not possible to save the bunker fuel by steaming slow on one stretch of the voyage and speeding up on another part of the voyage lemma 3 2 the bunker fuel consumption is minimal per nautical mile by proceeding at a constant speed the proof of lemma 3 2 can also be found in appendix so although the proof of wang et al 2013 is not valid for function 4 it is proved that a constant speed leads to minimal consumption per nautical mile with a given available time combining these ideas leads to the conclusion of theorem 3 1 theorem 3 1 independent of the design of vessel the parameters a e q and b e q are always strictly positive any speed v 1 b e q is inefficient the minimal bunker fuel consumption per nautical mile and total round voyage rv is achieved by operating at an optimal speed v o p t d t while d is the total voyage distance and t is the total voyage time the greater the number and or duration of the deviation from the optimal speed the more inefficient the performance is theorem 3 1 is proven by lemmas 3 1 and 3 2 resulting from theorem 3 1 bunker fuel consumption is minimized by steaming at a constant speed for the given distance and timeframe 4 comparing the different approaches to evaluate the ability of the three approaches introduced in sections 2 and 3 namely the c function f function and the e function a test case is created consisting of real data from different vessels using different cases of regression helps to examine the optimum parameter for the curves developed for each of the functions to compare the quality of the resulting curves three different criteria are used which are explained later akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and cook s distance 4 1 test set up the used real data consist of speed and bunker fuel consumption data from the daily reports of three different vessels to eliminate extreme values only reports for one whole day 24 h on sea with a wind speed of less than 4 beaufort and a current speed of less than 4 knots are considered these data have been collected between january 2011 and september 2015 the general specifications of the vessels are taken from equasis 2018 and are provided in table 1 matlab s curve fitting toolbox is used to determine the optimal parameters of each of the three functions for the three example vessels the optimal parameters for the different approaches can be found in table 2 fig 3 shows the data points and the resulting fit of the f and e functions for vessel ii as expected the two functions have similar curves in the middle speed range where most points are found however the two functions diverge at the edges here the e function s gradient is higher at high speeds and the differences from the real data are smaller at both low and high speed operating conditions 4 2 criteria in this paper the decisive aspects are represented by the variances resulting from deviations between the models and the collected data to compare the models different criteria are formulated which include the variance variances akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic cook s distance the values for these criteria are calculated and compared to judge the quality of the fits and thus to examine the best model variance of the residuals the first criterion is the variance of the residuals of all three functions the variance is examined by using the values of the residuals of the models as shown by burnham and anderson 2004 5 σ 2 i ϵ i 2 p where σ 2 is the variance of the residuals ϵ i the residuals and p the number of data points table 3 shows the results for the different functions which can be now used to judge the quality of the fits for the three vessels as described in sections 2 and 3 the c function is only a special case of the f function when the exponent has a value of 3 and so is always dominated by the f function therefore bigger values of residuals and the variances are expected for the c function which can be seen in the table for all investigated vessels the sum of residuals and variances are less for the e function than for the f function this demonstrates the better approximation by the use of the e function in order to explore the reasons for this result further criteria are introduced aic and bic two different criteria are introduced the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic these criteria can be defined by taken from burnham and anderson 2004 6 aic k p ln σ 2 2 k 7 bic k p ln σ 2 2 k ln p where p is again the number of data points σ 2 is the variance of the residuals and k is the number of parameter defined in sections 2 and 3 generally the criteria can be described by likelihood functions but due to the use of least squares the variance can be used instead as shown in burnham and anderson 2004 in general lower values of aic and bic refer to small aberrations between the real data and the function and thus the quality of a fit can be recognized by a small value however for the interpretation of the values the other impacts on the criteria must also be considered as ln p is more than 1 for all estimated vessels bic is always higher than aic for e function and f function k equals 2 while for c function k equals 1 hence the increase in bic for c function is less than for the other functions as the values of aic and bic depend on the number of data points p which varies for the three vessels shown in table 2 their heights differ significantly from each other for vessel ii the most data points are available which also means that the values of the criteria are the highest so a comparison between the different vessels is not sensible in summary for each vessel the values for the criteria are examined and compared for the three functions and the lowest shows the best approximation of the data table 4 shows the results for the different fits which can be used now to judge the quality of the different fits for the three vessels as already described the c function always shows bigger deviations than the f function as it is just a special case therefore the values of aic will always be higher for the c function than for the f function in contrast bic favours functions with fewer parameters and thus the c function might have more favourable results however in this test case bic is less for f function in the investigated cases in summary for the c function which is currently the most used function the quality of data is always inferior to the f function thus for further analysis only e function and f function will be investigated a comparison of the values of aic and bic shows lowest values for the e function meaning the e function curve reflects the data best to clarify this and to examine the differences between the functions cook s distance is calculated in the next subsection cook s distances in the literature cook s distances are used to determine points that have a huge effect on the regression curve such as erroneous measurement and typing mistakes as a result cook s distances can be used to visualize aberrations between real data and regression curves e g at the edges and thus the quality of the fits mathematically cook s distance d i is defined as the sum of all the changes in the regression model when point i is removed from it as formulated in cook 1977 8 d i σ 2 p s 2 where s 2 is the mean squared error of the regression model fig 4 illustrates the results of cook s distance for the e and f functions the data is ordered in a row as described in section 3 1 the results are about the same in the middle of the curves thus in the middle of the curves the data quality is almost the same for both functions as fig 4a and b show however two aspects are observed at the edges first the number of points with a big cook s distance is higher for the f function second the cook s distances of these points are higher than those using the e function therefore it is statistically shown that based on the three vessel cases the e function regression offers a better approximation for the relation between speed and bunker fuel consumption than the f and c functions which are the most prominently used functions in the maritime industry 5 conclusion this paper introduces a new model the e function to establish a relationship between speed and bunker fuel consumption of a vessel as a generalized function owing to justified criticism in the published papers a new universal speed bunker fuel consumption function is proposed with an exponent including speed as a variable and parameters for the design of the vessel here with the implementation of the e function a mathematically elegant way is found and it is thus possible to evaluate the characteristics of the new function this novel approach solves the basic problems by a generalized formulation including parameters that are no longer dependent on speed to clarify the impact three cases based on real data are used for numerical examples using different criteria such as aic bic and cook s distance the results unequivocally show that by exponential regression a more precise speed consumption function is provided in these cases with the larger size of a ship these effects increase as well however due to a lack of data a correct evaluation can only be performed at a later stage as discussed a realistic and accurate formulation of the speed consumption function is of vital importance for the planning and changing of schedules failed decisions can result in millions of dollars

21914,in this study a hybrid monopile friction wheel bucket mfb foundation for offshore wind turbines is proposed a bucket and a friction wheel are integrated with a monopile the friction wheel is filled with scattered material to provide distributed surcharge loads to the subsoil a series of geotechnical centrifuge tests was performed under monotonic load and cyclic load to investigate the bearing capacity of the mfb foundation five hybrid foundations with variable dimensions were tested in four types of sandy soil conditions the centrifuge test results show that the ultimate bearing capacity of the hybrid mfb foundation could be 4 times of the monopile foundation under cyclic load the final displacement of mfb foundation is significantly smaller than that of the monopile foundation the mfb foundation is stiffer in the reloading process but shows slightly more plastic characteristic in the unloading process the size of the add on friction wheel bucket structure is positively related to the performance of the mfb foundation the bucket height tends to be a more effective factor it is illustrated that the mfb foundation tends to demonstrates more improvements in the saturated loose sand a simplified method is proposed to predict the bearing capacity of the hybrid mfb foundation keywords bucket foundation centrifuge tests cyclic load friction wheel hybrid owt foundation lateral bearing capacity monopile monotonic load 1 introduction mother nature creates a bonanza of offshore wind blowing strongly and consistently along the coast of continents harvesting energy from offshore wind alone can make a huge contribution to meet the entire world s need for energy consumption as an energy source with huge potential a number of successful offshore wind farms having hundreds of megawatts capacity have been producing electricity along many countries coastline and many bigger projects are under construction li and yu 2017 2018 sun et al 2012 the development of offshore wind energy is currently at full throttle worldwide erecting an offshore wind turbine owt up to 35 of total investment is spent on foundation work byrne and houlsby 2003 the main challenge is to develop a stable foundation structure in the harsh marine environment while maintaining relatively low cost gao et al 2015 among many existing solutions the most widely used type of owt foundation is monopile as of march 2018 around 71 of owts are supported by monopile foundation monopiles are manufactured as hollow cylindrical steel tubular with wall thickness ranging from 55 mm to 150 mm hu 2015 most monopiles are driven into the seabed by large impact hydraulic hammers while some are installed into pre drilled the future design of monopile is likely to have a diameter up to 10 m and a weight heavier than 1000 ton li et al 2019 for these large diameter stiff monopile with high diameter length ratio the traditional p y curve method lada et al 2014 which is typically used for slender piles in oil and gas industry is no longer appropriate chen et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 numerical modellings and field tests are conducted to develop a new design method for large diameter monopiles however limited capacity of crane and impact hammer on the installation vessel as well as the increasing material cost are the major challenge of utilizing larger diameter stiff monopile the bucket foundation has been used in several experimental projects in europe and china and is very promising to become another popular owt foundation bucket foundation was used in the offshore oil and gas platform that was placed under the legs of the jacket baerheim et al 1995 a prototype of bucket foundation for offshore wind was installed in frederikshavn denmark in 2002 ibsen and brincker 2004 another prototype of a large scale composite bucket foundation proposed by tianjin university was installed in qidong jiangsu china in 2010 zhang et al 2014 the suction installation process makes very little noise which is good for marine creatures the performance of bucket foundation under lateral cyclic load and seismic load was investigated through 1 g model tests centrifuge tests and fe analysis ding et al 2015 fu et al 2017 kim 2012 lian et al 2011 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017a c researchers have studied the characteristics of the process of installation and transportation of bucket foundation ding et al 2011 guo et al 2012 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2004 2014 2016a 2016b efforts were also made to improve the performance of bucket foundation by adding compartments inside the bucket and optimizing the configuration of the bucket wall lian et al 2012 wang et al 2017b xiao et al 2019 some concepts of hybrid foundation combining monopile with other integrated components have been proposed an additional friction wheel on a monopile foundation can enhance the bearing capacity of the traditional monopile foundation and the increment could be up to 2 times wang et al 2018a 2018b a 1 g model test shows the lateral bearing capacity and initial stiffness are enhanced by adding a footing or skirt to the monopile and the improvement depends on the size of the footing and the soil condition stone et al 2007 an fe analysis of a hybrid monopile footing foundation was conducted to investigate the foundation performance under the environmental and seismic loading anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 a series of centrifuge and fe tests were conducted to investigate the optimized footing aspect ratio v h m load relationships structure soil interaction mechanism and the influence of soil properties el marassi 2011 li et al 2020 pedram 2015 2 the concept of hybrid owt foundation the concept of hybrid foundation proposed in this paper is a combination of monopile with friction wheel and bucket foundation the scheme of the structure is shown in fig 1 the friction wheel and bucket have the same diameter d f d b and these two parts are welded together as an integrated component the height of the friction wheel and bucket are h f and h b respectively the embedded length of the pile is l and it has a diameter of d p the friction wheel is filled with gravel or stone to apply vertical load on the bucket lid the connection between the friction wheel bucket part and the monopile is a tight fit in the horizontal direction while there is no displacement restriction in the vertical direction vertical relative movement is allowed under external load the resisting moment created by the friction wheel and the bucket can transfer load to the monopile and tower the depth of the bucket is relatively shallow compared to the traditional bucket foundation the installation method of the hybrid foundation is very important for its practicality it was suggested that for a monopile footing hybrid foundation the plate can be placed first as a guide for the monopile pedram 2015 stone et al 2007 for another hybrid model the inner circle of the footing can be made as a conical shape so that the monopile will be self locked while penetration anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 the process of installation of the proposed hybrid foundation is presented in fig 2 during the installation the bucket foundation can be compressed into the seabed initially by its self weight secondly the water inside is pumped out and the suction force assists the full penetration of the bucket finally the monopile is hammered into the seabed using the friction wheel and bucket part as a guide to locate the monopile in the seawater in motion the upper part of the inner circle of the friction wheel can be made as a conical shaped feature for a bucket cassion foundation in some cases rocks and stones buried in the soil layers would block the installation of the bucket and the pressure difference is not large enough to break through the obstacles thus the installation site is forced to be adjusted this problem will significantly slow down the installation process and increase the period of usage of special vessels therefore the bucket part of this concept is designed to be relatively shallow to reduce the risk of being blocked 3 centrifuge tests the tests were performed on the geotechnical centrifuge in the department of civil engineering of case western reserve university foundation models are tested under 50 g gravity field in this study there are 6 models tested including a monopile a monopile friction wheel foundation denoted as mf foundation and four monopile friction wheel bucket foundations with different aspect ratios denoted as mfb foundation the geometry parameters and weight of all 5 hybrid models are shown in table 1 all values in the paper are on a prototype scale the embedded length of the monopile l is 6 m the diameter of the pile d p is 1 1 m and the height of the owt tower is 14 m fig 3 shows the models tested in this program the nacelle of the turbine is simplified by a solid aluminum cube fixed on the top of the tower to simulate the weight of the upper structure the total weight of the upper structure is 38 25 tons in order to evaluate the performance of the models the uniform load on the lid of the bucket structure is set to be the same for different models this makes the depth of gravel filled in the friction wheel the same for different models the diameter of the friction wheel is the same as the bucket eventually the diameter and the depth of the container are determined by the above two reasons which determines the weight of the gravel in the tests the sand used in this test is standard toyoura sand with a mean particle size of 0 17 mm specific gravity of 2 65 and void ratios of 0 65 and 0 88 respectively for the dense and loose sand four soil conditions were prepared as loose saturated sand dense saturated sand loose dry sand and dense dry sand the relative density is 26 for loose sand and 87 for dense sand the soil sample were prepared by air pluviation method dry sand was poured into the test container with constant heights and additional compaction was required to prepare for the desired relative density de aired water flowed in from the bottom slowly and a vacuum was set for at least 24 h for saturation the effective unit weight was 13 81 and 8 61 kn m3 for dry and saturated loose sand 15 79 and 9 81 kn m3 for dry and saturated dense sand the internal friction angles for loose sand and dense sand are 32 5 and 36 respectively the foundation models were pushed into the soil before the test in order to maintain the absolute vertical installation of the foundation models a clip was used to guide the push of the monopile the friction wheel and bucket component were installed following the position of the monopile the installation process in the experiments is similar to the in situ process which could densify the surrounding soil all six of the models were tested by a monotonic load and a cyclic lateral load the monotonically increasing linear lateral load from 0 to 1 55 mn was acted horizontally above the ground line at a height of e 3 25 m on the tower and two lateral lvdts record the lateral displacement at two different heights 3 25 m and 5 75 m which is presented in fig 4 the rotation angle of the structure can be derived from the displacement of two points on the tower using a simple geometric calculation which is presented in fig 5 d 1 and d 2 denote the displacement recorded by the lvdt1 and lvdt2 respectively two triangles oaa1 and obb1 are two similar triangles so the length of ab can be used to calculate the rotation angle θ 1 θ t a n 1 d 2 d 1 a b to describe the characteristics of the cyclic load two parameters were defined by leblanc et al 2010 in terms of the load of moment and they can be modified to define the load of lateral force in this case 2 ζ b f m a x f r ζ c f m i n f m a x where f max and f min are the maximum and minimum force of the load cycle and the f r is the static bearing capacity of lateral load in the test series the cyclic load is a one way load with f max 445 kn and f min 0 and repeats 10 cycles in 110 s if we use the calculated lateral bearing capacity of monopile in dense dry sand as the f r to normalize the f max we can have the two parameters ζ b 0 93 and ζ c 0 the eccentricity of the cyclic load is also e 3 25 m the lvdt located at the same level as the actuator monitors the pile head displacement the monotonic load and cyclic load are presented in fig 6 to compare the performance of hybrid foundation models it is more convenient to use a uniform load in all soil conditions according to the test results from the monotonic load the bearing capacity of the monopile in different soil conditions ranges from 262 kn to 432 kn and the bearing capacity of the mfb2 hybrid foundation is from 882 kn to 1775 kn if the magnitude of the cyclic load is too large the monopile will fail directly and show no elastic behavior 445 kn is approximately the same as the bearing capacity of the monopile in dry dense sand and is about the same as the bearing capacity of the mfb2 hybrid foundation in saturated loose sand in this way all the models can show both of their elastic and plastic behavior to some extent 3 1 monotonic load tests the bearing capacity is often defined as the transition point where the load displacement curve reaches a platform or the intersection point of two fitted lines of the initial and final phase of the curve however in this set of tests it s hard to define a point by the above criterion therefore the rotation angle criterion θ 5 is used to define the ultimate capacity the rotation limits for owt is 5 for the ultimate limit state uls and less than 1 for the serviceability limit state sls dnv 2014 doherty and gavin 2011 for curves that cannot reach 5 a short line fitted to the final tendency of the curve intersect with the 5 dash line and the point of intersection is defined as the ultimate lateral bearing capacity from fig 7 we can see that for dry and saturated sand the lateral bearing capacity of foundations in dense sand is larger than that in the loose sand the bearing capacity in dry sand is larger than that in the saturated sand the bearing capacity of hybrid foundations is larger than the monopile foundation within the hybrid foundations all mfb foundations provide more lateral resistance than the mf foundation among the mfb foundations the mfb4 model with the smallest diameter of 3 81 m has the smallest bearing capacity but is very close to the mfb2 and mfb3 the load rotation curves of mfb1 and mfb3 with a diameter of 5 m and 6 35 m coincided with each other and the mfb3 has a slightly larger capacity than mfb1 except in dry dense sand in terms of soil condition the ultimate lateral bearing capacities for all models are the highest in dry dense soil and are the lowest in saturated loose sand for mfb1 mfb2 and mfb3 model the ultimate bearing capacity in saturated dense sand is slightly larger than that in dry loose sand but the situation is the opposite for mf and mfb4 model the ultimate bearing capacity in saturated dense sand is slightly smaller than that in dry loose sand the ultimate bearing capacities for all models and soil conditions are listed in table 2 foundation model mf mfb1 and mfb2 have the same bucket diameter of 5 m but different bucket heights 0 m 1 m and 2 m respectively model mfb4 mfb1 and mfb3 have the same bucket height of 1 m but different bucket diameters of 3 81 m 5 m and 6 35 m respectively height ratio η h is the ratio of bucket height h b to the embedded length of the pile l and diameter ratio η d is the ratio of bucket diameter d b to the pile diameter d p fig 8 shows the relationship of ultimate bearing capacity with height ratio h b l and diameter ratio d b d p from fig 8 a we can see that in all soil conditions with the same bucket diameter the ultimate bearing capacity increases almost linearly with the increase of height ratio in dry dense sand the mfb2 model with a height ratio of 0 33 gained significant growth in ultimate bearing capacity fig 8 b shows that in all soil condition with the same height of bucket the ultimate bearing capacity increase with the increase of diameter ratio except the case in dry loose sand if all the foundation structures were fabricated by steel sheets with the same thickness the amount of raw material used in model mfb2 is 29 3 more than the mfb1 model while the amount of material used in model mfb3 is 36 3 more than the mfb1 model however the increase of the ultimate bearing capacity of mfb2 is much larger than that of mfb3 which were both compared with mfb1 hence the increase of bucket depth is better than the increase of bucket diameter in terms of cost and performance 3 2 cyclic load tests since the cyclic load was acted on the foundation model by an actuator the output of the actuator is not precisely the same as what we expected from the input signal all the output of the actuator in dry dense sand series are presented in fig 9 from the figure we can see that although there are a couple of peaks stand out the average maximum and minimum values of the cyclic load of each type of foundation are around 445 kn and 0 kn which make sure that the load was pretty accurate fig 10 shows the lateral load displacement curves of monopile and mfb2 foundation in dry dense sand the pile head displaced significantly in the initial cycle and following reloading displacements increased in a decreasing rate which shows that the reloading stiffness of the foundations increased with the number of cycles the final displacement of 6 types of foundations in 4 soil conditions is listed in table 3 the lateral displacement time curves of all cyclic tests are presented in fig 11 the reloading displacements of each cycle are peaks in the solid line curves and all peaks are connected by the dashed line to help illustrate the growth rate of the reloading displacements it shows that in all cases the displacements of monopile foundation exceed all hybrid foundations and the difference between them keeps growing with the increase of the number of cycles the mf foundation has the largest displacement among all hybrid foundations within 4 mfb foundations the mfb4 mfb1 and mfb3 foundations with the same h b 1 m h f 1 m but different bucket diameters d b 3 81 m 5 m and 6 35 m have the displacement in the order of mfb4 mfb1 mfb3 which means that the increase of the bucket diameter help increase the resistance under cyclic load for foundation mfb1 and mfb2 with the same bucket diameter of d b 5 m but different bucket depth h b 1 m and 2 m respectively the displacement of mfb2 is smaller than mfb1 and it indicates that the structure could benefit from the increase of the bucket depth under cyclic load among all the foundations mfb2 and mfb3 with the largest bucket depth and largest bucket diameter respectively are two stiffest foundations and the mfb3 has the smallest displacement in dry sand the initial displacement of all hybrid foundation account for 80 90 of the final displacement and the following reloading displacements increase slowly which indicates the larger stiffness of the hybrid foundation in dry sand in saturated sand the initial displacement of hybrid foundations account for around 60 90 of the final displacement but they are still much stiffer than the monopile foundation the amount of reduction of the displacements for hybrid foundations in loose sand is much higher than the dense sand which shows that the hybrid foundations would outperform the monopile more significantly in loose sand than in dense sand under cyclic load the secant stiffness and unloading stiffness of the foundation under cyclic load can verify the reloading and unloading characteristics of foundations in each cycle the definition of the secant stiffness kr and unloading stiffness ku are shown in fig 12 large secant stiffness indicates that the foundation is hard to displace and having stronger resistance large unloading stiffness of a foundation shows that the foundation is hard to return its original position when the load is released in other words the foundation has a more plastic characteristic under cyclic load under the approximately same magnitude lateral reloading from fig 11 it shows that the displacement growth of every reloading process of the monopile is much larger than that of other hybrid foundation therefore the hybrid foundations have much larger secant stiffness than the monopile foundation the relationships of secant stiffness of all hybrid foundations are very close to that of the displacements of hybrid foundations fig 13 presents the unloading stiffness of all tests and it shows that in dry dense sand the hybrid foundations have larger unloading stiffness than the monopile foundation and the mfb2 mfb3 and mf foundations have larger unloading stiffness while the mfb1 and mfb4 have slightly smaller unloading stiffness than the previous three models the results of dry dense sand show that the hybrid foundations surprisingly have more plastic behavior than the monopile foundation in the unloading process and the growth of the dimension of the hybrid structure correlated with the increase of their unloading stiffness in dry loose sand relationships of different models are pretty similar to that of the dry dense sand tests except that the overall level of the unloading stiffness is smaller than the dry dense sand tests and the unloading stiffness of mfb4 foundation decrease comparing to the dry dense sand in saturated sand the difference of unloading stiffness between different models is relatively small than the dry sand tests while mfb2 and mfb3 still have larger unloading stiffness than other models the results indicate that the hybrid foundations with larger substructure size h b d b actually shows more plastic characteristics than monopile or smaller hybrid foundation however in saturated sand the gap of unloading stiffness between hybrid models and monopile is smaller than that in dry sand which shows that the hybrid foundations are more suitable for saturated and especially loose sand under cyclic load from the results of the centrifuge tests the performance of hybrid foundations is improved by a big margin compared with the monopile foundation under monotonic and cyclic load the addition of the bucket and friction wheel components expand the volume of the body of soil wedge in both horizontal and vertical direction the dead load of the gravel in the friction wheel increases the resistance of soil around the monopile and bucket indirectly the mechanism of the structure and soil interaction will be discussed in following sections in detail 4 reaction forces of surrounding soil of hybrid foundation the hybrid foundation consists of three parts monopile bucket and friction wheel each section contributes to the total bearing capacity of the foundation the soil structure interaction of all three individual components was investigated by many scholars in the past due to the integration of multiple components the behavior of each section is changed by the interaction among these components the friction wheel is filled with gravel which provides heavy surcharge on the soil beneath the friction wheel the surcharge leads to an increase in the effective stress of the soil inside the bucket subsequently the passive and active soil pressure on the monopile and bucket will be greater additionally the displacement and rotation of the head of the monopile are constrained to a certain degree by the bucket component based on previous researches the soil interaction of each individual component is analyzed and the calculation methods of the lateral bearing capacity are also proposed in the following three sections 4 1 monopile the interactions between soil and laterally loaded piles are typically interpreted by the p y curves originally introduced by reese 1956 and mcclelland 1956 the p y curves adopt the winkler approach that the soil is discretized into limited numbers of independent layers having a different nonlinear resistance displacement relationship and soil property a p y curve defines the relationship between the soil resistance p and the lateral pile displacement y at any point along the pile a series of important full size field tests were conducted and the results are summarized to form the p y curves which were adopted into standards for the oil and gas industry api 1993 the p y curves in each various depth of soil can be calculated by following the equations a numerical method is required to solve the fourth order differential equation for beam bending with appropriate boundary conditions then displacement bending moment and shearing force curve along the pile can be derived the lateral bearing capacity under criteria in terms of

32 for all soil conditions n h 1800 18000 kn m3 and we can get t 11 3 7 12 m and l 2t so the pile in the test is a stiff pile according to poulos and hull 1989 the transition from flexible to rigid pile behavior may be evaluated by 9 4 8 e s l 4 e p i p 388 6 where e s is the elastic modulus of soil for the toyoura sand used in the test the elastic modulus is around 40mpa we can get a value of 5 which is close to 4 8 so it can be considered to be a rigid pile by the criteria the behavior of a rigid pile under lateral load and moment would develop a toe kick rotation at a pivot point several theoretical methods have been published predicting the behavior of short rigid piles under lateral loads in cohesionless soil hansen 1961 broms 1964 meyerhof et al 1981 petrasovits and awad 1972 and these methods presume that the soil pressure along the diameter is uniform a series of 1 g model tests were conducted prasad and chari 1999 by attaching pressure transducers along the pile length and suggested a modified soil pressure distribution along the length and width of the pile based on the test results the variation of the lateral pressure can be idealized as shown in fig 14 the lateral soil pressure increases from zero at the ground surface to peak value p 0 6x at the depth of 0 6x linearly then the soil pressure decreases linearly to zero at x the depth of rotation point the lateral soil pressure increases linearly from zero at the pivot point to 1 7p 0 6x at the pile tip yang et al 2018 also developed a similar contour of passive pressure along the pile length by fe methods which is slightly different from prasad and chari 1999 on the location of maximum pressure point above the pivot point the soil pressure reaches a peak at about 0 5x depth many previous methods were based on the lateral pressure of a rigid retaining wall however since the soil pressure along the projected diameter of the pile is not uniform and it reduces from the maximum value to zero from the center to the sides nonlinearly the bearing capacity of a pile is smaller than retaining wall with the same width therefore a shape factor s was multiplied into the expression of the bearing capacity by measuring the soil pressure on the different directions along the forward moving half circumference the average pressure is 0 80 times the peak measured values in the center prasad and chari 1999 the maximum pressure at the 0 6x depth is derived as follows 10 p 0 6 x s k p γ 0 6 x 11 k p t a n 2 45 φ 2 where x is the depth of pivot point and k p is the rankine s passive earth pressure s is the shape factor and φ is the internal friction angle of soil the depth of the pivot point is expressed as 12 x 0 57 l 2 70 e 5 31 l 2 7 29 e 2 10 54 e l 0 5 2 20 where l is the embedded length of the pile from the equilibrium of the pile the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of a rigid pile h u can be described as 13 h u 0 5 p 0 6 x d 2 7 x 1 7 l where d is the diameter of the pile the method was applied to calculate different models and full scale piles tested by some researchers before the results are compared with each other and it can be seen that the method can predict the soil pressure pretty accurately so this method will be utilized in our calculation of bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation system due to the distributed vertical load from the friction wheel acted on the surrounding soil the lateral earth pressure profile is different for the hybrid foundation boussinesq published a mathematical solution for determining the normal and shear stresses at any point inside homogeneous elastic and isotropic mediums due to a concentrated point load located at the surface das 2015 following the solution the stress increase of an arbitrary point under a circularly loaded area was calculated ahlvin and ulery 1962 for the monopile friction wheel mf foundation the distribution of vertical stress increases due to a circularly loaded ring area outer diameter is the diameter of the friction wheel and inner diameter is the diameter of the monopile is calculated along the length of the pile with an interval of 0 1l to simplify the calculation the variation of vertical stress increase shown as dash lines are fitted to a linear process of variation shown by the straight lines for example fig 15 a shows that for mf foundation the increase of vertical stress is q at mudline and decreases to 0 620q at the depth of 0 1l and then further decreases to 0 148q at the tip of the pile for the mfb foundation the lateral displacement of the soil inside the bucket is restricted by the bucket wall hence the increase of vertical stress inside the bucket is q constantly throughout the depth of the bucket for the rest part of the monopile under the depth of the bucket the increase of vertical stress follows a similar pattern of mf foundation the distributions for mfb foundations are also shown in fig 15 and the equation of ultimate horizontal bearing capacity is expressed as 14 h u p 0 8 d 0 21 k q γ x 2 0 51 k q γ l x r q a s where h up is the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile part a s is the area of the lateral stress due to the distributed load of the surcharge which is presented as shaded part in fig 16 and as equals to the area of increase of vertical stress due to the surcharge load q shown in fig 15 multiplied by k p and r q is the reduction factor and it s considered 0 8 in the calculation when the foundation is under lateral load the friction wheel would rotate and the contact of the bucket lid with the soil can change with the rotation the contacting area could be half of the area of the lid and the contacting pressure increases from 0 to the maximum value linearly from the pile to the edge of the friction wheel stone et al 2007 the increase of vertical stress due to the surcharge load is reduced by the rotation therefore a reduction factor needs to be introduced 4 2 bucket foundation according to lian et al 2011 the sliding force of a bucket foundation includes horizontal load resulting from the upper structure and the active earth pressure and the anti sliding force includes the passive earth pressure and the friction resistance between the foundation bottom and subsoil which is shown in fig 17 therefore the horizontal bearing capacity of bucket foundation can be calculated as follows 15 q h e p r h e a 16 e p 1 2 γ h 2 k p 2 c h k p 2 r 17 e a 1 2 γ h 2 k p 2 c h k p 2 r 18 r h a b τ f h a b v p f a b t a n φ c where p f is the total skin friction resistance and v is the total vertical load above the foundation bottom and γ is the submerged unit weight of subsoil and h is the height of bucket and a b is the effective contacting area the failure mechanism of bucket foundation and the soil bucket interaction is highly related to the 3d geometry a series of fe analyses of bucket foundation in clay was conducted by kim 2012 a group of bucket foundations with different h d ratios shows different tendencies of sliding and rotation a pure sliding behavior was occurred at h d 0 whereas a sliding behavior with minimal rotation was observed at h d 0 25 at h d 0 5 the rotational behavior becomes significant therefore the failure mechanism of bucket foundation under horizontal load changed from a purely horizontal sliding to a combination of horizontal and rotational translation with an increasing h d ratio it was mentioned that the distribution shape of the lateral soil resistance in kim s study was similar to that obtained by prasad and chari 1999 for a short pile in cohesionless soil in a 1 g lateral loading test series zhu et al 2011 conducted before the rotation center of the bucket was found to be 0 8h in depth and right under the centerline of the bucket lid the position of the rotation center of the bucket foundation is also altering in the process of the movement zhu et al 2012 and it is found to be moving from below the bucket to inside the bucket at failure in the method proposed by wang et al 2017a the rotation center is also set to be 0 8h to predict the lateral bearing capacity of the bucket foundation so the rotation center in this calculation method is also adopted as 0 8h when the body ratio h d is large and the diameter is small the soil inside the bucket would be carried with the bucket and there is no significant force acted by soil body inside which is the case in fig 17 however when the body ratio is relatively smaller and the diameter is wider the soil body inside the bucket tends to attach to the underneath soil body instead of being sheared away with the bucket so there will be passive and active pressure inside the bucket wall and the friction develops between the top inside surface and soil accordingly due to the surcharge of the friction wheel and the gravel the effective stress increases and correspondingly the passive pressure would outgrow the active pressure which leads to greater overall lateral resistance similar to the rigid pile the stress distribution across the diameter is also not uniform and a reduction factor ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 is multiplied to average the inconsistency wang et al 2017a the equilibrium of the wide shallow bucket is shown in fig 18 and the expressions of passive and active force in sand are as follows 19 e p i u r d 1 2 q z 0 γ z 0 2 k p 20 e p o u r d 1 2 γ z 0 2 k p 21 e a i u r d 1 2 q z 0 γ z 0 2 k a 22 e a o u r d 1 2 γ z 0 2 k a 23 e p i d r d 1 2 2 q h z 0 γ h 2 z 0 2 k p 24 e p o d r d 1 2 γ h 2 z 0 2 k p 25 e a i d r d 1 2 2 q γ z 0 k p 26 e a o d r d 1 2 γ z 0 h z 0 k a 27 h u b e p o u e p i u e a o d e a i d e a i u e a o u e p i d e p o d where e xxx is the earth pressure acted on the bucket skirt and in the subscription a and p stand for active and passive pressure i and o stand for earth pressure inside and outside the bucket and u and d stand for earth pressure above and under the rotation point and h ub is the ultimate bearing capacity of the bucket part z 0 is the depth of the rotation point r is the reduction factor due to the curved surface of the bucket and it equals to 0 65 in the following calculation liu et al 1993 q is the distributed load produced by the weight of the structure and gravel 4 3 the friction wheel the friction wheel and bucket components are integrated as one part and are decoupled with the monopile after the installation of friction wheel and bucket components gravel is added into the friction wheel the surcharge of gravel would exert a distributed load q on the soil beneath the friction wheel as a result the lateral bearing capacity of monopile and bucket would increase indirectly due to the increase of confining pressure around the pile and inside the bucket and considerable friction force between the bucket lid and soil could be produced directly from the dead load inside the friction wheel to determine the lateral friction force of friction wheel bottom plate or bucket lid it is important to determine the vertical supporting force acted on the lid first by using the equilibrium of bucket and friction wheel on vertical direction the supporting force on the middle plate between friction wheel and bucket are calculated by 28 p s v f b p f p e where p s is the supporting force on friction wheel bottom or bucket lid and v f b is the weight of friction wheel and bucket component and p f is the total skin friction resistance of bucket and p e is the end resistance of bucket wall edge the aspect ratio h d of bucket component in this research is less than 1 and the diameter of the bucket is relatively large for piles and caissons with a large h d aspect ratio the soil inside the structure is considered trapped and has no relative movement with the structure wang et al 2019b so the calculation of tip resistance adopts the terzaghi s failure mode and the tip resistance contributes considerably to the total resistance for the case of bucket component with small h d aspect ratio in this research the soil inside the bucket is not moving with the pile synchronously the tip resistance from the perimeter of bucket wall is pretty small and could be ignored a series of field tests and model tests of suction caisson was conducted by houlsby et al 2005 focusing on the installation and design of suction bucket for offshore wind turbines the vertical load displacement response of pushing the suction bucket with different aspect ratios into the soil were presented it was clear that the penetration of bucket follows a three phase pattern the first phase is that when the bucket wall penetrating the soil the resistance increases linearly in a slow rate following the second phase as soon as the lid of bucket touches the soil the resistance increases rapidly with further compaction of the subsoil the bucket yields with the increasing vertical load the results show that the vertical capacity comes from the skin friction and the supporting force of bucket lid and the end resistance of the bucket wall can be ignored so the calculation of vertical capacity is expressed as 29 p s v f b p f and the friction resistance p f may be calculated as 30 p f 0 l p f d z π d k 1 s i n φ 0 l σ 0 t a n δ d z where p is bucket perimeter and f is the unit frictional resistance and it equals to kσ 0 tanδ and k is the earth pressure coefficient for steel material 1 26k 0 1 26 1 sin φ and σ 0 is the effective vertical stress at any depth z for single layer soil condition p f can be expressed as 31 p f 1 26 π d 1 s i n φ 1 2 h 2 γ tan δ the value of σ 0 will increase to a depth of about 15d and will remain constant thereafter which is similar to pile and shaft the values of soil bucket friction angle δ from various investigations appear to be in the range from 0 5 φ to 0 8 φ das 2015 in this case we choose 0 7 φ for loose sand and 0 8 φ for dense sand so with the known vertical load v f b and friction resistance the ultimate lateral resistance h f can be expressed as 32 h u f p s t a n δ a b v f b p f a b t a n δ c 4 4 simplified method for calculation of hybrid mfb owt foundation the equations of calculating the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of monopile h up friction wheel h uf and bucket foundation h ub are derived in the previous sections although the interaction between three components and between structures and soil is not clear it s still plausible to estimate the bearing capacity of the whole system by simply adding h up h uf and h ub together h up can be calculated by equation 14 h uf can be calculated by equation 19 27 h ub can be derived from equation 29 32 with the parameters of soil the dimensions and weight of structures and gravel the overall lateral bearing capacity of mf foundations are the summation of h up h uf and the bearing capacity of mfb foundations are the summation of h up h ub and h uf 33 h u m f b r h h u p h u b h u f where the r h is the reduction factor the bearing capacity of every foundation model utilizing the proposed simplified add up method in all soil conditions as well as the bearing capacity from centrifuge tests are listed in table 4 from table 4 the bearing capacity of the monopile in dry loose sand saturated dense and loose sand from the centrifuge tests are larger than the results of proposed methods for mf and mfb foundations the bearing capacity of the centrifuge test is smaller than the results of the proposed method for most comparisons the errors of mfb foundations are approximately 10 40 the error of 0 4 1 8 and 19 5 deviate from the data group so they are considered outliers the possible explanation of the reduction is that the overall bearing capacity is slightly compromised by the combination of three components therefore a reduction factor r h from 0 52 0 68 can be multiplied into the summation of h up h uf and h ub to get a more accurate prediction of hybrid foundation more specifically in this study for the mfb model with bucket diameter larger than 5 m the reduction factor is 0 52 0 56 for loose sand and 0 56 0 68 for dense sand respectively 5 conclusion in this paper a novel concept of foundation structure for offshore wind turbine is proposed of which a friction wheel bucket integrated component is added on a monopile the intention is that gravel can be filled into the friction wheel to provide a surcharge load on the subsoil increasing the passive and active earth pressure on the bucket and monopile components as well as friction force from the bucket lid and the bucket component can also help enlarge the lateral bearing capacity centrifuge tests are carried out on four models of monopile friction wheel bucket mfb foundation with different aspect ratios one model of monopile friction wheel mf foundation and one model of monopile foundation both monotonic and cyclic load were performed on foundation models in dry or saturated dense or loose sand to compare their behavior for each condition a simplified method to calculate the ultimate lateral bearing capacity is also proposed in this paper following conclusions can be drawn from this study in the monotonic load tests the ultimate bearing capacity of the hybrid foundations outperformed the monopile foundation by 100 300 the increase of diameter and depth of the bucket and the diameter of the friction wheel correlating with the area of the surcharge load could lead to the growth of the lateral bearing capacity the largest ultimate lateral bearing capacity of different soil conditions all comes from the mfb2 model d b 5 m h b 2 which has the deepest bucket component in the cyclic load tests the final displacement of the hybrid mfb foundation is about 50 of that of monopile in dense sand and less than 30 in saturated loose sand the secant stiffness of monopile is much higher than the mfb hybrid foundations but the unloading stiffness of mfb foundations is higher than the monopile in dry sand and slightly higher in saturated sand the enhancement of the performance of the hybrid foundation in loose sand is much more significant compared with dense sand and the saturated loose sand is the extremist case erecting mfb hybrid foundation in saturated loose sand could outperform the monopile foundation by a big margin and achieve maximum value of the investment a simplified calculation method for the mfb hybrid foundation was proposed and the surrounding soil resistance of different components was analyzed using the centrifuge test results as a reference the summation of the bearing capacity of three components multiplied by a reduction factor from 0 52 0 68 could be a conservative prediction of the ultimate bearing capacity of the proposed hybrid foundation and the reduction factor for dense sand is slightly larger than the loose sand credit authorship contribution statement xinyao li data curation writing original draft xiangwu zeng conceptualization writing review

21914,in this study a hybrid monopile friction wheel bucket mfb foundation for offshore wind turbines is proposed a bucket and a friction wheel are integrated with a monopile the friction wheel is filled with scattered material to provide distributed surcharge loads to the subsoil a series of geotechnical centrifuge tests was performed under monotonic load and cyclic load to investigate the bearing capacity of the mfb foundation five hybrid foundations with variable dimensions were tested in four types of sandy soil conditions the centrifuge test results show that the ultimate bearing capacity of the hybrid mfb foundation could be 4 times of the monopile foundation under cyclic load the final displacement of mfb foundation is significantly smaller than that of the monopile foundation the mfb foundation is stiffer in the reloading process but shows slightly more plastic characteristic in the unloading process the size of the add on friction wheel bucket structure is positively related to the performance of the mfb foundation the bucket height tends to be a more effective factor it is illustrated that the mfb foundation tends to demonstrates more improvements in the saturated loose sand a simplified method is proposed to predict the bearing capacity of the hybrid mfb foundation keywords bucket foundation centrifuge tests cyclic load friction wheel hybrid owt foundation lateral bearing capacity monopile monotonic load 1 introduction mother nature creates a bonanza of offshore wind blowing strongly and consistently along the coast of continents harvesting energy from offshore wind alone can make a huge contribution to meet the entire world s need for energy consumption as an energy source with huge potential a number of successful offshore wind farms having hundreds of megawatts capacity have been producing electricity along many countries coastline and many bigger projects are under construction li and yu 2017 2018 sun et al 2012 the development of offshore wind energy is currently at full throttle worldwide erecting an offshore wind turbine owt up to 35 of total investment is spent on foundation work byrne and houlsby 2003 the main challenge is to develop a stable foundation structure in the harsh marine environment while maintaining relatively low cost gao et al 2015 among many existing solutions the most widely used type of owt foundation is monopile as of march 2018 around 71 of owts are supported by monopile foundation monopiles are manufactured as hollow cylindrical steel tubular with wall thickness ranging from 55 mm to 150 mm hu 2015 most monopiles are driven into the seabed by large impact hydraulic hammers while some are installed into pre drilled the future design of monopile is likely to have a diameter up to 10 m and a weight heavier than 1000 ton li et al 2019 for these large diameter stiff monopile with high diameter length ratio the traditional p y curve method lada et al 2014 which is typically used for slender piles in oil and gas industry is no longer appropriate chen et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 numerical modellings and field tests are conducted to develop a new design method for large diameter monopiles however limited capacity of crane and impact hammer on the installation vessel as well as the increasing material cost are the major challenge of utilizing larger diameter stiff monopile the bucket foundation has been used in several experimental projects in europe and china and is very promising to become another popular owt foundation bucket foundation was used in the offshore oil and gas platform that was placed under the legs of the jacket baerheim et al 1995 a prototype of bucket foundation for offshore wind was installed in frederikshavn denmark in 2002 ibsen and brincker 2004 another prototype of a large scale composite bucket foundation proposed by tianjin university was installed in qidong jiangsu china in 2010 zhang et al 2014 the suction installation process makes very little noise which is good for marine creatures the performance of bucket foundation under lateral cyclic load and seismic load was investigated through 1 g model tests centrifuge tests and fe analysis ding et al 2015 fu et al 2017 kim 2012 lian et al 2011 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017a c researchers have studied the characteristics of the process of installation and transportation of bucket foundation ding et al 2011 guo et al 2012 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2004 2014 2016a 2016b efforts were also made to improve the performance of bucket foundation by adding compartments inside the bucket and optimizing the configuration of the bucket wall lian et al 2012 wang et al 2017b xiao et al 2019 some concepts of hybrid foundation combining monopile with other integrated components have been proposed an additional friction wheel on a monopile foundation can enhance the bearing capacity of the traditional monopile foundation and the increment could be up to 2 times wang et al 2018a 2018b a 1 g model test shows the lateral bearing capacity and initial stiffness are enhanced by adding a footing or skirt to the monopile and the improvement depends on the size of the footing and the soil condition stone et al 2007 an fe analysis of a hybrid monopile footing foundation was conducted to investigate the foundation performance under the environmental and seismic loading anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 a series of centrifuge and fe tests were conducted to investigate the optimized footing aspect ratio v h m load relationships structure soil interaction mechanism and the influence of soil properties el marassi 2011 li et al 2020 pedram 2015 2 the concept of hybrid owt foundation the concept of hybrid foundation proposed in this paper is a combination of monopile with friction wheel and bucket foundation the scheme of the structure is shown in fig 1 the friction wheel and bucket have the same diameter d f d b and these two parts are welded together as an integrated component the height of the friction wheel and bucket are h f and h b respectively the embedded length of the pile is l and it has a diameter of d p the friction wheel is filled with gravel or stone to apply vertical load on the bucket lid the connection between the friction wheel bucket part and the monopile is a tight fit in the horizontal direction while there is no displacement restriction in the vertical direction vertical relative movement is allowed under external load the resisting moment created by the friction wheel and the bucket can transfer load to the monopile and tower the depth of the bucket is relatively shallow compared to the traditional bucket foundation the installation method of the hybrid foundation is very important for its practicality it was suggested that for a monopile footing hybrid foundation the plate can be placed first as a guide for the monopile pedram 2015 stone et al 2007 for another hybrid model the inner circle of the footing can be made as a conical shape so that the monopile will be self locked while penetration anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 the process of installation of the proposed hybrid foundation is presented in fig 2 during the installation the bucket foundation can be compressed into the seabed initially by its self weight secondly the water inside is pumped out and the suction force assists the full penetration of the bucket finally the monopile is hammered into the seabed using the friction wheel and bucket part as a guide to locate the monopile in the seawater in motion the upper part of the inner circle of the friction wheel can be made as a conical shaped feature for a bucket cassion foundation in some cases rocks and stones buried in the soil layers would block the installation of the bucket and the pressure difference is not large enough to break through the obstacles thus the installation site is forced to be adjusted this problem will significantly slow down the installation process and increase the period of usage of special vessels therefore the bucket part of this concept is designed to be relatively shallow to reduce the risk of being blocked 3 centrifuge tests the tests were performed on the geotechnical centrifuge in the department of civil engineering of case western reserve university foundation models are tested under 50 g gravity field in this study there are 6 models tested including a monopile a monopile friction wheel foundation denoted as mf foundation and four monopile friction wheel bucket foundations with different aspect ratios denoted as mfb foundation the geometry parameters and weight of all 5 hybrid models are shown in table 1 all values in the paper are on a prototype scale the embedded length of the monopile l is 6 m the diameter of the pile d p is 1 1 m and the height of the owt tower is 14 m fig 3 shows the models tested in this program the nacelle of the turbine is simplified by a solid aluminum cube fixed on the top of the tower to simulate the weight of the upper structure the total weight of the upper structure is 38 25 tons in order to evaluate the performance of the models the uniform load on the lid of the bucket structure is set to be the same for different models this makes the depth of gravel filled in the friction wheel the same for different models the diameter of the friction wheel is the same as the bucket eventually the diameter and the depth of the container are determined by the above two reasons which determines the weight of the gravel in the tests the sand used in this test is standard toyoura sand with a mean particle size of 0 17 mm specific gravity of 2 65 and void ratios of 0 65 and 0 88 respectively for the dense and loose sand four soil conditions were prepared as loose saturated sand dense saturated sand loose dry sand and dense dry sand the relative density is 26 for loose sand and 87 for dense sand the soil sample were prepared by air pluviation method dry sand was poured into the test container with constant heights and additional compaction was required to prepare for the desired relative density de aired water flowed in from the bottom slowly and a vacuum was set for at least 24 h for saturation the effective unit weight was 13 81 and 8 61 kn m3 for dry and saturated loose sand 15 79 and 9 81 kn m3 for dry and saturated dense sand the internal friction angles for loose sand and dense sand are 32 5 and 36 respectively the foundation models were pushed into the soil before the test in order to maintain the absolute vertical installation of the foundation models a clip was used to guide the push of the monopile the friction wheel and bucket component were installed following the position of the monopile the installation process in the experiments is similar to the in situ process which could densify the surrounding soil all six of the models were tested by a monotonic load and a cyclic lateral load the monotonically increasing linear lateral load from 0 to 1 55 mn was acted horizontally above the ground line at a height of e 3 25 m on the tower and two lateral lvdts record the lateral displacement at two different heights 3 25 m and 5 75 m which is presented in fig 4 the rotation angle of the structure can be derived from the displacement of two points on the tower using a simple geometric calculation which is presented in fig 5 d 1 and d 2 denote the displacement recorded by the lvdt1 and lvdt2 respectively two triangles oaa1 and obb1 are two similar triangles so the length of ab can be used to calculate the rotation angle θ 1 θ t a n 1 d 2 d 1 a b to describe the characteristics of the cyclic load two parameters were defined by leblanc et al 2010 in terms of the load of moment and they can be modified to define the load of lateral force in this case 2 ζ b f m a x f r ζ c f m i n f m a x where f max and f min are the maximum and minimum force of the load cycle and the f r is the static bearing capacity of lateral load in the test series the cyclic load is a one way load with f max 445 kn and f min 0 and repeats 10 cycles in 110 s if we use the calculated lateral bearing capacity of monopile in dense dry sand as the f r to normalize the f max we can have the two parameters ζ b 0 93 and ζ c 0 the eccentricity of the cyclic load is also e 3 25 m the lvdt located at the same level as the actuator monitors the pile head displacement the monotonic load and cyclic load are presented in fig 6 to compare the performance of hybrid foundation models it is more convenient to use a uniform load in all soil conditions according to the test results from the monotonic load the bearing capacity of the monopile in different soil conditions ranges from 262 kn to 432 kn and the bearing capacity of the mfb2 hybrid foundation is from 882 kn to 1775 kn if the magnitude of the cyclic load is too large the monopile will fail directly and show no elastic behavior 445 kn is approximately the same as the bearing capacity of the monopile in dry dense sand and is about the same as the bearing capacity of the mfb2 hybrid foundation in saturated loose sand in this way all the models can show both of their elastic and plastic behavior to some extent 3 1 monotonic load tests the bearing capacity is often defined as the transition point where the load displacement curve reaches a platform or the intersection point of two fitted lines of the initial and final phase of the curve however in this set of tests it s hard to define a point by the above criterion therefore the rotation angle criterion θ 5 is used to define the ultimate capacity the rotation limits for owt is 5 for the ultimate limit state uls and less than 1 for the serviceability limit state sls dnv 2014 doherty and gavin 2011 for curves that cannot reach 5 a short line fitted to the final tendency of the curve intersect with the 5 dash line and the point of intersection is defined as the ultimate lateral bearing capacity from fig 7 we can see that for dry and saturated sand the lateral bearing capacity of foundations in dense sand is larger than that in the loose sand the bearing capacity in dry sand is larger than that in the saturated sand the bearing capacity of hybrid foundations is larger than the monopile foundation within the hybrid foundations all mfb foundations provide more lateral resistance than the mf foundation among the mfb foundations the mfb4 model with the smallest diameter of 3 81 m has the smallest bearing capacity but is very close to the mfb2 and mfb3 the load rotation curves of mfb1 and mfb3 with a diameter of 5 m and 6 35 m coincided with each other and the mfb3 has a slightly larger capacity than mfb1 except in dry dense sand in terms of soil condition the ultimate lateral bearing capacities for all models are the highest in dry dense soil and are the lowest in saturated loose sand for mfb1 mfb2 and mfb3 model the ultimate bearing capacity in saturated dense sand is slightly larger than that in dry loose sand but the situation is the opposite for mf and mfb4 model the ultimate bearing capacity in saturated dense sand is slightly smaller than that in dry loose sand the ultimate bearing capacities for all models and soil conditions are listed in table 2 foundation model mf mfb1 and mfb2 have the same bucket diameter of 5 m but different bucket heights 0 m 1 m and 2 m respectively model mfb4 mfb1 and mfb3 have the same bucket height of 1 m but different bucket diameters of 3 81 m 5 m and 6 35 m respectively height ratio η h is the ratio of bucket height h b to the embedded length of the pile l and diameter ratio η d is the ratio of bucket diameter d b to the pile diameter d p fig 8 shows the relationship of ultimate bearing capacity with height ratio h b l and diameter ratio d b d p from fig 8 a we can see that in all soil conditions with the same bucket diameter the ultimate bearing capacity increases almost linearly with the increase of height ratio in dry dense sand the mfb2 model with a height ratio of 0 33 gained significant growth in ultimate bearing capacity fig 8 b shows that in all soil condition with the same height of bucket the ultimate bearing capacity increase with the increase of diameter ratio except the case in dry loose sand if all the foundation structures were fabricated by steel sheets with the same thickness the amount of raw material used in model mfb2 is 29 3 more than the mfb1 model while the amount of material used in model mfb3 is 36 3 more than the mfb1 model however the increase of the ultimate bearing capacity of mfb2 is much larger than that of mfb3 which were both compared with mfb1 hence the increase of bucket depth is better than the increase of bucket diameter in terms of cost and performance 3 2 cyclic load tests since the cyclic load was acted on the foundation model by an actuator the output of the actuator is not precisely the same as what we expected from the input signal all the output of the actuator in dry dense sand series are presented in fig 9 from the figure we can see that although there are a couple of peaks stand out the average maximum and minimum values of the cyclic load of each type of foundation are around 445 kn and 0 kn which make sure that the load was pretty accurate fig 10 shows the lateral load displacement curves of monopile and mfb2 foundation in dry dense sand the pile head displaced significantly in the initial cycle and following reloading displacements increased in a decreasing rate which shows that the reloading stiffness of the foundations increased with the number of cycles the final displacement of 6 types of foundations in 4 soil conditions is listed in table 3 the lateral displacement time curves of all cyclic tests are presented in fig 11 the reloading displacements of each cycle are peaks in the solid line curves and all peaks are connected by the dashed line to help illustrate the growth rate of the reloading displacements it shows that in all cases the displacements of monopile foundation exceed all hybrid foundations and the difference between them keeps growing with the increase of the number of cycles the mf foundation has the largest displacement among all hybrid foundations within 4 mfb foundations the mfb4 mfb1 and mfb3 foundations with the same h b 1 m h f 1 m but different bucket diameters d b 3 81 m 5 m and 6 35 m have the displacement in the order of mfb4 mfb1 mfb3 which means that the increase of the bucket diameter help increase the resistance under cyclic load for foundation mfb1 and mfb2 with the same bucket diameter of d b 5 m but different bucket depth h b 1 m and 2 m respectively the displacement of mfb2 is smaller than mfb1 and it indicates that the structure could benefit from the increase of the bucket depth under cyclic load among all the foundations mfb2 and mfb3 with the largest bucket depth and largest bucket diameter respectively are two stiffest foundations and the mfb3 has the smallest displacement in dry sand the initial displacement of all hybrid foundation account for 80 90 of the final displacement and the following reloading displacements increase slowly which indicates the larger stiffness of the hybrid foundation in dry sand in saturated sand the initial displacement of hybrid foundations account for around 60 90 of the final displacement but they are still much stiffer than the monopile foundation the amount of reduction of the displacements for hybrid foundations in loose sand is much higher than the dense sand which shows that the hybrid foundations would outperform the monopile more significantly in loose sand than in dense sand under cyclic load the secant stiffness and unloading stiffness of the foundation under cyclic load can verify the reloading and unloading characteristics of foundations in each cycle the definition of the secant stiffness kr and unloading stiffness ku are shown in fig 12 large secant stiffness indicates that the foundation is hard to displace and having stronger resistance large unloading stiffness of a foundation shows that the foundation is hard to return its original position when the load is released in other words the foundation has a more plastic characteristic under cyclic load under the approximately same magnitude lateral reloading from fig 11 it shows that the displacement growth of every reloading process of the monopile is much larger than that of other hybrid foundation therefore the hybrid foundations have much larger secant stiffness than the monopile foundation the relationships of secant stiffness of all hybrid foundations are very close to that of the displacements of hybrid foundations fig 13 presents the unloading stiffness of all tests and it shows that in dry dense sand the hybrid foundations have larger unloading stiffness than the monopile foundation and the mfb2 mfb3 and mf foundations have larger unloading stiffness while the mfb1 and mfb4 have slightly smaller unloading stiffness than the previous three models the results of dry dense sand show that the hybrid foundations surprisingly have more plastic behavior than the monopile foundation in the unloading process and the growth of the dimension of the hybrid structure correlated with the increase of their unloading stiffness in dry loose sand relationships of different models are pretty similar to that of the dry dense sand tests except that the overall level of the unloading stiffness is smaller than the dry dense sand tests and the unloading stiffness of mfb4 foundation decrease comparing to the dry dense sand in saturated sand the difference of unloading stiffness between different models is relatively small than the dry sand tests while mfb2 and mfb3 still have larger unloading stiffness than other models the results indicate that the hybrid foundations with larger substructure size h b d b actually shows more plastic characteristics than monopile or smaller hybrid foundation however in saturated sand the gap of unloading stiffness between hybrid models and monopile is smaller than that in dry sand which shows that the hybrid foundations are more suitable for saturated and especially loose sand under cyclic load from the results of the centrifuge tests the performance of hybrid foundations is improved by a big margin compared with the monopile foundation under monotonic and cyclic load the addition of the bucket and friction wheel components expand the volume of the body of soil wedge in both horizontal and vertical direction the dead load of the gravel in the friction wheel increases the resistance of soil around the monopile and bucket indirectly the mechanism of the structure and soil interaction will be discussed in following sections in detail 4 reaction forces of surrounding soil of hybrid foundation the hybrid foundation consists of three parts monopile bucket and friction wheel each section contributes to the total bearing capacity of the foundation the soil structure interaction of all three individual components was investigated by many scholars in the past due to the integration of multiple components the behavior of each section is changed by the interaction among these components the friction wheel is filled with gravel which provides heavy surcharge on the soil beneath the friction wheel the surcharge leads to an increase in the effective stress of the soil inside the bucket subsequently the passive and active soil pressure on the monopile and bucket will be greater additionally the displacement and rotation of the head of the monopile are constrained to a certain degree by the bucket component based on previous researches the soil interaction of each individual component is analyzed and the calculation methods of the lateral bearing capacity are also proposed in the following three sections 4 1 monopile the interactions between soil and laterally loaded piles are typically interpreted by the p y curves originally introduced by reese 1956 and mcclelland 1956 the p y curves adopt the winkler approach that the soil is discretized into limited numbers of independent layers having a different nonlinear resistance displacement relationship and soil property a p y curve defines the relationship between the soil resistance p and the lateral pile displacement y at any point along the pile a series of important full size field tests were conducted and the results are summarized to form the p y curves which were adopted into standards for the oil and gas industry api 1993 the p y curves in each various depth of soil can be calculated by following the equations a numerical method is required to solve the fourth order differential equation for beam bending with appropriate boundary conditions then displacement bending moment and shearing force curve along the pile can be derived the lateral bearing capacity under criteria in terms of pile head displacement or rotation angle can be found 3 p u s c 1 h c 2 d γ h 4 p u d c 3 d γ h 5 p u m i n p u s p u d 6 p a p u t a n h k x a p u y 7 e p i p d 4 y d z 4 p y 0 z 0 l e n g t h o f p i l e where p us is the ultimate resistance force unit length in lbs in kn m s shallow d deep γ is the effective soil weight in lb in 3 kn m 3 h is the depth in in m φ is the angle of internal friction of sand in deg c 1 c 2 c 3 are the coefficients determined from empirical curves as a function of φ d is the average pile diameter from surface to the bottom in in m a is the factor to account for cyclic or static loading condition k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction in lb in 3 kn m 3 and e p i p are the elastic modulus and moment of inertia of the pile the conventional p y curve method was developed for long slender pile and a 1d manner along the pile but the monopile used in the offshore wind power industry has a significantly larger diameter and d l ratio many are skeptical that the conventional p y curve method is no longer justified in the application of large diameter stiff piles the characteristic length of the soil pile system is calculated by 8 t e p i p n h 5 when l 5t the pile is considered to be a long pile for l 2t the pile is considered to be a rigid pile the pile used in the test is a solid aluminum pile e p 72000 mpa l 6 m d 1 1 m and i p πd 4 32 for all soil conditions n h 1800 18000 kn m3 and we can get t 11 3 7 12 m and l 2t so the pile in the test is a stiff pile according to poulos and hull 1989 the transition from flexible to rigid pile behavior may be evaluated by 9 4 8 e s l 4 e p i p 388 6 where e s is the elastic modulus of soil for the toyoura sand used in the test the elastic modulus is around 40mpa we can get a value of 5 which is close to 4 8 so it can be considered to be a rigid pile by the criteria the behavior of a rigid pile under lateral load and moment would develop a toe kick rotation at a pivot point several theoretical methods have been published predicting the behavior of short rigid piles under lateral loads in cohesionless soil hansen 1961 broms 1964 meyerhof et al 1981 petrasovits and awad 1972 and these methods presume that the soil pressure along the diameter is uniform a series of 1 g model tests were conducted prasad and chari 1999 by attaching pressure transducers along the pile length and suggested a modified soil pressure distribution along the length and width of the pile based on the test results the variation of the lateral pressure can be idealized as shown in fig 14 the lateral soil pressure increases from zero at the ground surface to peak value p 0 6x at the depth of 0 6x linearly then the soil pressure decreases linearly to zero at x the depth of rotation point the lateral soil pressure increases linearly from zero at the pivot point to 1 7p 0 6x at the pile tip yang et al 2018 also developed a similar contour of passive pressure along the pile length by fe methods which is slightly different from prasad and chari 1999 on the location of maximum pressure point above the pivot point the soil pressure reaches a peak at about 0 5x depth many previous methods were based on the lateral pressure of a rigid retaining wall however since the soil pressure along the projected diameter of the pile is not uniform and it reduces from the maximum value to zero from the center to the sides nonlinearly the bearing capacity of a pile is smaller than retaining wall with the same width therefore a shape factor s was multiplied into the expression of the bearing capacity by measuring the soil pressure on the different directions along the forward moving half circumference the average pressure is 0 80 times the peak measured values in the center prasad and chari 1999 the maximum pressure at the 0 6x depth is derived as follows 10 p 0 6 x s k p γ 0 6 x 11 k p t a n 2 45 φ 2 where x is the depth of pivot point and k p is the rankine s passive earth pressure s is the shape factor and φ is the internal friction angle of soil the depth of the pivot point is expressed as 12 x 0 57 l 2 70 e 5 31 l 2 7 29 e 2 10 54 e l 0 5 2 20 where l is the embedded length of the pile from the equilibrium of the pile the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of a rigid pile h u can be described as 13 h u 0 5 p 0 6 x d 2 7 x 1 7 l where d is the diameter of the pile the method was applied to calculate different models and full scale piles tested by some researchers before the results are compared with each other and it can be seen that the method can predict the soil pressure pretty accurately so this method will be utilized in our calculation of bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation system due to the distributed vertical load from the friction wheel acted on the surrounding soil the lateral earth pressure profile is different for the hybrid foundation boussinesq published a mathematical solution for determining the normal and shear stresses at any point inside homogeneous elastic and isotropic mediums due to a concentrated point load located at the surface das 2015 following the solution the stress increase of an arbitrary point under a circularly loaded area was calculated ahlvin and ulery 1962 for the monopile friction wheel mf foundation the distribution of vertical stress increases due to a circularly loaded ring area outer diameter is the diameter of the friction wheel and inner diameter is the diameter of the monopile is calculated along the length of the pile with an interval of 0 1l to simplify the calculation the variation of vertical stress increase shown as dash lines are fitted to a linear process of variation shown by the straight lines for example fig 15 a shows that for mf foundation the increase of vertical stress is q at mudline and decreases to 0 620q at the depth of 0 1l and then further decreases to 0 148q at the tip of the pile for the mfb foundation the lateral displacement of the soil inside the bucket is restricted by the bucket wall hence the increase of vertical stress inside the bucket is q constantly throughout the depth of the bucket for the rest part of the monopile under the depth of the bucket the increase of vertical stress follows a similar pattern of mf foundation the distributions for mfb foundations are also shown in fig 15 and the equation of ultimate horizontal bearing capacity is expressed as 14 h u p 0 8 d 0 21 k q γ x 2 0 51 k q γ l x r q a s where h up is the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile part a s is the area of the lateral stress due to the distributed load of the surcharge which is presented as shaded part in fig 16 and as equals to the area of increase of vertical stress due to the surcharge load q shown in fig 15 multiplied by k p and r q is the reduction factor and it s considered 0 8 in the calculation when the foundation is under lateral load the friction wheel would rotate and the contact of the bucket lid with the soil can change with the rotation the contacting area could be half of the area of the lid and the contacting pressure increases from 0 to the maximum value linearly from the pile to the edge of the friction wheel stone et al 2007 the increase of vertical stress due to the surcharge load is reduced by the rotation therefore a reduction factor needs to be introduced 4 2 bucket foundation according to lian et al 2011 the sliding force of a bucket foundation includes horizontal load resulting from the upper structure and the active earth pressure and the anti sliding force includes the passive earth pressure and the friction resistance between the foundation bottom and subsoil which is shown in fig 17 therefore the horizontal bearing capacity of bucket foundation can be calculated as follows 15 q h e p r h e a 16 e p 1 2 γ h 2 k p 2 c h k p 2 r 17 e a 1 2 γ h 2 k p 2 c h k p 2 r 18 r h a b τ f h a b v p f a b t a n φ c where p f is the total skin friction resistance and v is the total vertical load above the foundation bottom and γ is the submerged unit weight of subsoil and h is the height of bucket and a b is the effective contacting area the failure mechanism of bucket foundation and the soil bucket interaction is highly related to the 3d geometry a series of fe analyses of bucket foundation in clay was conducted by kim 2012 a group of bucket foundations with different h d ratios shows different tendencies of sliding and rotation a pure sliding behavior was occurred at h d 0 whereas a sliding behavior with minimal rotation was observed at h d 0 25 at h d 0 5 the rotational behavior becomes significant therefore the failure mechanism of bucket foundation under horizontal load changed from a purely horizontal sliding to a combination of horizontal and rotational translation with an increasing h d ratio it was mentioned that the distribution shape of the lateral soil resistance in kim s study was similar to that obtained by prasad and chari 1999 for a short pile in cohesionless soil in a 1 g lateral loading test series zhu et al 2011 conducted before the rotation center of the bucket was found to be 0 8h in depth and right under the centerline of the bucket lid the position of the rotation center of the bucket foundation is also altering in the process of the movement zhu et al 2012 and it is found to be moving from below the bucket to inside the bucket at failure in the method proposed by wang et al 2017a the rotation center is also set to be 0 8h to predict the lateral bearing capacity of the bucket foundation so the rotation center in this calculation method is also adopted as 0 8h when the body ratio h d is large and the diameter is small the soil inside the bucket would be carried with the bucket and there is no significant force acted by soil body inside which is the case in fig 17 however when the body ratio is relatively smaller and the diameter is wider the soil body inside the bucket tends to attach to the underneath soil body instead of being sheared away with the bucket so there will be passive and active pressure inside the bucket wall and the friction develops between the top inside surface and soil accordingly due to the surcharge of the friction wheel and the gravel the effective stress increases and correspondingly the passive pressure would outgrow the active pressure which leads to greater overall lateral resistance similar to the rigid pile the stress distribution across the diameter is also not uniform and a reduction factor ranging from 0 6 to 0 8 is multiplied to average the inconsistency wang et al 2017a the equilibrium of the wide shallow bucket is shown in fig 18 and the expressions of passive and active force in sand are as follows 19 e p i u r d 1 2 q z 0 γ z 0 2 k p 20 e p o u r d 1 2 γ z 0 2 k p 21 e a i u r d 1 2 q z 0 γ z 0 2 k a 22 e a o u r d 1 2 γ z 0 2 k a 23 e p i d r d 1 2 2 q h z 0 γ h 2 z 0 2 k p 24 e p o d r d 1 2 γ h 2 z 0 2 k p 25 e a i d r d 1 2 2 q γ z 0 k p 26 e a o d r d 1 2 γ z 0 h z 0 k a 27 h u b e p o u e p i u e a o d e a i d e a i u e a o u e p i d e p o d where e xxx is the earth pressure acted on the bucket skirt and in the subscription a and p stand for active and passive pressure i and o stand for earth pressure inside and outside the bucket and u and d stand for earth pressure above and under the rotation point and h ub is the ultimate bearing capacity of the bucket part z 0 is the depth of the rotation point r is the reduction factor due to the curved surface of the bucket and it equals to 0 65 in the following calculation liu et al 1993 q is the distributed load produced by the weight of the structure and gravel 4 3 the friction wheel the friction wheel and bucket components are integrated as one part and are decoupled with the monopile after the installation of friction wheel and bucket components gravel is added into the friction wheel the surcharge of gravel would exert a distributed load q on the soil beneath the friction wheel as a result the lateral bearing capacity of monopile and bucket would increase indirectly due to the increase of confining pressure around the pile and inside the bucket and considerable friction force between the bucket lid and soil could be produced directly from the dead load inside the friction wheel to determine the lateral friction force of friction wheel bottom plate or bucket lid it is important to determine the vertical supporting force acted on the lid first by using the equilibrium of bucket and friction wheel on vertical direction the supporting force on the middle plate between friction wheel and bucket are calculated by 28 p s v f b p f p e where p s is the supporting force on friction wheel bottom or bucket lid and v f b is the weight of friction wheel and bucket component and p f is the total skin friction resistance of bucket and p e is the end resistance of bucket wall edge the aspect ratio h d of bucket component in this research is less than 1 and the diameter of the bucket is relatively large for piles and caissons with a large h d aspect ratio the soil inside the structure is considered trapped and has no relative movement with the structure wang et al 2019b so the calculation of tip resistance adopts the terzaghi s failure mode and the tip resistance contributes considerably to the total resistance for the case of bucket component with small h d aspect ratio in this research the soil inside the bucket is not moving with the pile synchronously the tip resistance from the perimeter of bucket wall is pretty small and could be ignored a series of field tests and model tests of suction caisson was conducted by houlsby et al 2005 focusing on the installation and design of suction bucket for offshore wind turbines the vertical load displacement response of pushing the suction bucket with different aspect ratios into the soil were presented it was clear that the penetration of bucket follows a three phase pattern the first phase is that when the bucket wall penetrating the soil the resistance increases linearly in a slow rate following the second phase as soon as the lid of bucket touches the soil the resistance increases rapidly with further compaction of the subsoil the bucket yields with the increasing vertical load the results show that the vertical capacity comes from the skin friction and the supporting force of bucket lid and the end resistance of the bucket wall can be ignored so the calculation of vertical capacity is expressed as 29 p s v f b p f and the friction resistance p f may be calculated as 30 p f 0 l p f d z π d k 1 s i n φ 0 l σ 0 t a n δ d z where p is bucket perimeter and f is the unit frictional resistance and it equals to kσ 0 tanδ and k is the earth pressure coefficient for steel material 1 26k 0 1 26 1 sin φ and σ 0 is the effective vertical stress at any depth z for single layer soil condition p f can be expressed as 31 p f 1 26 π d 1 s i n φ 1 2 h 2 γ tan δ the value of σ 0 will increase to a depth of about 15d and will remain constant thereafter which is similar to pile and shaft the values of soil bucket friction angle δ from various investigations appear to be in the range from 0 5 φ to 0 8 φ das 2015 in this case we choose 0 7 φ for loose sand and 0 8 φ for dense sand so with the known vertical load v f b and friction resistance the ultimate lateral resistance h f can be expressed as 32 h u f p s t a n δ a b v f b p f a b t a n δ c 4 4 simplified method for calculation of hybrid mfb owt foundation the equations of calculating the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of monopile h up friction wheel h uf and bucket foundation h ub are derived in the previous sections although the interaction between three components and between structures and soil is not clear it s still plausible to estimate the bearing capacity of the whole system by simply adding h up h uf and h ub together h up can be calculated by equation 14 h uf can be calculated by equation 19 27 h ub can be derived from equation 29 32 with the parameters of soil the dimensions and weight of structures and gravel the overall lateral bearing capacity of mf foundations are the summation of h up h uf and the bearing capacity of mfb foundations are the summation of h up h ub and h uf 33 h u m f b r h h u p h u b h u f where the r h is the reduction factor the bearing capacity of every foundation model utilizing the proposed simplified add up method in all soil conditions as well as the bearing capacity from centrifuge tests are listed in table 4 from table 4 the bearing capacity of the monopile in dry loose sand saturated dense and loose sand from the centrifuge tests are larger than the results of proposed methods for mf and mfb foundations the bearing capacity of the centrifuge test is smaller than the results of the proposed method for most comparisons the errors of mfb foundations are approximately 10 40 the error of 0 4 1 8 and 19 5 deviate from the data group so they are considered outliers the possible explanation of the reduction is that the overall bearing capacity is slightly compromised by the combination of three components therefore a reduction factor r h from 0 52 0 68 can be multiplied into the summation of h up h uf and h ub to get a more accurate prediction of hybrid foundation more specifically in this study for the mfb model with bucket diameter larger than 5 m the reduction factor is 0 52 0 56 for loose sand and 0 56 0 68 for dense sand respectively 5 conclusion in this paper a novel concept of foundation structure for offshore wind turbine is proposed of which a friction wheel bucket integrated component is added on a monopile the intention is that gravel can be filled into the friction wheel to provide a surcharge load on the subsoil increasing the passive and active earth pressure on the bucket and monopile components as well as friction force from the bucket lid and the bucket component can also help enlarge the lateral bearing capacity centrifuge tests are carried out on four models of monopile friction wheel bucket mfb foundation with different aspect ratios one model of monopile friction wheel mf foundation and one model of monopile foundation both monotonic and cyclic load were performed on foundation models in dry or saturated dense or loose sand to compare their behavior for each condition a simplified method to calculate the ultimate lateral bearing capacity is also proposed in this paper following conclusions can be drawn from this study in the monotonic load tests the ultimate bearing capacity of the hybrid foundations outperformed the monopile foundation by 100 300 the increase of diameter and depth of the bucket and the diameter of the friction wheel correlating with the area of the surcharge load could lead to the growth of the lateral bearing capacity the largest ultimate lateral bearing capacity of different soil conditions all comes from the mfb2 model d b 5 m h b 2 which has the deepest bucket component in the cyclic load tests the final displacement of the hybrid mfb foundation is about 50 of that of monopile in dense sand and less than 30 in saturated loose sand the secant stiffness of monopile is much higher than the mfb hybrid foundations but the unloading stiffness of mfb foundations is higher than the monopile in dry sand and slightly higher in saturated sand the enhancement of the performance of the hybrid foundation in loose sand is much more significant compared with dense sand and the saturated loose sand is the extremist case erecting mfb hybrid foundation in saturated loose sand could outperform the monopile foundation by a big margin and achieve maximum value of the investment a simplified calculation method for the mfb hybrid foundation was proposed and the surrounding soil resistance of different components was analyzed using the centrifuge test results as a reference the summation of the bearing capacity of three components multiplied by a reduction factor from 0 52 0 68 could be a conservative prediction of the ultimate bearing capacity of the proposed hybrid foundation and the reduction factor for dense sand is slightly larger than the loose sand credit authorship contribution statement xinyao li data curation writing original draft xiangwu zeng conceptualization writing review
