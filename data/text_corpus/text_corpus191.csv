955,the disturbances caused to forests by human interferences have a significant impact on forest hydrology and the nutrient cycle the stemflow throughfall interception loss and runoff are the major components of the forest hydrology and play an active role in nutrients cycling a study was therefore carried out in the sal forests under various disturbance gradients in himalayan foothills to quantify the rainfall partitioned components i e stemflow throughfall and interception loss runoff and chemical elements in rainfall partitioned components during the study period a total of 37 rainfall events were recorded for the rainfall partitioning study results showed that the significantly highest average stemflow was observed in the undisturbed sal forest 3 7 0 2 and lowest in the disturbed sal forest 1 7 0 1 a significantly highest average throughfall was observed in the disturbed sal forest 65 2 1 7 and lowest in the undisturbed forest 57 8 1 8 although the highest average interception loss was observed in the undisturbed forest 38 5 1 8 and lowest in the disturbed sal forest type 33 2 1 8 it was not significant p 0 05 significantly highest average runoff 22 2 1 7 was observed in the disturbed sal forest while the lowest runoff 8 5 1 8 was observed in the undisturbed sal forest type it was also observed that nutrient enrichment i e n p and k to the soil through stemflow and throughfall was 18 6 times 23 1 times and 10 8 times more as compared to incident rainfall from the statistical analysis it was observed that average canopy spread ground biomass and average crown projection area were the most important parameters of the sal forests which affected the proportion of rainfall partitioned components and runoff keywords rainfall stemflow throughfall interception loss 1 introduction rainfall partitioning i e redistribution of rainfall event by vegetation canopy controls the water balance and further it controls the water resources by changing the proportion of evaporation and runoff llorens domingo 2007 partitioning of rainfall into stemflow sf throughfall tf and interception loss i by the vegetation canopies are the three major components of forest hydrology sf is the part of the rainfall which is generated due to the draining of incident rainfall by leaves twig branches and stem whereas tf is the part of the incident rainfall which drips down through the canopy the last rainfall partitioned component i which is abstracted by the canopy and later on lost gradually by the process of evaporation sometimes the sf and tf are together termed as net rainfall for the rainfall events with rainfall volume more than the canopy water storage capacity tf is the major component and when rainfall amount equals the canopy water storage

within catchment areas might increase sediment yield to the stream stream temperature and nutrient concentration kara et al 2014 sal shorea robusta forests are predominantly scattered throughout south and south east asia occupying its northern and the central regions sal forests in india cover an area estimated at around 13 million hectares banglapedia 2021 according to champion seth 1968 the sal trees are one of the most dominant tree species in tropical moist and deciduous forests in india however due to its high value among the timber species sal forests are facing immense anthropogenic pressure overexploitation and deforestation leading to their shrinkage and abysmal regeneration status to date most studies on rainfall partitioned components in sal forest have focused on quantifying its fraction with respect to incident rainfall for a specific stand dabral rao 1969 studied the rainfall partitioning for sal trees of 37 years old and observed that sf tf and i ranged between 5 10 48 58 and 35 40 of rainfall respectively and the sf increases with rainfall amount up to certain threshold amount irrespective of its trunk diameter at dbh but throughfall increases with increase in rainfall and trunk diameter up to certain diameter similarly the study on rainfall partitioned components by pathak et al 1985 at six sites of the central himalayan forest observed that the sf tf and i were 0 28 0 89 74 7 91 5 and 8 1 25 0 of total incident rainfall respectively however the variability in the rainfall partitioned components caused by biotic factors has not been yet studied the present study therefore aimed at quantifying 1 the proportions of rainfall partitioned components 2 nutrient concentrations in the sf tf and incident rainfall 3 surface runoff from the sal forests under varying disturbance levels and 4 sal forest characteristics responsible for the variation in rainfall partitioned components and runoff the study is important to determine the effects of decreasing vegetation on tree hydrology and understanding the interaction between the forest canopy and various hydrological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the present study was conducted during the monsoon june to september 2014 in sal shorea robusta forest in the doon valley of himalayan foothills in dehradun uttrakhand india the study area falls under the soil conservation forest division kalsi dehradun the forests sample represented old growth apparently natural communities that are self maintaining the age of the stands was 50 5 years and they represented average conditions of their respective disturbance regime species content and vegetation pattern three disturbance gradients viz undisturbed kalyanpur site mild disturbed kedarwala site and disturbed amwala site were selected for this study the location details of the three study sites are presented in fig 1 various biotic factors viz grazing lopping weed infestation and forest canopy were considered for determining disturbance gradient in different selected sites fig 2 the site with maximum forest canopy and less biotic interference minimum grazing lopping and weed infestation was classified as undisturbed forest and the site with the lowest canopy and highest biotic interference was classified as disturbed forest the elevation of the study sites ranges from 715 m to 830 m above mean sea level the climate of the study area is sub tropical and includes at least three distinct seasons i e summer monsoon and winter the total average annual rainfall is about 1600 mm 87 of which occurs during the monsoon season the various meteorological data were collected from the nearest meteorological station located at the research farm of icar iiswc dehradun the monthly maximum temperature varies from 9 8 c january to 43 c june whereas the monthly minimum temperature varies from 1 c january to 27 c june the daily average maximum and minimum relative humidity are 90 23 and 53 54 respectively average wind speed and bright sunshine hour are 1 04 km hour 1 and 5 44 hours respectively the average daily evaporation rate is 2 90 mm during the period of study the rainfall recorded for the undisturbed mild disturbed and disturbed forest types were 2460 0 mm 2296 9 mm and 2348 2 mm respectively the soil particle size distribution was measured by hydrometer bouyoucos 1927 and the soil is mostly silty loam at all three sites with the average percentage of clay silt fine sand and coarse sand varies from 18 10 to 20 10 26 50 to 32 20 44 30 to 49 40 and 3 50 to 6 40 respectively the core sampler was used for soil bulk density determinations and bulk density varies from 1 16 to 1 27 mg m 3 for undisturbed 1 52 to 1 63 mg m 3 for mild disturbed and 1 78 to1 81 mg m 3 for disturbed forest type as obtained from the analysis of soil sample the saturated soil infiltration rates as measured by double ring infiltrometer astm 2003 at three sites were 6 50 mm hour 1 4 58 mm hour 1 and 4 32 mm hr 1 for undisturbed mild disturbed and disturbed site respectively the soil organic carbon estimated by using the method of walkley and black 1934 ranged from 0 42 disturbed site to 0 80 undisturbed site 2 2 growth parameters three sample plots of one hectare 100 m 100 m were marked in all the sites each plot was then apportioned into four quarters each of the said four quarters were then further partitioned into 25 quadrats measuring 10 m 10 m each the diameter at the breast height dbh 1 37 m from the ground for every tree was recorded with the help of a caliper the diversity index of species of the sal forest at three different sites was determined by adhering to the shannon weaver index shannon weaver 1949 kushwaha nandy 2012 which is represented as h σ n i n ln n i n where h shannon weaver index of general diversity ni importance value index of ith species n sum of importance value index of all the species the ground vegetation was measured by cutting the biomass above the ground in quadrats measuring 1 m 1 m 2 3 measurement of rainfall stemflow and throughfall nine sal trees varying in diameter were considered from each site for this study the total depth of daily rainfall was recorded from each site using a standard non recording type rain gauge installed in an open space located nearby the respective study site all the data on rainfall stemflow and throughfall were recorded during daytime when one rainfall spell was over and there was no rain at least for the next 1 hour it was considered as an exclusive rainfall event sf from the trees was collected with respect to each rainfall event by fixing a collar made of an easily foldable thin aluminium sheet fixed around the tree bole at suitable heights and attached to a container through a plastic pipe fig 3 the contact area between the tree bole and collar was sealed with silicone sealant to avoid leakage of water the sf depth corresponding to each rainfall event was calculated by dividing the sf volume with the crown projection area cpa the cpa of a sal tree was estimated by assuming a circular projected area of the crown of the tree having r as the radius of the circular crown r was determined by measuring the mean distance between the tree trunk and the end of the branch bellot and escarre 1998 tf from the trees with respect to each rainfall event was collected with one end opened cylindrical containers of 25 cm in diameter llorens and domingo 2007 nine containers were placed randomly below each tree at each site for collecting throughfall water the mean throughfall volume from the trees was calculated by taking the average of these nine containers at each site the mean throughfall depth was calculated by dividing the mean tf volume with the cross section of the container the interception loss for each rainfall event was calculated by subtracting the sum of sf and tf from the rainfall amount bellot escarre 1998 ahmed et al 2017 water samples of stemflow and throughfall from all forest types for few rainfall events were collected to assess the physicochemical properties of stemflow and throughfall in all collected samples ph and electrical conductivity were measured by digital ph and ec meter base cations of na and k were determined by flame photometer ca mg were determined by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta titration method whereas n concentrations were measured by phenol di sulfonic acid p concentrations were measured by blue colour method spectrophotometrically cl was measured by argentometric titration and hco3 was measured by phenolphthalein titration method 2 4 measurement of runoff for measuring runoff three observation plots of size 20 m x 20 m were constructed at each study site runoff from each plot was collected in tanks through two multi slot divisors connected in series having 11 and 5 slots respectively the runoff depth from each site was calculated using the following formula runoff depth number of slots in first multislot divisor depth of water in the first tank number of slots in second multislot divisor depth of water in the second tank runoff data from experimental treatments were recorded at 08 30 am after each rainfall event by measuring the depth of water collected in the runoff collection tanks pooled water samples were collected from the three sites each for incident rainfall sf and tf and their quality analysis was done in the laboratory for measuring nutrient flux npk in addition chemical analysis of the water samples was done to determine ec ph and concentration of exchangeable ions i e ca mg na cl and hco3 in incident rainfall sf and tf as per the standard procedure 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the oneway analysis of variance anova considering the null hypothesis of no variation rainfall partitioned components in treatments h 0 t d t m d t u d where subscript d md and ud indicates disturbed mild disturbed and undisturbed treatment in the sal forest prior to conducting anova the discrete percentage of rainfall partitioned components data were transformed to a normal distribution using arcsine transformation the post hoc analysis was performed for pair wise comparison using tukey s honest significant difference test at p value 05 linear regression equations were also developed to establish a relationship between rainfall amount and rainfall partitioned components principal component analysis pca was also performed on data related to forest characteristics rainfall partitioned components and nutrient concentrations in rainfall partitioned components separately to find out associations among the parameters under the three treatment scenarios further hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed using principal components to find out homogeneous clusters all statistical analysis was carried out using the rstudio software r version 4 0 2 and sas 9 3 statistical software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the sal forests the differences in vegetation parameters in the sal forest types due to the history of impact are indicated in table 1 the regeneration capacity of sal ranged from 200 sal trees per ha to 500 sal trees per ha for the disturbed to undisturbed forest type the species richness of tree and number of genera of a tree was observed to be higher in case of undisturbed forest type and decrease towards disturbed one similarly the stand density stem ha ground biomass g m2 and average canopy spread cm were also observed higher in the case of undisturbed type forest and lower for the disturbed one average dbh the height of the tree and seasonal litterfall from the sal tree are shown in table 1 higher litterfall from the undisturbed sal forest can be attributed to higher ground biomass stand density and higher canopy coverage in comparision to mild disturbed and disturbed forest types in addition the percentage area under forest canopy was observed declining from undisturbed forest to disturbed forest type whereas the percentage area under grazing looping and weed infestation was found increasing with the increase in disturbance level fig 2 3 2 rainfall partitioning over the study period a total number of 37 rainfall events were recorded in each of the three study sites rainfall events were categorized based on soni and chandel 2020 into six classes i e extremely heavy rainfall more than or equal to 244 5 mm per day very heavy rainfall 124 5 to 244 4 mm per day heavy rainfall 64 5 to 124 4 mm per day rather heavy rainfall 35 6 to 64 4 mm per day moderate rainfall 7 6 to 35 5 mm per day and light rainfall less than 7 5 mm per day the maximum number of rainfall events falls under the rather heavy category for most of the sites but the events under heavy rainfall contributed more towards gross rainfall table 2 it was observed that the proportion of stemflow was more for undisturbed sal forest compared to mild disturbed and disturbed sal forests irrespective of the rainfall event types table 3 overall the proportion of interception loss was also observed more with respect to rainfall event types for undisturbed sal forest than the other two sal forest types on contrary overall proportion of throughfall was observed more with respect to rainfall event types for disturbed and mild disturbed sal forest types than undisturbed sal forest sf showed a negative relationship with the disturbance in the sal forest types i e sf decreased with the increased level of disturbance fig 4 significantly higher sf 3 7 was observed in undisturbed sal forest and significantly lowest sf 1 7 was observed in the disturbed forest type tree canopy architecture plays an important role in the generation of sf high conversion of rainfall into sf increases chances for higher water absorption as well as minimise the raindrop splash erosion consequently sf contributes significantly to a positive soil moisture balance in the root zone and the replenishment of soil moisture in the deeper soil layers rao et al 2012 higher sf in the undisturbed sal forest can be attributed to a higher undisturbed canopy table 2 levia et al 2010 and levia herwitz 2005 showed that sf volume depends on tree species crown size leaf shape and orientation branch angle and bark roughness the results obtained from our study are comparable with the findings of negi et al 1998 who reported an average sf of 2 16 in sal forest in of central himalaya region of india similarly gupta usharani 2009 reported sf between 1 8 2 7 during drier months and 3 1 4 7 during wetter months for a tropical forest of manipur located in north east india although sf was a small fraction of the total rainfall that reached the soil it concentrates water in a small area around the tree trunk resulting in an increase in soil moisture far greater than that due to tf gómez et al 2002 herwitz 1986 levia frost 2003 tf values revealed that disturbance has a positive relationship with throughfall as its values were observed increasing with increasing intensity of disturbance significantly lowest 57 8 tf in undisturbed forest and significantly highest tf 65 2 was observed in the disturbed forest fig 4 leaf shape size and vertical layering of canopy affect the tf drop size and terminal velocity brand 1987 calder 2001 nanko et al 2006 the difference in tf in the study sites under varying disturbances categories can be attributed to differences in their canopy structure due to biotic pressure the canopy was regularly lopped in the disturbed forest further low stem density in the disturbed forest 317 trees ha 1 as compared to the mild disturbed 432 trees ha 1 and undisturbed forest 442 trees ha 1 resulted in higher tf under their canopies freedman and prager 1986 and negi et al 1998 also reported that the canopy area influenced tf in different tree species in the case of canopy interception loss i it was observed to decrease towards the higher disturbance level fig 4 maximum i 38 5 was recorded in the undisturbed forest followed by moderately disturbed 34 2 and disturbed forest type 33 2 in general i is influenced by rainfall and forest characteristics high rainfall interception by forest canopies is frequently associated with high leaf area and crown length herwitz 1985 marin et al 2000 the observed values for i are supported by the findings of dabral rao 1969 who reported the sf tf and i for sal tree as 5 10 48 58 and 35 40 of rainfall amount respectively ahmed et al 2017 reported that average sf tf and i were 2 5 86 7 and 10 8 of total rainfall amount respectively in grewia optiva and its respective values in the case of morus alba were 8 6 76 4 and 14 7 of total rainfall amount in the himalayan foothills higher interception as a result of the large canopy during smaller events however may produce high evapotranspiration rates park cameron 2008 which needs to be further investigated 3 3 runoff runoff values were observed differently in different categories of disturbance and precisely the percentage of runoff is increasing with increasing intensity of disturbance the highest runoff 22 2 of rainfall was recorded in the disturbed forest while the lowest runoff 8 5 of rainfall was observed in the undisturbed forest type fig 4 during the period of study the rainfall observed for the undisturbed mild disturbed and disturbed forest types was 2460 0 mm 2296 9 mm and 2348 2 mm respectively lower runoff in the undisturbed forest type can be attributed to higher interception by the tree canopy low throughfall and higher infiltration of runoff water in the soil the bulk density of soil in the undisturbed forest was less in comparison to the soils in mild disturbed and disturbed forest types which in other words means the soil is more porous in undisturbed sal forest than the other two forest types this increased porosity in the soil of undisturbed sal forest leads to an increase in soil infiltration 3 4 relationship between incident rainfall and sf tf and i while plotting sf tf and i with respect to each rainfall event for the forest types under varying disturbances it was observed that sf tf and i followed a linear relationship with the rainfall figs 5 7 higher values of the coefficient of determination r2 were observed in all cases thus it means that all the rainfall partitioned components increase with the increase in rainfall amount provided that the rainfall amount is greater than zero similar relationships were also reported by many researchers in their rainfall partitioning studies deguchi et al 2006 keith et al 2006 ahmadi et al 2009 in this study the value of r2 ranged from 0 84 0 89 for sf 0 96 0 96 for tf and from 0 89 0 96 for i 3 5 nutrient concentrations in incident rainfall sf and tf the water sample collected from tf was observed to carry more concentration of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k as compared to sf and followed by incident rainfall table 4 it was observed that tf carried 18 6 times 23 1 times and 10 8 times more n p and k respectively in comparison to incident rainfall the average concentration of calcium magnesium bicarbonate and chloride were found to be higher in sf followed by tf and incident rainfall except for sodium ion concentration which was observed highest in incident rainfall and lowest in sf table 4 the k mg l 1 concentration was found to be higher as compared to n and p in all the water samples collected its concentration was found higher 28 21 mg l 1 in tf and lowest 2 61 mg l 1 in incident rainfall thus the present study showed that soil gets enriched with the nutrient input through sf and tf than incident rainfall and acts as vital sources of nutrients to this ecosystem many researchers schroth et al 2001 macinnis ng et al 2012 reported nutrient enrichment of the soil through sf and tf in other tropic and humid tropic regions the ph of sf was observed slightly acidic but the ph of incident rainfall and tf was found slightly alkaline table 4 3 6 principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis pca was performed on forest characteristics data of the three sal forest types to screen the forest characteristics which were most sensitive to various disturbance gradients in sal forest the pca produced two pcs with eigen values greater than one and explained 100 of the variance of the original data table 5 it has been observed that average canopy spread ground biomass and average cpa under pc1 were the highest weighted parameters with rotated factor loadings of 0 993 0 991 and 0 980 respectively whereas average height and dbh under pc2 emerged as the highest weighted parameters with rotated factor loadings of 0 777 and 0 667 respectively column a of table 5 thus it revealed from this analysis that average canopy spread ground biomass and average cpa were the most important parameters to describe the disturbance gradient in the sal forests another principal component analysis pca was performed on rainfall partitioned components and runoff data recorded with respect to each rainfall event in the three sal forest types to understand the relation among these hydrological fluxes the pca produced two pcs with eigen values greater than one and explained 100 of the variance of the original data table 5 the pc1 which explained 94 734 variability of the data set revealed that sf and i were negatively associated with tf and runoff column b of table 5 thus this pca signifies that higher sf and i will lead to lower tf and runoff in undisturbed sal forest type and vice versa for mild disturbed and disturbed sal forests results obtained from the first pca can be extended to deduce that average canopy spread ground biomass and average cpa are the three most important parameters which are responsible for higher sf and i in undisturbed sal forest type and vice versa for mild disturbed and disturbed sal forests moreover the values of principal components shown in table 5 were applied separately for homogeneous clustering of the three sal forest types the clustering of the sal forest types was performed using hierarchical cluster analysis hca fig 8 the application of hca on pcs in table 5 was portraited through through cluster dendrogram produced two clusters using distance measurement of forest characteristic parameters cluster 1 comprised of the disturbed site d which was comparatively lesser rich in sal forest characteristic parameters and cluster 2 comprised of mild disturbed md and undisturbed ud sites which are overall rich in sal forest characteristic parameters fig 8a similarly the application of hca on pcs in table 5 produced two clusters that was visually depicted through cluster dendrogram cluster 1 is comprised of the disturbed site d due to comparatively lesser rich in sal forest characteristic parameters in disturbed site sf and i were lower and throughfall and runoff were higher than md and ud cluster 2 comprised of mild disturbed md and undisturbed ud sites as a result of overall rich in sal forest characteristic parameters in md and ud sites sf and i were higher than d and tf and runoff was lower than d fig 8b further hca were performed on pcs table 6 obtained from the principal component analysis of nutrient concentrations in sf tf and runoff the cluster dendrogram of nutrient concentrations in sf tf and runoff is grouped into two clusters cluster 1 comprised of incident rainfall comparatively with lower nutrient concentration whereas cluster 2 comprised of sf and tf with a higher concentration of nutrients fig 8c 4 conclusions in this study rainfall partitioning in the sal forest revealed that stemflow throughfall and interception loss were affected significantly under different degrees of disturbance levels caused due to human interferences the proportion of throughfall from the sal forests was observed highest among rainfall partitioned components followed by interception loss and stemflow the average throughfall percentage for the disturbed forest was significantly higher than the undisturbed forest whereas average interception loss and stemflow were observed higher for the undisturbed forest than the disturbed forest higher runoff observed from the disturbed forest can lead to higher erosion in the himalayas foothills it was observed that sal forests characteristic parameters play an important role in partitioning rainfall throughfall and stemflow were found to play a vital role in enriching the soil with nutrients sal forest occupies a significant area in the himalayan foothills therefore disturbance in the sal forest can have a serious impact on the hydrological cycle linear equations developed in this study for the prediction of rainfall partitioned components can successfully be used in estimating the water budgeting of the sal forest directly

temperature varies from 9 8 c january to 43 c june whereas the monthly minimum temperature varies from 1 c january to 27 c june the daily average maximum and minimum relative humidity are 90 23 and 53 54 respectively average wind speed and bright sunshine hour are 1 04 km hour 1 and 5 44 hours respectively the average daily evaporation rate is 2 90 mm during the period of study the rainfall recorded for the undisturbed mild disturbed and disturbed forest types were 2460 0 mm 2296 9 mm and 2348 2 mm respectively the soil particle size distribution was measured by hydrometer bouyoucos 1927 and the soil is mostly silty loam at all three sites with the average percentage of clay silt fine sand and coarse sand varies from 18 10 to 20 10 26 50 to 32 20 44 30 to 49 40 and 3 50 to 6 40 respectively the core sampler was used for soil bulk density determinations and bulk density varies from 1 16 to 1 27 mg m 3 for undisturbed 1 52 to 1 63 mg m 3 for mild disturbed and 1 78 to1 81 mg m 3 for disturbed forest type as obtained from the analysis of soil sample the saturated soil infiltration rates as measured by double ring infiltrometer astm 2003 at three sites were 6 50 mm hour 1 4 58 mm hour 1 and 4 32 mm hr 1 for undisturbed mild disturbed and disturbed site respectively the soil organic carbon estimated by using the method of walkley and black 1934 ranged from 0 42 disturbed site to 0 80 undisturbed site 2 2 growth parameters three sample plots of one hectare 100 m 100 m were marked in all the sites each plot was then apportioned into four quarters each of the said four quarters were then further partitioned into 25 quadrats measuring 10 m 10 m each the diameter at the breast height dbh 1 37 m from the ground for every tree was recorded with the help of a caliper the diversity index of species of the sal forest at three different sites was determined by adhering to the shannon weaver index shannon weaver 1949 kushwaha nandy 2012 which is represented as h σ n i n ln n i n where h shannon weaver index of general diversity ni importance value index of ith species n sum of importance value index of all the species the ground vegetation was measured by cutting the biomass above the ground in quadrats measuring 1 m 1 m 2 3 measurement of rainfall stemflow and throughfall nine sal trees varying in diameter were considered from each site for this study the total depth of daily rainfall was recorded from each site using a standard non recording type rain gauge installed in an open space located nearby the respective study site all the data on rainfall stemflow and throughfall were recorded during daytime when one rainfall spell was over and there was no rain at least for the next 1 hour it was considered as an exclusive rainfall event sf from the trees was collected with respect to each rainfall event by fixing a collar made of an easily foldable thin aluminium sheet fixed around the tree bole at suitable heights and attached to a container through a plastic pipe fig 3 the contact area between the tree bole and collar was sealed with silicone sealant to avoid leakage of water the sf depth corresponding to each rainfall event was calculated by dividing the sf volume with the crown projection area cpa the cpa of a sal tree was estimated by assuming a circular projected area of the crown of the tree having r as the radius of the circular crown r was determined by measuring the mean distance between the tree trunk and the end of the branch bellot and escarre 1998 tf from the trees with respect to each rainfall event was collected with one end opened cylindrical containers of 25 cm in diameter llorens and domingo 2007 nine containers were placed randomly below each tree at each site for collecting throughfall water the mean throughfall volume from the trees was calculated by taking the average of these nine containers at each site the mean throughfall depth was calculated by dividing the mean tf volume with the cross section of the container the interception loss for each rainfall event was calculated by subtracting the sum of sf and tf from the rainfall amount bellot escarre 1998 ahmed et al 2017 water samples of stemflow and throughfall from all forest types for few rainfall events were collected to assess the physicochemical properties of stemflow and throughfall in all collected samples ph and electrical conductivity were measured by digital ph and ec meter base cations of na and k were determined by flame photometer ca mg were determined by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta titration method whereas n concentrations were measured by phenol di sulfonic acid p concentrations were measured by blue colour method spectrophotometrically cl was measured by argentometric titration and hco3 was measured by phenolphthalein titration method 2 4 measurement of runoff for measuring runoff three observation plots of size 20 m x 20 m were constructed at each study site runoff from each plot was collected in tanks through two multi slot divisors connected in series having 11 and 5 slots respectively the runoff depth from each site was calculated using the following formula runoff depth number of slots in first multislot divisor depth of water in the first tank number of slots in second multislot divisor depth of water in the second tank runoff data from experimental treatments were recorded at 08 30 am after each rainfall event by measuring the depth of water collected in the runoff collection tanks pooled water samples were collected from the three sites each for incident rainfall sf and tf and their quality analysis was done in the laboratory for measuring nutrient flux npk in addition chemical analysis of the water samples was done to determine ec ph and concentration of exchangeable ions i e ca mg na cl and hco3 in incident rainfall sf and tf as per the standard procedure 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using the oneway analysis of variance anova considering the null hypothesis of no variation rainfall partitioned components in treatments h 0 t d t m d t u d where subscript d md and ud indicates disturbed mild disturbed and undisturbed treatment in the sal forest prior to conducting anova the discrete percentage of rainfall partitioned components data were transformed to a normal distribution using arcsine transformation the post hoc analysis was performed for pair wise comparison using tukey s honest significant difference test at p value 05 linear regression equations were also developed to establish a relationship between rainfall amount and rainfall partitioned components principal component analysis pca was also performed on data related to forest characteristics rainfall partitioned components and nutrient concentrations in rainfall partitioned components separately to find out associations among the parameters under the three treatment scenarios further hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed using principal components to find out homogeneous clusters all statistical analysis was carried out using the rstudio software r version 4 0 2 and sas 9 3 statistical software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the sal forests the differences in vegetation parameters in the sal forest types due to the history of impact are indicated in table 1 the regeneration capacity of sal ranged from 200 sal trees per ha to 500 sal trees per ha for the disturbed to undisturbed forest type the species richness of tree and number of genera of a tree was observed to be higher in case of undisturbed forest type and decrease towards disturbed one similarly the stand density stem ha ground biomass g m2 and average canopy spread cm were also observed higher in the case of undisturbed type forest and lower for the disturbed one average dbh the height of the tree and seasonal litterfall from the sal tree are shown in table 1 higher litterfall from the undisturbed sal forest can be attributed to higher ground biomass stand density and higher canopy coverage in comparision to mild disturbed and disturbed forest types in addition the percentage area under forest canopy was observed declining from undisturbed forest to disturbed forest type whereas the percentage area under grazing looping and weed infestation was found increasing with the increase in disturbance level fig 2 3 2 rainfall partitioning over the study period a total number of 37 rainfall events were recorded in each of the three study sites rainfall events were categorized based on soni and chandel 2020 into six classes i e extremely heavy rainfall more than or equal to 244 5 mm per day very heavy rainfall 124 5 to 244 4 mm per day heavy rainfall 64 5 to 124 4 mm per day rather heavy rainfall 35 6 to 64 4 mm per day moderate rainfall 7 6 to 35 5 mm per day and light rainfall less than 7 5 mm per day the maximum number of rainfall events falls under the rather heavy category for most of the sites but the events under heavy rainfall contributed more towards gross rainfall table 2 it was observed that the proportion of stemflow was more for undisturbed sal forest compared to mild disturbed and disturbed sal forests irrespective of the rainfall event types table 3 overall the proportion of interception loss was also observed more with respect to rainfall event types for undisturbed sal forest than the other two sal forest types on contrary overall proportion of throughfall was observed more with respect to rainfall event types for disturbed and mild disturbed sal forest types than undisturbed sal forest sf showed a negative relationship with the disturbance in the sal forest types i e sf decreased with the increased level of disturbance fig 4 significantly higher sf 3 7 was observed in undisturbed sal forest and significantly lowest sf 1 7 was observed in the disturbed forest type tree canopy architecture plays an important role in the generation of sf high conversion of rainfall into sf increases chances for higher water absorption as well as minimise the raindrop splash erosion consequently sf contributes significantly to a positive soil moisture balance in the root zone and the replenishment of soil moisture in the deeper soil layers rao et al 2012 higher sf in the undisturbed sal forest can be attributed to a higher undisturbed canopy table 2 levia et al 2010 and levia herwitz 2005 showed that sf volume depends on tree species crown size leaf shape and orientation branch angle and bark roughness the results obtained from our study are comparable with the findings of negi et al 1998 who reported an average sf of 2 16 in sal forest in of central himalaya region of india similarly gupta usharani 2009 reported sf between 1 8 2 7 during drier months and 3 1 4 7 during wetter months for a tropical forest of manipur located in north east india although sf was a small fraction of the total rainfall that reached the soil it concentrates water in a small area around the tree trunk resulting in an increase in soil moisture far greater than that due to tf gómez et al 2002 herwitz 1986 levia frost 2003 tf values revealed that disturbance has a positive relationship with throughfall as its values were observed increasing with increasing intensity of disturbance significantly lowest 57 8 tf in undisturbed forest and significantly highest tf 65 2 was observed in the disturbed forest fig 4 leaf shape size and vertical layering of canopy affect the tf drop size and terminal velocity brand 1987 calder 2001 nanko et al 2006 the difference in tf in the study sites under varying disturbances categories can be attributed to differences in their canopy structure due to biotic pressure the canopy was regularly lopped in the disturbed forest further low stem density in the disturbed forest 317 trees ha 1 as compared to the mild disturbed 432 trees ha 1 and undisturbed forest 442 trees ha 1 resulted in higher tf under their canopies freedman and prager 1986 and negi et al 1998 also reported that the canopy area influenced tf in different tree species in the case of canopy interception loss i it was observed to decrease towards the higher disturbance level fig 4 maximum i 38 5 was recorded in the undisturbed forest followed by moderately disturbed 34 2 and disturbed forest type 33 2 in general i is influenced by rainfall and forest characteristics high rainfall interception by forest canopies is frequently associated with high leaf area and crown length herwitz 1985 marin et al 2000 the observed values for i are supported by the findings of dabral rao 1969 who reported the sf tf and i for sal tree as 5 10 48 58 and 35 40 of rainfall amount respectively ahmed et al 2017 reported that average sf tf and i were 2 5 86 7 and 10 8 of total rainfall amount respectively in grewia optiva and its respective values in the case of morus alba were 8 6 76 4 and 14 7 of total rainfall amount in the himalayan foothills higher interception as a result of the large canopy during smaller events however may produce high evapotranspiration rates park cameron 2008 which needs to be further investigated 3 3 runoff runoff values were observed differently in different categories of disturbance and precisely the percentage of runoff is increasing with increasing intensity of disturbance the highest runoff 22 2 of rainfall was recorded in the disturbed forest while the lowest runoff 8 5 of rainfall was observed in the undisturbed forest type fig 4 during the period of study the rainfall observed for the undisturbed mild disturbed and disturbed forest types was 2460 0 mm 2296 9 mm and 2348 2 mm respectively lower runoff in the undisturbed forest type can be attributed to higher interception by the tree canopy low throughfall and higher infiltration of runoff water in the soil the bulk density of soil in the undisturbed forest was less in comparison to the soils in mild disturbed and disturbed forest types which in other words means the soil is more porous in undisturbed sal forest than the other two forest types this increased porosity in the soil of undisturbed sal forest leads to an increase in soil infiltration 3 4 relationship between incident rainfall and sf tf and i while plotting sf tf and i with respect to each rainfall event for the forest types under varying disturbances it was observed that sf tf and i followed a linear relationship with the rainfall figs 5 7 higher values of the coefficient of determination r2 were observed in all cases thus it means that all the rainfall partitioned components increase with the increase in rainfall amount provided that the rainfall amount is greater than zero similar relationships were also reported by many researchers in their rainfall partitioning studies deguchi et al 2006 keith et al 2006 ahmadi et al 2009 in this study the value of r2 ranged from 0 84 0 89 for sf 0 96 0 96 for tf and from 0 89 0 96 for i 3 5 nutrient concentrations in incident rainfall sf and tf the water sample collected from tf was observed to carry more concentration of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k as compared to sf and followed by incident rainfall table 4 it was observed that tf carried 18 6 times 23 1 times and 10 8 times more n p and k respectively in comparison to incident rainfall the average concentration of calcium magnesium bicarbonate and chloride were found to be higher in sf followed by tf and incident rainfall except for sodium ion concentration which was observed highest in incident rainfall and lowest in sf table 4 the k mg l 1 concentration was found to be higher as compared to n and p in all the water samples collected its concentration was found higher 28 21 mg l 1 in tf and lowest 2 61 mg l 1 in incident rainfall thus the present study showed that soil gets enriched with the nutrient input through sf and tf than incident rainfall and acts as vital sources of nutrients to this ecosystem many researchers schroth et al 2001 macinnis ng et al 2012 reported nutrient enrichment of the soil through sf and tf in other tropic and humid tropic regions the ph of sf was observed slightly acidic but the ph of incident rainfall and tf was found slightly alkaline table 4 3 6 principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis pca was performed on forest characteristics data of the three sal forest types to screen the forest characteristics which were most sensitive to various disturbance gradients in sal forest the pca produced two pcs with eigen values greater than one and explained 100 of the variance of the original data table 5 it has been observed that average canopy spread ground biomass and average cpa under pc1 were the highest weighted parameters with rotated factor loadings of 0 993 0 991 and 0 980 respectively whereas average height and dbh under pc2 emerged as the highest weighted parameters with rotated factor loadings of 0 777 and 0 667 respectively column a of table 5 thus it revealed from this analysis that average canopy spread ground biomass and average cpa were the most important parameters to describe the disturbance gradient in the sal forests another principal component analysis pca was performed on rainfall partitioned components and runoff data recorded with respect to each rainfall event in the three sal forest types to understand the relation among these hydrological fluxes the pca produced two pcs with eigen values greater than one and explained 100 of the variance of the original data table 5 the pc1 which explained 94 734 variability of the data set revealed that sf and i were negatively associated with tf and runoff column b of table 5 thus this pca signifies that higher sf and i will lead to lower tf and runoff in undisturbed sal forest type and vice versa for mild disturbed and disturbed sal forests results obtained from the first pca can be extended to deduce that average canopy spread ground biomass and average cpa are the three most important parameters which are responsible for higher sf and i in undisturbed sal forest type and vice versa for mild disturbed and disturbed sal forests moreover the values of principal components shown in table 5 were applied separately for homogeneous clustering of the three sal forest types the clustering of the sal forest types was performed using hierarchical cluster analysis hca fig 8 the application of hca on pcs in table 5 was portraited through through cluster dendrogram produced two clusters using distance measurement of forest characteristic parameters cluster 1 comprised of the disturbed site d which was comparatively lesser rich in sal forest characteristic parameters and cluster 2 comprised of mild disturbed md and undisturbed ud sites which are overall rich in sal forest characteristic parameters fig 8a similarly the application of hca on pcs in table 5 produced two clusters that was visually depicted through cluster dendrogram cluster 1 is comprised of the disturbed site d due to comparatively lesser rich in sal forest characteristic parameters in disturbed site sf and i were lower and throughfall and runoff were higher than md and ud cluster 2 comprised of mild disturbed md and undisturbed ud sites as a result of overall rich in sal forest characteristic parameters in md and ud sites sf and i were higher than d and tf and runoff was lower than d fig 8b further hca were performed on pcs table 6 obtained from the principal component analysis of nutrient concentrations in sf tf and runoff the cluster dendrogram of nutrient concentrations in sf tf and runoff is grouped into two clusters cluster 1 comprised of incident rainfall comparatively with lower nutrient concentration whereas cluster 2 comprised of sf and tf with a higher concentration of nutrients fig 8c 4 conclusions in this study rainfall partitioning in the sal forest revealed that stemflow throughfall and interception loss were affected significantly under different degrees of disturbance levels caused due to human interferences the proportion of throughfall from the sal forests was observed highest among rainfall partitioned components followed by interception loss and stemflow the average throughfall percentage for the disturbed forest was significantly higher than the undisturbed forest whereas average interception loss and stemflow were observed higher for the undisturbed forest than the disturbed forest higher runoff observed from the disturbed forest can lead to higher erosion in the himalayas foothills it was observed that sal forests characteristic parameters play an important role in partitioning rainfall throughfall and stemflow were found to play a vital role in enriching the soil with nutrients sal forest occupies a significant area in the himalayan foothills therefore disturbance in the sal forest can have a serious impact on the hydrological cycle linear equations developed in this study for the prediction of rainfall partitioned components can successfully be used in estimating the water budgeting of the sal forest directly

956,environmental hydraulics a neighboring research field to ecohydrology is an intermediate area between hydrodynamics and ecology biology the main research topic of this emerging scientific discipline is the interdependency and interconnectedness between water flow and the behavior of various aquatic organisms this truly interdisciplinary approach reveals numerous unanswered questions mostly related to the relationship between water flow sediment vegetation nutrients and harmful substances in the hydro environment and leads to better insight into river status often called river health in this paper we review some of the basic research questions and challenges in the field of environmental hydraulics the discussion is inspired by the outcomes of the recent 6th iahr europe congress 2020 where the community of hydro engineers met experts engaged in the unesco intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp viii keywords river health environmental hydraulics river status nature based solutions water quality vegetated channels 1 introduction recent decades have witnessed the successful development of methods facilitating the study of various interactions between water movement transport of contaminants and biological life in the aquatic environment such interactions have been referred to as either environmental hydraulics or ecohydraulics depending on the focus of the study moreover when we reach back to the fundamentals researchers also often speak about environmental fluid mechanics irrespective of what terminology is preferred however we are nowadays certainly witnessing the emergence of a new research discipline that takes the seemingly simple approach of melding and principles of aquatic ecology and fluvial geomorphology with engineering hydraulics nestler et al 2016 point out that the main challenge of such an approach lies in the fact that hydraulic engineers and ecologists 1 study processes that differ substantially in spatial and or temporal scale 2 have very different approaches to modelling 3 utilize different sets of mathematical formulations concepts and assumptions and 4 address problems with vastly different patterns of complexity and uncertainty and indeed searching for solutions at the confluence of such different disciplines drives innovation and new research methods this relatively new research area has already given rise to many monographic volumes specially focused conferences zeng et al 2021 and also to the emergence of such excellent research journals as journal of ecohydraulics journal of hydro environment research and environmental fluid mechanics this very new research field its historical development together with the bibliometric analysis and its major topics have been analyzed in depth by zeng et al 2021 we do not aim to perform a separate analysis of a similar sort here rather we propose to show environmental hydraulics as a neighboring research field to ecohydrology find the relation between them and show their potential for solving the environmental challenges we will name some of the challenges that we consider most important in the field but above all we want to demonstrate what practical problems might be solved by means of methods developed within environmental hydraulics both in the assessment of river status as well as in the development of so called nature based solutions for river status improvement the inspiration for this article came from the discussions held and conclusions reached during the 6th iahr europe congress 2020 titled hydro environment research and engineering no frames no borders hereinafter the iahr congress where researchers working in various hydro science specializations had a chance to discuss research trends and different solutions offered within the broadly understood field of environmental hydraulics the meeting of engineering solutions and environmental demands necessitates the development of innovative approaches to meet future targets for water resources 2 river health concept and the need for research for millennia rivers have served as the focus of human development as a major source of fresh water and food to this very day societies benefit from the numerous ecosystem services rivers provide constanza et al 1997 however over the past century humans have dramaticallyincreased pressures on water systems threatening or deteriorating their environmental conditions as a result societal well being is also endangered as goods and services important for humanity depend to great extent on river status it is important to communicate this interrelation to society using terms that are as clear as possible while remaining scientifically based the term river health as shorthand for good river condition has been described in detail by norris and thoms 1999 for the purposes of this paper we use this term as proposed by meyer 1997 describing a healthy river ecosystem as one that is sustainable and resilient maintaining its ecological structure and function over time while continuing to meet societal needs and expectations it is important to stress that this intuitively easy to quantify term healthy river unhealthy river etc has not yet been commonly adopted or fully defined examples of definitions and concepts of ecosystem health have been presented in vugteveen et al 2006 in the eu context the similar but more technical term good ecological status forms a central point of the water framework directive wfd european commission 2000 the challenging goal of achieving healthy rivers should unite scientists and the general public the role of society in this process is clear public acceptance of the importance of river health is the only way to push decision makers first politicians then water managers towards conservation and or restoration of water ecosystems the contribution of scientists however is more difficult as they should help in selecting the relevant health symptoms fairweather p g 1999 there are a wide variety of river features that can be measured with varying accuracy and at a broad range of spatial and temporal scales there are number of ecological concepts describing the physical dimensions dynamics and biota response in order to properly scale up the processes in rivers from the environmental hydraulics perspective four of them are the most interesting for purpose of assessing river status the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 the serial discontinuity concept ward stanford 1995 the flood pulse concept junk et al 1989 and the flow pulse concept tockner et al 2000 in addition abiotic biotic regulatory concept was proposed by zalewski and naiman 1985 which was the first effort to integrate understanding of hydrological processes described by water hydraulics e g bernoulli s principle zalewski 2020 and ecosystem properties which are described in thermodynamics law and van t hoff law temperature such synthetic model of integration of hydrology and ecology for prediction of hierarchy of drivers in different systems in different parts of the world were providing theoretical framework for integration ecological and hydrological processes across the scale the temporal dimension both in terms of historical development and monitoring of possible future trajectories e g after restoration has been brought in by boon 1998 in practice however the ecological concepts are broken down to a set of indictors so as to clearly assess and compare different rivers showing their status and need for improvement it is one of the most important points where research concepts is turned to the decision making process in this process different potential actions are weighted using the variables which can be quantified and thus compared the decisions are made in most case in different form of the multicriteria methods where ecological economical and societal demands are met in most cases ecologists divide methods of river health assessment into indicator species methods and comprehensive index methods huaibin jianping 2014 indicator species methods include fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates as target objects to assess the health of a river ecosystem biological monitoring and biological data provide the most integrative view of river condition or river health thus multimetric biological indices are an important approach for measuring a river s condition and assessing its status comprehensive index methods on the other hand use indicators such as river physical chemical biological characteristics enriched with data from social economy in order to utilize different sources and scales of information this may reflect the river habitat and biota condition the social and or economical function or pressures on the system index methods have produced an impressive number of analyses and critical reflections e g reviewed in vugteveen et al 2006 gippel et al 2017 indicators are crucial to many socio political schemes for identifying environmental influences of society i e differentiating the present condition of the environment from the anthropogenic pressures upon it hang et al 2010 this allows for the formulation any societal responses to alleviate identified pressures and or restore river conditions to those which we can be described as healthy there is common agreement that indicators have a fundamental technical basis in science supporting their usage in decision making lenders knippenberg 2005 however the criteria used in interpreting indicator values good bad healthy unhealthy etc are likely to go beyond scientific grounds and in many cases are ultimately socially determined this means that scientists should insist on society s involvement in such assessments and reporting as figure 1 shows with increasing pressure on particular elements of the system starting on a river segment but often going beyond the river channel or valley changing the characteristics and functioning of the catchment the abiotic and biota quality is decreasing furthermore degradation of the abiotic structure such as flow sediment movement or riverbed characteristics gives rise to positive feedback on the biota leading to further damage such non linear relations between pressure river abiotic elements and biota may include certain tipping points and internal relations these are crucial in formulating tasks for environmental hydraulics compare fig 3 which is a helpful tool both for identifying the processes most important for river health conservation or restoration as well as for choosing the best performing indicators however a full understanding of changes to a river ecosystem s structure and functioning from a relatively natural to a profoundly damaged system requires knowledge of physical chemical and ecological properties at many spatial and temporal scales in this respect ecohydrology as a sub discipline of sustainability science focused on development of solutions and implementation of different measures for enhancement of catchment sustainability potential and the river ecological status plays an important role it focuses on functioning of river lake reservoir ecosystem in the catchment perspective because ecological status of freshwater ecosystems is determined by hydrological cycle biological structure of the catchment human activities and human impact all of them determinants of ecologicalstatus catchment approach in ecohydrology has been explained by 1 terrestrial phase of the hydrological circle water plant eamus et al 2006 rodrigues iturbe 2000 and 2 freshwater ecosystem phase zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2000 zalewski 2014 chicharo et al 2001 wolanski 2007 harper et al 2008 this second phase is core of ecohydraulics as initiated by statzner statzner and holm 1989 and formalised by harleman 1991 the merit of transdisciplinary ecohydrology is the translation of water biota interplay into dual regulation of processes by development of nature based solutions which consist of three steps 1 mitigation of impacts e g increase in catchment retentiveness forestry soil organic matter buffering land water ecotonal zones 2 enhancement of resilience of freshwater ecosystem biomanipulation hrbacek et al 1961 brooks dodgeson 1965 hydrobiomanipulation zalewski et al 1990 and 3 enhancement of river self purification creation of land water ecotones of intermediate complexity again first and second steps are supported by the knowledge gained in ecohydraulics field of research considering all of the above introduced perspectives one might say that ecohydraulics can be considered as a subdiscipline of ecohydrology focused on instream flow regimes influence for aquatic flora and fauna whereas ecohydrology is a holistic catchment approach for development of nature based solutions nbs and solutions for enhancement of catchment sustainability potential wbsr of river systems especially resilience r the input from integrated water resources management iwrm and ecohydraulics has be in the context of the catchment processes and water plant soil interactions defined by ecohydrology by mentioning the iwrm one should also take into account the human perspective and perception of conservation and restoration processes by catchment population communicating the results of monitoring and assessments of changes in a river system to civil society is critical if the river health status is to influence environmental policies currently there is a growing awareness of the added value of the restoration projects and in fact for number of people the cultural services are much more important than the primary es that are targeted by the flood protection water alimentation or regulation of water quality to meet the legal requirements in case of restoration or conservation projects close to the big cities e g schelde estuary close to antwerp or danube floodplains close to vienna vistula protected river banks in warsaw etc we see then also an explosion of recreation along the river a lot of people walking cycling but also small businesses that appear a restaurant café or company organising excursions etc so the societal recognition is very important for defining other the provision or regulation services provided by a river this phenomena can be described in the form of response curve as shown in fig 2 the role of cooperation with society in the restoration project was described by wassen et al 2011 in broader sense for water management planning by gielczewski et al 2011 by using the results of demonstration projects or environmental models to describe the condition or health of rivers and their adjacent landscapes and to diagnose the causes of degradation we can develop restoration plans estimate the ecological risks associated with land use plans in a watershed or select among alternative development options to minimize river degradation 3 environmental hydraulics selected advances and challenges as mentioned above environmental hydraulics is a broad research domain and herein we shall focus on those problems that are directly or indirectly related to river health and where the link with biological life is rather straightforward we draw our inspiration from the discussions during the iahr congress and our personal experience of course the significance of any research advance or challenge whether achieved or aspired to is a subjective matter of opinion as such the list given below is admittedly partial incomplete and possibly biased toward transport processes and flows through vegetated channels our current understanding of environmental hydraulics eh goes far beyond the definition offered by harleman 1991 for whom the evolution of environmental hydraulics has occurred along three lines 1 mechanics of jet mixing 2 mechanics of stratified flows and 3 the transport and fate of pollutants in the natural environment those areas are embedded in what we mean by eh but many more issues are discussed nowadays we will concentrate on various problems but in each case the studies presented related to 1 understanding of physical processes and interdependence with ecological biological processes 2 field studies 3 laboratory experiments 4 modeling 5 implementation of designed scientific tools 6 practical solutions e g as nature based solutions surface water quality is definitely a factor crucial for the health of a river under consideration it may be based on numerous parameters such as ph dissolved oxygen do suspended solids ss chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 potassium permanganate index ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and other more detailed parameters but the dynamics of the transfer of the above quantities is crucial for in depth understanding and assessment of for instance a stream s capacity for self purification when a certain amount of contaminant is released into a watercourse it is carried downstream by the fluid motion and is continually mixed and redistributed within the water the basic fundamentals of this process are well studied resting upon the laws of conservation of mass and energy numerous models have been developed all over the world moreover transport and mixing processes have been the subject of countless monographs textbooks and review papers e g clark 1996 rowiński 2002 czernuszenko rowiński 2005 benedini tsakiris 2013 fu et al 2020 nonetheles researchers are still seeking relevant descriptions once the situation becomes more complex we still encounter problems understanding the transport processes under very complex geometries or unsteady flow conditions figure 3 shows that the transport of constituents by the dispersion advection or other processes is dependent on the hydrologic and hydrodynamic characteristics of a channel and they in turn depend on the geometry and morphometry of the river reach the more geometrically complex the setting is the more uncertain is the mathematical representation of the system if we also consider the presence of vegetation along river channels the transport processes become particularly difficult to describe vegetation influences the flow resistance of the watercourse creates additional drag causes violent transverse mixing due to great differences in velocities between the vegetated and non vegetated regions and affects turbulence intensity and diffusion on top of that riparian vegetation often significantly alters the channel geometry it is well known that transport equations take the general form of advection diffusion equations with additional source terms responsible for biological or chemical reactions however these equations themselves introduce numerous weaknesses and knowledge gaps most of the problems are related to the original sin of environmental hydraulics namely inaccurate description of the velocity field as well as resistance to flow whendeveloping models there is always a trade off between retaining greater detail of the processes under study and deriving tractable equations kalinowska rowiński 2012 inevitably some details are simplified in or even excluded from the models that we use to tackle the problems of river health although in the general situation the admixture concentration of the temperature distribution in rivers should be described by three dimensional equations we often seek to reduce it to two 2d or even one dimensional 1d situations depth or cross sectional averaging of equations introduces dispersion tensors or dispersion coefficients whose determination constitutes one of the basic tasks in environmental hydraulics and is a continually developing branch of eh involving either field investigations tracer tests detailed laboratory studies or now increasingly often artificial intelligence techniques e g wallis and manson 2004 rowiński et al 2005 zeng huai 2013 antonopoulos et al 2015 one of the most common approaches involves the use of a compromise model between the 1d and 2d approaches utilizing the concept of transient storage such models are particularly suitable for vegetated channels or those with a relatively complex geometry with pronounced riverbed irregularities river bends side pockets coves and also observed mass exchange with hyporheic zones see e g bencala walters 1983 czernuszenko and rowiński 1997 boano et al 2014 knapp kelleher 2020 these are probably the most popular models that to some extent reflect the complexity of riverine transport and they reconstruct the skewed solute breakthrough curves and their tailing behavior how intricate the situation is may be illustrated based on tracer tests such tests which are experiments allowing us to better understand how pollutants are mixed and transported in a particular stream consist in instantaneously injecting a known quantity of a solution of a given marker into a stream and observing the variation in its concentration as it moves downstream sukhodolov et al 1997 boxall and guymer 2007 rowiński et al 2008 the search for a substance suitable for this purpose but also environmentally safe and not threatening to the health of the river itself still remains a point of debate behrens et al 2001 rowiński chrzanowski 2011 koch et al 2021 skjoldin et al 2021 it seems that two hydroengineering topics are coming to the forefront one related to simulations and analysis of mixing and transport processes in the presence of vegetation in fluvial and marine environments and another involving plastics in rivers and in the aquatic environment both of them are crucial when river health is taken into account indeed new results reported in the recent literature confirm that observation the quite recent review by rowiński et al 2018 revealed the potential of vegetation for reducing pollution concentrations in watercourses in the context of nature based solutions in agriculture regions numerous papers have tackled the problem of ways of understanding and predicting how pollutants disperse in vegetation e g mossa et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2017 2019 termini 2019 park hwang 2019 guo et al 2020 but in spite of an abundance of studies on dispersion processes in the presence of various kinds of vegetation this is an area that will definitely require further analyses in laboratory and field conditions studies on microplastics transportation in the aquatic environment are quite new on the scientific scene and they are gaining increasing attention also within eh microplastic concentration is definitely a new relatively rarely recognized indication of river health and it seems that understanding of the transport of plastic particles in rivers a subject that definitely within the eh discipline is still very much in its infancy waldschläger schüttrumpf 2019 the authors of that study performed more than 500 experiments on the effects of particle shape size and density on the rise and settling velocities of microplastics it is most likely the only such exhaustive investigation of the process to date one can state that we are seeing the birth of a new research domain unfortunately necessitated by dramatic pollution detected in flowing surface waters sapea 2019 the above considerations are fully in agreement with the concept of zeng et al 2021 that the scientific focus of eh has been directed among others towards full consideration of the connections between physical chemical and biotic components of a natural water system around the concept of environmental interface marion et al 2014 so far we have focused on the influence of flow vegetation interface on the transport processes similar attention should be paid to sediment water interactions and hyporheic exchange and air water interactions we do realize that diffusional exchange of solutes between the water column and the bed sediment is one of key factors of water quality this applies also to dissolved oxygen a problem that we will briefly discuss later as figure 3 shows transport processes depend on the channel s roughness and velocity field two areas that constitute the very basics of open channel hydraulics knight et al 2010 we do realize it is cliché to note that the flow of water in rivers is governed by conservation of mass energy and momentum however we might quantify those laws the resistance to flow is the crucial part one of the key questions of eh is assessing the retardance of flow due to frictional resistance of water along the wetted perimeter as well as resistance imposed by various objects including vegetation elements in spite of a very long history of studies focused on it the accurate determination of roughness is not straightforward due to complex geometries spatial heterogeneity of riverbeds the stochastic nature of roughness often unsteadiness of the flow itself flow resistance is of extreme importance since it results in energy losses which determine the frictional force of water along the riverbed and riverbanks expressed as bed shear stresses or bed shear velocities those values have further consequences and among other things determine the turbulence flow structure quick recent development of this subject area is possible due to new available techniques such as close range photogrammetry and laser scanning allowing for the development of high precision digital elevation models applied to bed surface structure roughness and its description in terms of bed shear stresses has been a subject of many dedicated reports book chapters and review papers ferguson 2010 rowiński et al 2005 aberle and smart 2003 powell 2014 mrokowska rowinski 2017 understanding and determining flow velocity field is probably the most crucial part of all hydrodynamics considerations herein we would like to stress an emerging subtopic the structure of turbulence velocity field in vegetated channels vegetation is critical for the quality of biodiversity and better understanding of flow vegetation interactions is a must for properly approaching this aspect of river health in healthy rivers vegetation is helpful in tackling river management problems such as resilience to flooding transport of substances mentioned earlier and improvement of ecological status rowiński et al 2018 vegetation influences hydraulic resistance and conveyance and modifies the turbulent velocity field the latter constitutes a subject of new research developments in many scientific centers moreover vegetation affects backwater profiles sediment transport and channel morphology also solute and particulate budgets on the other hand side river flow influences the shapes sizes and spatial distributions of vegetated patches and mosaics and hence the habitat structure aberle and järvelä 2015 keizer et al 2016 with countless possible arrangements it offers a fascinating platform for basic research investigations it must be borne in mind that we may be dealing with fully vegetated channels vegetation patches within the channels or riparian vegetation vegetation might be submerged or emerged stiff or elastic with leaves or without in each case the turbulent velocity characteristics may become totally different the processes are studied over the scale of individual vegetation elements through canopy scale patch scale towards the scale of longer river reaches rich information has already been collected from many field and laboratory studies but it is too early for definite generalizations and it is clear that studies of this sort will continue for many years see e g nepf and vivoni 2000 nikora 2010 nepf 2012 nikora et al 2012 sukhodolova sukhodolov 2012 cameron et al 2013 caroppi et al 2019 2021 jahadi et al 2019 vegetation often serves for nature based solutions allowing for improvements in river health for example in the study of kałuża et al 2018 river deflectors called plant basket hydraulic structures were introduced the proposed solution also included the construction of vegetative sediment traps pbhs to initiate the hydromorphological processes in the river such solutions not only improved the hydromorphological status of the river but also triggered the meandering process in the channel the wetted perimeter is clearly one of the most crucial physical dimensions that can be changed by altered flow regimes acreman and dunbar 2004 here we enter the broad field of sediment transport in rivers which obviously goes far beyond this brief review local scouring erosion due to floods dam breaching flows aggradations and degradations of the riverbed bed motion play key role for the river health and constitute an important part of environmental hydraulics see e g dey 2014 in the context of eh two trends should be mentioned one is related to studies of flow vegetation sediment interactions see e g västilä et al 2016 wang et al 2015 hamidifar et al 2020 li et al 2018 it has been shown that vegetation counteracts the deformation and the erosion of the bed sediment fosters the bed stability and improves the water quality by removing suspended particles on the other hand sediment transport causes the reduction of photosynthetic capacity of vegetation by decreasing the water transparency and hindering the exchange of gas and nutrients between plants and water by attaching particles to plant leaves another research trend of great consequence for river health is sediment transport under unsteady flow conditions caused by snowmelts glacial processes excessive rainfall dam water releases etc quantification of the mobile riverbed response to flood waves has so far been one of the least successful areas of fluvial hydrodynamics and we may expect an influx of models based on new experimental field and laboratory data tabarestani zarrati 2015 fielding et al 2018 mrokowska rowiński 2019 on the opposing side of the environmental interfaces are the processes allowing for aeration of water oxygen can be transferred through the water surface for example due to disturbances on water surfaces caused by wind but obviously there are other processes driving oxygen into the water such as incoming streams flood waves waterfalls and obviously the process of photosynthesis when water plants release oxygen dissolved oxygen is one of fundamental indicators of the biological health of rivers and is subject to strong fluctuations over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales it is primarily dependent upon water temperature but is influenced by the changing hydro meteorological conditions and the intensity of biological processes such as photosynthesis respiration and decomposition of organic matter rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 dissolved oxygen is strongly linked to another important notion of eh namely stream metabolism one innovative way of estimating how respiration and photosynthesis contribute to carbon cycling and energy flow to food webs involves the use of the open channel diel oxygen method single or two station which is in fact the balancing of oxygen concentration over a defined river reach e g demars et al 2015 noteably prediction of the fate and transport of dissolved oxygen within fluvial systems involves the same transport processes that we have tackled above the difference lies in the description of sources of origin of oxygen within the stream another factor crucial for the biology of an aquatic ecosystem via stream ecosystem respiration gross primary productivity and ecosystem production is the thermal regime of the river under consideration water has the unique feature of absorbing thermal energy and only experiencing small changes in temperature but this means that most aquatic organisms operate in a relatively narrow temperature range river temperature is shaped by atmospheric conditions topography discharge and the composition and shape of the streambed and as such it is a subject of eh investigations elevated water temperatures affect dissolved oxygen and in extreme cases may cause elimination of some species as such better understanding of temperature oxygen stream hydraulics relation is one of major challenges in aquatic science see e g evans et al 1998 caissie 2006 kalinowska 2019 figure 3 presents in a schematic way how the complex system of eh influences the various social and natural functions of rivers responsible for their health environmental hydraulics is presented as a set of interrelationships and feedbacks between river flow both its bulk and turbulent part transport of various constituents including pollution clouds and solid particles representing natural sediments as well as artificial ones and conventionally named interfaces including the contours marking the planform curvature braiding or cross sectional shape also bed material roughness riparian vegetation as well as water surface coming into contact with air also not without significance is the fact that the riverbed is often in motion this means that any quantitative description of mass or momentum transport requires the use of complicated mathematical models in the form of differential equations with moving boundaries or so called free boundary problems simply put in most cases the domain in which the relevant differential equations are to be solved is given beforehand whereas in the case of moving boundaries we need to solve often difficult equations for the motion of the boundary itself sometimes one might conclude particularly from the hydrologic or biological literature that the driver of many processes is mean water velocity but the fact that water is in turbulent motion causes many nonlinear patterns observed within eh and in turn influencing river health mean and turbulent flow are related through traditional reynolds equations and therefore both components impact other processes in rivers many of them occur through the interface regions buffer or ecotone zones and they become crucial not only for the course of transport processes for instance but are also of utmost importance for indicators of river health it is worth pointing out that assessing river health often involves making comparisons indicators thought to represent river health are generally compared between sites that are thought to be similar in the absence of degradation as an example let us mention the study of radecki pawlik et al 2014 presenting analyses of hydrobiological and hydraulic parameters and variables of neighboring mountain catchments jamne and jaszcze photo 1 in the polish carpathians based on the abiotic properties of two neighboring river channel ecosystems including environmental hydraulics parameters like shear stress river bulk velocities froude and reynolds numbers granulometric properties of gravel water movement numbers as well as a hydrobiological benthic invertebrate based index it was shown that even though the valleys of the two small streams are similar in size and geological characteristics and are located nearby one another they exhibit completely different flow conditions which influence the hydrobiological status of those rivers eh is often identified with ecohydraulics which in turn is seen as a discipline elucidating the relationships between aquatic organisms and physical processes mostly flow in rivers most of the papers in the quite recently launched journal of ecohydraulics deal with this subject matter gibbins 2015 puts it somewhat poetically claiming that the forces of flowing water create the tune to which in order to persist stream dwelling organisms must be able to dance flow therefore has a direct effect on them but we should bear in mind that various organisms influence riverbed conditions and hence the flow itself one problem that attracts particular attention relates to the negative impacts of various artificial hydraulic structures and barriers on river morphology and ecology these structures are also known to have negative impacts on freshwater river system morphology and ecology including the blockage of upstream fish passage particularly small body mass fish species which calls for immediate solution whereas the processes are not sufficiently understood numerous publications on such topics appear every year e g albayrak et al 2020 chanson leng 2021 channing syms et al 2021 a good example of such studies presents the effects of constructed ramp hydraulic structures for fish passage on mountain creeks plesiński et al 2018 the authors evaluated the effectiveness of a block ramp for upstream fish movement in a mountain stream see photo 2 note that block ramps are usually considered to be environmentally friendly solutions and they are constructed to stabilize the riverbed and prevent it from incision and lateral erosion that detailed study clearly shows that the block ramp cannot provide longitudinal connectivity and migration of fish occurring in the mountain stream one particular reason for the low accessibility of the ramp for fish is excessively strong water current stream concentration created an unsurmountable velocity barrier for fish moving upstream for each of the analyzed discharges it has been shown that some crevices in the side zones of the ramp could be parts of the migration corridor but only for small and medium sized fish such constructions therefore have a considerable impact on river health another aspect is that discharge and the submergence of the rapid ramp is crucial in the spatial differentiation of water temperature and do concentration rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2020 at the end of our story about environmental hydraulics it is worth pointing out that this research domain very often triggers the development of unique research methods whose applications go far beyond this discipline one example might be so called double averaging methodology dam a kind of combination of fundamental conservation principles and statistical properties applied to rough wall turbulent flows i e those that appear in eh although the roots of the method can be sought in porous media hydrodynamics its rapid progress has been observed in atmospheric physics on the one hand and broadly understood eh on the other nikora et al 2007 nikora rowiński 2008 vowinckel et al 2017 although this method has developed quite recently it has become almost classical in the studies of rough bed flows and therefore of crucial importance for in depth understanding of the health of the rivers 4 lessons learned at iahr europe congress the iahr congress also offered other important observations related to the aim of this paper overall we are definitely seeing the ongoing interconnection of issues related to the motion of water with bio eco components with ecohydraulics and environmental hydrodynamics appearing as emerging scientific disciplines a lot of presentations touched upon various kinds of nature based solutions and as was strongly echoed such solutions must be sought for with the engagement of society and stakeholders of special importance was the unesco special session titled ecohydrology translation of science into innovation and solutions in accordance with the 8th phase of the unesco intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp viii with the leitmotif science and global water security the session was designed to show how integration of hydroengineering and the integrative science ecohydrology allows for development of innovative solutions towards solving global regional and local water problems integrated knowledge in the field of ecology and hydrology aligned with hydroengineering solutions is enhancing the potential for sustainable development in a given catchment area this involves the concept known as wbsrc estrategy comprising water w biodiversity b ecosystem services s resilience to anthropogenic stress and climate change r climate and education c education e e g zalewski 2014 it was stressed by the chair of the session maciej zalewski that the recent exploitative mechanistic paradigm of water resources management where declining water resources are only protected by reactive measures focused on mitigating impacts such as pollution and flood risk are not sufficient this makes the evolutionary ecosystemic wbscrc paradigm so crucial nowadays it has also been shown that the success of relevant implementations of various solutions may be enhanced by the proper use of so called foresight methodology i e studying alternative paths of development depending on the assumed concrete solutions in other words foresight is used to build multiple scenarios and the mathematical models developed within eh may become extremely useful for this purpose yet another philosophy that strongly overlaps with the aims of eh towards assessment or improvement or river health is the river culture concept which touches upon one aspect namely the improvement of human river relationships as a baseline for sustainable river management wantzen et al 2016 this concept integrates adaptations by non human organisms to the flood pulse in an ecosystem level bionic approach as well as from cultural emanations of humans living in floodplains studies of how eh methods may help the development of these other approaches and vice versa are still a job for the future similarly we do not yet have in depth analyses of how adaptive management practices gunderson et al 1995 could be improved with the use of eh methods after all this is again the search for good modeling tools allowing us to answer how ecosystems respond to management actions we could learn a lot from numerous innovative nature based solutions zalewski et al 2018 from many sites all over the world notably all of them have drawn upon in depth knowledge of eh processes though often without emphasizing this fact examples include such solutions as the recovery of artificial lakes to recharge aquifers and retain runoff in southern ecuador albarracín et al 2019 artificial wetlands for the treatment of wastewater in artisanal fish food industries in the pelican bay watershed ecohydrological measures to improve water quality in the mara river a transboundary water body between tanzania and kenya mango et al 2011 and many many others all these examples are embedded in the policy of unesco s intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp promoting the establishment of various demonstration sites around the world in order to achieve sustainability of ecosystems related with water note that all such solutions should be characterized by cost effectiveness for example if we think of the role of riparian vegetation implementation of vegetation based solutions does not seem to be particularly expensive and crucially it can be implemented by local farmers in the same vein one of the keynote lectures at the iahr congress by thomas heine followed by in depth debate concerned the danube river as a good example of proposed floodplain restoration to improve ecosystem functions and services at the river scale e g funk et al 2019 this is a highly complex socioecological system and a hotspot of biodiversity and ecosystem services especially considering the floodplain systems but it is also affected by multiple human activities like navigation hydropower urban development and agriculture making this particular river floodplain system considerably threatened it is worth pointing out that the lack of available experience meant that the adaptive management concept was implemented in the austrian section of the danube thus small steps were taken while continuously analyzing how the complex floodplain systems reacted various engineering measures aimed to improve hydrological connectivity like lowering the riverside embankments creating overflow sills and other artificial openings connecting the main river and side arms required in depth eh analyses similarly another keynote lecturer patrick meire raised the issue of integrated ecosystem based management of the schelde estuary and extended this to a wider vision of managing coastal systems he advocated for a more ecosystem based approach using nature based solutions as the relevant approach which in turn requires detailed understanding of the hydro environment interrelationships being the subject of eh the iahr europe congress turned out to be a unique event in the sense that two distinct communities met one gathering specialists in broadly understood hydroengineering and hydro physics and the other associated with various water related programs of unesco debate at the crossroads of various disciplines yielded fruitful results and opened up directions for future research which should aim at holistic global scientific assessment drawing upon eh investigations habersack et al 2018 among other sources 5 concluding remarks the term river health which describes good river conditions appears to be a useful tool for communication purposes to deliver the scientific message on river status to the public this communication between scientists and citizens should be a major driver for change in the water policy towards more environmentally oriented river basin management the environmental hydraulics offers unique opportunity for identifying relations between abiotic and biotic components of rivers and river valleys it is important for both choice of proper rh indicators as well as their validation for classification purposes as we are observing growing trend in societal perception of new ecosystem services belonging to river system such e g biodiversity conservation landscape integrity recreation potential including amateur fishing or bird watching etc there is more demand on better description of natural or semi natural systems including predictions of biota reaction on different anthrop pressures this in turn needs better process understanding measurement and modelling methods due to bigger heterogeneity of natural systems eh is booming and allows to tackle many research and practical problems of interdisciplinary character as shown above a few research domains attract particular attention of scientific community there are ongoing research and implementation studies on water quality and transport processes but the inquiry driven studies focus mostly on complex morphological settings and vegetated channels indeed still many unanswered questions refer to flow biota interactions although incomplete this list does indicate the magnitude of the tasks confronting eh as a discipline various tools built within eh are indispensable in practical implementations and in designing of various nature based solutions in river catchments as well as for assessment of the influence of various factors upon river condition the most important one is the quantification of hydrological processes and water biota interactions which should be the basis for nature based solutions a good example might be the influence of various hydraulic structures on fish and benthic invertebrates presented in this study not without significance is the fact that numerous field and laboratory investigations allow to validate and calibrate more and more numerical models built within eh area

956,environmental hydraulics a neighboring research field to ecohydrology is an intermediate area between hydrodynamics and ecology biology the main research topic of this emerging scientific discipline is the interdependency and interconnectedness between water flow and the behavior of various aquatic organisms this truly interdisciplinary approach reveals numerous unanswered questions mostly related to the relationship between water flow sediment vegetation nutrients and harmful substances in the hydro environment and leads to better insight into river status often called river health in this paper we review some of the basic research questions and challenges in the field of environmental hydraulics the discussion is inspired by the outcomes of the recent 6th iahr europe congress 2020 where the community of hydro engineers met experts engaged in the unesco intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp viii keywords river health environmental hydraulics river status nature based solutions water quality vegetated channels 1 introduction recent decades have witnessed the successful development of methods facilitating the study of various interactions between water movement transport of contaminants and biological life in the aquatic environment such interactions have been referred to as either environmental hydraulics or ecohydraulics depending on the focus of the study moreover when we reach back to the fundamentals researchers also often speak about environmental fluid mechanics irrespective of what terminology is preferred however we are nowadays certainly witnessing the emergence of a new research discipline that takes the seemingly simple approach of melding and principles of aquatic ecology and fluvial geomorphology with engineering hydraulics nestler et al 2016 point out that the main challenge of such an approach lies in the fact that hydraulic engineers and ecologists 1 study processes that differ substantially in spatial and or temporal scale 2 have very different approaches to modelling 3 utilize different sets of mathematical formulations concepts and assumptions and 4 address problems with vastly different patterns of complexity and uncertainty and indeed searching for solutions at the confluence of such different disciplines drives innovation and new research methods this relatively new research area has already given rise to many monographic volumes specially focused conferences zeng et al 2021 and also to the emergence of such excellent research journals as journal of ecohydraulics journal of hydro environment research and environmental fluid mechanics this very new research field its historical development together with the bibliometric analysis and its major topics have been analyzed in depth by zeng et al 2021 we do not aim to perform a separate analysis of a similar sort here rather we propose to show environmental hydraulics as a neighboring research field to ecohydrology find the relation between them and show their potential for solving the environmental challenges we will name some of the challenges that we consider most important in the field but above all we want to demonstrate what practical problems might be solved by means of methods developed within environmental hydraulics both in the assessment of river status as well as in the development of so called nature based solutions for river status improvement the inspiration for this article came from the discussions held and conclusions reached during the 6th iahr europe congress 2020 titled hydro environment research and engineering no frames no borders hereinafter the iahr congress where researchers working in various hydro science specializations had a chance to discuss research trends and different solutions offered within the broadly understood field of environmental hydraulics the meeting of engineering solutions and environmental demands necessitates the development of innovative approaches to meet future targets for water resources 2 river health concept and the need for research for millennia rivers have served as the focus of human development as a major source of fresh water and food to this very day societies benefit from the numerous ecosystem services rivers provide constanza et al 1997 however over the past century humans have dramaticallyincreased pressures on water systems threatening or deteriorating their environmental conditions as a result societal well being is also endangered as goods and services important for humanity depend to great extent on river status it is important to communicate this interrelation to society using terms that are as clear as possible while remaining scientifically based the term river health as shorthand for good river condition has been described in detail by norris and thoms 1999 for the purposes of this paper we use this term as proposed by meyer 1997 describing a healthy river ecosystem as one that is sustainable and resilient maintaining its ecological structure and function over time while continuing to meet societal needs and expectations it is important to stress that this intuitively easy to quantify term healthy river unhealthy river etc has not yet been commonly adopted or fully defined examples of definitions and concepts of ecosystem health have been presented in vugteveen et al 2006 in the eu context the similar but more technical term good ecological status forms a central point of the water framework directive wfd european commission 2000 the challenging goal of achieving healthy rivers should unite scientists and the general public the role of society in this process is clear public acceptance of the importance of river health is the only way to push decision makers first politicians then water managers towards conservation and or restoration of water ecosystems the contribution of scientists however is more difficult as they should help in selecting the relevant health symptoms fairweather p g 1999 there are a wide variety of river features that can be measured with varying accuracy and at a broad range of spatial and temporal scales there are number of ecological concepts describing the physical dimensions dynamics and biota response in order to properly scale up the processes in rivers from the environmental hydraulics perspective four of them are the most interesting for purpose of assessing river status the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 the serial discontinuity concept ward stanford 1995 the flood pulse concept junk et al 1989 and the flow pulse concept tockner et al 2000 in addition abiotic biotic regulatory concept was proposed by zalewski and naiman 1985 which was the first effort to integrate understanding of hydrological processes described by water hydraulics e g bernoulli s principle zalewski 2020 and ecosystem properties which are described in thermodynamics law and van t hoff law temperature such synthetic model of integration of hydrology and ecology for prediction of hierarchy of drivers in different systems in different parts of the world were providing theoretical framework for integration ecological and hydrological processes across the scale the temporal dimension both in terms of historical development and monitoring of possible future trajectories e g after restoration has been brought in by boon 1998 in practice however the ecological concepts are broken down to a set of indictors so as to clearly assess and compare different rivers showing their status and need for improvement it is one of the most important points where research concepts is turned to the decision making process in this process different potential actions are weighted using the variables which can be quantified and thus compared the decisions are made in most case in different form of the multicriteria methods where ecological economical and societal demands are met in most cases ecologists divide methods of river health assessment into indicator species methods and comprehensive index methods huaibin jianping 2014 indicator species methods include fish phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates as target objects to assess the health of a river ecosystem biological monitoring and biological data provide the most integrative view of river condition or river health thus multimetric biological indices are an important approach for measuring a river s condition and assessing its status comprehensive index methods on the other hand use indicators such as river physical chemical biological characteristics enriched with data from social economy in order to utilize different sources and scales of information this may reflect the river habitat and biota condition the social and or economical function or pressures on the system index methods have produced an impressive number of analyses and critical reflections e g reviewed in vugteveen et al 2006 gippel et al 2017 indicators are crucial to many socio political schemes for identifying environmental influences of society i e differentiating the present condition of the environment from the anthropogenic pressures upon it hang et al 2010 this allows for the formulation any societal responses to alleviate identified pressures and or restore river conditions to those which we can be described as healthy there is common agreement that indicators have a fundamental technical basis in science supporting their usage in decision making lenders knippenberg 2005 however the criteria used in interpreting indicator values good bad healthy unhealthy etc are likely to go beyond scientific grounds and in many cases are ultimately socially determined this means that scientists should insist on society s involvement in such assessments and reporting as figure 1 shows with increasing pressure on particular elements of the system starting on a river segment but often going beyond the river channel or valley changing the characteristics and functioning of the catchment the abiotic and biota quality is decreasing furthermore degradation of the abiotic structure such as flow sediment movement or riverbed characteristics gives rise to positive feedback on the biota leading to further damage such non linear relations between pressure river abiotic elements and biota may include certain tipping points and internal relations these are crucial in formulating tasks for environmental hydraulics compare fig 3 which is a helpful tool both for identifying the processes most important for river health conservation or restoration as well as for choosing the best performing indicators however a full understanding of changes to a river ecosystem s structure and functioning from a relatively natural to a profoundly damaged system requires knowledge of physical chemical and ecological properties at many spatial and temporal scales in this respect ecohydrology as a sub discipline of sustainability science focused on development of solutions and implementation of different measures for enhancement of catchment sustainability potential and the river ecological status plays an important role it focuses on functioning of river lake reservoir ecosystem in the catchment perspective because ecological status of freshwater ecosystems is determined by hydrological cycle biological structure of the catchment human activities and human impact all of them determinants of ecologicalstatus catchment approach in ecohydrology has been explained by 1 terrestrial phase of the hydrological circle water plant eamus et al 2006 rodrigues iturbe 2000 and 2 freshwater ecosystem phase zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2000 zalewski 2014 chicharo et al 2001 wolanski 2007 harper et al 2008 this second phase is core of ecohydraulics as initiated by statzner statzner and holm 1989 and formalised by harleman 1991 the merit of transdisciplinary ecohydrology is the translation of water biota interplay into dual regulation of processes by development of nature based solutions which consist of three steps 1 mitigation of impacts e g increase in catchment retentiveness forestry soil organic matter buffering land water ecotonal zones 2 enhancement of resilience of freshwater ecosystem biomanipulation hrbacek et al 1961 brooks dodgeson 1965 hydrobiomanipulation zalewski et al 1990 and 3 enhancement of river self purification creation of land water ecotones of intermediate complexity again first and second steps are supported by the knowledge gained in ecohydraulics field of research considering all of the above introduced perspectives one might say that ecohydraulics can be considered as a subdiscipline of ecohydrology focused on instream flow regimes influence for aquatic flora and fauna whereas ecohydrology is a holistic catchment approach for development of nature based solutions nbs and solutions for enhancement of catchment sustainability potential wbsr of river systems especially resilience r the input from integrated water resources management iwrm and ecohydraulics has be in the context of the catchment processes and water plant soil interactions defined by ecohydrology by mentioning the iwrm one should also take into account the human perspective and perception of conservation and restoration processes by catchment population communicating the results of monitoring and assessments of changes in a river system to civil society is critical if the river health status is to influence environmental policies currently there is a growing awareness of the added value of the restoration projects and in fact for number of people the cultural services are much more important than the primary es that are targeted by the flood protection water alimentation or regulation of water quality to meet the legal requirements in case of restoration or conservation projects close to the big cities e g schelde estuary close to antwerp or danube floodplains close to vienna vistula protected river banks in warsaw etc we see then also an explosion of recreation along the river a lot of people walking cycling but also small businesses that appear a restaurant café or company organising excursions etc so the societal recognition is very important for defining other the provision or regulation services provided by a river this phenomena can be described in the form of response curve as shown in fig 2 the role of cooperation with society in the restoration project was described by wassen et al 2011 in broader sense for water management planning by gielczewski et al 2011 by using the results of demonstration projects or environmental models to describe the condition or health of rivers and their adjacent landscapes and to diagnose the causes of degradation we can develop restoration plans estimate the ecological risks associated with land use plans in a watershed or select among alternative development options to minimize river degradation 3 environmental hydraulics selected advances and challenges as mentioned above environmental hydraulics is a broad research domain and herein we shall focus on those problems that are directly or indirectly related to river health and where the link with biological life is rather straightforward we draw our inspiration from the discussions during the iahr congress and our personal experience of course the significance of any research advance or challenge whether achieved or aspired to is a subjective matter of opinion as such the list given below is admittedly partial incomplete and possibly biased toward transport processes and flows through vegetated channels our current understanding of environmental hydraulics eh goes far beyond the definition offered by harleman 1991 for whom the evolution of environmental hydraulics has occurred along three lines 1 mechanics of jet mixing 2 mechanics of stratified flows and 3 the transport and fate of pollutants in the natural environment those areas are embedded in what we mean by eh but many more issues are discussed nowadays we will concentrate on various problems but in each case the studies presented related to 1 understanding of physical processes and interdependence with ecological biological processes 2 field studies 3 laboratory experiments 4 modeling 5 implementation of designed scientific tools 6 practical solutions e g as nature based solutions surface water quality is definitely a factor crucial for the health of a river under consideration it may be based on numerous parameters such as ph dissolved oxygen do suspended solids ss chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 potassium permanganate index ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and other more detailed parameters but the dynamics of the transfer of the above quantities is crucial for in depth understanding and assessment of for instance a stream s capacity for self purification when a certain amount of contaminant is released into a watercourse it is carried downstream by the fluid motion and is continually mixed and redistributed within the water the basic fundamentals of this process are well studied resting upon the laws of conservation of mass and energy numerous models have been developed all over the world moreover transport and mixing processes have been the subject of countless monographs textbooks and review papers e g clark 1996 rowiński 2002 czernuszenko rowiński 2005 benedini tsakiris 2013 fu et al 2020 nonetheles researchers are still seeking relevant descriptions once the situation becomes more complex we still encounter problems understanding the transport processes under very complex geometries or unsteady flow conditions figure 3 shows that the transport of constituents by the dispersion advection or other processes is dependent on the hydrologic and hydrodynamic characteristics of a channel and they in turn depend on the geometry and morphometry of the river reach the more geometrically complex the setting is the more uncertain is the mathematical representation of the system if we also consider the presence of vegetation along river channels the transport processes become particularly difficult to describe vegetation influences the flow resistance of the watercourse creates additional drag causes violent transverse mixing due to great differences in velocities between the vegetated and non vegetated regions and affects turbulence intensity and diffusion on top of that riparian vegetation often significantly alters the channel geometry it is well known that transport equations take the general form of advection diffusion equations with additional source terms responsible for biological or chemical reactions however these equations themselves introduce numerous weaknesses and knowledge gaps most of the problems are related to the original sin of environmental hydraulics namely inaccurate description of the velocity field as well as resistance to flow whendeveloping models there is always a trade off between retaining greater detail of the processes under study and deriving tractable equations kalinowska rowiński 2012 inevitably some details are simplified in or even excluded from the models that we use to tackle the problems of river health although in the general situation the admixture concentration of the temperature distribution in rivers should be described by three dimensional equations we often seek to reduce it to two 2d or even one dimensional 1d situations depth or cross sectional averaging of equations introduces dispersion tensors or dispersion coefficients whose determination constitutes one of the basic tasks in environmental hydraulics and is a continually developing branch of eh involving either field investigations tracer tests detailed laboratory studies or now increasingly often artificial intelligence techniques e g wallis and manson 2004 rowiński et al 2005 zeng huai 2013 antonopoulos et al 2015 one of the most common approaches involves the use of a compromise model between the 1d and 2d approaches utilizing the concept of transient storage such models are particularly suitable for vegetated channels or those with a relatively complex geometry with pronounced riverbed irregularities river bends side pockets coves and also observed mass exchange with hyporheic zones see e g bencala walters 1983 czernuszenko and rowiński 1997 boano et al 2014 knapp kelleher 2020 these are probably the most popular models that to some extent reflect the complexity of riverine transport and they reconstruct the skewed solute breakthrough curves and their tailing behavior how intricate the situation is may be illustrated based on tracer tests such tests which are experiments allowing us to better understand how pollutants are mixed and transported in a particular stream consist in instantaneously injecting a known quantity of a solution of a given marker into a stream and observing the variation in its concentration as it moves downstream sukhodolov et al 1997 boxall and guymer 2007 rowiński et al 2008 the search for a substance suitable for this purpose but also environmentally safe and not threatening to the health of the river itself still remains a point of debate behrens et al 2001 rowiński chrzanowski 2011 koch et al 2021 skjoldin et al 2021 it seems that two hydroengineering topics are coming to the forefront one related to simulations and analysis of mixing and transport processes in the presence of vegetation in fluvial and marine environments and another involving plastics in rivers and in the aquatic environment both of them are crucial when river health is taken into account indeed new results reported in the recent literature confirm that observation the quite recent review by rowiński et al 2018 revealed the potential of vegetation for reducing pollution concentrations in watercourses in the context of nature based solutions in agriculture regions numerous papers have tackled the problem of ways of understanding and predicting how pollutants disperse in vegetation e g mossa et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2017 2019 termini 2019 park hwang 2019 guo et al 2020 but in spite of an abundance of studies on dispersion processes in the presence of various kinds of vegetation this is an area that will definitely require further analyses in laboratory and field conditions studies on microplastics transportation in the aquatic environment are quite new on the scientific scene and they are gaining increasing attention also within eh microplastic concentration is definitely a new relatively rarely recognized indication of river health and it seems that understanding of the transport of plastic particles in rivers a subject that definitely within the eh discipline is still very much in its infancy waldschläger schüttrumpf 2019 the authors of that study performed more than 500 experiments on the effects of particle shape size and density on the rise and settling velocities of microplastics it is most likely the only such exhaustive investigation of the process to date one can state that we are seeing the birth of a new research domain unfortunately necessitated by dramatic pollution detected in flowing surface waters sapea 2019 the above considerations are fully in agreement with the concept of zeng et al 2021 that the scientific focus of eh has been directed among others towards full consideration of the connections between physical chemical and biotic components of a natural water system around the concept of environmental interface marion et al 2014 so far we have focused on the influence of flow vegetation interface on the transport processes similar attention should be paid to sediment water interactions and hyporheic exchange and air water interactions we do realize that diffusional exchange of solutes between the water column and the bed sediment is one of key factors of water quality this applies also to dissolved oxygen a problem that we will briefly discuss later as figure 3 shows transport processes depend on the channel s roughness and velocity field two areas that constitute the very basics of open channel hydraulics knight et al 2010 we do realize it is cliché to note that the flow of water in rivers is governed by conservation of mass energy and momentum however we might quantify those laws the resistance to flow is the crucial part one of the key questions of eh is assessing the retardance of flow due to frictional resistance of water along the wetted perimeter as well as resistance imposed by various objects including vegetation elements in spite of a very long history of studies focused on it the accurate determination of roughness is not straightforward due to complex geometries spatial heterogeneity of riverbeds the stochastic nature of roughness often unsteadiness of the flow itself flow resistance is of extreme importance since it results in energy losses which determine the frictional force of water along the riverbed and riverbanks expressed as bed shear stresses or bed shear velocities those values have further consequences and among other things determine the turbulence flow structure quick recent development of this subject area is possible due to new available techniques such as close range photogrammetry and laser scanning allowing for the development of high precision digital elevation models applied to bed surface structure roughness and its description in terms of bed shear stresses has been a subject of many dedicated reports book chapters and review papers ferguson 2010 rowiński et al 2005 aberle and smart 2003 powell 2014 mrokowska rowinski 2017 understanding and determining flow velocity field is probably the most crucial part of all hydrodynamics considerations herein we would like to stress an emerging subtopic the structure of turbulence velocity field in vegetated channels vegetation is critical for the quality of biodiversity and better understanding of flow vegetation interactions is a must for properly approaching this aspect of river health in healthy rivers vegetation is helpful in tackling river management problems such as resilience to flooding transport of substances mentioned earlier and improvement of ecological status rowiński et al 2018 vegetation influences hydraulic resistance and conveyance and modifies the turbulent velocity field the latter constitutes a subject of new research developments in many scientific centers moreover vegetation affects backwater profiles sediment transport and channel morphology also solute and particulate budgets on the other hand side river flow influences the shapes sizes and spatial distributions of vegetated patches and mosaics and hence the habitat structure aberle and järvelä 2015 keizer et al 2016 with countless possible arrangements it offers a fascinating platform for basic research investigations it must be borne in mind that we may be dealing with fully vegetated channels vegetation patches within the channels or riparian vegetation vegetation might be submerged or emerged stiff or elastic with leaves or without in each case the turbulent velocity characteristics may become totally different the processes are studied over the scale of individual vegetation elements through canopy scale patch scale towards the scale of longer river reaches rich information has already been collected from many field and laboratory studies but it is too early for definite generalizations and it is clear that studies of this sort will continue for many years see e g nepf and vivoni 2000 nikora 2010 nepf 2012 nikora et al 2012 sukhodolova sukhodolov 2012 cameron et al 2013 caroppi et al 2019 2021 jahadi et al 2019 vegetation often serves for nature based solutions allowing for improvements in river health for example in the study of kałuża et al 2018 river deflectors called plant basket hydraulic structures were introduced the proposed solution also included the construction of vegetative sediment traps pbhs to initiate the hydromorphological processes in the river such solutions not only improved the hydromorphological status of the river but also triggered the meandering process in the channel the wetted perimeter is clearly one of the most crucial physical dimensions that can be changed by altered flow regimes acreman and dunbar 2004 here we enter the broad field of sediment transport in rivers which obviously goes far beyond this brief review local scouring erosion due to floods dam breaching flows aggradations and degradations of the riverbed bed motion play key role for the river health and constitute an important part of environmental hydraulics see e g dey 2014 in the context of eh two trends should be mentioned one is related to studies of flow vegetation sediment interactions see e g västilä et al 2016 wang et al 2015 hamidifar et al 2020 li et al 2018 it has been shown that vegetation counteracts the deformation and the erosion of the bed sediment fosters the bed stability and improves the water quality by removing suspended particles on the other hand sediment transport causes the reduction of photosynthetic capacity of vegetation by decreasing the water transparency and hindering the exchange of gas and nutrients between plants and water by attaching particles to plant leaves another research trend of great consequence for river health is sediment transport under unsteady flow conditions caused by snowmelts glacial processes excessive rainfall dam water releases etc quantification of the mobile riverbed response to flood waves has so far been one of the least successful areas of fluvial hydrodynamics and we may expect an influx of models based on new experimental field and laboratory data tabarestani zarrati 2015 fielding et al 2018 mrokowska rowiński 2019 on the opposing side of the environmental interfaces are the processes allowing for aeration of water oxygen can be transferred through the water surface for example due to disturbances on water surfaces caused by wind but obviously there are other processes driving oxygen into the water such as incoming streams flood waves waterfalls and obviously the process of photosynthesis when water plants release oxygen dissolved oxygen is one of fundamental indicators of the biological health of rivers and is subject to strong fluctuations over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales it is primarily dependent upon water temperature but is influenced by the changing hydro meteorological conditions and the intensity of biological processes such as photosynthesis respiration and decomposition of organic matter rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 dissolved oxygen is strongly linked to another important notion of eh namely stream metabolism one innovative way of estimating how respiration and photosynthesis contribute to carbon cycling and energy flow to food webs involves the use of the open channel diel oxygen method single or two station which is in fact the balancing of oxygen concentration over a defined river reach e g demars et al 2015 noteably prediction of the fate and transport of dissolved oxygen within fluvial systems involves the same transport processes that we have tackled above the difference lies in the description of sources of origin of oxygen within the stream another factor crucial for the biology of an aquatic ecosystem via stream ecosystem respiration gross primary productivity and ecosystem production is the thermal regime of the river under consideration water has the unique feature of absorbing thermal energy and only experiencing small changes in temperature but this means that most aquatic organisms operate in a relatively narrow temperature range river temperature is shaped by atmospheric conditions topography discharge and the composition and shape of the streambed and as such it is a subject of eh investigations elevated water temperatures affect dissolved oxygen and in extreme cases may cause elimination of some species as such better understanding of temperature oxygen stream hydraulics relation is one of major challenges in aquatic science see e g evans et al 1998 caissie 2006 kalinowska 2019 figure 3 presents in a schematic way how the complex system of eh influences the various social and natural functions of rivers responsible for their health environmental hydraulics is presented as a set of interrelationships and feedbacks between river flow both its bulk and turbulent part transport of various constituents including pollution clouds and solid particles representing natural sediments as well as artificial ones and conventionally named interfaces including the contours marking the planform curvature braiding or cross sectional shape also bed material roughness riparian vegetation as well as water surface coming into contact with air also not without significance is the fact that the riverbed is often in motion this means that any quantitative description of mass or momentum transport requires the use of complicated mathematical models in the form of differential equations with moving boundaries or so called free boundary problems simply put in most cases the domain in which the relevant differential equations are to be solved is given beforehand whereas in the case of moving boundaries we need to solve often difficult equations for the motion of the boundary itself sometimes one might conclude particularly from the hydrologic or biological literature that the driver of many processes is mean water velocity but the fact that water is in turbulent motion causes many nonlinear patterns observed within eh and in turn influencing river health mean and turbulent flow are related through traditional reynolds equations and therefore both components impact other processes in rivers many of them occur through the interface regions buffer or ecotone zones and they become crucial not only for the course of transport processes for instance but are also of utmost importance for indicators of river health it is worth pointing out that assessing river health often involves making comparisons indicators thought to represent river health are generally compared between sites that are thought to be similar in the absence of degradation as an example let us mention the study of radecki pawlik et al 2014 presenting analyses of hydrobiological and hydraulic parameters and variables of neighboring mountain catchments jamne and jaszcze photo 1 in the polish carpathians based on the abiotic properties of two neighboring river channel ecosystems including environmental hydraulics parameters like shear stress river bulk velocities froude and reynolds numbers granulometric properties of gravel water movement numbers as well as a hydrobiological benthic invertebrate based index it was shown that even though the valleys of the two small streams are similar in size and geological characteristics and are located nearby one another they exhibit completely different flow conditions which influence the hydrobiological status of those rivers eh is often identified with ecohydraulics which in turn is seen as a discipline elucidating the relationships between aquatic organisms and physical processes mostly flow in rivers most of the papers in the quite recently launched journal of ecohydraulics deal with this subject matter gibbins 2015 puts it somewhat poetically claiming that the forces of flowing water create the tune to which in order to persist stream dwelling organisms must be able to dance flow therefore has a direct effect on them but we should bear in mind that various organisms influence riverbed conditions and hence the flow itself one problem that attracts particular attention relates to the negative impacts of various artificial hydraulic structures and barriers on river morphology and ecology these structures are also known to have negative impacts on freshwater river system morphology and ecology including the blockage of upstream fish passage particularly small body mass fish species which calls for immediate solution whereas the processes are not sufficiently understood numerous publications on such topics appear every year e g albayrak et al 2020 chanson leng 2021 channing syms et al 2021 a good example of such studies presents the effects of constructed ramp hydraulic structures for fish passage on mountain creeks plesiński et al 2018 the authors evaluated the effectiveness of a block ramp for upstream fish movement in a mountain stream see photo 2 note that block ramps are usually considered to be environmentally friendly solutions and they are constructed to stabilize the riverbed and prevent it from incision and lateral erosion that detailed study clearly shows that the block ramp cannot provide longitudinal connectivity and migration of fish occurring in the mountain stream one particular reason for the low accessibility of the ramp for fish is excessively strong water current stream concentration created an unsurmountable velocity barrier for fish moving upstream for each of the analyzed discharges it has been shown that some crevices in the side zones of the ramp could be parts of the migration corridor but only for small and medium sized fish such constructions therefore have a considerable impact on river health another aspect is that discharge and the submergence of the rapid ramp is crucial in the spatial differentiation of water temperature and do concentration rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2020 at the end of our story about environmental hydraulics it is worth pointing out that this research domain very often triggers the development of unique research methods whose applications go far beyond this discipline one example might be so called double averaging methodology dam a kind of combination of fundamental conservation principles and statistical properties applied to rough wall turbulent flows i e those that appear in eh although the roots of the method can be sought in porous media hydrodynamics its rapid progress has been observed in atmospheric physics on the one hand and broadly understood eh on the other nikora et al 2007 nikora rowiński 2008 vowinckel et al 2017 although this method has developed quite recently it has become almost classical in the studies of rough bed flows and therefore of crucial importance for in depth understanding of the health of the rivers 4 lessons learned at iahr europe congress the iahr congress also offered other important observations related to the aim of this paper overall we are definitely seeing the ongoing interconnection of issues related to the motion of water with bio eco components with ecohydraulics and environmental hydrodynamics appearing as emerging scientific disciplines a lot of presentations touched upon various kinds of nature based solutions and as was strongly echoed such solutions must be sought for with the engagement of society and stakeholders of special importance was the unesco special session titled ecohydrology translation of science into innovation and solutions in accordance with the 8th phase of the unesco intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp viii with the leitmotif science and global water security the session was designed to show how integration of hydroengineering and the integrative science ecohydrology allows for development of innovative solutions towards solving global regional and local water problems integrated knowledge in the field of ecology and hydrology aligned with hydroengineering solutions is enhancing the potential for sustainable development in a given catchment area this involves the concept known as wbsrc estrategy comprising water w biodiversity b ecosystem services s resilience to anthropogenic stress and climate change r climate and education c education e e g zalewski 2014 it was stressed by the chair of the session maciej zalewski that the recent exploitative mechanistic paradigm of water resources management where declining water resources are only protected by reactive measures focused on mitigating impacts such as pollution and flood risk are not sufficient this makes the evolutionary ecosystemic wbscrc paradigm so crucial nowadays it has also been shown that the success of relevant implementations of various solutions may be enhanced by the proper use of so called foresight methodology i e studying alternative paths of development depending on the assumed concrete solutions in other words foresight is used to build multiple scenarios and the mathematical models developed within eh may become extremely useful for this purpose yet another philosophy that strongly overlaps with the aims of eh towards assessment or improvement or river health is the river culture concept which touches upon one aspect namely the improvement of human river relationships as a baseline for sustainable river management wantzen et al 2016 this concept integrates adaptations by non human organisms to the flood pulse in an ecosystem level bionic approach as well as from cultural emanations of humans living in floodplains studies of how eh methods may help the development of these other approaches and vice versa are still a job for the future similarly we do not yet have in depth analyses of how adaptive management practices gunderson et al 1995 could be improved with the use of eh methods after all this is again the search for good modeling tools allowing us to answer how ecosystems respond to management actions we could learn a lot from numerous innovative nature based solutions zalewski et al 2018 from many sites all over the world notably all of them have drawn upon in depth knowledge of eh processes though often without emphasizing this fact examples include such solutions as the recovery of artificial lakes to recharge aquifers and retain runoff in southern ecuador albarracín et al 2019 artificial wetlands for the treatment of wastewater in artisanal fish food industries in the pelican bay watershed ecohydrological measures to improve water quality in the mara river a transboundary water body between tanzania and kenya mango et al 2011 and many many others all these examples are embedded in the policy of unesco s intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp promoting the establishment of various demonstration sites around the world in order to achieve sustainability of ecosystems related with water note that all such solutions should be characterized by cost effectiveness for example if we think of the role of riparian vegetation implementation of vegetation based solutions does not seem to be particularly expensive and crucially it can be implemented by local farmers in the same vein one of the keynote lectures at the iahr congress by thomas heine followed by in depth debate concerned the danube river as a good example of proposed floodplain restoration to improve ecosystem functions and services at the river scale e g funk et al 2019 this is a highly complex socioecological system and a hotspot of biodiversity and ecosystem services especially considering the floodplain systems but it is also affected by multiple human activities like navigation hydropower urban development and agriculture making this particular river floodplain system considerably threatened it is worth pointing out that the lack of available experience meant that the adaptive management concept was implemented in the austrian section of the danube thus small steps were taken while continuously analyzing how the complex floodplain systems reacted various engineering measures aimed to improve hydrological connectivity like lowering the riverside embankments creating overflow sills and other artificial openings connecting the main river and side arms required in depth eh analyses similarly another keynote lecturer patrick meire raised the issue of integrated ecosystem based management of the schelde estuary and extended this to a wider vision of managing coastal systems he advocated for a more ecosystem based approach using nature based solutions as the relevant approach which in turn requires detailed understanding of the hydro environment interrelationships being the subject of eh the iahr europe congress turned out to be a unique event in the sense that two distinct communities met one gathering specialists in broadly understood hydroengineering and hydro physics and the other associated with various water related programs of unesco debate at the crossroads of various disciplines yielded fruitful results and opened up directions for future research which should aim at holistic global scientific assessment drawing upon eh investigations habersack et al 2018 among other sources 5 concluding remarks the term river health which describes good river conditions appears to be a useful tool for communication purposes to deliver the scientific message on river status to the public this communication between scientists and citizens should be a major driver for change in the water policy towards more environmentally oriented river basin management the environmental hydraulics offers unique opportunity for identifying relations between abiotic and biotic components of rivers and river valleys it is important for both choice of proper rh indicators as well as their validation for classification purposes as we are observing growing trend in societal perception of new ecosystem services belonging to river system such e g biodiversity conservation landscape integrity recreation potential including amateur fishing or bird watching etc there is more demand on better description of natural or semi natural systems including predictions of biota reaction on different anthrop pressures this in turn needs better process understanding measurement and modelling methods due to bigger heterogeneity of natural systems eh is booming and allows to tackle many research and practical problems of interdisciplinary character as shown above a few research domains attract particular attention of scientific community there are ongoing research and implementation studies on water quality and transport processes but the inquiry driven studies focus mostly on complex morphological settings and vegetated channels indeed still many unanswered questions refer to flow biota interactions although incomplete this list does indicate the magnitude of the tasks confronting eh as a discipline various tools built within eh are indispensable in practical implementations and in designing of various nature based solutions in river catchments as well as for assessment of the influence of various factors upon river condition the most important one is the quantification of hydrological processes and water biota interactions which should be the basis for nature based solutions a good example might be the influence of various hydraulic structures on fish and benthic invertebrates presented in this study not without significance is the fact that numerous field and laboratory investigations allow to validate and calibrate more and more numerical models built within eh area

957,the pressure placed on global water resources by landscape modification and various forms of pollution is being exacerbated by climate change while substantial progress has been observed in the field of wastewater treatment less attention has been given on how to reduce the impact of diffuse sources such as runoff from agriculture and urban areas to make further progress in water quality management stronger links with nature have to be made through the implementation of new ecosystem based strategies to mitigate the impact of anthropopressure and build ecosystem resilience a framework for the implementation of such solutions is provided by ecohydrology a science that translates abiotic biotic processes ranging from the molecular to the catchment scale to develop new systemic management of water resources an integral part of this strategy is the implementation of ecohydrological nature based solutions eh nbs for water quality and quantity improvement with growing popularity of such solutions questions arise about their future optimization scenarios this short article presents i the current state of research and development in eh nbs ii recent hybrid advancements for enhancing nbs efficiency and iii discusses the integration of eh nbs with circular economy ce to facilitate broad scale implementation keywords ecohydrology nature based solutions water quality biogeochemistry circular economy 1 ecohydrological nature based solutions its origins the unesco intergovernmental hydrological unesco ihp and unesco man and biosphere programs have been instrumental in the rapid development of aquatic and environmental sciences from structure descriptive towards problem solving approaches their efforts have resulted in the recognition of the important role played by ecosystems in water cycle regulation and in the development of the concept of ecohydrology zalewski et al 1997 ecohydrology is a science that integrates multidisciplinary knowledge to improve understanding of ecosystem processes and their use in sustainable water management zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2002 the idea is rooted in the abiotic biotic regulatory concept abrc which was created to explain the hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors involved in controlling fish populations in river systems zalewski and naiman 1985 despite originally being aimed at explaining the structure and variability of river ichthyofauna communities this hierarchy can also be adapted to model the dynamics of biogeochemical processes in river systems therefore abrc later evolved towards the dual regulation concept where abiotic factors can regulate biotic ones and vice versa zalewski 2002 the advent of new molecular tools in the last decades allowed abrc to enter a new era giving rise to an in depth understanding of how hydrodynamics affect microbial processes and thus the overall carrying capacity of a system fazi et al 2016 while the term nature based solutions nbs itself appeared probably for the first time at the beginning of the 21st century and it became widely used after 2010 cohen shacham et al 2016 the concept of using ecosystem processes to manage the quality of the aquatic environment was first formulated as part of the unesco ihp ecohydrology programme zalewski et al 1997 at a basic level an approach based on ecohydrology is one that modulates ecological and hydrological processes from the molecular to the catchment scale with the aim of creating system solutions capable of effectively mitigating an intermediate level human impact on the environment at the local scale while increasing the overall resilience of ecosystems zalewski 2002 zalewski et al 1997 this approach is extremely important as we are currently crossing several planetary boundaries including those linked to the nitrogen n and phosphorus p cycles rockstrom et al 2009 with a greater understanding of biogeochemical cycles and in concert with ecological engineering mitsch and jorgensen 1989 2003 ecohydrological approach can be used to support the development and implementation of nbs aimed at improving the management of water quality and quantity the importance of nbs is comprehensively discussed in the 2018 world water development report wwdr 2018 and has been closely linked to the ecohydrology concept in a number of studies e g bridgewater 2018 zalewski et al 2018 krauze and wagner 2019 in the present study to underline their conceptual background we intentionally propose the new term ecohydrological nature based solutions eh nbs for a subset of methods within nbs 2 eh nbs the current state one of the first eh nbs to be implemented was the sequential sedimentation biofiltration system ssbs zalewski et al 2012 which prototype was implemented in lodz poland as part of the european union eu project switch ip 6 pr ue goce 018530 2006 2011 the ssbs contains three zones designed to enhance different self purification processes the first is shaped using artificial surfaces with a reinforced bottom intended to enhance sedimentation essential for long term efficiency the second biogeochemical zone is usually constructed with calcium based rocks allowing adsorption and precipitation of p pollution over time the bio prefix becomes dominant as biofilm structures develop on the surface of rocks and take a greater role in nutrient removal font najera et al 2021b the last zone consisting of constructed wetland cw uses the potential of biotic components including plants and microorganisms to enhance biodegradation mineralization uptake and assimilation processes zalewski et al 2012 thanks to this zonation the system provides a range of abiotic conditions which can regulate self purification processes through various types of metabolic activity font najera et al 2020 as well as bacterial abundance and community structure font najera et al 2020 font najera et al 2021b ssbs can be applied both in rural and urban catchments both located on the side arm of a stream or directly inside drainage ditches zalewski et al 2012 izydorczyk et al 2015 the ssbs concept has given rise to other new technologies one is the sequential biofiltration system sbs designed to work as a post treatment step in wastewater treatment plants kiedrzyńska et al 2017 another modification is the hybrid ssbs intended for urban catchments with high sediment concentrations which uses additional underground separators to provide an additional pre treatment step jurczak et al 2018 a comparison of different eh nbs is presented in table 1 more general review of nbs services and efficiency has been recently presented by de macedo et al 2021a and wwdr 2018 other types of eh nbs have been developed to limit the impact of agricultural pollution buffer zones are known to reduce n and p diffuse pollution through a range of mechanisms such as sorption biodegradation assimilation and sedimentation e g hill 2019 pärn et al 2012 however agricultural areas often lack the space for wide buffer zones which are needed to effectively reduce pollution in such cases buffering processes can be enhanced by modifying the microbial metabolism in denitrification barriers for example or by increasing sorption capacity both approaches named enhanced riparian buffer zones can increase the efficiency of n and p removal in shallow groundwater runoff izydorczyk et al 2013 izydorczyk et al 2018 frątczak et al 2019 in addition to agricultural areas these zones are useful in sites where sewage tank leakage occurs izydorczyk et al 2013 fratczak et al 2019 in order to remove phosphates po4 the barrier can be filled with dolomites and limestones with a diameter of 5 8 cm and placed transverse to the water flow frątczak et al 2019 found the mean efficiency of such a po4 barrier to be 12 4 over a period of 3 5 years however their findings indicate that the available sorption sites became depleted over use as in the first year the effectiveness was 58 1 in parallel denitrification barriers have been developed and evaluated in many locations worldwide with different carbon sources applied for the removal of nitrates no3 gibert et al 2008 in the case of point sources of pollution particularly within unprotected manure heaps n pollution can be concentrated in agricultural catchments such conditions require the use of another eh nbs the organic manure plate bednarek et al 2010 mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 which can remove up to 90 of soluble n in the groundwater passing through the underground barrier 3 the future of eh nbs what challenges are ahead among the self purification processes taking place of aquatic ecosystems the sorption desorption equilibrium and biodegradation are believed to have the most significant effect holvoet et al 2007 kalwasińska et al 2011 the proper management of both processes can enhance the total efficiency of nbs for pollutant removal nevertheless the efficiency of both conventional and eh nbs water purification systems decrease over time mitsch 2012 while an ssbs created as part of the switch project was able to remove 50 of p in the first two years from construction zalewski et al 2012 its efficiency dropped to 37 3 p in subsequent years szklarek et al 2018 saturation of sorption material is commonly observed in constructed wetlands cws dunne and reddy 2005 vymazal 2010 therefore probably the greatest challenge in eh nbs design is ensuring efficient long term removal of p as the process is complex being controlled by several factors including redox conditions adsorption capacity and ph funes et al 2018 the effectiveness of the adsorption and precipitation process is also influenced by the growth of microorganisms which form biofilm on the surface of the adsorption material in particular biofilms bring hydrodynamic retention and biochemical processing into close spatial proximity and influence biogeochemical patterns however biofilm development is characterized by increments in biomass in its earlier stages with the development of a thick three dimensional structure during maturation once mature biofilms reach a critical thickness the biomass starts to detach from the substrate and be released into the water flow lupini et al 2011 fazi et al 2016 biofilm growth is highly dependent on the material used for the substrate some biofilm systems use attachment materials with a high number of crevasses that create additional attachment area indeed permeable reactive barriers pbrs constructed with limestone demonstrate higher metabolic activity than in those built with dolomite font najera et al 2021b this may be due to the higher porosity of limestone which facilitates the growth of microorganisms in addition eh nbs efficiency can be significantly influenced by the composition and dynamics of the bacterial community in the biofilms as the presence of certain bacterial functional groups can metabolize specific pollutants font najera et al 2020 efficiency can only be improved when the adsorption material undergoes regular exchange or regeneration with currently used materials with a bulk mass above 1000 kg m 3 barrier replacement can be complicated and costly and its operation may disrupt the developed biotic processes therefore there is a need to identify new adsorption materials 3 1 new adsorbing materials adsorption materials can be divided into natural types waste products and artificial designed types vohla et al 2011 some of the popular materials used in water treatment include gravel mann and bavor 1993 dolomite karaca et al 2006 zeolite sakadevan and bavor 1998 and slag oguz 2004 however flitralite adam et al 2007 and polonite are artificial alternatives karczmarczyk and bus 2014 sorbents based on organic compounds such as chitosan biopolymer membranes have also been found to offer effective removal including micropollutants such as pesticides carneiro et al 2015 in recent years biochar has also gained popularity as a matrix capable of removing many organic impurities from aqueous solutions bis et al 2018 khalid et al 2020 varjani et al 2019 currently the most popular sorption material in eh nbs is dolomite however dolomite based pbrs can sometimes demonstrate large fluctuations between the accumulation and release of p srinivasan et al 2008 therefore it is anticipated that new sorbents will be incorporated in eh nbs in the future although this can be challenging the application of organic based compounds in biogeochemical barriers increases the removal efficiency of more complex pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides however their use also runs the risk of p release qian et al 2013 we propose that low mass materials 500 kg m 3 may be optimal sorption substrates for eh nbs when demonstrating high efficiency towards p removal and possible efficiency for micropollutant removal one of the latest concepts in eh nbs is bioker a material which is developed from light expanded clay aggregates coated with exchangeable components such as calcite or biochar fig 1 pbrs made with bioker are six times lighter and provide 20 times higher efficiency for po4 removal compared to dolomite based pbrs zalewski 2020 the intellectual property rights for bioker have been protected by patent application no p 420265 jarosiewicz and zalewski 2017 3 2 how can our knowledge on biogeochemical processes driven by microorganisms help optimize eh nbs in ecohydrology a range of molecular methods are used both to analyze threats and explain their causes e g toxic cyanobacterial blooms and to increase the effectiveness of eh nbs for pollutant removal mankiewicz boczek 2012 zalewski et al 2012 fazi et al 2016 mierzejewska and urbaniak 2020 as microbial communities may synergistically respond to multiple external stressors and pollutants in the environment zieliński et al 2016 cibic et al 2019 fazi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 an understanding of the molecular aspects of abiotic biotic interactions can be used to optimize eh nbs functionality among the biotic components that drive the community structure microbe microbe interactions are believed to be dominant and therefore different species of bacteria are expected to co occur in the environment zhang et al 2020 this phenomenon is probably explained by the specific interactions that increase ecological performance i e such co occurrence provides benefits for the involved groups of bacteria such as cross feeding mee et al 2014 it is well known for example that algal communities influence bacterial productivity through the release of dissolved organic compounds sondergaard et al 1985 espeland et al 2001 translation of this process can be used in eh nbs for example the addition of glucose as a carbon source increased pollutant removal efficiency in experimental constructed wetlands cws kirui et al 2016 however the use of additional carbon sources to enhance microbial degradation of specific pollutants presents a challenge even at the laboratory scale artigas et al 2020 ssbs present a prime example of the effect of microbial composition in eh nbs indeed recent studies of font najera et al 2021a 2021b discuss the bacteria strains responsible for p and n transformation in ssbs however further studies are needed to understand the role of microbial communities in the transformation of nutrients and micropollutant removal in ssbss and the effect of nbs construction seasonal variations in abundance and metabolic activity in addition to nutrient utilization microbial processes can also control micropollutant removal artigas et al 2020 carles and artigas 2020 however this has not yet been studied in detail in eh nbs the general framework of operation of an eh nbs is similar to that of cws in which self purification is driven by ecohydrological processes mitsch et al 2012 vymazal and brezinova 2015 in these systems both aerobic and anaerobic conditions stimulate different metabolic pathways which play key roles in ensuring the efficiency of eh nbs such as nitrification or denitrification hence an important direction in eh nbs optimization may be to regulate oxygen concentrations by modulating aeration as it is well known that organic matter input and microbial mineralization results in oxygen decline in cws moreover as oxygen levels in nbs may vary seasonally ouellet plamondon et al 2006 artificial aeration may be an effective tool for increasing eh nbs efficiency oxygen availability directly enhances organic matter mineralization and nitrification ouellet plamondon et al 2006 or the removal of more complex pollutants such as nitrobenzene kirui et al 2016 in addition the operational costs of such solutions may be reduced by using renewable energy pollution and other abiotic factors influence the composition of bacterial communities zhang et al 2020 which may suggest that any new species added to the environment would be dominated with native species over time nevertheless the idea of bioaugmentation including mycorrhization of plant roots and bacterial inoculation is gaining popularity in the area of cws tondera et al 2021 although examples of full scale implementation of bioaugmentation are rare the future development of those solutions may be spurred by the isolation and identification of pollutant utilizing bacteria artigas et al 2020 font najera et al 2021a such implementations can also be supported through the use of biopolymers and other biofilm supporting structures the potential biopolymers as carriers of microorganisms are already well known and studied for bacteria and yeasts mungier and jung 1985 future directions for optimizing the microbial processes in eh nbs should address the carbon source microorganism relationship modification of abiotic conditions such as mentioned aeration or new methods of bioaugmentation with biopolymers 3 3 real time control in nbs management traditionally most of the nbs are constructed as the passive ones and do not adapt to the local conditions persaud et al 2019 one of the developing trends is application of real time control rtc that can assist in the system operation and optimization centralized control strategies have been originally developed for floods prevention in combined sewage overflow systems as discussed by brasil et al 2021 integration of rtc with nbs can be complex but brings a numerous benefits e g mitigation of flood risk and increase of water quality being mostly applied to urban catchments with growing availability of sensors their remote integration optimization based algorithms and artificial intelligence development rtc has a potential to become an important tool in water management sector and nbss 4 future outlook of eh nbs linking with circular economy concept one of the foundations of ecohydrology is that a successful strategy should seek to eliminate threats and amplify opportunities zalewski 1999 in recent years this concept has been particularly reflected in the process of integrating ecohydrology with the circular economy ce which has culminated in the organization of ecohydrology for the circular economy and nature based solutions towards mitigation adaptation to climate change an international symposium which took place in lodz in september 2017 zalewski et al 2018 ce focuses on a closing the loop approach that is directed toward increasing resource productivity energy efficiency and reducing pollutant emission recently ce application in water resources has been underlined by the unesco ihp phase ix strategy unesco ihp ix 2021 the circular economy is an important part of integrated water resources management also considering urban rural interlinkages and the urban water systems within their biological regions examples of integration between eh nbs and ce have recently been noted in connection with sanitation energy and food security langergraber and masi 2018 such approaches have also been used in the reuse of gray water for irrigation rozos et al 2013 however such reuse may require advanced treatment de macedo et al 2019 the further implementation of both eh nbs and ce requires identification of the potential areas of cooperation between them fig 2 for example in eh nbs vegetation can be used to support the biodiversity of river catchments accumulate pollutants enhance pollutant degradation and constitute an alternative source of energy bioenergy while sequestering co2 zalewski 2000 anaerobic digestion of biomass or its direct combustion can be performed to provide both energy and fertilizer to achieve full circulation biomass can be used for the production of biochar with simultaneous energy generation during the pyrolysis process bis et al 2018 this type of green economy creates new employment opportunities as such the ecohydrology approach not only results in improving environmental quality but can also contribute to raising the economic status and the level of sustainable development of local communities zalewski 2000 2006 banaszuk et al 2020 special focus can be given to the area of p pollution of waters both from point and area sources with main anthropogenic sources including domestic wastewater 54 agriculture 38 and industrial wastewater 8 mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 in addition to its negative impact on the aquatic environment recent reports have highlighted the potential problems related to its distribution and use in agriculture fossil p resources are only forecast to last from 50 to 100 years cordell et al 2009 and production is a significant source of environmental pollution by the heavy metals and chemicals used in the treatment of mined rocks villabla et al 2008 alternative sources of p are sought after and increasingly advanced technologies are being implemented for its recovery from wastewater kroiss et al 2011 of these methods that allow the direct use of p recovered from wastewater as a fertilizing substances are of particular interest pap et al 2020 efforts to achieve more sustainable p management also entail changes in the fertilization model to provide the minimum necessary amounts of p and increase its bioavailability to plants one example being the use of polonite as a qualitative soil improver hylander and siman 2001 due to its high selectivity and low operating costs phosphorus adsorption and desorption is currently one of the most popular methods of p recovery li et al 2019 it uses a range of materials such as dolomite piol et al 2019 modified zeolite zhan et al 2017 and magnetic materials han et al 2017 which could be integrated in eh nbs it must be stressed that more precise evaluation of new nbs must take place from laboratory controlled tests up to the pilots and demonstration sites operating in long term networks to collect reliable data on their performance de macedo et al 2021b 5 conclusions the implementation of the ecohydrology principles allows the creation of new solutions to counteract the negative effects of human pressure on the environment including pollution in most cases the key factor is the water retention time in the wetland or buffer zone as sorption processes prolong the retention time for specific pollutants and make them more available for biodegradation the relationship between adsorption processes and biological activity determines the efficiency of the system future improvements of eh nbs efficiency will be based primarily on the enhancement of sorption processes and stimulation of biodegradation however with sorption goals now clearly defined viz low mass low cost high efficiency and p recovery more attention should be devoted to understanding microbial processes and the dynamics of natural composition in the aquatic systems definitely the integration of eh nbs with ce is a win win strategy for providing solutions with long term functionality and this should be used to guide further research in this area also direction of eh nbs development towards more sustainable water resources management can be concluded with one of the goals for the unesco ihp phase ix 2021 ecohydrology research and innovation at unesco designated sites conducted and shared by the scientific community and unesco water family communicated to assess the impact of ecohydrological and nature based solutions on water cycles and include such solutions in integrated water resource management iwrm and services at all scales and in sites management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
957,the pressure placed on global water resources by landscape modification and various forms of pollution is being exacerbated by climate change while substantial progress has been observed in the field of wastewater treatment less attention has been given on how to reduce the impact of diffuse sources such as runoff from agriculture and urban areas to make further progress in water quality management stronger links with nature have to be made through the implementation of new ecosystem based strategies to mitigate the impact of anthropopressure and build ecosystem resilience a framework for the implementation of such solutions is provided by ecohydrology a science that translates abiotic biotic processes ranging from the molecular to the catchment scale to develop new systemic management of water resources an integral part of this strategy is the implementation of ecohydrological nature based solutions eh nbs for water quality and quantity improvement with growing popularity of such solutions questions arise about their future optimization scenarios this short article presents i the current state of research and development in eh nbs ii recent hybrid advancements for enhancing nbs efficiency and iii discusses the integration of eh nbs with circular economy ce to facilitate broad scale implementation keywords ecohydrology nature based solutions water quality biogeochemistry circular economy 1 ecohydrological nature based solutions its origins the unesco intergovernmental hydrological unesco ihp and unesco man and biosphere programs have been instrumental in the rapid development of aquatic and environmental sciences from structure descriptive towards problem solving approaches their efforts have resulted in the recognition of the important role played by ecosystems in water cycle regulation and in the development of the concept of ecohydrology zalewski et al 1997 ecohydrology is a science that integrates multidisciplinary knowledge to improve understanding of ecosystem processes and their use in sustainable water management zalewski et al 1997 zalewski 2002 the idea is rooted in the abiotic biotic regulatory concept abrc which was created to explain the hierarchy of abiotic and biotic factors involved in controlling fish populations in river systems zalewski and naiman 1985 despite originally being aimed at explaining the structure and variability of river ichthyofauna communities this hierarchy can also be adapted to model the dynamics of biogeochemical processes in river systems therefore abrc later evolved towards the dual regulation concept where abiotic factors can regulate biotic ones and vice versa zalewski 2002 the advent of new molecular tools in the last decades allowed abrc to enter a new era giving rise to an in depth understanding of how hydrodynamics affect microbial processes and thus the overall carrying capacity of a system fazi et al 2016 while the term nature based solutions nbs itself appeared probably for the first time at the beginning of the 21st century and it became widely used after 2010 cohen shacham et al 2016 the concept of using ecosystem processes to manage the quality of the aquatic environment was first formulated as part of the unesco ihp ecohydrology programme zalewski et al 1997 at a basic level an approach based on ecohydrology is one that modulates ecological and hydrological processes from the molecular to the catchment scale with the aim of creating system solutions capable of effectively mitigating an intermediate level human impact on the environment at the local scale while increasing the overall resilience of ecosystems zalewski 2002 zalewski et al 1997 this approach is extremely important as we are currently crossing several planetary boundaries including those linked to the nitrogen n and phosphorus p cycles rockstrom et al 2009 with a greater understanding of biogeochemical cycles and in concert with ecological engineering mitsch and jorgensen 1989 2003 ecohydrological approach can be used to support the development and implementation of nbs aimed at improving the management of water quality and quantity the importance of nbs is comprehensively discussed in the 2018 world water development report wwdr 2018 and has been closely linked to the ecohydrology concept in a number of studies e g bridgewater 2018 zalewski et al 2018 krauze and wagner 2019 in the present study to underline their conceptual background we intentionally propose the new term ecohydrological nature based solutions eh nbs for a subset of methods within nbs 2 eh nbs the current state one of the first eh nbs to be implemented was the sequential sedimentation biofiltration system ssbs zalewski et al 2012 which prototype was implemented in lodz poland as part of the european union eu project switch ip 6 pr ue goce 018530 2006 2011 the ssbs contains three zones designed to enhance different self purification processes the first is shaped using artificial surfaces with a reinforced bottom intended to enhance sedimentation essential for long term efficiency the second biogeochemical zone is usually constructed with calcium based rocks allowing adsorption and precipitation of p pollution over time the bio prefix becomes dominant as biofilm structures develop on the surface of rocks and take a greater role in nutrient removal font najera et al 2021b the last zone consisting of constructed wetland cw uses the potential of biotic components including plants and microorganisms to enhance biodegradation mineralization uptake and assimilation processes zalewski et al 2012 thanks to this zonation the system provides a range of abiotic conditions which can regulate self purification processes through various types of metabolic activity font najera et al 2020 as well as bacterial abundance and community structure font najera et al 2020 font najera et al 2021b ssbs can be applied both in rural and urban catchments both located on the side arm of a stream or directly inside drainage ditches zalewski et al 2012 izydorczyk et al 2015 the ssbs concept has given rise to other new technologies one is the sequential biofiltration system sbs designed to work as a post treatment step in wastewater treatment plants kiedrzyńska et al 2017 another modification is the hybrid ssbs intended for urban catchments with high sediment concentrations which uses additional underground separators to provide an additional pre treatment step jurczak et al 2018 a comparison of different eh nbs is presented in table 1 more general review of nbs services and efficiency has been recently presented by de macedo et al 2021a and wwdr 2018 other types of eh nbs have been developed to limit the impact of agricultural pollution buffer zones are known to reduce n and p diffuse pollution through a range of mechanisms such as sorption biodegradation assimilation and sedimentation e g hill 2019 pärn et al 2012 however agricultural areas often lack the space for wide buffer zones which are needed to effectively reduce pollution in such cases buffering processes can be enhanced by modifying the microbial metabolism in denitrification barriers for example or by increasing sorption capacity both approaches named enhanced riparian buffer zones can increase the efficiency of n and p removal in shallow groundwater runoff izydorczyk et al 2013 izydorczyk et al 2018 frątczak et al 2019 in addition to agricultural areas these zones are useful in sites where sewage tank leakage occurs izydorczyk et al 2013 fratczak et al 2019 in order to remove phosphates po4 the barrier can be filled with dolomites and limestones with a diameter of 5 8 cm and placed transverse to the water flow frątczak et al 2019 found the mean efficiency of such a po4 barrier to be 12 4 over a period of 3 5 years however their findings indicate that the available sorption sites became depleted over use as in the first year the effectiveness was 58 1 in parallel denitrification barriers have been developed and evaluated in many locations worldwide with different carbon sources applied for the removal of nitrates no3 gibert et al 2008 in the case of point sources of pollution particularly within unprotected manure heaps n pollution can be concentrated in agricultural catchments such conditions require the use of another eh nbs the organic manure plate bednarek et al 2010 mankiewicz boczek et al 2017 which can remove up to 90 of soluble n in the groundwater passing through the underground barrier 3 the future of eh nbs what challenges are ahead among the self purification processes taking place of aquatic ecosystems the sorption desorption equilibrium and biodegradation are believed to have the most significant effect holvoet et al 2007 kalwasińska et al 2011 the proper management of both processes can enhance the total efficiency of nbs for pollutant removal nevertheless the efficiency of both conventional and eh nbs water purification systems decrease over time mitsch 2012 while an ssbs created as part of the switch project was able to remove 50 of p in the first two years from construction zalewski et al 2012 its efficiency dropped to 37 3 p in subsequent years szklarek et al 2018 saturation of sorption material is commonly observed in constructed wetlands cws dunne and reddy 2005 vymazal 2010 therefore probably the greatest challenge in eh nbs design is ensuring efficient long term removal of p as the process is complex being controlled by several factors including redox conditions adsorption capacity and ph funes et al 2018 the effectiveness of the adsorption and precipitation process is also influenced by the growth of microorganisms which form biofilm on the surface of the adsorption material in particular biofilms bring hydrodynamic retention and biochemical processing into close spatial proximity and influence biogeochemical patterns however biofilm development is characterized by increments in biomass in its earlier stages with the development of a thick three dimensional structure during maturation once mature biofilms reach a critical thickness the biomass starts to detach from the substrate and be released into the water flow lupini et al 2011 fazi et al 2016 biofilm growth is highly dependent on the material used for the substrate some biofilm systems use attachment materials with a high number of crevasses that create additional attachment area indeed permeable reactive barriers pbrs constructed with limestone demonstrate higher metabolic activity than in those built with dolomite font najera et al 2021b this may be due to the higher porosity of limestone which facilitates the growth of microorganisms in addition eh nbs efficiency can be significantly influenced by the composition and dynamics of the bacterial community in the biofilms as the presence of certain bacterial functional groups can metabolize specific pollutants font najera et al 2020 efficiency can only be improved when the adsorption material undergoes regular exchange or regeneration with currently used materials with a bulk mass above 1000 kg m 3 barrier replacement can be complicated and costly and its operation may disrupt the developed biotic processes therefore there is a need to identify new adsorption materials 3 1 new adsorbing materials adsorption materials can be divided into natural types waste products and artificial designed types vohla et al 2011 some of the popular materials used in water treatment include gravel mann and bavor 1993 dolomite karaca et al 2006 zeolite sakadevan and bavor 1998 and slag oguz 2004 however flitralite adam et al 2007 and polonite are artificial alternatives karczmarczyk and bus 2014 sorbents based on organic compounds such as chitosan biopolymer membranes have also been found to offer effective removal including micropollutants such as pesticides carneiro et al 2015 in recent years biochar has also gained popularity as a matrix capable of removing many organic impurities from aqueous solutions bis et al 2018 khalid et al 2020 varjani et al 2019 currently the most popular sorption material in eh nbs is dolomite however dolomite based pbrs can sometimes demonstrate large fluctuations between the accumulation and release of p srinivasan et al 2008 therefore it is anticipated that new sorbents will be incorporated in eh nbs in the future although this can be challenging the application of organic based compounds in biogeochemical barriers increases the removal efficiency of more complex pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides however their use also runs the risk of p release qian et al 2013 we propose that low mass materials 500 kg m 3 may be optimal sorption substrates for eh nbs when demonstrating high efficiency towards p removal and possible efficiency for micropollutant removal one of the latest concepts in eh nbs is bioker a material which is developed from light expanded clay aggregates coated with exchangeable components such as calcite or biochar fig 1 pbrs made with bioker are six times lighter and provide 20 times higher efficiency for po4 removal compared to dolomite based pbrs zalewski 2020 the intellectual property rights for bioker have been protected by patent application no p 420265 jarosiewicz and zalewski 2017 3 2 how can our knowledge on biogeochemical processes driven by microorganisms help optimize eh nbs in ecohydrology a range of molecular methods are used both to analyze threats and explain their causes e g toxic cyanobacterial blooms and to increase the effectiveness of eh nbs for pollutant removal mankiewicz boczek 2012 zalewski et al 2012 fazi et al 2016 mierzejewska and urbaniak 2020 as microbial communities may synergistically respond to multiple external stressors and pollutants in the environment zieliński et al 2016 cibic et al 2019 fazi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 an understanding of the molecular aspects of abiotic biotic interactions can be used to optimize eh nbs functionality among the biotic components that drive the community structure microbe microbe interactions are believed to be dominant and therefore different species of bacteria are expected to co occur in the environment zhang et al 2020 this phenomenon is probably explained by the specific interactions that increase ecological performance i e such co occurrence provides benefits for the involved groups of bacteria such as cross feeding mee et al 2014 it is well known for example that algal communities influence bacterial productivity through the release of dissolved organic compounds sondergaard et al 1985 espeland et al 2001 translation of this process can be used in eh nbs for example the addition of glucose as a carbon source increased pollutant removal efficiency in experimental constructed wetlands cws kirui et al 2016 however the use of additional carbon sources to enhance microbial degradation of specific pollutants presents a challenge even at the laboratory scale artigas et al 2020 ssbs present a prime example of the effect of microbial composition in eh nbs indeed recent studies of font najera et al 2021a 2021b discuss the bacteria strains responsible for p and n transformation in ssbs however further studies are needed to understand the role of microbial communities in the transformation of nutrients and micropollutant removal in ssbss and the effect of nbs construction seasonal variations in abundance and metabolic activity in addition to nutrient utilization microbial processes can also control micropollutant removal artigas et al 2020 carles and artigas 2020 however this has not yet been studied in detail in eh nbs the general framework of operation of an eh nbs is similar to that of cws in which self purification is driven by ecohydrological processes mitsch et al 2012 vymazal and brezinova 2015 in these systems both aerobic and anaerobic conditions stimulate different metabolic pathways which play key roles in ensuring the efficiency of eh nbs such as nitrification or denitrification hence an important direction in eh nbs optimization may be to regulate oxygen concentrations by modulating aeration as it is well known that organic matter input and microbial mineralization results in oxygen decline in cws moreover as oxygen levels in nbs may vary seasonally ouellet plamondon et al 2006 artificial aeration may be an effective tool for increasing eh nbs efficiency oxygen availability directly enhances organic matter mineralization and nitrification ouellet plamondon et al 2006 or the removal of more complex pollutants such as nitrobenzene kirui et al 2016 in addition the operational costs of such solutions may be reduced by using renewable energy pollution and other abiotic factors influence the composition of bacterial communities zhang et al 2020 which may suggest that any new species added to the environment would be dominated with native species over time nevertheless the idea of bioaugmentation including mycorrhization of plant roots and bacterial inoculation is gaining popularity in the area of cws tondera et al 2021 although examples of full scale implementation of bioaugmentation are rare the future development of those solutions may be spurred by the isolation and identification of pollutant utilizing bacteria artigas et al 2020 font najera et al 2021a such implementations can also be supported through the use of biopolymers and other biofilm supporting structures the potential biopolymers as carriers of microorganisms are already well known and studied for bacteria and yeasts mungier and jung 1985 future directions for optimizing the microbial processes in eh nbs should address the carbon source microorganism relationship modification of abiotic conditions such as mentioned aeration or new methods of bioaugmentation with biopolymers 3 3 real time control in nbs management traditionally most of the nbs are constructed as the passive ones and do not adapt to the local conditions persaud et al 2019 one of the developing trends is application of real time control rtc that can assist in the system operation and optimization centralized control strategies have been originally developed for floods prevention in combined sewage overflow systems as discussed by brasil et al 2021 integration of rtc with nbs can be complex but brings a numerous benefits e g mitigation of flood risk and increase of water quality being mostly applied to urban catchments with growing availability of sensors their remote integration optimization based algorithms and artificial intelligence development rtc has a potential to become an important tool in water management sector and nbss 4 future outlook of eh nbs linking with circular economy concept one of the foundations of ecohydrology is that a successful strategy should seek to eliminate threats and amplify opportunities zalewski 1999 in recent years this concept has been particularly reflected in the process of integrating ecohydrology with the circular economy ce which has culminated in the organization of ecohydrology for the circular economy and nature based solutions towards mitigation adaptation to climate change an international symposium which took place in lodz in september 2017 zalewski et al 2018 ce focuses on a closing the loop approach that is directed toward increasing resource productivity energy efficiency and reducing pollutant emission recently ce application in water resources has been underlined by the unesco ihp phase ix strategy unesco ihp ix 2021 the circular economy is an important part of integrated water resources management also considering urban rural interlinkages and the urban water systems within their biological regions examples of integration between eh nbs and ce have recently been noted in connection with sanitation energy and food security langergraber and masi 2018 such approaches have also been used in the reuse of gray water for irrigation rozos et al 2013 however such reuse may require advanced treatment de macedo et al 2019 the further implementation of both eh nbs and ce requires identification of the potential areas of cooperation between them fig 2 for example in eh nbs vegetation can be used to support the biodiversity of river catchments accumulate pollutants enhance pollutant degradation and constitute an alternative source of energy bioenergy while sequestering co2 zalewski 2000 anaerobic digestion of biomass or its direct combustion can be performed to provide both energy and fertilizer to achieve full circulation biomass can be used for the production of biochar with simultaneous energy generation during the pyrolysis process bis et al 2018 this type of green economy creates new employment opportunities as such the ecohydrology approach not only results in improving environmental quality but can also contribute to raising the economic status and the level of sustainable development of local communities zalewski 2000 2006 banaszuk et al 2020 special focus can be given to the area of p pollution of waters both from point and area sources with main anthropogenic sources including domestic wastewater 54 agriculture 38 and industrial wastewater 8 mekonnen and hoekstra 2018 in addition to its negative impact on the aquatic environment recent reports have highlighted the potential problems related to its distribution and use in agriculture fossil p resources are only forecast to last from 50 to 100 years cordell et al 2009 and production is a significant source of environmental pollution by the heavy metals and chemicals used in the treatment of mined rocks villabla et al 2008 alternative sources of p are sought after and increasingly advanced technologies are being implemented for its recovery from wastewater kroiss et al 2011 of these methods that allow the direct use of p recovered from wastewater as a fertilizing substances are of particular interest pap et al 2020 efforts to achieve more sustainable p management also entail changes in the fertilization model to provide the minimum necessary amounts of p and increase its bioavailability to plants one example being the use of polonite as a qualitative soil improver hylander and siman 2001 due to its high selectivity and low operating costs phosphorus adsorption and desorption is currently one of the most popular methods of p recovery li et al 2019 it uses a range of materials such as dolomite piol et al 2019 modified zeolite zhan et al 2017 and magnetic materials han et al 2017 which could be integrated in eh nbs it must be stressed that more precise evaluation of new nbs must take place from laboratory controlled tests up to the pilots and demonstration sites operating in long term networks to collect reliable data on their performance de macedo et al 2021b 5 conclusions the implementation of the ecohydrology principles allows the creation of new solutions to counteract the negative effects of human pressure on the environment including pollution in most cases the key factor is the water retention time in the wetland or buffer zone as sorption processes prolong the retention time for specific pollutants and make them more available for biodegradation the relationship between adsorption processes and biological activity determines the efficiency of the system future improvements of eh nbs efficiency will be based primarily on the enhancement of sorption processes and stimulation of biodegradation however with sorption goals now clearly defined viz low mass low cost high efficiency and p recovery more attention should be devoted to understanding microbial processes and the dynamics of natural composition in the aquatic systems definitely the integration of eh nbs with ce is a win win strategy for providing solutions with long term functionality and this should be used to guide further research in this area also direction of eh nbs development towards more sustainable water resources management can be concluded with one of the goals for the unesco ihp phase ix 2021 ecohydrology research and innovation at unesco designated sites conducted and shared by the scientific community and unesco

will be driven by rising precipitation mainly in the regions where it is already high less snow would result in less surface runoff substituted by increased lateral and groundwater flows because of more water percolating through the soils as a result water flows could be expected to increase by 9 7 for rcp4 5 and by 35 4 for the rcp8 5 climate scenario by the end century whereas sediment transport and phosphorus loads would tend to decline a little bit median results are 11 4 and 5 6 respectively for the rcp4 5 scenario 13 3 and 7 4 for the rcp8 5 by the end of century conversely temperature driven nutrient mineralization and increased leaching are expected to cause a significant increase in nitrogen loads by 23 1 for the rcp4 5 scenario and by 64 4 for the rcp8 5 by the end of century overall it could be concluded that climate change related hydrometeorological and water quality changes were found to be the most profound for the end century rcp8 5 climate change scenario keywords climate change hydrology nutrient loads swat model lithuania 1 introduction climate change is a factor of reality which has to be accounted for in every future planning activities even if countries would keep up with paris climate agreement s long term temperature goal which is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 c with a target of 1 5 c un 2015 to pre industrial levels extreme environmental changes are to be expected ipcc 2018 however this is getting increasingly unlikely as steep drop of green house gas ghg emissions required by such commitments has yet to be observed according to the world meteorological organization wmo 2020 already during a 2020 2024 year period there is 20 chance one of these years will already be 1 5 c warmer than pre industrial levels but the chance is increasing with time thus any governmental or business planning should take this into account including water resource management water pollution and water scarcity are among the main challenges faced by the world and also the european union water environment is under pressure from multiple stressors such as discharges of municipal and industrial waste waters irrigation transportation channelization damming fishing and multiple other human activities heathwaite 2010 among them diffuse sources are one of the most important ones according to eea 2018 38 of european water bodies are failing to reach good status because of diffuse pollution sources particularly from agriculture addressing water scarcity and pollution is also required by multiple eu legislative acts such as water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd marine strategy framework directive 2008 56 ec nitrate directive 91 676 eec and the helsinki convention 1974 relevant in the baltic sea region as well as its implementation instrument baltic sea action plan bsap yet since environmental targets require long term efforts the inclusion of climate change dimension is crucial since assumption of hydroclimatic stationarity is no longer a valid one heathwaite 2010 studies show bosch et al 2018 that various kinds of damage inflicted on the economies and the environment are not the only effects of climate change in addition to this climate change will likely increase the cost of meeting water quality goals effective reduction of diffuse water pollution should take into account changes in the environment due to climate change brouziyne et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 wallace et al 2017 xu et al 2019 therefore it is of crucial importance to understand how water and nutrient flows are expected to be affected by upcoming changes in climate and align planning efforts with anticipated future conditions there are many efforts to estimate climate change impacts on ecohydrological systems great majority of them are focused on changes expected in river flow regime some of them are looking into large scale changes like on the level of continents or regions for instance study by schneider et al 2013 investigates the impacts of climate change on river flow regimes in europe by using global hydrology model similar european analysis by marx et al 2017 is based on a multi model ensemble of hydrological simulations other studies focus on a specific region for example the nordic baltic region or the baltic sea region study by øygarden et al 2014 looks into possible effects of climate change on runoff and nitrogen losses in the nordic baltic region ebook by the bacc ii author team 2015 collects multiple studies of climate related research relevant to the baltic sea region however most studies are focused on a particular river or water body as lake lagoon or fjord basin for instance a study of molina navarro et al 2018 is focused on danish fjord while a study of čerkasova et al 2016 on the curonian lagoon or the nemunas river basin focused study by kriaučiūnienė et al 2008 only a few of them take the whole country as a study object for example a study by piniewski et al 2018 examines projections of runoff in the vistula and the odra river basins both of which together cover around 88 of poland yet most of such studies make conclusions based on existing and already published regional or basin level research work which is usually done in the framework of a particular national project gpf 2015 lmt 2017 the whole country of lithuania was selected as the focus area for this study as overall country conclusions are important for decision makers in discussing strategies for pollution abatement measures and programs as lithuania is a small country total area is about 65300 km2 it is possible to extract somewhat unified conclusions over expected changes including regional differences inside the country there is already a lot of research done covering parts of lithuania on topics of climate change impact on surface water flows kriaučiūnienė et al 2008 looked into climate change impact on hydrological processes in the nemunas river basin it covers around 70 of lithuania moreover kriauciuniene et al 2009 examined uncertainties of climate change hydrological impact predictions for southern lithuania river basin of merkys covers 3781 km2 of lithuania jakimavičius et al 2018 estimated changes expected in the curonian lagoon water balance salinity and temperature by modeling changes in the nemunas river basin čerkasova et al 2016 in her study analyzed climate change induced water discharge changes in the nemunas river basin akstinas et al 2019 assessed expected climate change impacts on three rivers in lithuania representing different hydrological regions however there are far fewer studies that would examine climate change impacts on nutrient loads and concentrations in lithuanian rivers čerkasova et al 2018 examined climate change impact on water flows and nutrient loads in the upstream part of the neris river basin the lithuanian part of the neris river basin comprises 7824 km2 which is situated in the territory of belarus the minija river basin 2942 km2 has also been examined in terms of climate change impact on water discharge and nutrient load changes čerkasova et al 2019 modeling study done by povilaitis et al 2018 with fyris model examined flows and nutrient load changes with different climate scenarios for the minija 2939 km2 nevėžis 6140 km2 šventoji 6771 km2 and žeimena 2769 km2 river basins the most comprehensive work was done by čerkasova 2019 where the nemunas river basin discharge nutrient and sediment loading as well as microbial pollution were examined through the climate change perspective nevertheless even after reviewing numerous published studies we were not able to find information covering an entire country moreover existing studies lacked insights into changes on pathways by which water and nutrients were reaching water bodies this information is of crucial importance when planning adaptation strategies lastly some results between studies contradicted each other in their final conclusions for instance čerkasova et al 2018 concluded that water flows and nitrogen loads are going to increase with climate change yet study by lmt 2017 for the same neris river projected a substantial decrease of water flows and nutrient loads furthermore there is a lack of agreement as to which climate scenario is going to have a bigger impact one study on the minija river by akstinas et al 2019 shows that in the event of the rcp8 5 scenario water flows would decrease the most yet study results by čerkasova et al 2019 conclude that this would be the case if the rcp4 5 scenario takes hold for answering questions of climate change impact on water environment hydrological and water quality modeling has became increasingly important tool in recent decades many different models have been applied successfully however semi distributed processed based soil and water assessment tool swat model is one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models across the globe gassman and yingkuan 2015 it has also been broadly used for the hydro climatic questions tan et al 2020 swat has been widely utilized for dealing with questions important in the baltic sea basin which relate to the implementation of river basin management plans required by eu directive 2000 60 ec the so called water framework directive thereafter wfd and country allocated reduction targets required by bsap andersen et al 2016 hesse et al 2014 huttunen et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2018 piniewski et al 2021 thodsen et al 2017 it has been successfully applied for hydro climatic questions in lithuania as well čerkasova 2019 čerkasova et al 2019 moreover it is supported and used as an operational model for the water management questions by the environmental protection agency of lithuania paic 2015 plunge 2013 therefore we selected swat model for use in our work thus the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 evaluate the impact of climate change on water flows in lithuania by applying swat model 2 assess expected climate change induced changes in nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus loads and their riverine concentrations in the country 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the focus area for this study is the whole country of lithuania however it was important to include important areas outside the country as well the transboundary parts of lithuanian river basins were critical to enable the modeling of climate change scenarios it should be noted though that these areas were included mainly for the purpose of getting the boundary conditions for lithuanian rivers as a result model preparation for transboundary areas was performed with much coarser data lower river network resolution and lower calibration validation effort if compared to the lithuanian part of ecohydrological model modeling area fig 1 used in this study spanned across lithuania 65300 km2 belarus 45463 km2 for the nemunas basin and 488 km2 for the daugava basin and poland 2516 km2 however despite sharing some of river basins with lithuania territories in the kaliningrad oblast part of russia are not covered by this study this was possible because the kaliningrad region for the most part only receives water flows from lithuania the results presented here relate solely to the territory of lithuania the land use of lithuania the focus area of the study is dominated by agriculture which occupies around 59 of the country s territory forests take up another 30 water bodies 2 urban built up areas 3 and other areas 6 plc 7 2019 land uses for the study area outside of lithuania modeled for the purpose of getting boundary conditions are also dominated by agriculture 49 and forests 47 while the remaining uses taking up significantly lower shares water 1 urban built up areas 0 4 and other 3 pakhomau 2016 most agricultural land in lithuania is used for cereal production according to statistics lithuania 2021 in 2020 around 47 of arable land was used for grain production while grasslands occupied around 33 intensive use of land for plant growing is concentrated in the central northern parts of the country which is characterized by fertile soils and mostly flat terrain eastern western and southern parts are less suitable for intensive plant growing due to not as suitable soils therefore more used for livestock production beside low slopes the highest place 294 m mild temperatures average 3 2 c in january and 17 9 c in july dominant feature of the country is the excess of humidity this means precipitation is notably higher on average around 695 mm per year than evapotranspiration on average 470 mm per year causing excessive soil water content in some areas lietuvos hidrometeorologijos tarnyba 2021 as a results around 28 of total territory has installed tile drain systems to be suitable for crop production aplinkos apsaugos agentūra 2015 dominant soils in lithuania are albeluvisols which occupies 30 of the country followed by luvisols 27 cambisols 13 arenosols 12 podzols 11 mainly in forest areas and gleysols together with histosols 5 3 in the depressions buivydaite 2005 2 2 swat model description the swat model is without a doubt one of the most widely used ecohydrological models available gassman and yingkuan 2015 it is a process based semi distributed and a continuous time tool which is used for the simulation of water sediment nutrients pesticides or heavy metals on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 necessary input for this model includes meteorological soil land use agricultural management fertilization tillage crops rotations planting and harvesting time etc slope river network and other data or information arnold et al 2012 based on this information swat model prepares basic spatial units called hydrological response units hrus which represent unique combinations of land use soil and slope within each sub basin hrus are the smallest spatial units in the model for which processes of water sediment movement plant growth or nutrient cycling are simulated land processes are calculated first and then water is routed through the river network to the outlets 2 3 epa river modeling system the environmental protection agency of lithuania epa selected swat model as its operational model for surface water questions related to wfd bsap nitrate directive and the marine strategy framework directive firstly the model was tested on a small catchment in the center of lithuania plunge 2009 2011 later based on these test results the activities of model preparation for the whole country were started plunge 2013 which led to the final outcome the river modeling system rms which integrated swat 2012 model with specially prepared python script library paic 2015 the prepared scripts library allowed to manage the whole process of input data preparation gis time series data various sources of information from raw data input preparation to swat model formats running the model extracting and examining outputs as well as setting up scenarios in a seamless way the most recent and detailed available data for the country was applied for the rms the preparation of this system is explained in detail in the report of paic 2015 available online 1 1 report could be assessed by the following link http vanduo old gamta lt files 3 20priedas swat

calibration and validation procedures and results it is impossible to present detailed account of all rms preparation steps made in this article thus for details reader is referred to the rms preparation report by paic 2015 therefore in this article we attempt to present only the most relevant information on model preparation 2 3 1 data sources the most detailed available national and international data relevant for the rms were collected and processed for the preparation of relevant model inputs multiple institutions were approached for data as well as experts of specific fields

swat model calibration and validation was done in a number of steps first lithuanian territory was divided into 14 regions according to the hydrological and pollution generation conditions fig 2 presents the resulting identified regions for all of these regions the representative water discharge and water quality monitoring stations were selected one per each region which contained rich datasets calibration and validation was done for those selected stations when good as described below results were reached the relevant representative parameters were attributed to the whole region the final step model validation was performed utilizing data of stations which were not used in the calibration validation process if the required criteria were not met over those stations additional calibration validation iterations were done in order to reach the necessary performance level targets for model calibration and validation criteria were based on moriasi et al 2007 and bennett et al 2013 guidelines additionally swat check program white et al 2014 was applied to identify problems with representation of processes and correcting them soft calibration was applied to get hydrology and nutrient processes align with available data for yields subsurface flow etc 62 hydrological stations were used in model calibration validation for water quality data from 130 stations were used data used in model calibration validation spanned across 1997 2013 year period detail steps and results are presented in the report of paic 2015 final model performance results achieved by calibration validation effort is presented in fig 3 water flows were represented well with median model performance values around 0 for percent of bias pbias parameter and around 0 6 for nash sutcliffe nse model efficiency coefficient for daily water flows total nitrogen tn and nitrates nitrate nitrogen also well simulated by the model as median model performance values were 0 8 for determination coefficient r2 and pbias close to zero for monthly concentration values the most problematic variables for calibration were phosphate phosphate phosphorus and total phosphorus tp as those are very sensitive to point source data quality and frequency of both point source and water quality monitoring data heathwaite 2010 monthly grab sample data might not be adequate for this task median pbias for these variables were around 0 13 the final parameter set is presented in table 1 this table provides information on how swat 2012 default parameters were changed in calibrated validated model for different regions the meaning of parameters could be found in arnold et al 2012 swat input output documentation version 2012 2 2 link to documentation https swat tamu edu media 69296 swat io documentation 2012 pdf beside parameters presented in table 1 values for some parameters were changed for all regions firstly potential evapotranspiration calculation was changed to hargreaves method neitsch et al 2011

with additional point source and meteorological data to extend simulated time series by 6 years up to 2019 in order for varying loads from point sources not to interfere with the effects of agricultural bmps results are planned to be presented in the next paper or climate change point source loads waste water treatment plants and storm water pipes for historical and forecasting periods were fixed to constant yearly values the 2012 2019 period point source load data were grouped by the type of effluents and treatment and 1st quartile yearly concentration values were calculated to represent the groups which were applied for all the point sources available for the year 2019 this allowed to fix point source loads and set them to an achievable low level which could be reasonably expected in the future fixing point sources at low level was important to avoid interference with in stream processes finally it is also important to emphasize that land use for the purposes of this study was kept constant representing the situation in the year 2012 earlier date was chosen to better represent historical period this allowed to separate only impacts of climate change and examine them though to be more realistic scenarios should include predicted landuse change agricultural activities fertilization tillage harvest operation scheduling etc used in the model was prepared from information on agricultural activities available for the 2010 2013 period agricultural operations were constructed using heat unit scheduling available in swat 2012 neitsch et al 2011 2 4 climate change data meteorological data for climate change modeling was collected from the european coordinated regional climate downscaling euro cordex program 3 3 data could be reached by the following link https www euro cordex net which is designed to serve as input for climate change impact and adaptation studies within the timeline of the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change euro cordex 2021 fine resolution 0 11 degree eur 11 12 5km regional climate models rcm were selected for this work the nearest grid points to the real meteorological stations have been assigned to represent conditions at those stations in total 18 stations with climate data were prepared for lithuania and 6 for the study area outside of it the selection of rcms and global climate models gcms which were used to set boundary conditions for rcms were based on the availability of data for particular climate change scenarios and generating wider representations of possible rcms and gcms combinations see table 2 seven combinations were selected inline with recommendations given by multiple sources to use ensembles of climate models rather than a single best fitting one rathjens et al 2016 singh 2016 in all combinations ensemble r1i1p1 was selected since euro cordex program already delivered quality data for the european context additional selection criteria was not applied two climate change representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were selected to represent future climatic conditions rcp4 5 set to represent the intermediate and rcp8 5 to represent the worst case climate change scenarios data for daily minimum near surface air temperature tasmin daily maximum near surface air temperature tasmax and precipitation pr were collected as input to the swat model other swat meteorological data wind speed solar radiation relative humidity were generated by the use of swat weather generator neitsch et al 2011 bias correcting methods were applied in addition to climate data extraction unit conversion assignment to meteorological stations according to sunyer et al 2015 rcms inherit the biases from gcms thus statistical bias adjustment of rcms outputs is important therefore the latter procedure is commonly applied before using data in climate scenarios for hydrological modeling singh 2016 in this work cmhyd program was used for bias correction which is available on official swat model website 4 4 link to the software https swat tamu edu software cmhyd this tool has been tested with cordex data rathjens et al 2016 and has implemented several downscaling or bias correcting methods for precipitation and temperature after examining initial results local intensity scaling method was selected for bias correction of precipitation data the only exception was remo2009 for which due to poor results the linear scaling was used instead local intensity scaling method distribution mapping method was used for bias correction temperature data swat model was run for time period of 1994 2099 with the prepared rcms data in order to be consistent with the rest of time series historical period was modeled with rcms data three periods of 20 years were selected for the assessment and representation of results historical period included the 2000 2019 year interval mid century the 2040 2059 year interval and end century the 2080 2099 year interval 3 results 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 annual water flows one of important questions raised by this study was how would climate change affects hydrological conditions in lithuania to answer this question all values for particular hydrological variables were summed up to represent country totals for each year afterwards averaging was performed for selected periods finally results obtained by using all climate models were presented in boxplots depicting the distribution of results around the median of model outcomes results from the modeling are presented in fig 4 surface runoff in results represents water reaching surface water bodies via overland flow water reaching water bodies through soil is included in lateral and tile drain flows while groundwater flow represents water infiltrating from shallow aquifers percolation past soil profile is water leaving soil to feed shallow aquifers whereas water flow is all water contributed to a streamflow results show that according to rcm outcomes precipitation is likely to increase in lithuania in the future the increase in median values by 5 7 could be expected in the rcp4 5 scenario by the end of the century however if the rcp8 5 scenario would be on course the increase could climb up to 17 9 due to rising temperatures large changes are expected in winter snow coverage for the rcp4 5 scenario expected median change between historical and the end of century periods is 32 7 while for the rcp8 5 it would be 60 an increase in temperatures would potentially raise actual evapotranspiration by 3 9 for the rcp4 5 scenario and by 10 1 for the rcp8 5 scenario if historical and end of century periods are compared these hydrological changes might have profound effect on water flows distribution on land less snow or ice cover due to climate warming allows more infiltration thus surface runoff is expected to decrease by 17 9 for the rcp4 5 scenario the decrease in surface runoff is expected to be slightly smaller for the rcp8 5 scenario in which it would constitute a 15 9 drop by the end of this century the loss of surface runoff would seem to be overcompensated by more precipitation water infiltrating into the soil and thus by bigger quantities of water reaching water bodies through an underground flow for instance in the worst case scenario soil water content would increase by roughly 5 8 by the end of century if compared to the historical period as the result water flows are expected to increase by 9 7 until the middle of this century and by 9 6 by the end of it if the rcp4 5 scenario takes hold in case of the rcp8 5 scenario the rise in water flows would constitute 7 and 35 4 respectively tendencies for lateral flows are inline with that of water flows 3 1 2 monthly and seasonal water flows monthly results averaged over the country also provide important insights into possible changes in temporal distribution of water flows fig 5 shows that in both scenarios precipitation would be more unpredictable during may october period while december february period would get more consistent increase of precipitation it is also noticeable that the rcp8 5 scenario might cause amplification of trends and an increase of uncertainty in monthly precipitation fig 6 on relative changes in precipitation in different scenarios relative to historical period hints that precipitation tends to increase or remain stable pretty much in all months with more pronounced peaks in winter months as well as possibly during august october period snow and ice melt would face the largest changes during february april period for the rcp4 5 scenario modeling results show that april could be free of snow or ice by the end of century for the worst case scenario april and november would become warm months moreover december march months would see sharp drop in snow or ice melting because of shrunken snow cover area by the end of century december january february and march snow and ice melting drop would be 50 9 40 3 43 1 and 86 1 correspondingly surface runoff in march and april would see the largest drop during both scenarios yet the rcp8 5 scenario would see higher amplification of the trend it should be noted as well that an upward trend in surface flow from july to january is expected which is especially prominent in the rcp8 5 scenario and end century period however the latter trend is rather significant only in relative terms in relation to historical values of a particular month and not that much in absolute terms as in spring changes groundwater flow would face only slight changes in intermediate scenario up to 34 9 increase in february whereas in the worst case scenario the 53 1 60 2 and 59 7 increase during january february and march respectively are expected with other months being exposed to a lesser change upward trends are also detectable from approximately august to november although somewhat lower in relative and absolute terms if compared to winter increases may july period seems to remain a rather stable one although some important differences among scenarios are noticeable in case of the rcp8 5 scenario no change or slight increase in groundwater flow is possible while the rcp4 5 scenario might bring even reductions in flows for water flow the results for january and february indicate the most substantial changes a 51 2 and 40 increase for the intermediate scenario there is also a decrease of flows during march may expected which is occurring because of drop in snow and ice melt those trends are well amplified in the worst case climate scenario the months with largest water flow increases are november to february increases of water flows are 45 58 6 71 3 and 70 6 respectively between historical and the end century periods expected decreases for march and april are 11 2 and 29 8 furthermore the rcp8 5 scenario not only emboldens the trends of climate impact but it also increase uncertainty bands represented by span of box plot and whiskers for the prediction it is worth noting that increased precipitation and the resulting surface runoff and groundwater flow might slightly increase water flows through july to october as well according to the fig 6 potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration are expected to increase significantly during november may period however trends are not so clearly for the rest of the year in fact for this remaining period of the year actual evapotranspiration might stay on the same level or might even face a slight reduction lateral flows would plummet only for march june period in the remaining period of the year those flows would be increasing with especially sharp rise during winter months for the worst case scenario winter increase would be nearly twice as large by the end of century if compared to the intermediate climate change scenario water percolation past the root zone 5 5 in model its depth is defined by soil type it varies in the interval from 1200 to 1750 mm with average values around 1360 mm would mirror the trends in lateral flows the more water infiltrates into the soil the more will be leaving the soils and discharging into surface and groundwater bodies for some scenarios relationship is not exactly the same since fig 6 presents medians and not means of results for variables this allows for some misalignment similarly such misalignment could be noticed in some cases for soil water content variable which is recorded at the end of each period for other variables the average of the period is recorded despite this it could be observed that spring and summer would bring reductions in soil water and water flows refilling groundwater bodies autumn and winter would be the seasons which would replenish groundwater for the worst case scenario water addition to shallow aquifers will be larger 3 2 water quality 3 2 1 annual nutrient and sediment loads hydrological changes have substantial impact on nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus and sediment loads to water bodies fig 7 presents annual loads reaching water bodies by different pathways sediment organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus as well as mineral phosphorus are tightly interconnected in a way that surface runoff is their main pathway to surface water bodies as a result sizable decrease in surface runoff propagate into decrease in load values for all the above mentioned variables in case of the most extreme scenario by the end of century water bodies might face a 13 3 22 4 15 3 and 6 3 decrease in loads for sediment organic nitrogen organic and mineral phosphorus respectively however for the same scenario and time scale potential rise in quantities of nitrates no3 n reaching water bodies through subsurface water flows is rather staggering for nitrates in tile drains the increase in loads would amount to approximately 153 1 for nitrates in lateral flow 57 2 and for nitrates in groundwater flow 108 7 this is likely to occur in part due to higher quantity of water expected to reach water bodies through a subsurface path yet the acceleration of nitrification in the soils because of temperature increase might probably be equally important or even more important factor driving the rise of nitrate loads it is worth noting that nitrification is expected to also increase the amount of nitrates reaching water bodies by surface runoff by 8 5 on the other hand the intermediate climate scenario would cause much less pronounced but still significant changes for instance it is expected that by the end of century the amount of nitrates reaching water bodies through tile drains would increase by 60 4 whereas through lateral flow by 31 5 with groundwater flow by 58 1 and with surface runoff by 2 a drop of sediment and nutrient loads reaching water bodies with surface runoff would be milder as well sediment yield is expected to face a reduction of around 11 4 organic nitrogen 26 3 organic phosphorus 15 2 and mineral phosphorus 3 7 3 2 2 monthly loads some representative variables were selected to be examined with monthly results sediment yields variable was selected to best represent changes in pollutant loads affected by the reduction in surface runoff changes in sediment yield are on the same path as changes in loads of organic parts of nutrients and mineral phosphorus nitrates mobile part of nitrogen reaching water bodies via subsurface water flows represents another group which relates to increased nitrification and precipitation fig 8 shows that the largest part of sediment yield reduction with the highest uncertainty is occurring during march april months sediment yield drop for these months by the end of century could amount to roughly 45 4 and 78 2 respectively for the rcp4 5 scenario whereas for the rcp8 5 scenario the drop of 81 9 and 81 8 for the same months is likely this is highly connected with the reduction of snow or ice melt and the subsequent drop in springtime surface runoff which is characterized by larger quantities of water erosion related suspended matter flow while march april is responsible for the largest sediment yield drop in absolute terms as well as for a total reduction of annual sediment flow relative sediment yield changes when compared to historical period reveal other interesting patterns as could be witnessed from fig 9 a significant increase of sediment yield is expected in the remaining vegetation period from june to october in the worst case scenario such an increase could reach up to 450 or even more in some months by the end of century such projections may partly be attributed to an increase in precipitation which to a lesser extent is expected to occur during summer months as well in addition to this more numerous and more intense precipitation events are likely to occur in the future which would enhance water erosion related sediment flow although summer sediment jump might be significantly lower in absolute terms than a spring drop it might be important for phosphorus content and its effect on eutrofication processes during summer period when nutrients are in fullest demand and a climate change induced temperature rise would even more intensify the usual vegetation processes major changes for nitrates reaching water bodies through the tile drains are expected to occur during winter months as climate change causes snow and ice cover to disappear precipitation which otherwise would be locked on land would infiltrate and wash away mobile nitrates from soil into surface water bodies for the intermediate climate change scenario by the end of century nitrate leaching through december january and february months would increase by about 42 1 138 3 and 93 respectively as for the worst case scenario the rise in nitrate leaching values for the same months and period would be 163 5 240 6 and 171 respectively as in the case with sediment yield big relative increase in nitrate tile drains leaching is expected for july october period as well which might be attributed to a summer precipitation and temperature rise for nitrates in lateral flow a similar pattern as in tile drains would hold except that this time march would face a large increase in load values as well changes in end of century nitrates loading for the december march period in intermediate scenario would comprise a 40 5 80 7 95 9 and 33 3 rise respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario end of century increases could be about 65 7 127 4 106 1 and 48 8 respectively relative july october period rise in loading values are similar to that of the tile drains however the change is of a lesser magnitude but it would be also observed in november nitrates leaching with groundwater is also expected to rise the magnitude of which is tightly interconnected with the intensity of climate change however this source is far less significant if compared to nitrates in lateral flow and especially to tile drains the first three months would face the steepest increase for the rcp4 5 scenario the rise in loads for january march months would amount to 73 103 8 and 52 1 respectively by the end of century the worst case scenario could increase those values up to 152 142 7 and 107 1 respectively it should be noted though that the worst case scenario is prone to much higher uncertainty as well furthermore in relative terms the increase in nitrate loads through groundwater would rise in all months even in springtime period and by a similar amount as the result it seems that not only phosphorus but also nitrogen could potentially reach water bodies in slightly larger quantities in the vegetation period which could have negative implications for the eutrophication processes in water bodies fig 9 indicates that the loads of nitrates with surface runoff as well as that of organic nitrogen will be decreasing in march june period this is connected to expected reductions in surface runoff for the rest of the year an increase for both variables could be expected however this increase will manifest itself most dramatically in the end of century rcp8 5 scenario similar trends could be observed in the results for organic mineral and soluble phosphorus loads spring and early summer is where reductions could be expected whereas for the second half of the year an increase is predicted which will largely depend on climate change intensity it is also important to note that variables dependent on surface runoff will be changing less in winter months for the worst case scenario than in the case of the intermediate scenario this is due to a smaller surface runoff increase estimated for the rcp8 5 scenario 3 3 aggregation of annual water flow and nutrient load results previous hydrology and water quality sections presented detailed information about changes expected in water flows and nutrient loads due to climate change this section briefly sums up that information extracting the main trends which could be anticipated for the future fig 10 illustrates how water flows will likely be redistributed between the historical and end of century periods for the two rcp scenarios the meanings of abbreviations used in the figure are as follows prec precipitation snow snow and ice melt rain prec snow evap evapotranspiration surf plant soil surface interaction surq surface runoff latq lateral flow grwf groundwater flow tileq water flow through tile drains waty water flows it could be seen that the difference between the intermediate and worst case scenarios starts with increased precipitation the more intense climate change the more increase in precipitation could be expected also the worst case scenario would significantly reduce snow and ice melt basically it means that there will be less cold days and consequently less snow and ice moreover the intensity of climate change will alter evapotranspiration by increasing it however increased evapotranspiration only partially buffers the precipitation increase additionally less water will likely reach surface water bodies through surface runoff thus more water will be available for infiltration into soil the expected increase in lateral groundwater and flow through tile drains will be governed by the intensity of climate change this also implies that more nutrients in soils especially mobile nitrogen will be facing increased likelihood of washing out lastly water flows in surface water bodies are expected to increase and the level of increase will climb if more intense climate change scenario takes place fig 11 provides summary information about how overall quantity of water flows and nutrients will change in lithuania through periods and with different climate scenarios according to the figure water flows are going to increase especially with longer time frame and more extreme climate change scenario as stated previously the largest increase would come from subsurface flows due to increased washing of soils substantial increase of nitrogen loads could be expected in the future the most of it will come through the tile drains and lateral flow the already dominant nitrates pathways some reduction of organic nitrogen which is connected to sediments could be expected until the middle of the century phosphorus loads coming from non point sources are expected to decrease slightly as less surface runoff is expected especially during the time without vegetation the worst case scenario could bring more notable reductions in phosphorus pathways connected to sediments 3 4 spatial distribution of changes spatial distribution of changes is also important in the examination of climate change impacts in general water flows are expected to rise throughout all the basins with the most prominent changes expected for end century values of the rcp8 5 scenario however spatial distribution of those changes reveal regional differences fig 12 shows how lithuania s territory differs in terms of expected water flow absolute change from the values in the historical period having in mind different climate change scenarios and different time frames a similar but slightly different is fig 13 which depicts the same change expressed in percentages the percentage change map seems to suggest that the biggest increase in water flows may occur in the agricultural production belt of lithuania northern central and south western flat land parts of the country and in the south eastern recreational countryside on the other hand absolute change map distinguishes mainly south eastern and north western parts of the country as the areas of potentially largest absolute rise in water flows overall it seems that the most notable changes in absolute terms is likely to occur in areas which already have highest water flows nevertheless the higher relative percentage water flow rise in lithuanian flat lands might be a fact of significance since this is the driest region of the country facing frequent water scarcity issues in rivers during summer periods spatial analysis was undertaken for nitrogen loads as well using the same approach which was applied for water flows here as with the water flows nitrogen loads are expected to rise throughout all the basins too with end century rcp8 5 values being the highest ones regional differences have been found for nitrogen loads as well the differences could be tracked by examining figures 14 and 15 which represent expected absolute kg ha and relative percentage changes in nitrogen loads if compared to a historical period the biggest absolute nitrogen load increase is expected in the lithuanian agricultural flat lands northern central and south western parts of the country the same holds true for relative percentage changes with addition to large increases in the south eastern part of lithuania this seems to suggest that a combination of increased precipitation temperature and large amounts of soil organic in agricultural flat lands as well as intensive agricultural practices could result in leaching and temperature decomposition driven rise in nitrogen loads from northern central and south western parts of the country these areas are likely to bear the brunt of total nitrogen load rise from the territory of lithuania this prospect is rather concerning given the fact that the highest nitrogen loads are already confined to the areas dominated by agriculture 3 5 changes in nutrient concentrations changing loads and water flows would also affect concentrations in the rivers fig 16 shows how water body status judged by only nitrogen concentrations would change over time in the settings of different climate change scenarios nitrogen concentrations officially are divided into 5 status categories based on intervals extracted from national law am 2007 very good 2 mgn l good 2 3 mgn l moderate 3 6 mgn l bad 6 12 mgn l very bad 12 mgn l for the sake of simplicity we grouped river water bodies into two categories water bodies at risk of not achieving at least good status by 2027 moderate bad and very bad status and water bodies not at risk good and very good status it is noticeable that in both scenarios status of water bodies is going to worsen over time areas dominated by agriculture would be affected the most yet the worst case scenario would cause the most adverse changes 4 discussion 4 1 water flows study results show that we should be expecting higher level of precipitation over the country s territory and the increase of precipitation is connected with the intensity of climate change the more extreme scenario would take place the more extreme rise in precipitation could be expected this pattern would hold even though the rise in temperatures would enhance evapotranspiration yet this enhancement would not be on the level needed to offset the precipitation increase on a annual balance therefore the increase in water flows could be expected throughout the country especially in winter december to february such conclusions are inline with multiple other sources for instance extensive study by gpf 2015 analyzed results of 24 gcm models and presented expected changes of precipitation over lithuania for different timescales and different rcp scenarios results of this study show a clear increase of precipitation which is scaled with intensity of climate change the largest increase is expected during non vegetative period october to may the same conclusion is drawn in the work by øygarden et al 2014 which overviewed the nordic baltic region for expected changes due to climatic conditions according to this study precipitation and water flows in rivers will increase outside the growing season multiple european scale studies lobanova et al 2018 marx et al 2017 schneider et al 2013 confirm that the northern region is expected to face a stream flow increase the scale of which will be correlated with climate change intensity the same conclusion is made in studies for the scandinavian countries in the baltic sea catchment molina navarro et al 2018 the bacc ii author team 2015 study by tamm et al 2018 on estonian rivers combining high resolution euro cordex project rcm data with swat modeling also obtained results which predict an increase in annual runoff research on the vistula and odra covering 88 of poland rivers using nine bias corrected rcms simulations showed an increase in the mean of spatially averaged runoff over poland which is positively correlated with the intensity of climate change and the time horizon the closer the forecast period is to the end of century the larger runoff increase is to be expected similar conclusions on potential runoff increase are also made for lithuania by a special study targeted on forecasts for changes in hydropower production peter 2019 moreover increasing water flows are expected for the transboundary part of the lithuanian river neris basin čerkasova et al 2018 in addition to this an increase of precipitation and runoff is estimated for particular water bodies in lithuania as well for example according to the report by lhmt 2021 rėkyva lake would be exposed to an increasing water inflow due to climate change impacts moreover valiukas 2015 by analyzing past 1961 2010 period concluded that historical data already shows significant precipitation and runoff increase trends in lithuania results from climate models extend these trends into the future to our knowledge all other published national studies about climate change impact on water flows which are focused particularly on lithuanian rivers agree on water flow increase in winter akstinas et al 2019 čerkasova 2019 jakimavičius et al 2018 kriauciuniene et al 2009 kriaučiūnienė et al 2008 povilaitis et al 2018 šarauskienė et al 2018 however the results of the latter studies on changes in annual water flows are somewhat divergent from our work results contradictory conclusions made by these studies are related to the expectation of decreased annual water flows the magnitude of which would depend on the intensity of climate change those studies suggest that steeper temperature increase would cause more severe loss of annual water flows however study by čerkasova et al 2019 concluded that more extreme flow changes could be expected in the rcp4 5 scenario rather than the rcp8 5 one it is not obvious to us why such different conclusions could be made from the results of studies covering lithuania one possible explanation could be that the selection of gcm rcm methods for statistical downscaling of meteorological data and hydrological models could create large uncertainties and significantly change final results as demonstrated by several studies akstinas et al 2019 huttunen et al 2021 for instance this manifests itself in the study by tamm et al 2018 where two rcm models from euro cordex project resulted in different runoff projections similarly martínková et al 2011 concluded that different approaches in climate change predictions yielded the opposite final results in runoff and nutrient load changes moreover olsson et al 2016 showed that application of different hydrological models resulted in quite different runoff results for the same territory and the same climate change data additionally differences in the setup of baseline and forecast periods could bring differences in results as well some studies seem to indicate that lithuania might be located in the some sort of borderline area between different direction runoff trends in the north and south which might significantly increase the uncertainty level of predictions for lithuania this might be another possible explanation for divergent results for instance from schneider et al 2013 work it could be noticed that european river basins to the south of lithuania are expected to be faced with climate change induced reduced annual water flows if compared to the basins to the north of lithuania where a clear increase in annual water flows is expected schneider et al 2013 furthermore the study of the baltic sea basin by arheimer et al 2012 demonstrates that the northern part of the basin would witness a clear runoff increase however the more one moves to the south the less runoff increase could be expected due to climate change thus lithuania as a border line territory might have not a very clear signal in this respect therefore uncertainties could play quite a major role in the final results of all climate change impact studies for the country the choice of potential evapotranspiration pet calculation method in hydrological models is usually an important factor in the final results as well according to a study by hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 uncertainties related to evapotranspiration methods is of comparable magnitude to gcm uncertainty as the main source of uncertainty in estimation of hydrological impacts of climate change results presented in the study show that our selected hargreaves method for pet calculation have the lowest sensitivity to climate change compared to other applied methods thus it is important that this source of uncertainties would be investigated in future studies if our predictions are correct there might not be severe long term water quantity issues for groundwater reserves lakes and rivers overall it seems that groundwater reserves might grow or at least remain stable and in a long rem perspective lake water level is not going to drop however this does not mean there will not be short term water quantity fluctuations to the higher and the lower end in fact valiukas 2015 suggests that some droughts metrics like spi and htc indicate the number of short term meteorological droughts during the summer period is increasing and they cover larger territories this may indicate a possibly larger weather variability in summer months with more frequent droughts in some years and extremely wet condition in some other years notwithstanding this it appears from our results that in general the second half of the summer might be confronted with slightly higher water flows than in the historical period reducing the probability of now rather frequent occurrences of hydrological summer droughts on the other hand spring early summer periods might exhibit slightly lower than historical water flows which might partly exacerbate scarce water occurrences in some years there might also be some important spatial changes in water runoff due to climate change in general western and south eastern lithuanian areas will be exposed to highest absolute rise in water flows meaning that the areas which are already known for highest water flows will receive even more precipitation this will be important for lakes as these water bodies are mainly located in such areas and the precipitation fed western lithuania rivers in relative terms the highest percentage water flow increases will be present in lithuania s flat lands south western central and northern parts of the country the backbone of national agriculture industry having in mind frequent summer water shortages in small rivers during summer such changes could be beneficial to water ecosystems at least in the second half of the summer season 4 2 nutrient loads according to our results nitrogen loads are expected to increase with increasing climate change intensity climate change will bring more precipitation and less snow cover which will enhance more water percolation and thus wetter soil conditions resulting in more nitrogen leaching in addition changing climate will raise temperatures which in their turn will increase nutrient mineralisation and thus will cause even higher nitrogen losses from the soil barclay and walter 2015 nitrogen losses from the soils will be accelerated especially outside the growing season the same conclusion were made by øygarden et al 2014 and čerkasova et al 2018 arheimer et al 2005 examined climate change impact on a catchment in southern sweden applying soilndb and hbv models study results show that increased nitrogen losses from arable land higher nitrogen concentrations and loads into water bodies more pronounced seasonal dynamics declined quality of lakes and increased amounts of cyanobacteria could be expected in the future due to changes in the earth s climate another study on polish river basins marcinkowski et al 2017 concluded that climate change would clearly cause an increase in annual and seasonal total nitrogen losses sediment yield and phosphorus losses show only weak and uncertain trends with changing climate similar results was in our study sediment and phosphorus load trends on different territories were correlated mostly with precipitation changes however quite opposite conclusions were obtained by studies in which water flows were expected to decrease arheimer et al 2012 čerkasova et al 2019 lmt 2017 povilaitis et al 2018 these studies state that climate change will reduce nutrient losses and the increase in severity of climate change will result in greater level of reductions certainly water balance might be the most important factor which would drive climate change impact into decreasing or increasing direction for nitrogen losses from the soil yet plungė and gudas 2018 investigated current trends by examining historical and current water quality land use and fertilization data for lithuania and concluded that in the 1996 2017 period climate change seemed to have a reinforcing effect to the existing nitrogen loss trends from the soils this impact was especially well pronounced during the non growing season on agricultural soils our results presented in this study showed that the decrease of surface runoff in spring would likely cause the reduction of annual sediment and total phosphorus loads in the future such results are confirmed by the study of čerkasova et al 2018 the impact of sediment load drop will potentially be most pronounced on phosphorus part since phosphorus flux is highly connected to the movement of sediments especially during spring period such results are also confirmed in a study by marcinkowski et al 2017 on polish rivers however while annual sediment and total phosphorus loads is decreasing monthly results suggest that large increases could be expected especially in july to october period this occurs due to earlier planting harvesting and tillage after harvest which leaves soil unprotected by plants for a longer time during this period more precipitation and more extreme precipitation events cause larger sediment yields and loads of nutrients connected to sediments there might be some important considerations when discussing the effects of annual nutrient load changes to water ecosystems since most annual load increase of nitrogen would accrue to a non vegetative period the effect on the worsening of river ecosystem status would be relatively lower than on the status of standing water ecosystems like lakes the curonian lagoon and the baltic sea this could be due to the fact that in the cold season additional nitrogen quantities are not translated into more vegetation growth thus all this quantities is simply transported to the standing water bodies where it partially accumulates because of the latter process only the standing water ecosystems could experience a greater boost in productivity when spring comes on the other hand reduction of total annual sediment and the corresponding phosphorus loads could potentially block or inhibit to a various degree the nitrogen eutrophication boost effect in some standing water ecosystems due to enhanced phosphorus limiting effect jeppesen et al 2005 schindler et al 2008 however our study also observes a potential possibility of slight increase of sediment phosphorus as well as nitrogen loads in the second half of the summer season when additional nutrients might be rapidly incorporated into the biomass and thus exacerbate eutrophication processes in all water bodies rivers lakes the curonian lagoon and the baltic sea what is clear though that the brunt of nitrogen load increase will most likely be confined to the lithuanian agricultural flat lands 4 3 uncertainties certainly we are aware of possibly numerous uncertainties which might be related to our results most of them are already touched upon in the discussion these are uncertainties related to gcm rcm selection bias correction hydrological models selection data input model parametrization and calibration validation selection of pet methods anticipating future social economic technological conditions etc in our work we mostly addressed uncertainties related to gcm rcm selection by inclusion of ensembles of rcms as is recommended by singh 2016 this allowed us to examine the dispersion of results due to uncertainties related to rcm selection however inclusion of other types of uncertainties in such type of assessments of climate change impacts would be important in order to draw conclusions with much bigger certainty future efforts should be focused on this 5 conclusion this study aimed at evaluating the impact of climate change on water flows in lithuania as well as at assessing climate change related changes in nutrient loads and their riverine concentrations by applying swat model seven rcm and gcm combinations were selected where ensemble r1i1p1 was chosen the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change representative concentration pathways were selected for the study overall it could be concluded that climate change related hydrometeorological and water quality changes were found to be mostly pronounced for the end century rcp8 5 climate change scenario these changes would be especially noticeable in the cold period of year november to april in terms of changes in annual hydrometeorological variables water loads are expected to rise up to 35 4 this is the result of expected increase in precipitation which is not to be sufficiently offset by temperature induced higher evapotranspiration less snow and ice melting water would result in redistributed quantities of waters coming by different pathways there will be much less surface runoff especially during spring period the lost part of surface runoff water would be replaced by larger shares of lateral and groundwater runoff in terms of monthly changes in hydrometeorological variables the main rise in water flows is foreseen for winter months especially january and february a slight increase through july to october which might have a positive hydrological effect on small river ecosystems and a sharp decline in march may period due to a drop in snow melt annual water flows in absolute terms are expected to rise throughout all the river basins of lithuania but most notably in the western and south eastern lithuania the areas which already have highest water flows however the largest relative increase in water flows is expected in the agricultural production belt of lithuania northern central and south western flat land parts of the country water quality variables are expected to follow the changed hydrological patterns a drop in annual and springtime sediment as well as the related organic and mineral phosphorus loads would stem from surface runoff decline however a significant increase of sediment and the related phosphorus loads is expected in the remaining vegetation period from june to october reason for this is earlier harvesting leaving soils without plant protection from increased precipitation and more extreme precipitation events contrary to phosphorus annual nitrogen loads might be subjected to a significant increase the rising leaching effects of increased water flows being amplified by temperature induced nutrient mineralisation the brunt of nitrogen load increase would occur in winter months which could climb up to a staggering 142 7 similarly as in the case with phosphorus a significant increase in nitrogen loads is expected in part of the vegetation period july october possible summer increases in both nitrogen and phosphorus might potentially trigger the intensification of eutrophication processes in all surface water bodies however winter nitrogen load increase would have the most profound effect on standing water ecosystems like lakes the curonian lagoon and the baltic sea since part of winter transported nitrogen would be accumulated and then later made available for plants when vegetation period starts concerning rivers a slight increase in the number of water bodies with nitrate levels above acceptable threshold is expected as in the case with water flows nitrogen loads in absolute terms are expected to rise throughout all the basins too but unlike with water flows the biggest absolute and relative rise is expected in lithuania s agricultural flat lands northern central and south western parts of the country suggesting that this problematic territory in particular might need additional measures to compensate for climate change related increased nitrogen losses however climate change is expected just to exacerbate current problems which are and will be mainly determined by intensive agriculture rather than climate change credit authorship contribution statement svajunas plunge conceptualization data curation

958,the study evaluated climate change impact on water flows and nutrient loads to surface water bodies in lithuania by applying the swat model seven rcm and gcm combinations were selected and rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change representative concentration pathways were selected for the study the study concluded that an annual and winter increase in most river water flows are expected the change will be driven by rising precipitation mainly in the regions where it is already high less snow would result in less surface runoff substituted by increased lateral and groundwater flows because of more water percolating through the soils as a result water flows could be expected to increase by 9 7 for rcp4 5 and by 35 4 for the rcp8 5 climate scenario by the end century whereas sediment transport and phosphorus loads would tend to decline a little bit median results are 11 4 and 5 6 respectively for the rcp4 5 scenario 13 3 and 7 4 for the rcp8 5 by the end of century conversely temperature driven nutrient mineralization and increased leaching are expected to cause a significant increase in nitrogen loads by 23 1 for the rcp4 5 scenario and by 64 4 for the rcp8 5 by the end of century overall it could be concluded that climate change related hydrometeorological and water quality changes were found to be the most profound for the end century rcp8 5 climate change scenario keywords climate change hydrology nutrient loads swat model lithuania 1 introduction climate change is a factor of reality which has to be accounted for in every future planning activities even if countries would keep up with paris climate agreement s long term temperature goal which is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 c with a target of 1 5 c un 2015 to pre industrial levels extreme environmental changes are to be expected ipcc 2018 however this is getting increasingly unlikely as steep drop of green house gas ghg emissions required by such commitments has yet to be observed according to the world meteorological organization wmo 2020 already during a 2020 2024 year period there is 20 chance one of these years will already be 1 5 c warmer than pre industrial levels but the chance is increasing with time thus any governmental or business planning should take this into account including water resource management water pollution and water scarcity are among the main challenges faced by the world and also the european union water environment is under pressure from multiple stressors such as discharges of municipal and industrial waste waters irrigation transportation channelization damming fishing and multiple other human activities heathwaite 2010 among them diffuse sources are one of the most important ones according to eea 2018 38 of european water bodies are failing to reach good status because of diffuse pollution sources particularly from agriculture addressing water scarcity and pollution is also required by multiple eu legislative acts such as water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd marine strategy framework directive 2008 56 ec nitrate directive 91 676 eec and the helsinki convention 1974 relevant in the baltic sea region as well as its implementation instrument baltic sea action plan bsap yet since environmental targets require long term efforts the inclusion of climate change dimension is crucial since assumption of hydroclimatic stationarity is no longer a valid one heathwaite 2010 studies show bosch et al 2018 that various kinds of damage inflicted on the economies and the environment are not the only effects of climate change in addition to this climate change will likely increase the cost of meeting water quality goals effective reduction of diffuse water pollution should take into account changes in the environment due to climate change brouziyne et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 renkenberger et al 2017 wallace et al 2017 xu et al 2019 therefore it is of crucial importance to understand how water and nutrient flows are expected to be affected by upcoming changes in climate and align planning efforts with anticipated future conditions there are many efforts to estimate climate change impacts on ecohydrological systems great majority of them are focused on changes expected in river flow regime some of them are looking into large scale changes like on the level of continents or regions for instance study by schneider et al 2013 investigates the impacts of climate change on river flow regimes in europe by using global hydrology model similar european analysis by marx et al 2017 is based on a multi model ensemble of hydrological simulations other studies focus on a specific region for example the nordic baltic region or the baltic sea region study by øygarden et al 2014 looks into possible effects of climate change on runoff and nitrogen losses in the nordic baltic region ebook by the bacc ii author team 2015 collects multiple studies of climate related research relevant to the baltic sea region however most studies are focused on a particular river or water body as lake lagoon or fjord basin for instance a study of molina navarro et al 2018 is focused on danish fjord while a study of čerkasova et al 2016 on the curonian lagoon or the nemunas river basin focused study by kriaučiūnienė et al 2008 only a few of them take the whole country as a study object for example a study by piniewski et al 2018 examines projections of runoff in the vistula and the odra river basins both of which together cover around 88 of poland yet most of such studies make conclusions based on existing and already published regional or basin level research work which is usually done in the framework of a particular national project gpf 2015 lmt 2017 the whole country of lithuania was selected as the focus area for this study as overall country conclusions are important for decision makers in discussing strategies for pollution abatement measures and programs as lithuania is a small country total area is about 65300 km2 it is possible to extract somewhat unified conclusions over expected changes including regional differences inside the country there is already a lot of research done covering parts of lithuania on topics of climate change impact on surface water flows kriaučiūnienė et al 2008 looked into climate change impact on hydrological processes in the nemunas river basin it covers around 70 of lithuania moreover kriauciuniene et al 2009 examined uncertainties of climate change hydrological impact predictions for southern lithuania river basin of merkys covers 3781 km2 of lithuania jakimavičius et al 2018 estimated changes expected in the curonian lagoon water balance salinity and temperature by modeling changes in the nemunas river basin čerkasova et al 2016 in her study analyzed climate change induced water discharge changes in the nemunas river basin akstinas et al 2019 assessed expected climate change impacts on three rivers in lithuania representing different hydrological regions however there are far fewer studies that would examine climate change impacts on nutrient loads and concentrations in lithuanian rivers čerkasova et al 2018 examined climate change impact on water flows and nutrient loads in the upstream part of the neris river basin the lithuanian part of the neris river basin comprises 7824 km2 which is situated in the territory of belarus the minija river basin 2942 km2 has also been examined in terms of climate change impact on water discharge and nutrient load changes čerkasova et al 2019 modeling study done by povilaitis et al 2018 with fyris model examined flows and nutrient load changes with different climate scenarios for the minija 2939 km2 nevėžis 6140 km2 šventoji 6771 km2 and žeimena 2769 km2 river basins the most comprehensive work was done by čerkasova 2019 where the nemunas river basin discharge nutrient and sediment loading as well as microbial pollution were examined through the climate change perspective nevertheless even after reviewing numerous published studies we were not able to find information covering an entire country moreover existing studies lacked insights into changes on pathways by which water and nutrients were reaching water bodies this information is of crucial importance when planning adaptation strategies lastly some results between studies contradicted each other in their final conclusions for instance čerkasova et al 2018 concluded that water flows and nitrogen loads are going to increase with climate change yet study by lmt 2017 for the same neris river projected a substantial decrease of water flows and nutrient loads furthermore there is a lack of agreement as to which climate scenario is going to have a bigger impact one study on the minija river by akstinas et al 2019 shows that in the event of the rcp8 5 scenario water flows would decrease the most yet study results by čerkasova et al 2019 conclude that this would be the case if the rcp4 5 scenario takes hold for answering questions of climate change impact on water environment hydrological and water quality modeling has became increasingly important tool in recent decades many different models have been applied successfully however semi distributed processed based soil and water assessment tool swat model is one of the most extensively used ecohydrological models across the globe gassman and yingkuan 2015 it has also been broadly used for the hydro climatic questions tan et al 2020 swat has been widely utilized for dealing with questions important in the baltic sea basin which relate to the implementation of river basin management plans required by eu directive 2000 60 ec the so called water framework directive thereafter wfd and country allocated reduction targets required by bsap andersen et al 2016 hesse et al 2014 huttunen et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2018 piniewski et al 2021 thodsen et al 2017 it has been successfully applied for hydro climatic questions in lithuania as well čerkasova 2019 čerkasova et al 2019 moreover it is supported and used as an operational model for the water management questions by the environmental protection agency of lithuania paic 2015 plunge 2013 therefore we selected swat model for use in our work thus the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 evaluate the impact of climate change on water flows in lithuania by applying swat model 2 assess expected climate change induced changes in nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus loads and their riverine concentrations in the country 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the focus area for this study is the whole country of lithuania however it was important to include important areas outside the country as well the transboundary parts of lithuanian river basins were critical to enable the modeling of climate change scenarios it should be noted though that these areas were included mainly for the purpose of getting the boundary conditions for lithuanian rivers as a result model preparation for transboundary areas was performed with much coarser data lower river network resolution and lower calibration validation effort if compared to the lithuanian part of ecohydrological model modeling area fig 1 used in this study spanned across lithuania 65300 km2 belarus 45463 km2 for the nemunas basin and 488 km2 for the daugava basin and poland 2516 km2 however despite sharing some of river basins with lithuania territories in the kaliningrad oblast part of russia are not covered by this study this was possible because the kaliningrad region for the most part only receives water flows from lithuania the results presented here relate solely to the territory of lithuania the land use of lithuania the focus area of the study is dominated by agriculture which occupies around 59 of the country s territory forests take up another 30 water bodies 2 urban built up areas 3 and other areas 6 plc 7 2019 land uses for the study area outside of lithuania modeled for the purpose of getting boundary conditions are also dominated by agriculture 49 and forests 47 while the remaining uses taking up significantly lower shares water 1 urban built up areas 0 4 and other 3 pakhomau 2016 most agricultural land in lithuania is used for cereal production according to statistics lithuania 2021 in 2020 around 47 of arable land was used for grain production while grasslands occupied around 33 intensive use of land for plant growing is concentrated in the central northern parts of the country which is characterized by fertile soils and mostly flat terrain eastern western and southern parts are less suitable for intensive plant growing due to not as suitable soils therefore more used for livestock production beside low slopes the highest place 294 m mild temperatures average 3 2 c in january and 17 9 c in july dominant feature of the country is the excess of humidity this means precipitation is notably higher on average around 695 mm per year than evapotranspiration on average 470 mm per year causing excessive soil water content in some areas lietuvos hidrometeorologijos tarnyba 2021 as a

description the swat model is without a doubt one of the most widely used ecohydrological models available gassman and yingkuan 2015 it is a process based semi distributed and a continuous time tool which is used for the simulation of water sediment nutrients pesticides or heavy metals on a daily time step arnold et al 1998 necessary input for this model includes meteorological soil land use agricultural management fertilization tillage crops rotations planting and harvesting time etc slope river network and other data or information arnold et al 2012 based on this information swat model prepares basic spatial units called hydrological response units hrus which represent unique combinations of land use soil and slope within each sub basin hrus are the smallest spatial units in the model for which processes of water sediment movement plant growth or nutrient cycling are simulated land processes are calculated first and then water is routed through the river network to the outlets 2 3 epa river modeling system the environmental protection agency of lithuania epa selected swat model as its operational model for surface water questions related to wfd bsap nitrate directive and the marine strategy framework directive firstly the model was tested on a small catchment in the center of lithuania plunge 2009 2011 later based on these test results the activities of model preparation for the whole country were started plunge 2013 which led to the final outcome the river modeling system rms which integrated swat 2012 model with specially prepared python script library paic 2015 the prepared scripts library allowed to manage the whole process of input data preparation gis time series data various sources of information from raw data input preparation to swat model formats running the model extracting and examining outputs as well as setting up scenarios in a seamless way the most recent and detailed available data for the country was applied for the rms

international data relevant for the rms were collected and processed for the preparation of relevant model inputs multiple institutions were approached for data as well as experts of specific fields

swat model calibration and validation was done in a number of steps first lithuanian territory was divided into 14 regions according to the hydrological and pollution generation conditions fig 2 presents the resulting identified regions for all of these regions the representative water discharge and water quality monitoring stations were selected one per each region which contained rich datasets calibration and validation was done for those selected stations when good as described below results were reached the relevant representative parameters were attributed to the whole region the final step model validation was performed utilizing data of stations which were not used in the calibration validation process if the required criteria were not met over those stations additional calibration validation iterations were done in order to reach the necessary performance level targets for model calibration and validation criteria were based on moriasi et al 2007 and bennett et al 2013 guidelines additionally swat check program white et al 2014 was applied to identify problems with representation of processes and correcting them soft calibration was applied to get hydrology and nutrient processes align with available data for yields subsurface flow etc 62 hydrological stations were used in model calibration validation for water quality data from 130 stations were used data used in model calibration validation spanned across 1997 2013 year period detail steps and results are presented in the report of paic 2015 final model performance results achieved by calibration validation effort is presented in fig 3 water flows were represented well with median model performance values around 0 for percent of bias pbias parameter and around 0 6 for nash sutcliffe nse model efficiency coefficient for daily water flows total nitrogen tn and nitrates nitrate nitrogen also well simulated by the model as median model performance values were 0 8 for determination coefficient r2 and pbias close to zero for monthly concentration values the most problematic variables for calibration were phosphate phosphate phosphorus and total phosphorus tp as those are very sensitive to point source data quality and frequency of both point source and water quality monitoring data heathwaite 2010 monthly grab sample data might not be adequate for this task median pbias for these variables were around 0 13 the final parameter set is presented in table 1 this table provides information on how swat 2012 default parameters were changed in calibrated validated model for different regions the meaning of parameters could be found in arnold et al 2012 swat input output documentation version 2012 2 2 link to documentation https swat tamu edu media 69296 swat io documentation 2012 pdf beside parameters presented in table 1 values for some parameters were changed for all regions firstly potential evapotranspiration calculation was changed to hargreaves method neitsch et al 2011

with additional point source and meteorological data to extend simulated time series by 6 years up to 2019 in order for varying loads from point sources not to interfere with the effects of agricultural bmps results are planned to be presented in the next paper or climate change point source loads waste water treatment plants and storm water pipes for historical and forecasting periods were fixed to constant yearly values the 2012 2019 period point source load data were grouped by the type of effluents and treatment and 1st quartile yearly concentration values were calculated to represent the groups which were applied for all the point sources available for the year 2019 this allowed to fix point source loads and set them to an achievable low level which could be reasonably expected in the future fixing point sources at low level was important to avoid interference with in stream processes finally it is also important to emphasize that land use for the purposes of this study was kept constant representing the situation in the year 2012 earlier date was chosen to better represent historical period this allowed to separate only impacts of climate change and examine them though to be more realistic scenarios should include predicted landuse change agricultural activities fertilization tillage harvest operation scheduling etc used in the model was prepared from information on agricultural activities available for the 2010 2013 period agricultural operations were constructed using heat unit scheduling available in swat 2012 neitsch et al 2011 2 4 climate change data meteorological data for climate change modeling was collected from the european coordinated regional climate downscaling euro cordex program 3 3 data could be reached by the following link https www euro cordex net which is designed to serve as input for climate change impact and adaptation studies within the timeline of the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change euro cordex 2021 fine resolution 0 11 degree eur 11 12 5km regional climate models rcm were selected for this work the nearest grid points to the real meteorological stations have been assigned to represent conditions at those stations in total 18 stations with climate data were prepared for lithuania and 6 for the study area outside of it the selection of rcms and global climate models gcms which were used to set boundary conditions for rcms were based on the availability of data for particular climate change scenarios and generating wider representations of possible rcms and gcms combinations see table 2 seven combinations were selected inline with recommendations given by multiple sources to use ensembles of climate models rather than a single best fitting one rathjens et al 2016 singh 2016 in all combinations ensemble r1i1p1 was selected since euro cordex program already delivered quality data for the european context additional selection criteria was not applied two climate change representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were selected to represent future climatic conditions rcp4 5 set to represent the intermediate and rcp8 5 to represent the worst case climate change scenarios data for daily minimum near surface air temperature tasmin daily maximum near surface air temperature tasmax and precipitation pr were collected as input to the swat model other swat meteorological data wind speed solar radiation relative humidity were generated by the use of swat weather generator neitsch et al 2011 bias correcting methods were applied in addition to climate data extraction unit conversion assignment to meteorological stations according to sunyer et al 2015 rcms inherit the biases from gcms thus statistical bias adjustment of rcms outputs is important therefore the latter procedure is commonly applied before using data in climate scenarios for hydrological modeling singh 2016 in this work cmhyd program was used for bias correction which is available on official swat model website 4 4 link to the software https swat tamu edu software cmhyd this tool has been tested with cordex data rathjens et al 2016 and has implemented several downscaling or bias correcting methods for precipitation and temperature after examining initial results local intensity scaling method was selected for bias correction of precipitation data the only exception was remo2009 for which due to poor results the linear scaling was used instead local intensity scaling method distribution mapping method was used for bias correction temperature data swat model was run for time period of 1994 2099 with the prepared rcms data in order to be consistent with the rest of time series historical period was modeled with rcms data three periods of 20 years were selected for the assessment and representation of results historical period included the 2000 2019 year interval mid century the 2040 2059 year interval and end century the 2080 2099 year interval 3 results 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 annual water flows one of important questions raised by this study was how would climate change affects hydrological conditions in lithuania to answer this question all values for particular hydrological variables were summed up to represent country totals for each year afterwards averaging was performed for selected periods finally results obtained by using all climate models were presented in boxplots depicting the distribution of results around the median of model outcomes results from the modeling are presented in fig 4 surface runoff in results represents water reaching surface water bodies via overland flow water reaching water bodies through soil is included in lateral and tile drain flows while groundwater flow represents water infiltrating from shallow aquifers percolation past soil profile is water leaving soil to feed shallow aquifers whereas water flow is all water contributed to a streamflow results show that according to rcm outcomes precipitation is likely to increase in lithuania in the future the increase in median values by 5 7 could be expected in the rcp4 5 scenario by the end of the century however if the rcp8 5 scenario would be on course the increase could climb up to 17 9 due to rising temperatures large changes are expected in winter snow coverage for the rcp4 5 scenario expected median change between historical and the end of century periods is 32 7 while for the rcp8 5 it would be 60 an increase in temperatures would potentially raise actual evapotranspiration by 3 9 for the rcp4 5 scenario and by 10 1 for the rcp8 5 scenario if historical and end of century periods are compared these hydrological changes might have profound effect on water flows distribution on land less snow or ice cover due to climate warming allows more infiltration thus surface runoff is expected to decrease by 17 9 for the rcp4 5 scenario the decrease in surface runoff is expected to be slightly smaller for the rcp8 5 scenario in which it would constitute a 15 9 drop by the end of this century the loss of surface runoff would seem to be overcompensated by more precipitation water infiltrating into the soil and thus by bigger quantities of water reaching water bodies through an underground flow for instance in the worst case scenario soil water content would increase by roughly 5 8 by the end of century if compared to the historical period as the result water flows are expected to increase by 9 7 until the middle of this century and by 9 6 by the end of it if the rcp4 5 scenario takes hold in case of the rcp8 5 scenario the rise in water flows would constitute 7 and 35 4 respectively tendencies for lateral flows are inline with that of water flows 3 1 2 monthly and seasonal water flows monthly results averaged over the country also provide important insights into possible changes in temporal distribution of water flows fig 5 shows that in both scenarios precipitation would be more unpredictable during may october period while december february period would get more consistent increase of precipitation it is also noticeable that the rcp8 5 scenario might cause amplification of trends and an increase of uncertainty in monthly precipitation fig 6 on relative changes in precipitation in different scenarios relative to historical period hints that precipitation tends to increase or remain stable pretty much in all months with more pronounced peaks in winter months as well as possibly during august october period snow and ice melt would face the largest changes during february april period for the rcp4 5 scenario modeling results show that april could be free of snow or ice by the end of century for the worst case scenario april and november would become warm months moreover december march months would see sharp drop in snow or ice melting because of shrunken snow cover area by the end of century december january february and march snow and ice melting drop would be 50 9 40 3 43 1 and 86 1 correspondingly surface runoff in march and april would see the largest drop during both scenarios yet the rcp8 5 scenario would see higher amplification of the trend it should be noted as well that an upward trend in surface flow from july to january is expected which is especially prominent in the rcp8 5 scenario and end century period however the latter trend is rather significant only in relative terms in relation to historical values of a particular month and not that much in absolute terms as in spring changes groundwater flow would face only slight changes in intermediate scenario up to 34 9 increase in february whereas in the worst case scenario the 53 1 60 2 and 59 7 increase during january february and march respectively are expected with other months being exposed to a lesser change upward trends are also detectable from approximately august to november although somewhat lower in relative and absolute terms if compared to winter increases may july period seems to remain a rather stable one although some important differences among scenarios are noticeable in case of the rcp8 5 scenario no change or slight increase in groundwater flow is possible while the rcp4 5 scenario might bring even reductions in flows for water flow the results for january and february indicate the most substantial changes a 51 2 and 40 increase for the intermediate scenario there is also a decrease of flows during march may expected which is occurring because of drop in snow and ice melt those trends are well amplified in the worst case climate scenario the months with largest water flow increases are november to february increases of water flows are 45 58 6 71 3 and 70 6 respectively between historical and the end century periods expected decreases for march and april are 11 2 and 29 8 furthermore the rcp8 5 scenario not only emboldens the trends of climate impact but it also increase uncertainty bands represented by span of box plot and whiskers for the prediction it is worth noting that increased precipitation and the resulting surface runoff and groundwater flow might slightly increase water flows through july to october as well according to the fig 6 potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration are expected to increase significantly during november may period however trends are not so clearly for the rest of the year in fact for this remaining period of the year actual evapotranspiration might stay on the same level or might even face a slight reduction lateral flows would plummet only for march june period in the remaining period of the year those flows would be increasing with especially sharp rise during winter months for the worst case scenario winter increase would be nearly twice as large by the end of century if compared to the intermediate climate change scenario water percolation past the root zone 5 5 in model its depth is defined by soil type it varies in the interval from 1200 to 1750 mm with average values around 1360 mm would mirror the trends in lateral flows the more water infiltrates into the soil the more will be leaving the soils and discharging into surface and groundwater bodies for some scenarios relationship is not exactly the same since fig 6 presents medians and not means of results for variables this allows for some misalignment similarly such misalignment could be noticed in some cases for soil water content variable which is recorded at the end of each period for other variables the average of the period is recorded despite this it could be observed that spring and summer would bring reductions in soil water and water flows refilling groundwater bodies autumn and winter would be the seasons which would replenish groundwater for the worst case scenario water addition to shallow aquifers will be larger 3 2 water quality 3 2 1 annual nutrient and sediment loads hydrological changes have substantial impact on nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus and sediment loads to water bodies fig 7 presents annual loads reaching water bodies by different pathways sediment organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus as well as mineral phosphorus are tightly interconnected in a way that surface runoff is their main pathway to surface water bodies as a result sizable decrease in surface runoff propagate into decrease in load values for all the above mentioned variables in case of the most extreme scenario by the end of century water bodies might face a 13 3 22 4 15 3 and 6 3 decrease in loads for sediment organic nitrogen organic and mineral phosphorus respectively however for the same scenario and time scale potential rise in quantities of nitrates no3 n reaching water bodies through subsurface water flows is rather staggering for nitrates in tile drains the increase in loads would amount to approximately 153 1 for nitrates in lateral flow 57 2 and for nitrates in groundwater flow 108 7 this is likely to occur in part due to higher quantity of water expected to reach water bodies through a subsurface path yet the acceleration of nitrification in the soils because of temperature increase might probably be equally important or even more important factor driving the rise of nitrate loads it is worth noting that nitrification is expected to also increase the amount of nitrates reaching water bodies by surface runoff by 8 5 on the other hand the intermediate climate scenario would cause much less pronounced but still significant changes for instance it is expected that by the end of century the amount of nitrates reaching water bodies through tile drains would increase by 60 4 whereas through lateral flow by 31 5 with groundwater flow by 58 1 and with surface runoff by 2 a drop of sediment and nutrient loads reaching water bodies with surface runoff would be milder as well sediment yield is expected to face a reduction of around 11 4 organic nitrogen 26 3 organic phosphorus 15 2 and mineral phosphorus 3 7 3 2 2 monthly loads some representative variables were selected to be examined with monthly results sediment yields variable was selected to best represent changes in pollutant loads affected by the reduction in surface runoff changes in sediment yield are on the same path as changes in loads of organic parts of nutrients and mineral phosphorus nitrates mobile part of nitrogen reaching water bodies via subsurface water flows represents another group which relates to increased nitrification and precipitation fig 8 shows that the largest part of sediment yield reduction with the highest uncertainty is occurring during march april months sediment yield drop for these months by the end of century could amount to roughly 45 4 and 78 2 respectively for the rcp4 5 scenario whereas for the rcp8 5 scenario the drop of 81 9 and 81 8 for the same months is likely this is highly connected with the reduction of snow or ice melt and the subsequent drop in springtime surface runoff which is characterized by larger quantities of water erosion related suspended matter flow while march april is responsible for the largest sediment yield drop in absolute terms as well as for a total reduction of annual sediment flow relative sediment yield changes when compared to historical period reveal other interesting patterns as could be witnessed from fig 9 a significant increase of sediment yield is expected in the remaining vegetation period from june to october in the worst case scenario such an increase could reach up to 450 or even more in some months by the end of century such projections may partly be attributed to an increase in precipitation which to a lesser extent is expected to occur during summer months as well in addition to this more numerous and more intense precipitation events are likely to occur in the future which would enhance water erosion related sediment flow although summer sediment jump might be significantly lower in absolute terms than a spring drop it might be important for phosphorus content and its effect on eutrofication processes during summer period when nutrients are in fullest demand and a climate change induced temperature rise would even more intensify the usual vegetation processes major changes for nitrates reaching water bodies through the tile drains are expected to occur during winter months as climate change causes snow and ice cover to disappear precipitation which otherwise would be locked on land would infiltrate and wash away mobile nitrates from soil into surface water bodies for the intermediate climate change scenario by the end of century nitrate leaching through december january and february months would increase by about 42 1 138 3 and 93 respectively as for the worst case scenario the rise in nitrate leaching values for the same months and period would be 163 5 240 6 and 171 respectively as in the case with sediment yield big relative increase in nitrate tile drains leaching is expected for july october period as well which might be attributed to a summer precipitation and temperature rise for nitrates in lateral flow a similar pattern as in tile drains would hold except that this time march would face a large increase in load values as well changes in end of century nitrates loading for the december march period in intermediate scenario would comprise a 40 5 80 7 95 9 and 33 3 rise respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario end of century increases could be about 65 7 127 4 106 1 and 48 8 respectively relative july october period rise in loading values are similar to that of the tile drains however the change is of a lesser magnitude but it would be also observed in november nitrates leaching with groundwater is also expected to rise the magnitude of which is tightly interconnected with the intensity of climate change however this source is far less significant if compared to nitrates in lateral flow and especially to tile drains the first three months would face the steepest increase for the rcp4 5 scenario the rise in loads for january march months would amount to 73 103 8 and 52 1 respectively by the end of century the worst case scenario could increase those values up to 152 142 7 and 107 1 respectively it should be noted though that the worst case scenario is prone to much higher uncertainty as well furthermore in relative terms the increase in nitrate loads through groundwater would rise in all months even in springtime period and by a similar amount as the result it seems that not only phosphorus but also nitrogen could potentially reach water bodies in slightly larger quantities in the vegetation period which could have negative implications for the eutrophication processes in water bodies fig 9 indicates that the loads of nitrates with surface runoff as well as that of organic nitrogen will be decreasing in march june period this is connected to expected reductions in surface runoff for the rest of the year an increase for both variables could be expected however this increase will manifest itself most dramatically in the end of century rcp8 5 scenario similar trends could be observed in the results for organic mineral and soluble phosphorus loads spring and early summer is where reductions could be expected whereas for the second half of the year an increase is predicted which will largely depend on climate change intensity it is also important to note that variables dependent on surface runoff will be changing less in winter months for the worst case scenario than in the case of the intermediate scenario this is due to a smaller surface runoff increase estimated for the rcp8 5 scenario 3 3 aggregation of annual water flow and nutrient load results previous hydrology and water quality sections presented detailed information about changes expected in water flows and nutrient loads due to climate change this section briefly sums up that information extracting the main trends which could be anticipated for the future fig 10 illustrates how water flows will likely be redistributed between the historical and end of century periods for the two rcp scenarios the meanings of abbreviations used in the figure are as follows prec precipitation snow snow and ice melt rain prec snow evap evapotranspiration surf plant soil surface interaction surq surface runoff latq lateral flow grwf groundwater flow tileq water flow through tile drains waty water flows it could be seen that the difference between the intermediate and worst case scenarios starts with increased precipitation the more intense climate change the more increase in precipitation could be expected also the worst case scenario would significantly reduce snow and ice melt basically it means that there will be less cold days and consequently less snow and ice moreover the intensity of climate change will alter evapotranspiration by increasing it however increased evapotranspiration only partially buffers the precipitation increase additionally less water will likely reach surface water bodies through surface runoff thus more water will be available for infiltration into soil the expected increase in lateral groundwater and flow through tile drains will be governed by the intensity of climate change this also implies that more nutrients in soils especially mobile nitrogen will be facing increased likelihood of washing out lastly water flows in surface water bodies are expected to increase and the level of increase will climb if more intense climate change scenario takes place fig 11 provides summary information about how overall quantity of water flows and nutrients will change in lithuania through periods and with different climate scenarios according to the figure water flows are going to increase especially with longer time frame and more extreme climate change scenario as stated previously the largest increase would come from subsurface flows due to increased washing of soils substantial increase of nitrogen loads could be expected in the future the most of it will come through the tile drains and lateral flow the already dominant nitrates pathways some reduction of organic nitrogen which is connected to sediments could be expected until the middle of the century phosphorus loads coming from non point sources are expected to decrease slightly as less surface runoff is expected especially during the time without vegetation the worst case scenario could bring more notable reductions in phosphorus pathways connected to sediments 3 4 spatial distribution of changes spatial distribution of changes is also important in the examination of climate change impacts in general water flows are expected to rise throughout all the basins with the most prominent changes expected for end century values of the rcp8 5 scenario however spatial distribution of those changes reveal regional differences fig 12 shows how lithuania s territory differs in terms of expected water flow absolute change from the values in the historical period having in mind different climate change scenarios and different time frames a similar but slightly different is fig 13 which depicts the same change expressed in percentages the percentage change map seems to suggest that the biggest increase in water flows may occur in the agricultural production belt of lithuania northern central and south western flat land parts of the country and in the south eastern recreational countryside on the other hand absolute change map distinguishes mainly south eastern and north western parts of the country as the areas of potentially largest absolute rise in water flows overall it seems that the most notable changes in absolute terms is likely to occur in areas which already have highest water flows nevertheless the higher relative percentage water flow rise in lithuanian flat lands might be a fact of significance since this is the driest region of the country facing frequent water scarcity issues in rivers during summer periods spatial analysis was undertaken for nitrogen loads as well using the same approach which was applied for water flows here as with the water flows nitrogen loads are expected to rise throughout all the basins too with end century rcp8 5 values being the highest ones regional differences have been found for nitrogen loads as well the differences could be tracked by examining figures 14 and 15 which represent expected absolute kg ha and relative percentage changes in nitrogen loads if compared to a historical period the biggest absolute nitrogen load increase is expected in the lithuanian agricultural flat lands northern central and south western parts of the country the same holds true for relative percentage changes with addition to large increases in the south eastern part of lithuania this seems to suggest that a combination of increased precipitation temperature and large amounts of soil organic in agricultural flat lands as well as intensive agricultural practices could result in leaching and temperature decomposition driven rise in nitrogen loads from northern central and south western parts of the country these areas are likely to bear the brunt of total nitrogen load rise from the territory of lithuania this prospect is rather concerning given the fact that the highest nitrogen loads are already confined to the areas dominated by agriculture 3 5 changes in nutrient concentrations changing loads and water flows would also affect concentrations in the rivers fig 16 shows how water body status judged by only nitrogen concentrations would change over time in the settings of different climate change scenarios nitrogen concentrations officially are divided into 5 status categories based on intervals extracted from national law am 2007 very good 2 mgn l good 2 3 mgn l moderate 3 6 mgn l bad 6 12 mgn l very bad 12 mgn l for the sake of simplicity we grouped river water bodies into two categories water bodies at risk of not achieving at least good status by 2027 moderate bad and very bad status and water bodies not at risk good and very good status it is noticeable that in both scenarios status of water bodies is going to worsen over time areas dominated by agriculture would be affected the most yet the worst case scenario would cause the most adverse changes 4 discussion 4 1 water flows study results show that we should be expecting higher level of precipitation over the country s territory and the increase of precipitation is connected with the intensity of climate change the more extreme scenario would take place the more extreme rise in precipitation could be expected this pattern would hold even though the rise in temperatures would enhance evapotranspiration yet this enhancement would not be on the level needed to offset the precipitation increase on a annual balance therefore the increase in water flows could be expected throughout the country especially in winter december to february such conclusions are inline with multiple other sources for instance extensive study by gpf 2015 analyzed results of 24 gcm models and presented expected changes of precipitation over lithuania for different timescales and different rcp scenarios results of this study show a clear increase of precipitation which is scaled with intensity of climate change the largest increase is expected during non vegetative period october to may the same conclusion is drawn in the work by øygarden et al 2014 which overviewed the nordic baltic region for expected changes due to climatic conditions according to this study precipitation and water flows in rivers will increase outside the growing season multiple european scale studies lobanova et al 2018 marx et al 2017 schneider et al 2013 confirm that the northern region is expected to face a stream flow increase the scale of which will be correlated with climate change intensity the same conclusion is made in studies for the scandinavian countries in the baltic sea catchment molina navarro et al 2018 the bacc ii author team 2015 study by tamm et al 2018 on estonian rivers combining high resolution euro cordex project rcm data with swat modeling also obtained results which predict an increase in annual runoff research on the vistula and odra covering 88 of poland rivers using nine bias corrected rcms simulations showed an increase in the mean of spatially averaged runoff over poland which is positively correlated with the intensity of climate change and the time horizon the closer the forecast period is to the end of century the larger runoff increase is to be expected similar conclusions on potential runoff increase are also made for lithuania by a special study targeted on forecasts for changes in hydropower production peter 2019 moreover increasing water flows are expected for the transboundary part of the lithuanian river neris basin čerkasova et al 2018 in addition to this an increase of precipitation and runoff is estimated for particular water bodies in lithuania as well for example according to the report by lhmt 2021 rėkyva lake would be exposed to an increasing water inflow due to climate change impacts moreover valiukas 2015 by analyzing past 1961 2010 period concluded that historical data already shows significant precipitation and runoff increase trends in lithuania results from climate models extend these trends into the future to our knowledge all other published national studies about climate change impact on water flows which are focused particularly on lithuanian rivers agree on water flow increase in winter akstinas et al 2019 čerkasova 2019 jakimavičius et al 2018 kriauciuniene et al 2009 kriaučiūnienė et al 2008 povilaitis et al 2018 šarauskienė et al 2018 however the results of the latter studies on changes in annual water flows are somewhat divergent from our work results contradictory conclusions made by these studies are related to the expectation of decreased annual water flows the magnitude of which would depend on the intensity of climate change those studies suggest that steeper temperature increase would cause more severe loss of annual water flows however study by čerkasova et al 2019 concluded that more extreme flow changes could be expected in the rcp4 5 scenario rather than the rcp8 5 one it is not obvious to us why such different conclusions could be made from the results of studies covering lithuania one possible explanation could be that the selection of gcm rcm methods for statistical downscaling of meteorological data and hydrological models could create large uncertainties and significantly change final results as demonstrated by several studies akstinas et al 2019 huttunen et al 2021 for instance this manifests itself in the study by tamm et al 2018 where two rcm models from euro cordex project resulted in different runoff projections similarly martínková et al 2011 concluded that different approaches in climate change predictions yielded the opposite final results in runoff and nutrient load changes moreover olsson et al 2016 showed that application of different hydrological models resulted in quite different runoff results for the same territory and the same climate change data additionally differences in the setup of baseline and forecast periods could bring differences in results as well some studies seem to indicate that lithuania might be located in the some sort of borderline area between different direction runoff trends in the north and south which might significantly increase the uncertainty level of predictions for lithuania this might be another possible explanation for divergent results for instance from schneider et al 2013 work it could be noticed that european river basins to the south of lithuania are expected to be faced with climate change induced reduced annual water flows if compared to the basins to the north of lithuania where a clear increase in annual water flows is expected schneider et al 2013 furthermore the study of the baltic sea basin by arheimer et al 2012 demonstrates that the northern part of the basin would witness a clear runoff increase however the more one moves to the south the less runoff increase could be expected due to climate change thus lithuania as a border line territory might have not a very clear signal in this respect therefore uncertainties could play quite a major role in the final results of all climate change impact studies for the country the choice of potential evapotranspiration pet calculation method in hydrological models is usually an important factor in the final results as well according to a study by hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 uncertainties related to evapotranspiration methods is of comparable magnitude to gcm uncertainty as the main source of uncertainty in estimation of hydrological impacts of climate change results presented in the study show that our selected hargreaves method for pet calculation have the lowest sensitivity to climate change compared to other applied methods thus it is important that this source of uncertainties would be investigated in future studies if our predictions are correct there might not be severe long term water quantity issues for groundwater reserves lakes and rivers overall it seems that groundwater reserves might grow or at least remain stable and in a long rem perspective lake water level is not going to drop however this does not mean there will not be short term water quantity fluctuations to the higher and the lower end in fact valiukas 2015 suggests that some droughts metrics like spi and htc indicate the number of short term meteorological droughts during the summer period is increasing and they cover larger territories this may indicate a possibly larger weather variability in summer months with more frequent droughts in some years and extremely wet condition in some other years notwithstanding this it appears from our results that in general the second half of the summer might be confronted with slightly higher water flows than in the historical period reducing the probability of now rather frequent occurrences of hydrological summer droughts on the other hand spring early summer periods might exhibit slightly lower than historical water flows which might partly exacerbate scarce water occurrences in some years there might also be some important spatial changes in water runoff due to climate change in general western and south eastern lithuanian areas will be exposed to highest absolute rise in water flows meaning that the areas which are already known for highest water flows will receive even more precipitation this will be important for lakes as these water bodies are mainly located in such areas and the precipitation fed western lithuania rivers in relative terms the highest percentage water flow increases will be present in lithuania s flat lands south western central and northern parts of the country the backbone of national agriculture industry having in mind frequent summer water shortages in small rivers during summer such changes could be beneficial to water ecosystems at least in the second half of the summer season 4 2 nutrient loads according to our results nitrogen loads are expected to increase with increasing climate change intensity climate change will bring more precipitation and less snow cover which will enhance more water percolation and thus wetter soil conditions resulting in more nitrogen leaching in addition changing climate will raise temperatures which in their turn will increase nutrient mineralisation and thus will cause even higher nitrogen losses from the soil barclay and walter 2015 nitrogen losses from the soils will be accelerated especially outside the growing season the same conclusion were made by øygarden et al 2014 and čerkasova et al 2018 arheimer et al 2005 examined climate change impact on a catchment in southern sweden applying soilndb and hbv models study results show that increased nitrogen losses from arable land higher nitrogen concentrations and loads into water bodies more pronounced seasonal dynamics declined quality of lakes and increased amounts of cyanobacteria could be expected in the future due to changes in the earth s climate another study on polish river basins marcinkowski et al 2017 concluded that climate change would clearly cause an increase in annual and seasonal total nitrogen losses sediment yield and phosphorus losses show only weak and uncertain trends with changing climate similar results was in our study sediment and phosphorus load trends on different territories were correlated mostly with precipitation changes however quite opposite conclusions were obtained by studies in which water flows were expected to decrease arheimer et al 2012 čerkasova et al 2019 lmt 2017 povilaitis et al 2018 these studies state that climate change will reduce nutrient losses and the increase in severity of climate change will result in greater level of reductions certainly water balance might be the most important factor which would drive climate change impact into decreasing or increasing direction for nitrogen losses from the soil yet plungė and gudas 2018 investigated current trends by examining historical and current water quality land use and fertilization data for lithuania and concluded that in the 1996 2017 period climate change seemed to have a reinforcing effect to the existing nitrogen loss trends from the soils this impact was especially well pronounced during the non growing season on agricultural soils our results presented in this study showed that the decrease of surface runoff in spring would likely cause the reduction of annual sediment and total phosphorus loads in the future such results are confirmed by the study of čerkasova et al 2018 the impact of sediment load drop will potentially be most pronounced on phosphorus part since phosphorus flux is highly connected to the movement of sediments especially during spring period such results are also confirmed in a study by marcinkowski et al 2017 on polish rivers however while annual sediment and total phosphorus loads is decreasing monthly results suggest that large increases could be expected especially in july to october period this occurs due to earlier planting harvesting and tillage after harvest which leaves soil unprotected by plants for a longer time during this period more precipitation and more extreme precipitation events cause larger sediment yields and loads of nutrients connected to sediments there might be some important considerations when discussing the effects of annual nutrient load changes to water ecosystems since most annual load increase of nitrogen would accrue to a non vegetative period the effect on the worsening of river ecosystem status would be relatively lower than on the status of standing water ecosystems like lakes the curonian lagoon and the baltic sea this could be due to the fact that in the cold season additional nitrogen quantities are not translated into more vegetation growth thus all this quantities is simply transported to the standing water bodies where it partially accumulates because of the latter process only the standing water ecosystems could experience a greater boost in productivity when spring comes on the other hand reduction of total annual sediment and the corresponding phosphorus loads could potentially block or inhibit to a various degree the nitrogen eutrophication boost effect in some standing water ecosystems due to enhanced phosphorus limiting effect jeppesen et al 2005 schindler et al 2008 however our study also observes a potential possibility of slight increase of sediment phosphorus as well as nitrogen loads in the second half of the summer season when additional nutrients might be rapidly incorporated into the biomass and thus exacerbate eutrophication processes in all water bodies rivers lakes the curonian lagoon and the baltic sea what is clear though that the brunt of nitrogen load increase will most likely be confined to the lithuanian agricultural flat lands 4 3 uncertainties certainly we are aware of possibly numerous uncertainties which might be related to our results most of them are already touched upon in the discussion these are uncertainties related to gcm rcm selection bias correction hydrological models selection data input model parametrization and calibration validation selection of pet methods anticipating future social economic technological conditions etc in our work we mostly addressed uncertainties related to gcm rcm selection by inclusion of ensembles of rcms as is recommended by singh 2016 this allowed us to examine the dispersion of results due to uncertainties related to rcm selection however inclusion of other types of uncertainties in such type of assessments of climate change impacts would be important in order to draw conclusions with much bigger certainty future efforts should be focused on this 5 conclusion this study aimed at evaluating the impact of climate change on water flows in lithuania as well as at assessing climate change related changes in nutrient loads and their riverine concentrations by applying swat model seven rcm and gcm combinations were selected where ensemble r1i1p1 was chosen the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate change representative concentration pathways were selected for the study overall it could be concluded that climate change related hydrometeorological and water quality changes were found to be mostly pronounced for the end century rcp8 5 climate change scenario these changes would be especially noticeable in the cold period of year november to april in terms of changes in annual hydrometeorological variables water loads are expected to rise up to 35 4 this is the result of expected increase in precipitation which is not to be sufficiently offset by temperature induced higher evapotranspiration less snow and ice melting water would result in redistributed quantities of waters coming by different pathways there will be much less surface runoff especially during spring period the lost part of surface runoff water would be replaced by larger shares of lateral and groundwater runoff in terms of monthly changes in hydrometeorological variables the main rise in water flows is foreseen for winter months especially january and february a slight increase through july to october which might have a positive hydrological effect on small river ecosystems and a sharp decline in march may period due to a drop in snow melt annual water flows in absolute terms are expected to rise throughout all the river basins of lithuania but most notably in the western and south eastern lithuania the areas which already have highest water flows however the largest relative increase in water flows is expected in the agricultural production belt of lithuania northern central and south western flat land parts of the country water quality variables are expected to follow the changed hydrological patterns a drop in annual and springtime sediment as well as the related organic and mineral phosphorus loads would stem from surface runoff decline however a significant increase of sediment and the related phosphorus loads is expected in the remaining vegetation period from june to october reason for this is earlier harvesting leaving soils without plant protection from increased precipitation and more extreme precipitation events contrary to phosphorus annual nitrogen loads might be subjected to a significant increase the rising leaching effects of increased water flows being amplified by temperature induced nutrient mineralisation the brunt of nitrogen load increase would occur in winter months which could climb up to a staggering 142 7 similarly as in the case with phosphorus a significant increase in nitrogen loads is expected in part of the vegetation period july october possible summer increases in both nitrogen and phosphorus might potentially trigger the intensification of eutrophication processes in all surface water bodies however winter nitrogen load increase would have the most profound effect on standing water ecosystems like lakes the curonian lagoon and the baltic sea since part of winter transported nitrogen would be accumulated and then later made available for plants when vegetation period starts concerning rivers a slight increase in the number of water bodies with nitrate levels above acceptable threshold is expected as in the case with water flows nitrogen loads in absolute terms are expected to rise throughout all the basins too but unlike with water flows the biggest absolute and relative rise is expected in lithuania s agricultural flat lands northern central and south western parts of the country suggesting that this problematic territory in particular might need additional measures to compensate for climate change related increased nitrogen losses however climate change is expected just to exacerbate current problems which are and will be mainly determined by intensive agriculture rather than climate change credit authorship contribution statement svajunas plunge conceptualization data curation

959,sediment transport is a complex hydrological phenomenon that influences water resources ecosystems soil and water quality the evaluation of sediment yield and mitigation practices are the mechanism to enhance the water resource potential the study was aimed at simulating the sediment yield and the impact of three best management scenarios in the upper and middle awash river basin umarb the soil and water assessment tool arcswat 2012 was used to simulate and identify high sediment yield prone areas in the catchment by the implementation of three management practices such as filter strips terraces and grassed waterways the model results indicated a good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow and sediment yield in the baseline scenario the mean annual sediment yield was 21 43 ton ha yr the implementation of 5 and 10 m filter strips reduced the mean annual sediment yield by 31 68 and 46 6 respectively terraces and grassed waterways were showed a reduction of sediment yield by 19 56 and 16 64 respectively filter strips were found to provide the highest reduction of sediment yield in each sub basin and the outlet of the catchment besides the combination of the three management scenarios has reduced the values of sediment yield by 50 88 from the baseline and the mean annual sediment yield becomes 10 53 ton ha yr in these results the efficiency of soil conservation practices would increase by applying more than two sediment management scenarios in the study area the study delivered important information for the reduction of sediment yield and implementation of sustainable watershed management in the umarb keywords sediment yield filter strips terraces grassed waterway management scenarios soil conservation 1 introduction simulation of sediment yield and its management scenarios is a device to estimate and mitigate sediment influx and outflux in the catchment explicitly to assess how much sediment load is generated from certain soil and land cover types sediment transport is a complex hydrological phenomenon and the variables involved in soil erosion modeling make a challenging to measure kumar et al 2015 soil erosion and sediment yield have a significant impact on water and natural resources water quality sustainability of agricultural development and loss of water storage in the reservoir abebe and gebremariam 2019 gathagu et al 2018 malunjkar et al 2015 mishra et al 2007 tadesse et al 2017 xu et al 2009 recently evaluating the impact of sediment yield and implementing soil and water conservation measures to manage sediment yield from different slopes and land used cover areas are crucial issues of the world gathagu et al 2018 the simulation of sediment yield is the primary on site of soil degradation

security abebe and gebremariam 2019 schmalz et al 2015 numerous studies have been done on the simulation of sediment yield and erosion of sediment transportation in different parts of ethiopia ayana et al 2012 ayele et al 2017 molla et al 2020 tadesse et al 2017 tesema and leta 2020 welde and gebremariam 2017 yesuf et al 2015 these studies reported that the north eastern central western and northeastern highlands of ethiopia have been influenced by soil erosion and land degradation besides the negative impact of soil erosion and land degradation influences water resource potential that could lead to an increase in drought events in the country ayele gebremariam 2020 quantified the high spatial and temporal variability of sedimentation in bilate watershed in rift valley lake basin ethiopia the spatial and temporal variability of sediment yield accounted to land use land cover soil and topographical features of the watershed besides among four conservation measures used i e grassed waterway filter strips terracing and contouring for reduction of sediment yield terracing 63 26 was found as the most suitable method in bilate watershed the studies conducted in upper blue nile river basin in ethiopia reported that the basin is one of the sensitive areas of sediment transport and land degradations where soil erosion and sediment yields vary spatially and temporally ayele et al 2017 betrie et al 2011 easton et al 2010 yesuf et al 2015 choto fetene 2019 simulated streamflow and sediment yield in gojeb watershed in the omo gibe basin based on the variability of land use land cover among three conservation measures i e filter strip terrace bund and reforestation practiced in the study area the reforestation scenario was recommended as the most appropriate technique of controlling sediment yield in the watershed conventionally awash river basin is the backbone of the ethiopian economy in the basin sugar factors and irrigation projects wonji shoa sugar factor metahara sugar factor upper awash agro industry fentale and tibila irrigation project water resource infrastructures koka and tendaho dam and other small and medium projects play a vital role in the economy of the country are found for the best utility of these infrastructures practicing soil and water conservation as well as finding the hotspot area of sediment yield soil erosion and sediment transportation is paramount tesema and leta 2020 several studies were addressed the soil erosion and sediment transportation of different watersheds in the awash river basin abebe and gebremariam 2019 bishaw and kedir 2015 jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 zeberie 2020 hence most of the studies were limited to a certain watershed with a small landscape in this paper umarb covers more than 28 000 km2 which is 23 4 of the basin landscape were covered besides in the downstream of the study area the amount of flood and sediment transportation are high and have more impact on tendaho sugar factory and tendaho dam dubti and assayita town jilo et al 2019 tilahun et al 2017 therefore simulation and mitigation of sediment load in the umarb are very important for land and water management in the catchment as well as for the downstream section moreover the earlier studies in awash river basin have highlighted the application of sediment management practice tesema and leta 2020 zeberie 2020 but before implementation the efficiency of each management practice needs to be established as the efficacy of any conservation practice varies in the area due to land uses slope and climatic conditions therefore the study is aimed to i simulate sediment yield in the umarb and ii evaluate the impact of three management scenarios and their combination on sediment yield reduction in umarb by using the arcswat2012 hydrological model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area umarb is located in the awash river basin ethiopia and geographically situated between 7 59 n and 9 25 n and 38 19 e and 40 36 e with areal coverage of 28 078 41 km2 fig 1 the elevation of the catchment varies from 4185 m at upstream of the catchment to 704 m at the outlet point above mean sea level fig 1 based on the topographical level and intertropical climate zone of the basin the precipitation distribution of the catchment varies in seasons and designates to three seasonal time series fig 2 the peak rainy season happened during kiremt heavy rainy season whereas the bega is the dry season out of the mean annual precipitation which is 905 mm about 58 occurred during the kiremt season the streamflow is significantly determined by the bimodal pattern of precipitation distribution in the catchment fig 2 the mean annual min max air temperature of the catchment is 20 1 c and 29 5 c respectively during the time series of 1990 2015 according to fao wrb 2006 classification eutric vertisols and lithic leptosols are the most dominant soil groups in the catchment fig 3 b cropland rainfed and irrigated agricultural land is the dominant land use land cover fig 3a the main crops of the umarb are wheat maize teff barley beans groundnut fruits and vegetables mainly tomatoes sugar cane is the dominant crop product in metahara and wonji shoa sugar factories daba and you 2020 in this study irrigated fields swamps addis ababa city and other small settlements are obtained although this study is located on the floor of the ethiopian rift valley hot springs and volcanic phenomena are commonly obvious chekol mnalku 2012 2 2 data the daily meteorological data i e precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity sunshine and wind speed of 14 meteorological stations fig 1 and hydrological data were obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia and the ministry of water irrigation and electricity respectively for the periods of 1990 to 2015 the selection of meteorological stations was based on the availability of long term data the minimum percentage of missing data and their inscription in the catchment the daily hydrological streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations data were recorded at the melka werer gauging station the digital elevation model dem 30 by 30 resolution was obtained from the asterbgdem website http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp the dem was used to delineate catchment and analysis drainage patterns soil and land use land cover data of the umarb were obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity in ethiopia mowie 2 3 data quality analysis before inputting meteorological data into the swat model analyzing its quality is a vital step among meteorological data quality decreasing factors missing data is common due to lack of appropriate records and shifting of the station location this could lead to incorrect and ambiguous results that may contradict the actual situation consequently the daily precipitation data were filled by the arithmetic mean method subramanya 2008 besides the time series of observed precipitation data was checked to the relatively consistent and homogeneous according to mccuen 1998 the obtained data is said to be homogenous if the measurements have been consistently done by the same method with the same instrumentation at the same time and place and in the same environment as presented in figure 3 a umarb has no distinct climatic and similar precipitation pattern the maximum precipitation was recorded during the heavy rainy season june september and the small rainy season february may figure 3 b shows the relatively consistent precipitation data which was determined using double mass curve techniques this technique is commonly used to analyze and check the consistency and adjustment of precipitation data choto and fetene 2019 2 4 soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model arcswat2012 hydrological model is a physically based and spatially semi distributed hydrological model designed to route water sediments and contaminants from individual drainage unit throughout a river basin towards its outlet the model predicts the impact of land management practices of water and sediment in the catchment with changing management conditions in soils and land cover over long periods arnold et al 2012 swat joined with geographical information system gis interface to process the datasets and construct the required input for the initial modeling setup fentaw et al 2018 the model was verified by using observed streamflow and sediment data of the umarb the model was selected because it is widely applied in the simulation of sediment yield and its management scenarios in different basins and catchments in the world particularly in the awash river basin al khafaji al chalabi 2019 ayele gebremariam 2020 betrie et al 2011 briak et al 2019 choto fetene 2019 gathagu et al 2018 tesema leta 2020 2 4 1 swat model input spatial data such as soil map and land use land cover data are the most important parameters of swat model input the spatial distribution of soil types and land use land cover in the umarb were displayed in fig 4 a and b in addition to soil and land use the swat requires dem to derive slope classes indicated in fig 4 c to create hydrological response units hrus the spatial data of soil land uses and slopes were used to increase the number of hrus and to provide a good understanding of the physical description of streamflow and sediment routing ayalew and bharti 2020 an increasing number of hrus was defined by eliminating the percentages of land use soil and slope values that covered a percentage of the catchment area less than the threshold level jilo et al 2019 the umarb was delineated into 25 sub basins and 573 hrus fig 4 d the threshold values of land use soil slope combination defined in hrus were 10 10 and 15 respectively to produce each hrus response unit and to obtain a good illustration of sediment load in the catchment ayalew and bharti 2020 the thresholds confirm a unique combination of land use soils and slopes in the ultimate determination of hrus by simplifying catchment processes the meteorological data required to setup the swat model are daily precipitation max min temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity the strength of swat model is to generate weather climate data from the stations which had full all climate data therefore in this study abomsa addis ababa metehara and shola gebeya weather stations were written into the wgen user file in swat database which was used to create a user defined weather generator yuan and forshay 2020 in addition the observed streamflow and sediment yield data were also collected to verify the performance of the swat model ayalew and bharti 2020 choto and fetene 2019 jilo et al 2019 tesema and leta 2020 in awash river basin there is a lack of continuous time series of observed sediment data bishaw and kedir 2015 jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 therefore to solve the limitation a sediment rating curve was established from the relationship between daily average streamflow and suspended sediment concentration data equation 1 the sediment rating curve is a widely applicable technique that is used to generate sediment yield in the region of limited observed data asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 in this study the power function rating curve was developed fig 5 1 q s 20 176 q 1 5113 where qs is sediment load ton day q is streamflow m3 s and the value of r squared between streamflow and suspended sediment concentration was 0 74 as presented in fig 5 2 5 calibration validation and performance evaluation swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup version 5 1 6 and sufi 2 sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm integrated into swat cup were used to produce the sensitivity parameters and to verify calibration validation and evaluation of the model gurara et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 the algorithm was used monthly time series data of streamflow and sediment yield at melka werer gauging station after selecting the most sensitive parameters of streamflow and sediment yield the calibration and validation procedures were performed the first three years of data 1990 1992 were used for the warm up period whereas 1993 2007 for the calibration and 2008 2015 for validation in this study an auto calibration process was applied in swat cup for both streamflow and sediment load the correlation between observed and simulated streamflow and sediment yield from the hydrological model is used to check the model performances the performances of streamflow and sediment yield were evaluated using the statistical and graphical recommendation boskidis et al 2012 gyamfi et al 2016 moriasi et al 2007 in this study nash sutclie efficiency coefficient nse the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr were used for model performance evaluation the values of r2 ranges between 0 to 1 and it is acceptable if these values are greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 nse is a statistical description for the relative magnitude of the residual variance associated with the observed streamflow and sediment data variance ayalew and bharti 2020 gyamfi et al 2016 welde and gebremariam 2017 the nse value is between negative infinity to one perfect if nse values are greater than 0 5 it is acceptable performance boskidis et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 the pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated streamflow and sediment yield data either they were smaller or larger compared to the observed data ayalew and bharti 2020 gyamfi et al 2016 jilo et al 2019 pbias could be 25 for streamflow and 55 for sediment data zhang et al 2019 the negative and positive values of pbias indicate model overestimation and underestimation respectively abbaspour 2012 rsr is the ratio of the root mean square error rmse and using the standard deviations of observation data for streamflow and sediment yield gyamfi et al 2016 moriasi et al 2007 the values of rsr are between its optimum value of 0 which indicates model perfect simulation to positive values abbaspour 2012 ayalew and bharti 2020 2 6 sediment management scenarios the development of sediment management scenarios was a very important technique for managing different farming activities upstream of the catchment practices nadew et al 2019 pongpetch et al 2015 tesema and leta 2020 swat model was used to simulate the implementation of sediment management practice indicate high sediment yield areas in the sub catchment and identify the most appropriate methods of managing sediment load abdelwahab et al 2014 ayele gebremariam 2020 betrie et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 choto fetene 2019 tesema leta 2020 the best management practice bmps was applied by modifying swat parameters to reflect the effect practice on the simulated results within the tool bracmort et al 2006 baseline scenario terracing filter strip and grassed waterway were the selected scenarios to manage sediment load in the umarb these scenarios were applied across the catchment based on the comparison to the baseline scenario and the amount of sediment yield was estimated at the outlet of each sub basin the selected appropriate scenarios were used in similar numerous findings involving catchments in ethiopia ayele gebremariam 2020 betrie et al 2011 choto fetene 2019 demissie et al 2013 nadew et al 2019 tesema leta 2020 firstly the baseline scenario was evaluated to examine the existing conditions of the catchment without any implementation of bmps then the bmps were applied to evaluate the changes in sediment yield the implementation of filter strip scenario on soil erosion process of the catchment has the effect of filtering and trapping the streamflow and sediment yield in a given plot of land respectively bracmort et al 2006 the width of the filter strip filterw is the appropriate swat model parameter that affects filter strip scenarios the application of terraces was implemented to reduce overland flow sheet erosion and reduce slope length bracmort et al 2006 the scs curve number average slope length slsubbsn and universal soil los equation support practice factor usle p were the most appropriate parameters in swat model that affect terraces conservation scenario grassed waterways are defined as a channel of water having a grass that is too reduced surface runoff and sediment yields blanco and lal 2008 this management scenario was modeled in swat by modifying model parameters in the scheduled management option mgt op 7 gathagu et al 2018 these adjusted parameters were length gwat l average slope gwat s depth gwat d average width gwat w manning s roughness coefficient gwat n and linear factor for the channel sediment routing gwat spcon the effect of all bmps was compared to the baseline period 1990 2015 finally by the combination of all conservation scenarios the most appropriate techniques to mitigate sediment yield for the specific areas were identified 2 7 simulating the combination of three sediment management scenarios the combinations of the three best sediment management scenarios filter strips terraces and grassed waterways were used to estimate the effects on sediment yield simulation the combination of filter strips terraces and grassed waterways was achieved after adjusting the value of filterw scs curve number slsubbsn usle p gwat l gwat s gwat d gwat w gwat n and gwat spcon in swat model the integration results of these three management scenarios were compared to those achieved when one technique of soil and water conservation was used in this study the individual results of sediment management scenarios were compared to the combination of the three best management scenarios the effectiveness of sediment yield management in three methods was estimated in equation 2 2 e y 1 y 2 y 1 100 where e is the effectiveness of the sediment management practice y1 and y2 are swat model simulations before and after implementation of the conservation method respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 parameters sensitivity the results of the most global sensitive parameters of streamflow and sediment yield are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively eleven and five of the most sensitive parameters were selected for streamflow and sediment load respectively during calibration and validation of the model the selected sensitive parameters were based on high correlation with streamflow and sediment yield simulations and the recommendation of different literature in the awash river basin daba and you 2020 jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 tessema et al 2020 the most sensitive parameters of streamflow namely cn2 alpha bf gw delay spexp and spcon were also the most sensitive parameters of sediment yield tables 1 and 2 the sensitive parameters of this study were in line with other studies conducted in the awash river basin jilo et al 2019 tesema and leta 2020 3 2 calibration and validation as shown in fig 6 a and b the simulated values of both streamflow and sediment yield were in a good relationship to the observed values the statistical values of r2 were 0 8 and 0 71 for calibration and validation respectively table 3 the values of nse pbias and rsp were found to be 0 69 8 08 and 0 56 respectively in the calibration period similarly table 3 presented the statical value of parameters during the validation period the mean annual streamflow in calibration and validation periods were 67 80 and 73 30 m3 s respectively this indicated that the observed and simulated streamflow have a strong relationship and the model was able to simulate streamflow data in the umarb the results of calibration and validation obtained from the analysis of sediment yield are also set out in table 3 as displayed in fig 6b the simulated sediment data is greater than the observed values it indicated that the model overestimated the sediment yield and the values of pbias were 32 57 and 22 88 in the calibration and validation period respectively this could be due to the scarcity of sediment data quality and constraint of meteorological and hydrological data and uneven distribution of gauging stations ayana et al 2012 as shown in table 3 the values of r2 and nse were greater than 0 5 in calibration and validation and rsr values were also less than 0 6 in both periods as shown in calibration and validation output in both streamflow and sediment parameters the values of r2 and nse 0 6 indicate a good correlation between observed and simulated values boskidis et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 the rsr 0 6 value shows good performance evaluation between observed and model data except for the streamflow validation period moriasi et al 2007 in calibration and validation of streamflow the pbias is 15 and it indicated a very good agreement between observed and simulated flow data moriasi et al 2007 for sediment yield 30 pbias 55 was under satisfactory correlations moriasi et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 the calibration and validation results of this study were similar to the previous finding in the middle and lower awash river basin jilo et al 2019 tesema and leta 2020 therefore in the umarb swat hydrological model was able to predict the streamflow and sediment yield for the entire period 3 3 spatial sediment yield mapping over the catchment simulation of the spatial distribution of sediment yield is useful for catchment management planning betrie et al 2011 after calibration and validation of the swat model the result of the spatial distribution mapping of sediment yield over the study area was presented in fig 7 the quantified sediment yield was varying from 0 01 to 68 78 ton ha yr with an average value of 21 43 ton ha yr in the baseline scenario this outcome is similar to those earlier findings in awash river basin jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 in hambole watershed upper awash river basin the mean annual sediment yield is 21 5 ton ha yr chekol et al 2007 bishaw kedir 2015 found the mean annual sediment yields of 658 120 ton yr in awash river at merti bridge gauging station in this study the highest values of sediment yields were recorded in sub basins 3 7 1 19 and 16 with sediment yield values of 68 78 47 12 43 01 40 27 and 38 93 ton ha yr respectively fig 7 the lowest sediment yield values were simulated in sub basins 2 4 10 8 and 5 with sediment values of 0 01 0 24 0 91 3 72 and 5 23 ton ha yr respectively over the umarb fig 7 according to the classification of tadesse et al 2017 in baseline scenarios 4 sub basins were showed very low sediment yield 0 5 ton ha yr 5 sub basins were presented low sediment yield 6 10 ton ha yr 7 sub basins were indicated moderate sediment yields 11 25 ton ha yr 8 sub basins were displayed high sediment yield 26 50 ton ha yr and one sub basin was showed very high sediment yield in the study area fig 7 the areas of high sediment yield are located in the cropland agricultural shrub brushland and bare land with a steep slope this shows that the spatial variation in the amount of sediment yield could be attributed to the type of land use soil and slope classes in the present study sub basin 3 has a mostly steep slope greater than 30 and is characterized by woodland and cropland as indicated in land use land cover map fig 4a besides lithic leptosols is the dominant soil type that covers sub basin 3 which is characterized as coarse soil type extremely gravelly and stony and easily exposed to soil erosion due to poor fertility and inability to hold water the authors concluded that all the three effects such as steep slope soil type and land cover exposed the sub basin 3 to the intense soil erosion from the study area on the other hand sub basins 2 4 and 10 have a dominant slope class of 0 5 and shrub grass and woodland are the dominant land cover and eutric fluvisols vertic cambisols and eutric cambisols were the most dominant soils in these sub basins fig 4a in these sub basins the amount of sediment yield is minimum the study in kesem dam watershed in awash river basin indicated that shrubland agricultural forest bare land and pasture land covers were contributing a high amount of sediment yield in sub basins and slope had an influence of highest sediment yield in the sub basins tesema and leta 2020 gathagu et al 2018 stated that agricultural and bare land areas are spotted to have the maximum sediment yield in the thika chania catchment kenya therefore the spatial variability of sediment yield in the catchment and sub basin is very important to the application of best management practices of soil erosion in the umarb 3 4 estimation of best management practice bmp on sediment yield the bmp was identified by changing swat parameter values the modification of model parameters was depending on the previous finding in the basin chekol et al 2007 tesema and leta 2020 and the results of sediment yield calibration in the study area arabi et al 2008 finally a comparison of bmp and a combination of all bmps were implemented to endorse the best management practice in the area 3 4 1 impact of filter strip on sediment yield the results obtained from the 5 m width of the filter strip are presented in fig 8 a after the filter strip of 5 m width simulations the mean annual sediment yield of the umarb is 14 64 ton ha yr and it varies between 0 and 60 81 ton ha yr in this scenario the average annual sediment reduction in the catchment is 31 68 in comparison to the baseline the implementation of a 10 m filter strip will result in the reduction of sediment yield by 46 6 from the baseline condition and the mean annual sediment yield is 11 45 ton ha yr the outcomes of this finding showed that the efficiency of plummeting sediment yield from this study was increasing with the increase of the filter strip width after implementation of 5 m filter strip conservation the amount of sediment yield was classified as very low 10 sub basins low 2 sub basins moderate 4 sub basins high 4 sub basins and very high one sub basin sediment yield zones fig 8a these results indicated the values of sediment yield in each sub basin were reduced relative to the baseline scenario a similar finding has been observed in the kesem dam watershed tesema and leta 2020 they found that the 5m and 10m filter strips lead to sediment yield reduction by 59 16 and 72 67 respectively the results of this study are in line with the previous finding in ethiopia e g ayele gebremariam 2020 andualem gebremariam 2015 betrie et al 2011 choto fetene 2019 the study in bilate watershed rift valley lake basin ethiopia found that the implementation of 10m filter strips will reduce the average annual sediment yield by 38 41 ayele gebremariam 2020 3 4 2 impact of grassed waterways on sediment yield fig 8 b displays the simulation result of grassed waterways that reduced the mean annual sediment yield by 16 84 from the baseline simulation of 21 43 ton ha yr after simulation of grassed waterway in the catchment the sediment yield values are varying between 0 to 66 70 ton ha yr with an average value of 17 82 ton ha yr in this management scenario 8 2 9 5 1 sub basins were categorized to very low low moderate high and very high sediment yield respectively fig 8b the amount of sediment yield in each sub basin was changed relative to the baseline condition the implementation of grassed waterways is reducing the values of sediment in surface runoff by generating channel roughness that depots soil particles in the catchment gathagu et al 2018 this conservation scenario is reducing channel erosion and increasing sediment deposition because it is installed within the channel network mwangi et al 2015 the results coincide with tesema leta 2020 finding in the kesem dam watershed the application of grass waterways reduced sediment yield by 57 34 in another study in bilate watershed rift valley lake basin in ethiopia 54 45 of the mean annual sediment yield was reduced after the grassed waterway was implemented ayele gebremariam 2020 finding in sasumua water kenya indicates that the implementation of the grassed waterway can reduce the amount of sediment yield by 54 at the outlet of the watershed mwangi et al 2015 the application of grassed waterways reduced sediment yield in the upper maquoketa watershed by 45 9 gassman et al 2007 therefore the implementation of grass waterways indicated that the efficiency would be enhanced hereafter the mean annual sediment yield would decrease in the umarb 3 4 3 impact of terraces on sediment yield fig 8 c depicts the amount of sediment yield classification after the implementation of terracing in the umarb the amount of sediment yield provided by the different values varied between 0 01 and 64 29 ton ha yr with an average rate of about 17 24 ton ha yr the simulation of terracing in reduction of sediment yield is 19 56 from the baseline scenario after implementation of terracing 8 2 9 5 and 1 sub basins were showed very low 0 5 ton ha yr low 6 10 ton ha yr moderate 11 25 ton ha yr high 26 50 ton ha yr and very high sediment yield respectively in this conservation the numbers of sub basins classes were similar to grassed waterways scenario however the values of sediment yield in each sub basin were different in both management scenarios the amount of sediment yield was reduced in all sub basins in comparison to the baseline scenario the maximum sediment yield reduction was obtained in the area covered by crops and bare land having a steep slope the application of terraces would have the highest benefit in terms of reducing sediment yield from plateaus where cropland is the dominant land use land cover in the areas gathagu et al 2018 the results show that the application of terraces was able to reduce the amount of sediment yield than grasses waterways the outcomes of this study were agreed with the previous finding in the kessem dam watershed tesema and leta 2020 they concluded that grassed waterways implemented in the kesem dam watershed reduce the amount of sediment yield by 57 34 while terracing reduces by 63 25 from the baseline the study in gojeb watershed omo gibe basin find the reduction of sediment yield by 29 4 when terraces bund was implemented choto and fetene 2019 schmidt zemadim 2015 indicated the implementation of terraces on a steep slope could reduce the high amount of sediment yield in the blue nile basin 3 5 combination of filter strip grassed waterways and terraces during the combination of filter strip 5 m width grassed waterway and terraces together the amount of sediment yield in the umarb reduced by 50 88 from the mean annual sediment yield of 21 43 ton ha yr the mean annual sediment yield after using each management scenario and their combination is presented in fig 8 d according to the classification of tadesse et al 2017 after the implementation of the combination of three best management practices 12 sub basins 2 sub basins 7 sub basins four sub basins and nil sub basin were showed very low low moderate high and very high sediment yield in the catchment fig 8d the simulation of these three scenarios depicts an increment of 31 32 compared to the implementation of terracing in sediment yield reduction the grassed waterways would reduce sediment yield by 16 84 in the study however when it combined with terracing and a 5 m filter strip an additional 34 04 of sediment yield was reduced and a 5 m filter strip combined with terracing and grassed waterways was reduced sediment yield by 50 88 in the catchment but individually 5 m filter strip was reduced the amount of sediment yield by 19 2 while a 10 m filter strip combination with terracing and grassed waterway results in the reduction of sediment yield by 55 7 and the average annual sediment yield was 9 49 ton ha yr the combination of three sediment management practices was indicated an increase in sediment yield reduction in the umarb however the percentage of increasing reduction was not uniform in all bmps based on these results grassed waterways conservation practice was the least impact on sediment yield compared with others the impact of terraces on sediment yield was greater than the impact of grassed waterways but less than the influence of 5 and 10 m filter strip scenarios moreover increasing the width of the filter strip and integrating it with terracing and grassed waterways can reduce the amount of sediment yield in the catchment more it indicated that the increase of filter strip width was directly related to the reduction of sediment yield this result was similar to mwangi 2011 the combination of 5 m filter strip with counter farming leads to the reduction of sediment yield by 73 from the baseline value ouattara et al 2017 reported that the combination of soil and water conservation techniques of water and sediment yield is effective in burkina faso comparison of three scenarios independently the filter strip showed the maximum reduction of sediment yield in areas it was relatively the most appropriate soil conservation technique for the reduction of sediment yield in all sub basins and catchments in this study fig 9 the implementation of filter strips on cropland and bare land can potentially make mitigation and limitation of sediment yield which is consistent with the earlier finding in kesem dam watershed tesema and leta 2020 therefore the results of this finding would deliver an important mark for the most effective bmps within the catchment or in the awash river basin 3 6 limitations and needful action in the future the key limitation and challenge of the swat hydrological model is a non spatial representation of hrus that affecte the model simulation accuracy it is difficult to determine the spatial locations and describe the interactions between different hrus in each sub basin guo et al 2019 land use land cover soil types and slope heterogeneity of the model are accounted for through each sub basin this approach ignores streamflow and pollutants routing between hrus in the catchment in addition swat is the time intensive model development and challenging streamflow calibration and it was found to be inflexible to the delineation of the catchment and the river network which could not be adjusted apart from choosing another threshold drainage area of the basin cambien et al 2020 overall the model limitations included the simulation of snowmelt evapotranspiration snowmelt erosion floodplain erosion sediment transport routines empirical model formulas and the model does not simulate non field sources of sediment such as erosion of streambanks gorges and or bluffs the effectiveness of filter strip terrace and grasses waterway were depending upon the percentage of land available and local topographical conditions in the basin betrie et al 2011 the accuracy of land use was different to simulate the installation of these management scenarios in the catchment briaket al 2019 the accurate interpretation of the quantitative results may not be appropriate because some physical processes are not well represented in the swat model e g deterioration of the bmps flow concentrations in filter strip and lack of model parameterization at a local scale hence as more data is collected from the catchment the model can be further calibrated to provide more accurate results despite the limitation of the swat model it is important to verify in the future the modeled results by alternative methods and approaches the model outputs may be compared to experimental field and laboratory data when possible this approach is increasing the accuracy of the model outputs meaningful the model results and showed a good performance evaluation of the model parameters to verify the results model simulations and alternative management scenarios are most helpful when coupled with stakeholder input and expert judgment by relying on expert knowledge from local landowners and local and state agency representatives more meaningful management scenarios can be developed that will be in a better position to provide useful information and guide water quality improvement practices moreover change in land use and land cover which could influence the results could be considered in future studies 4 conclusions the study was designed for simulation of sediment yield and impacts of the three best management scenarios in the umarb arcswat 2012 model was used to simulate streamflow and sediment yield the global sensitive analysis parameters for the streamflow and sediment yield were undertaken by using sufi 2 algorism in the swat cup program in calibration period the results of r2 nse pbias and rsp are 0 8 0 69 8 08 and 0 56 respectively for streamflow and 0 72 0 65 32 56 and 0 59 respectively for sediment yield the results of r2 nse pbias and rsp showed a good fitting between observed and simulated streamflow and sediment yield in the calibration and validation period in the baseline scenario the simulated values of sediment yield vary from 0 01 to 68 78 ton ha yr with an average value of 21 43 ton ha yr the highest and lowest value of sediment yield was obtained in sub basins 3 and 2 respectively the sub basin which recorded the highest value of sediment yield indicate the great impact of sediment management scenarios filter strips 5 and 10 m were the most effective method of reducing sediment yield when compared with the terraces and grassed waterways the implementation of 5 m and 10 m filter strips indicated sediment reduction by 31 68 and 46 6 respectively this showed sediment yield reduction is related to an increase in filter strip widths the implemented impact of the grassed waterways and terraces were reduced sediment yields by 16 64 and 19 56 respectively from the base scenario the combination of 5 m filter strip terraces and grassed waterways soil conservation methods was reduced sediment yield by more than half 50 88 in the comparison of three scenarios filter strip was found to provide the highest reduction of sediment yield in each sub basin however the combination of three sediment management practices was significantly more efficient in the reduction of sediment yield therefore the integrated implementation of soil water conservation practice is more feasible for the reduction of sediment yield in umarb overall the results of this study deliver important information for the reduction of sediment yield and implementation of sustainable watershed management of the catchment and help the stakeholders to select the best suitable management practice however further studies will be recommended to evaluate

959,sediment transport is a complex hydrological phenomenon that influences water resources ecosystems soil and water quality the evaluation of sediment yield and mitigation practices are the mechanism to enhance the water resource potential the study was aimed at simulating the sediment yield and the impact of three best management scenarios in the upper and middle awash river basin umarb the soil and water assessment tool arcswat 2012 was used to simulate and identify high sediment yield prone areas in the catchment by the implementation of three management practices such as filter strips terraces and grassed waterways the model results indicated a good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow and sediment yield in the baseline scenario the mean annual sediment yield was 21 43 ton ha yr the implementation of 5 and 10 m filter strips reduced the mean annual sediment yield by 31 68 and 46 6 respectively terraces and grassed waterways were showed a reduction of sediment yield by 19 56 and 16 64 respectively filter strips were found to provide the highest reduction of sediment yield in each sub basin and the outlet of the catchment besides the combination of the three management scenarios has reduced the values of sediment yield by 50 88 from the baseline and the mean annual sediment yield becomes 10 53 ton ha yr in these results the efficiency of soil conservation practices would increase by applying more than two sediment management scenarios in the study area the study delivered important information for the reduction of sediment yield and implementation of sustainable watershed management in the umarb keywords sediment yield filter strips terraces grassed waterway management scenarios soil conservation 1 introduction simulation of sediment yield and its management scenarios is a device to estimate and mitigate sediment influx and outflux in the catchment explicitly to assess how much sediment load is generated from certain soil and land cover types sediment transport is a complex hydrological phenomenon and the variables involved in soil erosion modeling make a challenging to measure kumar et al 2015 soil erosion and sediment yield have a significant impact on water and natural resources water quality sustainability of agricultural development and loss of water storage in the reservoir abebe and gebremariam 2019 gathagu et al 2018 malunjkar et al 2015 mishra et al 2007 tadesse et al 2017 xu et al 2009 recently evaluating the impact of sediment yield and implementing soil and water conservation measures to manage sediment yield from different slopes and land used cover areas are crucial issues of the world gathagu et al 2018 the simulation of sediment yield is the primary on site of soil degradation

et al 2012 ayele et al 2017 molla et al 2020 tadesse et al 2017 tesema and leta 2020 welde and gebremariam 2017 yesuf et al 2015 these studies reported that the north eastern central western and northeastern highlands of ethiopia have been influenced by soil erosion and land degradation besides the negative impact of soil erosion and land degradation influences water resource potential that could lead to an increase in drought events in the country ayele gebremariam 2020 quantified the high spatial and temporal variability of sedimentation in bilate watershed in rift valley lake basin ethiopia the spatial and temporal variability of sediment yield accounted to land use land cover soil and topographical features of the watershed besides among four conservation measures used i e grassed waterway filter strips terracing and contouring for reduction of sediment yield terracing 63 26 was found as the most suitable method in bilate watershed the studies conducted in upper blue nile river basin in ethiopia reported that the basin is one of the sensitive areas of sediment transport and land degradations where soil erosion and sediment yields vary spatially and temporally ayele et al 2017 betrie et al 2011 easton et al 2010 yesuf et al 2015 choto fetene 2019 simulated streamflow and sediment yield in gojeb watershed in the omo gibe basin based on the variability of land use land cover among three conservation measures i e filter strip terrace bund and reforestation practiced in the study area the reforestation scenario was recommended as the most appropriate technique of controlling sediment yield in the watershed conventionally awash river basin is the backbone of the ethiopian economy in the basin sugar factors and irrigation projects wonji shoa sugar factor metahara sugar factor upper awash agro industry fentale and tibila irrigation project water resource infrastructures koka and tendaho dam and other small and medium projects play a vital role in the economy of the country are found for the best utility of these infrastructures practicing soil and water conservation as well as finding the hotspot area of sediment yield soil erosion and sediment transportation is paramount tesema and leta 2020 several studies were addressed the soil erosion and sediment transportation of different watersheds in the awash river basin abebe and gebremariam 2019 bishaw and kedir 2015 jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 zeberie 2020 hence most of the studies were limited to a certain watershed with a small landscape in this paper umarb covers more than 28 000 km2 which is 23 4 of the basin landscape were covered besides in the downstream of the study area the amount of flood and sediment transportation are high and have more impact on tendaho sugar factory and tendaho dam dubti and assayita town jilo et al 2019 tilahun et al 2017 therefore simulation and mitigation of sediment load in the umarb are very important for land and water management in the catchment as well as for the downstream section moreover the earlier studies in awash river basin have highlighted the application of sediment management practice tesema and leta 2020 zeberie 2020 but before implementation the efficiency of each management practice needs to be established as the efficacy of any conservation practice varies in the area due to land uses slope and climatic conditions therefore the study is aimed to i simulate sediment yield in the umarb and ii evaluate the impact of three management scenarios and their combination on sediment yield reduction in umarb by using the arcswat2012 hydrological model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area umarb is located in the awash river basin ethiopia and geographically situated between 7 59 n and 9 25 n and 38 19 e and 40 36 e with areal coverage of 28 078 41 km2 fig 1 the elevation of the catchment varies from 4185 m at upstream of the catchment to 704 m at the outlet point above mean sea level fig 1 based on the topographical level and intertropical climate zone of the basin the precipitation distribution of the catchment varies in seasons and designates to three seasonal time series fig 2 the peak rainy season happened during kiremt heavy rainy season whereas the bega is the dry season out of the mean annual precipitation which is 905 mm about 58 occurred during the kiremt season the streamflow is significantly determined by the bimodal pattern of precipitation distribution in the catchment fig 2 the mean annual min max air temperature of the catchment is 20 1 c and 29 5 c respectively during the time series of 1990 2015 according to fao wrb 2006 classification eutric vertisols and lithic leptosols are the most dominant soil groups in the catchment fig 3 b cropland rainfed and irrigated agricultural land is the dominant land use land cover fig 3a the main crops of the umarb are wheat maize teff barley beans groundnut fruits and vegetables mainly tomatoes sugar cane is the dominant crop product in metahara and wonji shoa sugar factories daba and you 2020 in this study irrigated fields swamps addis ababa city and other small settlements are obtained although this study is located on the floor of the ethiopian rift valley hot springs and volcanic phenomena are commonly obvious chekol mnalku 2012 2 2 data the daily meteorological data i e precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity sunshine and wind speed of 14 meteorological stations fig 1 and hydrological data were obtained from the national meteorological agency of ethiopia and the ministry of water irrigation and electricity respectively for the periods of 1990 to 2015 the selection of meteorological stations was based on the availability of long term data the minimum percentage of missing data and their inscription in the catchment the daily hydrological streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations data were recorded at the melka werer gauging station the digital elevation model dem 30 by 30 resolution was obtained from the asterbgdem website http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp the dem was used to delineate catchment and analysis drainage patterns soil and land use land cover data of the umarb were obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity in ethiopia mowie 2 3 data quality analysis before inputting meteorological data into the swat model analyzing its quality is a vital step among meteorological data quality decreasing factors missing data is common due to lack of appropriate records and shifting of the station location this could lead to incorrect and ambiguous results that may contradict the actual situation consequently the daily precipitation data were filled by the arithmetic mean method subramanya 2008 besides the time series of observed precipitation data was checked to the relatively consistent and homogeneous according to mccuen 1998 the obtained data is said to be homogenous if the measurements have been consistently done by the same method with the same instrumentation at the same time and place and in the same environment as presented in figure 3 a umarb has no distinct climatic and similar precipitation pattern the maximum precipitation was recorded during the heavy rainy season june september and the small rainy season february may figure 3 b shows the relatively consistent precipitation data which was determined using double mass curve techniques this technique is commonly used to analyze and check the consistency and adjustment of precipitation data choto and fetene 2019 2 4 soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model arcswat2012 hydrological model is a physically based and spatially semi distributed hydrological model designed to route water sediments and contaminants from individual drainage unit throughout a river basin towards its outlet the model predicts the impact of land management practices of water and sediment in the catchment with changing management conditions in soils and land cover over long periods arnold et al 2012 swat joined with geographical information system gis interface to process the datasets and construct the required input for the initial modeling setup fentaw et al 2018 the model was verified by using observed streamflow and sediment data of the umarb the model was selected because it is widely applied in the simulation of sediment yield and its management scenarios in different basins and catchments in the world particularly in the awash river basin al khafaji al chalabi 2019 ayele gebremariam 2020 betrie et al 2011 briak et al 2019 choto fetene 2019 gathagu et al 2018 tesema leta 2020 2 4 1 swat model input spatial data such as soil map and land use land cover data are the most important parameters of swat model input the spatial distribution of soil types and land use land cover in the umarb were displayed in fig 4 a and b in addition to soil and land use the swat requires dem to derive slope classes indicated in fig 4 c to create hydrological response units hrus the spatial data of soil land uses and slopes were used to increase the number of hrus and to provide a good understanding of the physical description of streamflow and sediment routing ayalew and bharti 2020 an increasing number of hrus was defined by eliminating the percentages of land use soil and slope values that covered a percentage of the catchment area less than the threshold level jilo et al 2019 the umarb was delineated into 25 sub basins and 573 hrus fig 4 d the threshold values of land use soil slope combination defined in hrus were 10 10 and 15 respectively to produce each hrus response unit and to obtain a good illustration of sediment load in the catchment ayalew and bharti 2020 the thresholds confirm a unique combination of land use soils and slopes in the ultimate determination of hrus by simplifying catchment processes the meteorological data required to setup the swat model are daily precipitation max min temperatures solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity the strength of swat model is to generate weather climate data from the stations which had full all climate data therefore in this study abomsa addis ababa metehara and shola gebeya weather stations were written into the wgen user file in swat database which was used to create a user defined weather generator yuan and forshay 2020 in addition the observed streamflow and sediment yield data were also collected to verify the performance of the swat model ayalew and bharti 2020 choto and fetene 2019 jilo et al 2019 tesema and leta 2020 in awash river basin there is a lack of continuous time series of observed sediment data bishaw and kedir 2015 jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 therefore to solve the limitation a sediment rating curve was established from the relationship between daily average streamflow and suspended sediment concentration data equation 1 the sediment rating curve is a widely applicable technique that is used to generate sediment yield in the region of limited observed data asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 in this study the power function rating curve was developed fig 5 1 q s 20 176 q 1 5113 where qs is sediment load ton day q is streamflow m3 s and the value of r squared between streamflow and suspended sediment concentration was 0 74 as presented in fig 5 2 5 calibration validation and performance evaluation swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup version 5 1 6 and sufi 2 sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm integrated into swat cup were used to produce the sensitivity parameters and to verify calibration validation and evaluation of the model gurara et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 the algorithm was used monthly time series data of streamflow and sediment yield at melka werer gauging station after selecting the most sensitive parameters of streamflow and sediment yield the calibration and validation procedures were performed the first three years of data 1990 1992 were used for the warm up period whereas 1993 2007 for the calibration and 2008 2015 for validation in this study an auto calibration process was applied in swat cup for both streamflow and sediment load the correlation between observed and simulated streamflow and sediment yield from the hydrological model is used to check the model performances the performances of streamflow and sediment yield were evaluated using the statistical and graphical recommendation boskidis et al 2012 gyamfi et al 2016 moriasi et al 2007 in this study nash sutclie efficiency coefficient nse the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr were used for model performance evaluation the values of r2 ranges between 0 to 1 and it is acceptable if these values are greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 nse is a statistical description for the relative magnitude of the residual variance associated with the observed streamflow and sediment data variance ayalew and bharti 2020 gyamfi et al 2016 welde and gebremariam 2017 the nse value is between negative infinity to one perfect if nse values are greater than 0 5 it is acceptable performance boskidis et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 the pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated streamflow and sediment yield data either they were smaller or larger compared to the observed data ayalew and bharti 2020 gyamfi et al 2016 jilo et al 2019 pbias could be 25 for streamflow and 55 for sediment data zhang et al 2019 the negative and positive values of pbias indicate model overestimation and underestimation respectively abbaspour 2012 rsr is the ratio of the root mean square error rmse and using the standard deviations of observation data for streamflow and sediment yield gyamfi et al 2016 moriasi et al 2007 the values of rsr are between its optimum value of 0 which indicates model perfect simulation to positive values abbaspour 2012 ayalew and bharti 2020 2 6 sediment management scenarios the development of sediment management scenarios was a very important technique for managing different farming activities upstream of the catchment practices nadew et al 2019 pongpetch et al 2015 tesema and leta 2020 swat model was used to simulate the implementation of sediment management practice indicate high sediment yield areas in the sub catchment and identify the most appropriate methods of managing sediment load abdelwahab et al 2014 ayele gebremariam 2020 betrie et al 2011 bosch et al 2013 choto fetene 2019 tesema leta 2020 the best management practice bmps was applied by modifying swat parameters to reflect the effect practice on the simulated results within the tool bracmort et al 2006 baseline scenario terracing filter strip and grassed waterway were the selected scenarios to manage sediment load in the umarb these scenarios were applied across the catchment based on the comparison to the baseline scenario and the amount of sediment yield was estimated at the outlet of each sub basin the selected appropriate scenarios were used in similar numerous findings involving catchments in ethiopia ayele gebremariam 2020 betrie et al 2011 choto fetene 2019 demissie et al 2013 nadew et al 2019 tesema leta 2020 firstly the baseline scenario was evaluated to examine the existing conditions of the catchment without any implementation of bmps then the bmps were applied to evaluate the changes in sediment yield the implementation of filter strip scenario on soil erosion process of the catchment has the effect of filtering and trapping the streamflow and sediment yield in a given plot of land respectively bracmort et al 2006 the width of the filter strip filterw is the appropriate swat model parameter that affects filter strip scenarios the application of terraces was implemented to reduce overland flow sheet erosion and reduce slope length bracmort et al 2006 the scs curve number average slope length slsubbsn and universal soil los equation support practice factor usle p were the most appropriate parameters in swat model that affect terraces conservation scenario grassed waterways are defined as a channel of water having a grass that is too reduced surface runoff and sediment yields blanco and lal 2008 this management scenario was modeled in swat by modifying model parameters in the scheduled management option mgt op 7 gathagu et al 2018 these adjusted parameters were length gwat l average slope gwat s depth gwat d average width gwat w manning s roughness coefficient gwat n and linear factor for the channel sediment routing gwat spcon the effect of all bmps was compared to the baseline period 1990 2015 finally by the combination of all conservation scenarios the most appropriate techniques to mitigate sediment yield for the specific areas were identified 2 7 simulating the combination of three sediment management scenarios the combinations of the three best sediment management scenarios filter strips terraces and grassed waterways were used to estimate the effects on sediment yield simulation the combination of filter strips terraces and grassed waterways was achieved after adjusting the value of filterw scs curve number slsubbsn usle p gwat l gwat s gwat d gwat w gwat n and gwat spcon in swat model the integration results of these three management scenarios were compared to those achieved when one technique of soil and water conservation was used in this study the individual results of sediment management scenarios were compared to the combination of the three best management scenarios the effectiveness of sediment yield management in three methods was estimated in equation 2 2 e y 1 y 2 y 1 100 where e is the effectiveness of the sediment management practice y1 and y2 are swat model simulations before and after implementation of the conservation method respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 parameters sensitivity the results of the most global sensitive parameters of streamflow and sediment yield are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively eleven and five of the most sensitive parameters were selected for streamflow and sediment load respectively during calibration and validation of the model the selected sensitive parameters were based on high correlation with streamflow and sediment yield simulations and the recommendation of different literature in the awash river basin daba and you 2020 jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 tessema et al 2020 the most sensitive parameters of streamflow namely cn2 alpha bf gw delay spexp and spcon were also the most sensitive parameters of sediment yield tables 1 and 2 the sensitive parameters of this study were in line with other studies conducted in the awash river basin jilo et al 2019 tesema and leta 2020 3 2 calibration and validation as shown in fig 6 a and b the simulated values of both streamflow and sediment yield were in a good relationship to the observed values the statistical values of r2 were 0 8 and 0 71 for calibration and validation respectively table 3 the values of nse pbias and rsp were found to be 0 69 8 08 and 0 56 respectively in the calibration period similarly table 3 presented the statical value of parameters during the validation period the mean annual streamflow in calibration and validation periods were 67 80 and 73 30 m3 s respectively this indicated that the observed and simulated streamflow have a strong relationship and the model was able to simulate streamflow data in the umarb the results of calibration and validation obtained from the analysis of sediment yield are also set out in table 3 as displayed in fig 6b the simulated sediment data is greater than the observed values it indicated that the model overestimated the sediment yield and the values of pbias were 32 57 and 22 88 in the calibration and validation period respectively this could be due to the scarcity of sediment data quality and constraint of meteorological and hydrological data and uneven distribution of gauging stations ayana et al 2012 as shown in table 3 the values of r2 and nse were greater than 0 5 in calibration and validation and rsr values were also less than 0 6 in both periods as shown in calibration and validation output in both streamflow and sediment parameters the values of r2 and nse 0 6 indicate a good correlation between observed and simulated values boskidis et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 the rsr 0 6 value shows good performance evaluation between observed and model data except for the streamflow validation period moriasi et al 2007 in calibration and validation of streamflow the pbias is 15 and it indicated a very good agreement between observed and simulated flow data moriasi et al 2007 for sediment yield 30 pbias 55 was under satisfactory correlations moriasi et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 the calibration and validation results of this study were similar to the previous finding in the middle and lower awash river basin jilo et al 2019 tesema and leta 2020 therefore in the umarb swat hydrological model was able to predict the streamflow and sediment yield for the entire period 3 3 spatial sediment yield mapping over the catchment simulation of the spatial distribution of sediment yield is useful for catchment management planning betrie et al 2011 after calibration and validation of the swat model the result of the spatial distribution mapping of sediment yield over the study area was presented in fig 7 the quantified sediment yield was varying from 0 01 to 68 78 ton ha yr with an average value of 21 43 ton ha yr in the baseline scenario this outcome is similar to those earlier findings in awash river basin jilo et al 2019 molla et al 2020 tesema and leta 2020 in hambole watershed upper awash river basin the mean annual sediment yield is 21 5 ton ha yr chekol et al 2007 bishaw kedir 2015 found the mean annual sediment yields of 658 120 ton yr in awash river at merti bridge gauging station in this study the highest values of sediment yields were recorded in sub basins 3 7 1 19 and 16 with sediment yield values of 68 78 47 12 43 01 40 27 and 38 93 ton ha yr respectively fig 7 the lowest sediment yield values were simulated in sub basins 2 4 10 8 and 5 with sediment values of 0 01 0 24 0 91 3 72 and 5 23 ton ha yr respectively over the umarb fig 7 according to the classification of tadesse et al 2017 in baseline scenarios 4 sub basins were showed very low sediment yield 0 5 ton ha yr 5 sub basins were presented low sediment yield 6 10 ton ha yr 7 sub basins were indicated moderate sediment yields 11 25 ton ha yr 8 sub basins were displayed high sediment yield 26 50 ton ha yr and one sub basin was showed very high sediment yield in the study area fig 7 the areas of high sediment yield are located in the cropland agricultural shrub brushland and bare land with a steep slope this shows that the spatial variation in the amount of sediment yield could be attributed to the type of land use soil and slope classes in the present study sub basin 3 has a mostly steep slope greater than 30 and is characterized by woodland and cropland as indicated in land use land cover map fig 4a besides lithic leptosols is the dominant soil type that covers sub basin 3 which is characterized as coarse soil type extremely gravelly and stony and easily exposed to soil erosion due to poor fertility and inability to hold water the authors concluded that all the three effects such as steep slope soil type and land cover exposed the sub basin 3 to the intense soil erosion from the study area on the other hand sub basins 2 4 and 10 have a dominant slope class of 0 5 and shrub grass and woodland are the dominant land cover and eutric fluvisols vertic cambisols and eutric cambisols were the most dominant soils in these sub basins fig 4a in these sub basins the amount of sediment yield is minimum the study in kesem dam watershed in awash river basin indicated that shrubland agricultural forest bare land and pasture land covers were contributing a high amount of sediment yield in sub basins and slope had an influence of highest sediment yield in the sub basins tesema and leta 2020 gathagu et al 2018 stated that agricultural and bare land areas are spotted to have the maximum sediment yield in the thika chania catchment kenya therefore the spatial variability of sediment yield in the catchment and sub basin is very important to the application of best management practices of soil erosion in the umarb 3 4 estimation of best management practice bmp on sediment yield the bmp was identified by changing swat parameter values the modification of model parameters was depending on the previous finding in the basin chekol et al 2007 tesema and leta 2020 and the results of sediment yield calibration in the study area arabi et al 2008 finally a comparison of bmp and a combination of all bmps were implemented to endorse the best management practice in the area 3 4 1 impact of filter strip on sediment yield the results obtained from the 5 m width of the filter strip are presented in fig 8 a after the filter strip of 5 m width simulations the mean annual sediment yield of the umarb is 14 64 ton ha yr and it varies between 0 and 60 81 ton ha yr in this scenario the average annual sediment reduction in the catchment is 31 68 in comparison to the baseline the implementation of a 10 m filter strip will result in the reduction of sediment yield by 46 6 from the baseline condition and the mean annual sediment yield is 11 45 ton ha yr the outcomes of this finding showed that the efficiency of plummeting sediment yield from this study was increasing with the increase of the filter strip width after implementation of 5 m filter strip conservation the amount of sediment yield was classified as very low 10 sub basins low 2 sub basins moderate 4 sub basins high 4 sub basins and very high one sub basin sediment yield zones fig 8a these results indicated the values of sediment yield in each sub basin were reduced relative to the baseline scenario a similar finding has been observed in the kesem dam watershed tesema and leta 2020 they found that the 5m and 10m filter strips lead to sediment yield reduction by 59 16 and 72 67 respectively the results of this study are in line with the previous finding in ethiopia e g ayele gebremariam 2020 andualem gebremariam 2015 betrie et al 2011 choto fetene 2019 the study in bilate watershed rift valley lake basin ethiopia found that the implementation of 10m filter strips will reduce the average annual sediment yield by 38 41 ayele gebremariam 2020 3 4 2 impact of grassed waterways on sediment yield fig 8 b displays the simulation result of grassed waterways that reduced the mean annual sediment yield by 16 84 from the baseline simulation of 21 43 ton ha yr after simulation of grassed waterway in the catchment the sediment yield values are varying between 0 to 66 70 ton ha yr with an average value of 17 82 ton ha yr in this management scenario 8 2 9 5 1 sub basins were categorized to very low low moderate high and very high sediment yield respectively fig 8b the amount of sediment yield in each sub basin was changed relative to the baseline condition the implementation of grassed waterways is reducing the values of sediment in surface runoff by generating channel roughness that depots soil particles in the catchment gathagu et al 2018 this conservation scenario is reducing channel erosion and increasing sediment deposition because it is installed within the channel network mwangi et al 2015 the results coincide with tesema leta 2020 finding in the kesem dam watershed the application of grass waterways reduced sediment yield by 57 34 in another study in bilate watershed rift valley lake basin in ethiopia 54 45 of the mean annual sediment yield was reduced after the grassed waterway was implemented ayele gebremariam 2020 finding in sasumua water kenya indicates that the implementation of the grassed waterway can reduce the amount of sediment yield by 54 at the outlet of the watershed mwangi et al 2015 the application of grassed waterways reduced sediment yield in the upper maquoketa watershed by 45 9 gassman et al 2007 therefore the implementation of grass waterways indicated that the efficiency would be enhanced hereafter the mean annual sediment yield would decrease in the umarb 3 4 3 impact of terraces on sediment yield fig 8 c depicts the amount of sediment yield classification after the implementation of terracing in the umarb the amount of sediment yield provided by the different values varied between 0 01 and 64 29 ton ha yr with an average rate of about 17 24 ton ha yr the simulation of terracing in reduction of sediment yield is 19 56 from the baseline scenario after implementation of terracing 8 2 9 5 and 1 sub basins were showed very low 0 5 ton ha yr low 6 10 ton ha yr moderate 11 25 ton ha yr high 26 50 ton ha yr and very high sediment yield respectively in this conservation the numbers of sub basins classes were similar to grassed waterways scenario however the values of sediment yield in each sub basin were different in both management scenarios the amount of sediment yield was reduced in all sub basins in comparison to the baseline scenario the maximum sediment yield reduction was obtained in the area covered by crops and bare land having a steep slope the application of terraces would have the highest benefit in terms of reducing sediment yield from plateaus where cropland is the dominant land use land cover in the areas gathagu et al 2018 the results show that the application of terraces was able to reduce the amount of sediment yield than grasses waterways the outcomes of this study were agreed with the previous finding in the kessem dam watershed tesema and leta 2020 they concluded that grassed waterways implemented in the kesem dam watershed reduce the amount of sediment yield by 57 34 while terracing reduces by 63 25 from the baseline the study in gojeb watershed omo gibe basin find the reduction of sediment yield by 29 4 when terraces bund was implemented choto and fetene 2019 schmidt zemadim 2015 indicated the implementation of terraces on a steep slope could reduce the high amount of sediment yield in the blue nile basin 3 5 combination of filter strip grassed waterways and terraces during the combination of filter strip 5 m width grassed waterway and terraces together the amount of sediment yield in the umarb reduced by 50 88 from the mean annual sediment yield of 21 43 ton ha yr the mean annual sediment yield after using each management scenario and their combination is presented in fig 8 d according to the classification of tadesse et al 2017 after the implementation of the combination of three best management practices 12 sub basins 2 sub basins 7 sub basins four sub basins and nil sub basin were showed very low low moderate high and very high sediment yield in the catchment fig 8d the simulation of these three scenarios depicts an increment of 31 32 compared to the implementation of terracing in sediment yield reduction the grassed waterways would reduce sediment yield by 16 84 in the study however when it combined with terracing and a 5 m filter strip an additional 34 04 of sediment yield was reduced and a 5 m filter strip combined with terracing and grassed waterways was reduced sediment yield by 50 88 in the catchment but individually 5 m filter strip was reduced the amount of sediment yield by 19 2 while a 10 m filter strip combination with terracing and grassed waterway results in the reduction of sediment yield by 55 7 and the average annual sediment yield was 9 49 ton ha yr the combination of three sediment management practices was indicated an increase in sediment yield reduction in the umarb however the percentage of increasing reduction was not uniform in all bmps based on these results grassed waterways conservation practice was the least impact on sediment yield compared with others the impact of terraces on sediment yield was greater than the impact of grassed waterways but less than the influence of 5 and 10 m filter strip scenarios moreover increasing the width of the filter strip and integrating it with terracing and grassed waterways can reduce the amount of sediment yield in the catchment more it indicated that the increase of filter strip width was directly related to the reduction of sediment yield this result was similar to mwangi 2011 the combination of 5 m filter strip with counter farming leads to the reduction of sediment yield by 73 from the baseline value ouattara et al 2017 reported that the combination of soil and water conservation techniques of water and sediment yield is effective in burkina faso comparison of three scenarios independently the filter strip showed the maximum reduction of sediment yield in areas it was relatively the most appropriate soil conservation technique for the reduction of sediment yield in all sub basins and catchments in this study fig 9 the implementation of filter strips on cropland and bare land can potentially make mitigation and limitation of sediment yield which is consistent with the earlier finding in kesem dam watershed tesema and leta 2020 therefore the results of this finding would deliver an important mark for the most effective bmps within the catchment or in the awash river basin 3 6 limitations and needful action in the future the key limitation and challenge of the swat hydrological model is a non spatial representation of hrus that affecte the model simulation accuracy it is difficult to determine the spatial locations and describe the interactions between different hrus in each sub basin guo et al 2019 land use land cover soil types and slope heterogeneity of the model are accounted for through each sub basin this approach ignores streamflow and pollutants routing between hrus in the catchment in addition swat is the time intensive model development and challenging streamflow calibration and it was found to be inflexible to the delineation of the catchment and the river network which could not be adjusted apart from choosing another threshold drainage area of the basin cambien et al 2020 overall the model limitations included the simulation of snowmelt evapotranspiration snowmelt erosion floodplain erosion sediment transport routines empirical model formulas and the model does not simulate non field sources of sediment such as erosion of streambanks gorges and or bluffs the effectiveness of filter strip terrace and grasses waterway were depending upon the percentage of land available and local topographical conditions in the basin betrie et al 2011 the accuracy of land use was different to simulate the installation of these management scenarios in the catchment briaket al 2019 the accurate interpretation of the quantitative results may not be appropriate because some physical processes are not well represented in the swat model e g deterioration of the bmps flow concentrations in filter strip and lack of model parameterization at a local scale hence as more data is collected from the catchment the model can be further calibrated to provide more accurate results despite the limitation of the swat model it is important to verify in the future the modeled results by alternative methods and approaches the model outputs may be compared to experimental field and laboratory data when possible this approach is increasing the accuracy of the model outputs meaningful the model results and showed a good performance evaluation of the model parameters to verify the results model simulations and alternative management scenarios are most helpful when coupled with stakeholder input and expert judgment by relying on expert knowledge from local landowners and local and state agency representatives more meaningful management scenarios can be developed that will be in a better position to provide useful information and guide water quality improvement practices moreover change in land use and land cover which could influence the results could be considered in future studies 4 conclusions the study was designed for simulation of sediment yield and impacts of the three best management scenarios in the umarb arcswat 2012 model was used to simulate streamflow and sediment yield the global sensitive analysis parameters for the streamflow and sediment yield were undertaken by using sufi 2 algorism in the swat cup program in calibration period the results of r2 nse pbias and rsp are 0 8 0 69 8 08 and 0 56 respectively for streamflow and 0 72 0 65 32 56 and 0 59 respectively for sediment yield the results of r2 nse pbias and rsp showed a good fitting between observed and simulated streamflow and sediment yield in the calibration and validation period in the baseline scenario the simulated values of sediment yield vary from 0 01 to 68 78 ton ha yr with an average value of 21 43 ton ha yr the highest and lowest value of sediment yield was obtained in sub basins 3 and 2 respectively the sub basin which recorded the highest value of sediment yield indicate the great impact of sediment management scenarios filter strips 5 and 10 m were the most effective method of reducing sediment yield when compared with the terraces and grassed waterways the implementation of 5 m and 10 m filter strips indicated sediment reduction by 31 68 and 46 6 respectively this showed sediment yield reduction is related to an increase in filter strip widths the implemented impact of the grassed waterways and terraces were reduced sediment yields by 16 64 and 19 56 respectively from the base scenario the combination of 5 m filter strip terraces and grassed waterways soil conservation methods was reduced sediment yield by more than half 50 88 in the comparison of three scenarios filter strip was found to provide the highest reduction of sediment yield in each sub basin however the combination of three sediment management practices was significantly more efficient in the reduction of sediment yield therefore the integrated implementation of soil water conservation practice is more feasible for the reduction of sediment yield in umarb overall the results of this study deliver important information for the reduction of sediment yield and implementation of sustainable watershed management of the catchment and help the stakeholders to select the best suitable management practice however further studies will be recommended to evaluate the cost analysis and benefits of integrating soil conservation practice in the catchment and or in the awash river basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
