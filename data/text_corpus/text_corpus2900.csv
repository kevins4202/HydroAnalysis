has raised to more than 2900 tonnes in 2017 18 while it was less than 2500 tonnes in 2011 12 as stated by international olive oil council 1 the table olive production industry is substantially important for the mediterranean region especially in morocco greece spain turkey and italy 2 3 table olives can be produced by three different methods that are naturally black olives in brine green spanish style olives and black californian style olives 4 5 in all processes a high amount of water is consumed which is 0 9 1 9 m3 tonne for black olives 6 it is recommended to treat the topw separately from other industrial wastewaters due to its significant influence on the worldwide wastewater pollution which is about 85 7 black table olive process involves three steps which are cleaning of the olives by fresh water fermentation by sodium chloride solution and storage of olives in brine solution 3 in the naturally black olives processing industry the wastewater is mainly generated by the fermentation step and the characterization of the wastewater generally includes a low ph value between 3 6 4 4 high salts content 56 77 g l high bod5 value 34 8 38 3 g l and phenolic compounds 3 2 5 1 g l 8 besides topw includes a significant amount of organic acids sugars and high conductivity which depends on the characterization of olives and production processes 9 10 the inorganic salt content complicates the treatment of topw 11 and phenolic compounds cause phytotoxic antimicrobial and ecotoxic properties 12 13 the biologic treatment of topw is a bit difficult due to

mill wastewater omw by membrane technologies 23 25 there are not many works on topw which has higher organic compounds and salinity 26 so the treatment of topw has become so important for the environmental concern and the strict limits on the discharging of topw necessitate the integrated treatment technologies for the effective wastewater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 black table olive process wastewater black table olive brine wastewater was supplied from the olive fermentation tank of a commercial table olive processing facility in turkey and stored at 4 c the average physicochemical composition of the brine wastewater is listed in table 1 2 2 chemical treatability studies in chemical treatability studies optimum coagulant type operating ph coagulant dosage amount flocculant type and flocculant dosage amount were determined respectively the types of commercial coagulants and flocculants and the dosage values are listed in table 2 and table 3 fecl3 and al2 so4 3 were obtained from sigma aldrich and the concentration of the solutions was prepared by 10 w v the other coagulants were supplied by nalco company enfloc 330 a and rheomax dr 1050 were used as anionic flocculants which were purchased from sebit chem co korea and basf respectively flocculant types of 13515 and 5030 l were obtained from cromogenia units and used as cationic flocculants chemical treatability studies were carried out with 500 ml of wastewater sample f1 anionic polyelectrolyte pe was added by 4 mg l as a flocculant during the optimization of the coagulant type operating ph and coagulant dosage amount all flocculants were prepared as 0 1 w v solution at the beginning at first determination of the optimum coagulant type and operating ph was studied at a constant 1 v v coagulant dosage all the coagulation and flocculation experiments were performed at 130 rpm of rapid mixing rate for 5 min and 20 rpm of slow mixing rate for 15 min respectively the settling time was maintained for 20 min conductivity ph cod and ss parameters were analyzed in the supernatant 2 3 membrane treatability studies 2 3 1 membranes hollow fiber ultrafiltration module uf 125 was purchased from imt flat sheet nanofiltration membranes nf 270 and np 010 were obtained from filmtech and microdyn nadir respectively flat sheet reverse osmosis membranes bw 30 and sw30 were supplied from filmtech the characterization of the uf and nf ro membranes can be seen in table 4 and table 5 respectively 2 3 2 system configurations used in membrane treatability studies membrane treatability studies were carried out with the supernatant of the coagulated wastewater treatment studies by membrane processes consisted of three steps in the first stage coagulated wastewater which is the supernatant of the chemically treated wastewater was pretreated by uf membrane prior to nf ro membranes then the pretreated wastewater which is the permeate of the uf membrane was further treated with nf membranes in the end ro treatment was performed to reduce the wastewater quality values below to regulatory standards of turkey prior to nf and ro membranes the supernatant of the coagulated wastewater was treated by a pilot scale hollow fiber uf system which can be seen in fig 1 the membrane area was 0 05 m2 and the system pressure was adjusted to 1 bar by the ball valve which is on the concentrate line of the module the hollow fiber membrane was cleaned chemically after the 7 h filtration experiment and the impact of chemical cleaning on the permeate flux was investigated then obtained permeate fluxes were compared for both virgin and cleaned membranes the uf membrane module was cleaned chemically by using of 5 m naoh solution at ph 12 during the chemical cleaning period firstly the cleaning chemical was circulated inside of the module and then it was soaked about 15 min after that the membrane module was rinsed with a fresh water until the ph of the effluent is between 7 8 coagulated flocculated wastewater was fed to uf system for determining of the permeate flux after chemical cleaning the uf experiment was continued until the enough volume of permeate water was collected for the next experiments after the uf treatment the nf experiments were conducted for further treatment by a pilot scale cross flow membrane filtration system which can be seen in fig 2 the volume of the feed tank was 9 l and the effective area of the flat sheet membranes was 80 cm2 nf270 and np010 membranes were tested during the experiments operating pressure was set at 20 bar and the cross flow velocity was 2 15 m sec during the circulation of the feed water inside of the system the feed water is starting to warm up over time therefore the feed water temperature was adjusted to room temperature using a cooling bath the filtration pressure was adjusted using valves located in both sides of the filtration channel after the determination of the nf membrane type the effect of the wastewater ph ph 3 7 and 9 on the permeate flux and cod removal efficiency was studied for the selected nf membrane during these experiments lab scale dead end filtration system was used instead of the pilot scale filtration set up due to the requirement of the large volumes of feed water fig 3 the operating pressure was adjusted to 20 bar for the nf experiments in lab scale filtration set up finally two type of ro membranes brackish water membrane bw30 and sea water membrane sw30 were tested to provide the regulatory standards for discharge lab scale dead end filtration set up model hp4750 sterlitech usa with 14 6 cm2 effective membrane area and 300 ml of feed water capacity was used for the ro experiments fig 3 the operating pressure was set at 35 bar for all the ro membranes conductivity and cod analyses were monitored in feed and permeate water for all the experiments to observe the efficiency of filtration tests the permeate flux was monitored as a function of time at 1 min intervals for all the membrane filtration experiments 3 results and discussions 3 1 chemically treatment of topw 3 1 1 optimization of the coagulant type determination of the optimum coagulant type was carried out at the original sample ph ph 4 60 each of coagulants and f1 anionic pe were added to wastewater sample as 1 v v and 4 mg l respectively the impact of the coagulant types on cod and ss removal efficiencies is shown in fig 4 as it is seen the highest removal efficiencies were obtained as 17 7 for cod and 10 6 for ss when pac s used as a coagulant while the u 71 228 coagulant had the least impact on removal efficiencies pac s have a higher charge density and therefore have a higher neutralizing potential of negative colloids in wastewater 27 besides as wu et al reported in their study so4 2 ions in pac s may advance the hydrolysis polymerization and accumulation of the hydrolyzed species of aluminum 28 thus the increment in the formation of larger flocs enhanced the cod and ss removal efficiencies 3 1 2 optimization of operating ph seven different ph values ph 2 3 4 4 6 sample ph 7 9 11 were tested to determine the optimum working ph the sample ph was adjusted by aqueous solutions of ca oh 2 and hcl during the determination of the optimum working ph experiments 1 v v pac s and 4 mg l f1 anionic pe were added to the wastewater sample the impact of operating ph on cod and ss removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5 according to the experimental results the floc formations at ph 3 were bulkier than ph 4 and the amount of sludge formation was more compact when the sample ph was adjusted below 3 floc formations were deteriorated and removal efficiencies of ss and cod were decreased at sample ph 3 the cod value was decreased from 67 840 mg l to 55 760 mg l while the ss value was reduced from 3784 mg l to 3370 mg l besides that cod and ss removal efficiencies were enhanced by 17 8 and 10 9 respectively when the ph of the sample was decreased from 4 6 to 3 no significant improvement was observed in the cod and ss removal efficiencies on the other hand compact floc formation reduced the sludge disposal by 46 which causes a serious problem in chemical treatment processes although high cod and ss removal efficiencies were obtained at higher operating ph values weak floc formations were observed which prevented the sludge settling therefore at high working ph values weak sludge settling can be an important problem by blocking up the membrane pores in the next treatment stages study by pelendridou et al on the treatment of olive process wastewater showed that the olive wastewater has negatively charged colloids and the absolute zeta potential is low for the low ph values when the same amount of coagulant was added to wastewater it is easier to make colloids unstable to agglomerate and to precipitate in acidic wastewater compared to high ph values 29 the addition of pac s at low ph values neutralized the colloid charges and destabilized the steady state position of the colloids thereby the charges of the non settleable colloids approached the isoelectric point which enabled the positively charged aluminum hydrolysis products to neutralize the negatively charged colloids 27 so the optimum sample ph was determined as ph 3 to minimize the chemical consumption and sludge formation while at the same time achieving the maximum cod and ss removal efficiencies 3 1 3 optimization of the coagulant dosage three different amounts of coagulant dosage 0 5 0 75 1 v v were tested to determine the optimum coagulant dosage chemical treatment studies were performed with the addition of pac s at ph 3 and the addition of 4 mg l f1 anionic pe the effect of the coagulant dosage amount on cod and ss removal efficiencies can be seen in fig 6 the highest cod and ss removal efficiencies were achieved for the addition of pac s by 0 5 v v when the coagulant addition was decreased from 1 to 0 5 the supernatant cod value was reduced from 55 760 mg l to 44 720 mg l and cod removal efficiency was enhanced from 17 8 to 34 1 while ss removal efficiency was increased from 10 9 to 28 2 in addition to this sludge formation was reduced by 25 the excess coagulant usage destabilized the flocculated colloids and prohibited the floc formation which caused weak settling properties and when the dosage amount of pac s was increased sweep flocculation mechanism dominates the charge neutralization mechanism which can affect the removal efficiencies and settling properties 30 as zamfiroiu and masu explained in their study sweep flocculation mechanism dominates the other flocculation mechanisms for the three times bigger ferric and aluminum salt dosage values 31 especially for the coagulants contain aluminum and ferric salts sweep flocculation mechanism becomes dominant when these coagulants cause the formation of gelatinous matrix the other possible cod reduction can be related to settlement of some fine nano suspensions due to change of ph which can affect their surface charges and cause them to become agglomerated due to these reasons the optimum amount of coagulant dosage was determined as 0 5 v v 3 1 4 optimization of the flocculant type during the determination of the optimum flocculant type experiments ph was adjusted to 3 and the dosage amount of pac s and flocculant types were 0 5 and 4 mg l respectively the impact of the flocculant types on cod and ss removal efficiencies can be seen in fig 7 as it is seen from the fig 7 higher removal efficiencies for both cod and ss were observed when the anionic flocculant was used removal efficiencies were enhanced from 34 1 to 35 5 for cod and from 28 2 to 29 7 for ss when the anionic f2 flocculant was used instead of anionic f1 flocculant besides the volume of sludge was reduced by 33 cationic flocculants had less impact on cod and ss removal efficiencies in comparison with anionic flocculants consequently the anionic f2 flocculant was selected as the optimum flocculant type considering the minimum sludge formation and maximum cod and ss removal efficiencies 3 1 5 optimization of the flocculant dosage the effect of four different amounts of flocculant dosage 1 4 mg l on cod and ss removal efficiencies can be seen in fig 8 flocculant optimization experiments were carried out at a sample ph 3 with the addition of 0 5 pac s and anionic f2 flocculant despite the fact that there was not any significant change in the removal efficiencies the amount of the flocculant dosage was determined as 4 mg l because of the less sludge formation 3 2 treatment of topw by membrane filtration processes after the optimization of chemical treatment conditions treatability studies by membrane processes were carried out which consist of three stages in the first stage chemically treated wastewater was pretreated by uf and in the second stage pretreated wastewater was further treated by nf membranes in the last step cod and ss concentrations of the wastewater were reduced below the discharging standard values by ro membranes 3 2 1 first stage pre treatment by uf membrane in the first stage imt uf 125 brand hollow fiber membrane with a surface area of 0 05 m2 was used under a constant working pressure of 1 bar the permeate flux of the uf membrane versus time is given in fig 9 the coagulated wastewater was treated until enough pretreated water was collected for the next stages as it is seen from the fig 9 the permeate flux was decreased by 86 from 37 kg m2 h to 5 kg m2 h after the 7 h of operating time especially at the beginning of the experiment more flux decline was observed compared to obtained permeate fluxes after 100 min the equilibrium permeate flux was determined as 5 7 kg m2 h after the uf treatment coagulated wastewater cod value was decreased by 46 7 from 43 770 mg l to 23 350 mg l and it was observed a total of 65 6 cod removal efficiency compared to cod of the raw wastewater the raw wastewater conductivity value was reduced by 19 9 from 136 ms cm to 109 ms cm after the pretreatment by uf similar results can be seen in the literature for example galanakis et al investigated the clarification of high added value products from olive mill wastewater they obtained conductivity retention coefficients between 5 61 for several ultrafiltration membrane types 32 and also it is known that ultrafiltration process can remove conductivity and salinity between 0 40 as urtiaga et al informed in their study 33 the flux decline in fig 9 indicates the possible fouling of the uf membrane by pore adsorption and or cake formation on the membrane surface these fouling mechanisms can cause narrower membrane pore sizes which can enhance the conductivity rejection after the uf filtration test uf membrane was cleaned chemically and the impact of chemical cleaning on permeate flux was investigated which can be seen in fig 9 the initial flux values was decreased by 16 from 37 kg m2 h to 31 kg m2 h and the equilibrium permeate flux values were declined by 22 from 20 3 kg m2 h to 15 7 kg m2 h the decrement in both initial and equilibrium permeate fluxes after cleaning were observed due to the irreversible clogging of pores by dissolved organic contaminants 3 2 2 second stage treatment by nf membrane firstly nf270 and np010 nanofiltration membranes were tested with a pilot scale cross flow filtration system to determine the optimum membrane type then the effect of sample ph on permeate flux and cod removal efficiency was investigated using the selected membrane type with a dead end filtration system experiments were carried out at a pressure of 20 bar at a temperature of 25 c and at a cross flow rate of 2 15 m sec the permeate flux versus time graph for both np010 and nf270 membranes is given in fig 10 according to experimental results cod value was reduced by 43 8 from 23 350 mg l to 13 120 mg l for nf270 membrane and by 39 from 23 350 mg l to 14 250 mg l for np010 membrane besides the conductivity was decreased by 17 1 from 109 0 ms cm to 90 4 ms cm for nf270 membrane while it was lowered by 10 9 from 109 0 ms cm to 97 1 ms cm for np010 membrane in total cod removal efficiencies were enhanced by 80 7 and 79 for nf270 and np010 membranes respectively equilibrium flux was determined as 6 8 kg m2 h for np010 membrane and 17 5 kg m2 h for nf270 membrane nf270 membrane had higher cod and conductivity removal efficiencies because of the molecular weight cut off value of n270 membrane 340 da was less than np010 membrane 1000 da besides the permeate flux of nf270 membrane was higher than np010 membrane due to more hydrophilic membrane structure of nf270 membrane 34 similar results were obtained by coskun et al in which the cod removal efficiency and permeate flux of the nf270 membrane were higher than the np010 membrane for the treatment of olive mill wastewater 35 so nf270 membrane was selected as optimum nf membrane prior to treatment by ro membrane after the determination of optimum nf membrane the impact of operating ph ph 3 7 and 9 on cod and conductivity removal efficiencies and the permeate flux was investigated by using dead end filtration set up the impact of operating ph on permeate flux is given in fig 11 the cod removal efficiency was decreased by 49 4 from 23 350 mg l to 11 820 mg l for ph 3 80 8 from 23 350 mg l to 4480 mg l for ph 7 and 82 4 from 23 350 mg l to 4210 mg l the conductivity removal efficiencies were improved by 20 3 71 9 and 72 7 for ph 3 7 and 9 respectively when the ph of the wastewater sample was increased from ph 3 to ph 9 the permeate water flux was increased from 8 2 kg m2 h to 26 9 kg m2 h and it was 25 7 kg m2 h for ph 7 by increasing the ph further floc formations were observed in the wastewater as el abbasi et al reported in their study 36 therefore both removal efficiencies were increased due to the rejection of newly formed flocs when the ph value was increased from ph 7 to ph 9 the size of the newly formed flocs enlarged because of this a faster decline in the permeate flux was observed due to both formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface and clogging in the membrane pores by precipitation of proteins 37 and polyphenols 38 at alkaline ph consequently the working ph was determined as ph 7 considering the permeate flux minimum chemical consumption cod and conductivity removal efficiencies 3 2 3 final stage treatment by ro membrane bw30 and sw30 membranes were used in the final stage of the membrane filtration studies under the operating pressure of 35 bar cod and conductivity removal efficiencies in total are given in table 6 in the final stage permeate water cod value was decreased by 99 3 from 4480 mg l to 32 mg l for sw30 membrane and by 96 3 from 4480 mg l to 128 mg l for bw30 membrane the permeate water conductivity was reduced by 96 4 and 95 4 for sw30 and bw30 membranes respectively in total a higher than 99 8 cod removal efficiency was achieved for both membranes the equilibrium permeate water flux was 2 8 kg m2 h for sw30 membrane while it was 4 kg m2 h for bw30 membrane in turkey characterization of the composite samples for 2 h is taken into consideration as a discharging limit value of the effluent so the discharging standards were provided for both membranes which can be shown in table 7 as hilal et al reported in their study mean surface pore diameters of the bw30 and sw30 membranes are 5 9 nm and 1 8 nm respectively in addition to this the surface porosity is 38 for bw30 membrane while it is 20 for sw30 membrane 39 due to the higher pore diameter and surface porosity of the bw30 membrane the permeate quality was lower than sw30 membrane while the permeate flux was higher 4 conclusions the table olive industry has a substantially high water consumption during the process and releases a considerable amount of wastewater which includes a high value of cod conductivity and ss therefore the investigation of the table olive wastewater treatment by integrated membrane technologies becomes more crucial due to its significant environmental damages and difficult treatability in this study the table olive wastewater was treated chemically and coagulation flocculation conditions were optimized according to the results optimum type of coagulant and dosage amount operating ph type of flocculant and dosage amount were determined as pac s 0 5 v v ph 3 anionic f2 flocculant and 4 mg l respectively the cod value of the wastewater sample was decreased by 35 5 while the removal efficiency of ss was 29 7 the type and dosage value of the coagulant are the main operating parameters of coagulant flocculation process that have higher effect on both cod and ss removal efficiencies in the uf treatment stage cod removal efficiency was increased from 35 5 to 65 6 while the conductivity was decreased by 19 9 generally the conductivity rejection is not good for the uf membranes it is thought that the decrease in the conductivity is due to the changes in membrane characterization which is probably caused by membrane fouling the chemical cleaning protocol of the uf membrane was quite effective to restore the permeate flux and it was decreased by only 16 due to the irreversible clogging of the membrane pores in the nf treatment stage nf270 was selected as the most effective nf membrane because of its higher permeate flux and higher cod removal efficiency due to the larger mwco value and hydrophilic structure besides it was observed that the ph of the wastewater had an important effect on the permeate flux because of the forming of further floc formations in the wastewater and it was determined as ph 7 in the ro treatment cod values of the permeate waters were lower than 150 mg l for both bw30 and sw30 membranes in which discharging limit values were provided and the bw30 membrane was found to be a more suitable membrane for the ro stage as it had better filtration performance and could be operated at lower operating pressures although it is not the purpose of this study many thermal based and membrane based processes such as evaporation forward osmosis and membrane distillation processes can be used for the treatment of membrane concentrates 40 in conclusion topw with high cod and salinity content was treated below the limited values for discharging by an integrated wastewater treatment technology consisting of chemical and membrane filtration technologies it showed that chemical treatment is a promising option for the primary treatment of topw prior to membrane filtration process in addition to that further investigations must be done on the disposal of the membrane concentrates and reuse of the effluents

membranes conductivity and cod analyses were monitored in feed and permeate water for all the experiments to observe the efficiency of filtration tests the permeate flux was monitored as a function of time at 1 min intervals for all the membrane filtration experiments 3 results and discussions 3 1 chemically treatment of topw 3 1 1 optimization of the coagulant type determination of the optimum coagulant type was carried out at the original sample ph ph 4 60 each of coagulants and f1 anionic pe were added to wastewater sample as 1 v v and 4 mg l respectively the impact of the coagulant types on cod and ss removal efficiencies is shown in fig 4 as it is seen the highest removal efficiencies were obtained as 17 7 for cod and 10 6 for ss when pac s used as a coagulant while the u 71 228 coagulant had the least impact on removal efficiencies pac s have a higher charge density and therefore have a higher neutralizing potential of negative colloids in wastewater 27 besides as wu et al reported in their study so4 2 ions in pac s may advance the hydrolysis polymerization and accumulation of the hydrolyzed species of aluminum 28 thus the increment in the formation of larger flocs enhanced the cod and ss removal efficiencies 3 1 2 optimization of operating ph seven different ph values ph 2 3 4 4 6 sample ph 7 9 11 were tested to determine the optimum working ph the sample ph was adjusted by aqueous solutions of ca oh 2 and hcl during the determination of the optimum working ph experiments 1 v v pac s and 4 mg l f1 anionic pe were added to the wastewater sample the impact of operating ph on cod and ss removal efficiencies is shown in fig 5 according to the experimental results the floc formations at ph 3 were bulkier than ph 4 and the amount of sludge formation was more compact when the sample ph was adjusted below 3 floc formations were deteriorated and removal efficiencies of ss and cod were decreased at sample ph 3 the cod value was decreased from 67 840 mg l to 55 760 mg l while the ss value was reduced from 3784 mg l to 3370 mg l besides that cod and ss removal efficiencies were enhanced by 17 8 and 10 9 respectively when the ph of the sample was decreased from 4 6 to 3 no significant improvement was observed in the cod and ss removal efficiencies on the other hand compact floc formation reduced the sludge disposal by 46 which causes a serious problem in chemical treatment processes although high cod and ss removal efficiencies were obtained at higher operating ph values weak floc formations were observed which prevented the sludge settling therefore at high working ph values weak sludge settling can be an important problem by blocking up the membrane pores in the next treatment stages study by pelendridou et al on the treatment of olive process wastewater showed that the olive wastewater has negatively charged colloids and the absolute zeta potential is low for the low ph values when the same amount of coagulant was added to wastewater it is easier to make colloids unstable to agglomerate and to precipitate in acidic wastewater compared to high ph values 29 the addition of pac s at low ph values neutralized the colloid charges and destabilized the steady state position of the colloids thereby the charges of the non settleable colloids approached the isoelectric point which enabled the positively charged aluminum hydrolysis products to neutralize the negatively charged colloids 27 so the optimum sample ph was determined as ph 3 to minimize the chemical consumption and sludge formation while at the same time achieving the maximum cod and ss removal efficiencies 3 1 3 optimization of the coagulant dosage three different amounts of coagulant dosage 0 5 0 75 1 v v were tested to determine the optimum coagulant dosage chemical treatment studies were performed with the addition of pac s at ph 3 and the addition of 4 mg l f1 anionic pe the effect of the coagulant dosage amount on cod and ss removal efficiencies can be seen in fig 6 the highest cod and ss removal efficiencies were achieved for the addition of pac s by 0 5 v v when the coagulant addition was decreased from 1 to 0 5 the supernatant cod value was reduced from 55 760 mg l to 44 720 mg l and cod removal efficiency was enhanced from 17 8 to 34 1 while ss removal efficiency was increased from 10 9 to 28 2 in addition to this sludge formation was reduced by 25 the excess coagulant usage destabilized the flocculated colloids and prohibited the floc formation which caused weak settling properties and when the dosage amount of pac s was increased sweep flocculation mechanism dominates the charge neutralization mechanism which can affect the removal efficiencies and settling properties 30 as zamfiroiu and masu explained in their study sweep flocculation mechanism dominates the other flocculation mechanisms for the three times bigger ferric and aluminum salt dosage values 31 especially for the coagulants contain aluminum and ferric salts sweep flocculation mechanism becomes dominant when these coagulants cause the formation of gelatinous matrix the other possible cod reduction can be related to settlement of some fine nano suspensions due to change of ph which can affect their surface charges and cause them to become agglomerated due to these reasons the optimum amount of coagulant dosage was determined as 0 5 v v 3 1 4 optimization of the flocculant type during the determination of the optimum flocculant type experiments ph was adjusted to 3 and the dosage amount of pac s and flocculant types were 0 5 and 4 mg l respectively the impact of the flocculant types on cod and ss removal efficiencies can be seen in fig 7 as it is seen from the fig 7 higher removal efficiencies for both cod and ss were observed when the anionic flocculant was used removal efficiencies were enhanced from 34 1 to 35 5 for cod and from 28 2 to 29 7 for ss when the anionic f2 flocculant was used instead of anionic f1 flocculant besides the volume of sludge was reduced by 33 cationic flocculants had less impact on cod and ss removal efficiencies in comparison with anionic flocculants consequently the anionic f2 flocculant was selected as the optimum flocculant type considering the minimum sludge formation and maximum cod and ss removal efficiencies 3 1 5 optimization of the flocculant dosage the effect of four different amounts of flocculant dosage 1 4 mg l on cod and ss removal efficiencies can be seen in fig 8 flocculant optimization experiments were carried out at a sample ph 3 with the addition of 0 5 pac s and anionic f2 flocculant despite the fact that there was not any significant change in the removal efficiencies the amount of the flocculant dosage was determined as 4 mg l because of the less sludge formation 3 2 treatment of topw by membrane filtration processes after the optimization of chemical treatment conditions treatability studies by membrane processes were carried out which consist of three stages in the first stage chemically treated wastewater was pretreated by uf and in the second stage pretreated wastewater was further treated by nf membranes in the last step cod and ss concentrations of the wastewater were reduced below the discharging standard values by ro membranes 3 2 1 first stage pre treatment by uf membrane in the first stage imt uf 125 brand hollow fiber membrane with a surface area of 0 05 m2 was used under a constant working pressure of 1 bar the permeate flux of the uf membrane versus time is given in fig 9 the coagulated wastewater was treated until enough pretreated water was collected for the next stages as it is seen from the fig 9 the permeate flux was decreased by 86 from 37 kg m2 h to 5 kg m2 h after the 7 h of operating time especially at the beginning of the experiment more flux decline was observed compared to obtained permeate fluxes after 100 min the equilibrium permeate flux was determined as 5 7 kg m2 h after the uf treatment coagulated wastewater cod value was decreased by 46 7 from 43 770 mg l to 23 350 mg l and it was observed a total of 65 6 cod removal efficiency compared to cod of the raw wastewater the raw wastewater conductivity value was reduced by 19 9 from 136 ms cm to 109 ms cm after the pretreatment by uf similar results can be seen in the literature for example galanakis et al investigated the clarification of high added value products from olive mill wastewater they obtained conductivity retention coefficients between 5 61 for several ultrafiltration membrane types 32 and also it is known that ultrafiltration process can remove conductivity and salinity between 0 40 as urtiaga et al informed in their study 33 the flux decline in fig 9 indicates the possible fouling of the uf membrane by pore adsorption and or cake formation on the membrane surface these fouling mechanisms can cause narrower membrane pore sizes which can enhance the conductivity rejection after the uf filtration test uf membrane was cleaned chemically and the impact of chemical cleaning on permeate flux was investigated which can be seen in fig 9 the initial flux values was decreased by 16 from 37 kg m2 h to 31 kg m2 h and the equilibrium permeate flux values were declined by 22 from 20 3 kg m2 h to 15 7 kg m2 h the decrement in both initial and equilibrium permeate fluxes after cleaning were observed due to the irreversible clogging of pores by dissolved organic contaminants 3 2 2 second stage treatment by nf membrane firstly nf270 and np010 nanofiltration membranes were tested with a pilot scale cross flow filtration system to determine the optimum membrane type then the effect of sample ph on permeate flux and cod removal efficiency was investigated using the selected membrane type with a dead end filtration system experiments were carried out at a pressure of 20 bar at a temperature of 25 c and at a cross flow rate of 2 15 m sec the permeate flux versus time graph for both np010 and nf270 membranes is given in fig 10 according to experimental results cod value was reduced by 43 8 from 23 350 mg l to 13 120 mg l for nf270 membrane and by 39 from 23 350 mg l to 14 250 mg l for np010 membrane besides the conductivity was decreased by 17 1 from 109 0 ms cm to 90 4 ms cm for nf270 membrane while it was lowered by 10 9 from 109 0 ms cm to 97 1 ms cm for np010 membrane in total cod removal efficiencies were enhanced by 80 7 and 79 for nf270 and np010 membranes respectively equilibrium flux was determined as 6 8 kg m2 h for np010 membrane and 17 5 kg m2 h for nf270 membrane nf270 membrane had higher cod and conductivity removal efficiencies because of the molecular weight cut off value of n270 membrane 340 da was less than np010 membrane 1000 da besides the permeate flux of nf270 membrane was higher than np010 membrane due to more hydrophilic membrane structure of nf270 membrane 34 similar results were obtained by coskun et al in which the cod removal efficiency and permeate flux of the nf270 membrane were higher than the np010 membrane for the treatment of olive mill wastewater 35 so nf270 membrane was selected as optimum nf membrane prior to treatment by ro membrane after the determination of optimum nf membrane the impact of operating ph ph 3 7 and 9 on cod and conductivity removal efficiencies and the permeate flux was investigated by using dead end filtration set up the impact of operating ph on permeate flux is given in fig 11 the cod removal efficiency was decreased by 49 4 from 23 350 mg l to 11 820 mg l for ph 3 80 8 from 23 350 mg l to 4480 mg l for ph 7 and 82 4 from 23 350 mg l to 4210 mg l the conductivity removal efficiencies were improved by 20 3 71 9 and 72 7 for ph 3 7 and 9 respectively when the ph of the wastewater sample was increased from ph 3 to ph 9 the permeate water flux was increased from 8 2 kg m2 h to 26 9 kg m2 h and it was 25 7 kg m2 h for ph 7 by increasing the ph further floc formations were observed in the wastewater as el abbasi et al reported in their study 36 therefore both removal efficiencies were increased due to the rejection of newly formed flocs when the ph value was increased from ph 7 to ph 9 the size of the newly formed flocs enlarged because of this a faster decline in the permeate flux was observed due to both formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface and clogging in the membrane pores by precipitation of proteins 37 and polyphenols 38 at alkaline ph consequently the working ph was determined as ph 7 considering the permeate flux minimum chemical consumption cod and conductivity removal efficiencies 3 2 3 final stage treatment by ro membrane bw30 and sw30 membranes were used in the final stage of the membrane filtration studies under the operating pressure of 35 bar cod and conductivity removal efficiencies in total are given in table 6 in the final stage permeate water cod value was decreased by 99 3 from 4480 mg l to 32 mg l for sw30 membrane and by 96 3 from 4480 mg l to 128 mg l for bw30 membrane the permeate water conductivity was reduced by 96 4 and 95 4 for sw30 and bw30 membranes respectively in total a higher than 99 8 cod removal efficiency was achieved for both membranes the equilibrium permeate water flux was 2 8 kg m2 h for sw30 membrane while it was 4 kg m2 h for bw30 membrane in turkey characterization of the composite samples for 2 h is taken into consideration as a discharging limit value of the effluent so the discharging standards were provided for both membranes which can be shown in table 7 as hilal et al reported in their study mean surface pore diameters of the bw30 and sw30 membranes are 5 9 nm and 1 8 nm respectively in addition to this the surface porosity is 38 for bw30 membrane while it is 20 for sw30 membrane 39 due to the higher pore diameter and surface porosity of the bw30 membrane the permeate quality was lower than sw30 membrane while the permeate flux was higher 4 conclusions the table olive industry has a substantially high water consumption during the process and releases a considerable amount of wastewater which includes a high value of cod conductivity and ss therefore the investigation of the table olive wastewater treatment by integrated membrane technologies becomes more crucial due to its significant environmental damages and difficult treatability in this study the table olive wastewater was treated chemically and coagulation flocculation conditions were optimized according to the results optimum type of coagulant and dosage amount operating ph type of flocculant and dosage amount were determined as pac s 0 5 v v ph 3 anionic f2 flocculant and 4 mg l respectively the cod value of the wastewater sample was decreased by 35 5 while the removal efficiency of ss was 29 7 the type and dosage value of the coagulant are the main operating parameters of coagulant flocculation process that have higher effect on both cod and ss removal efficiencies in the uf treatment stage cod removal efficiency was increased from 35 5 to 65 6 while the conductivity was decreased by 19 9 generally the conductivity rejection is not good for the uf membranes it is thought that the decrease in the conductivity is due to the changes in membrane characterization which is probably caused by membrane fouling the chemical cleaning protocol of the uf membrane was quite effective to restore the permeate flux and it was decreased by only 16 due to the irreversible clogging of the membrane pores in the nf treatment stage nf270 was selected as the most effective nf membrane because of its higher permeate flux and higher cod removal efficiency due to the larger mwco value and hydrophilic structure besides it was observed that the ph of the wastewater had an important effect on the permeate flux because of the forming of further floc formations in the wastewater and it was determined as ph 7 in the ro treatment cod values of the permeate waters were lower than 150 mg l for both bw30 and sw30 membranes in which discharging limit values were provided and the bw30 membrane was found to be a more suitable membrane for the ro stage as it had better filtration performance and could be operated at lower operating pressures although it is not the purpose of this study many thermal based and membrane based processes such as evaporation forward osmosis and membrane distillation processes can be used for the treatment of membrane concentrates 40 in conclusion topw with high cod and salinity content was treated below the limited values for discharging by an integrated wastewater treatment technology consisting of chemical and membrane filtration technologies it showed that chemical treatment is a promising option for the primary treatment of topw prior to membrane filtration process in addition to that further investigations must be done on the disposal of the membrane concentrates and reuse of the effluents 
14501,this paper presents a mathematical model for an in situ hydrogenotrophic denitrification and oxidation process in an experimental scale aquifer this model was developed to investigate the stable denitrification performance of the aquifer as well as the effects of varying the molar ratio of nitrate load to hydrogen gas injection n h ratio on the effluent quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite concentrations under a long term operation the model could fairly predict the effluent quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the aquifer in response to the sudden decrease in h2 gas injection as well as different n h ratios furthermore the model clearly demonstrated that denitrification and nitrification proceeded in each zone injected with h2 gas or o2 gas respectively and that stable treatment can be achieved there were some differences between the experimental data and the model results for nitrate nitrite dissolved oxygen and dissolved hydrogen at the h2 injection zone implying that mass transfer rates in biofilm should be taken into consideration for more precise modeling a sensitivity analysis showed that effluent quality in terms of nitrate concentration was the most sensitive to changes in maximum nitrate and nitrite utilization rates keywords in situ hydrogenotrophic denitrification mathematical model nitrate removal groundwater 1 introduction the remediation of nitrate contaminated groundwater has been emergent globally because the consumption of nitrate contaminated water poses carcinogenic risks to humans 1 one of the remediation technologies implemented for this purpose is a biological denitrification process in this process nitrate is biologically reduced to non toxic nitrogen gas with organic or inorganic electron donors 2 4 because in situ application of biological denitrification processes to underground aquifers does not require groundwater withdrawal it can reduce operational costs compared to other remediation technologies 5 schipper and vojvodic vukovic 6 succeeded in maintaining a 95 nitrate removal efficiency in a pilot scale plant for five years using an in situ heterotrophic denitrification process however clogging due to excessive growth of microorganisms might occur in a heterotrophic denitrification process in which organic compounds such as methanol 7 ethanol 8 and sucrose 9 are supplied as electron donors in addition secondary pollution caused by these compounds is a concern because of lower growth rates and the non toxicity of the electron donor an autotrophic denitrification process using hydrogen gas has been proposed 10 11 the operation is simple because only injection of hydrogen gas into the aquifer is necessary the electric power required in electrolysis to generate hydrogen gas could be provided by solar power given the advantages in terms of purification performance and cost this process has been considered one of the most promising and cost effective alternative methods for remediation of nitrate contaminated aquifers 12 13 however although long term continuous and stable removal performance of the technology should be demonstrated well before its application no previous study has achieved such performance to our knowledge in our prior studies 14 15 continuous experiments were conducted for more than 800 days and nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas with slight accumulations of nitrite in the hydrogen injected zone but oxygen was supplied subsequently in a downstream oxygen injected zone resulting in the complete oxidation of nitrite to nitrate furthermore nitrous oxide n2o considered an intermediate product was not detected during the treatment the effectiveness of the in situ process with injection of hydrogen and oxygen gases was demonstrated experimentally however theoretical investigations had not been conducted fully those investigations are important for a quantitative analysis of the performance leading to proper management of the environmental technology in addition they may be helpful for design considerations when the system is scaled up in this study a mathematical model was developed to investigate the stable denitrification performance and the effects of varying molar ratio of nitrate loads to hydrogen gas injection on the model output of effluent water qualities such as nitrate and nitrite 2 methodology 2 1 long term denitrification and oxidation process a schematic of the experimental scale aquifer used for this study is shown in fig 1 the reactor consisted of custom made acrylic panels 1950 mm in length 25 mm in width and 780 mm in height packed with glass beads φ 2 mm as the carrier of microorganisms the total and effective liquid volumes of the reactor were 40 l and 16 l respectively sampling ports were arranged horizontally and vertically within 300 mm intervals concentrations of eight sampling points including influent and effluent were measured mixing three samples from ports located at a same distance from the inlet nitrate and nitrite were measured with ion chromatography hic 10 a shimadzu kyoto japan dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured with a do meter ud 1 central kagaku corp tokyo japan and a ph meter cyberscan ph 510 eutech instruments singapore respectively dissolved hydrogen dh concentration was measured by headspace method i e a water sample taken from the reactor was put in a bottle sealed with a butyl rubber septum and the bottle was placed after turning it upside down in a thermostatic chamber at 65 c for two hours to make an equilibrium condition between liquid and gas phases after that hydrogen concentration in the gas phase was measured with gas chromatography gc 8 a shimadzu kyoto japan and then dh concentration was calculated using henry s law synthetic groundwater was fed and withdrawn through five lines in total with peristaltic pumps the synthetic groundwater contained nano3 at 15 06 mg n l 1 k2hpo4 at 1 76 mg l 1 kh2po4 at 2 08 mg l 1 nacl at 0 96 mg l 1 fecl3 6h2o at 1 92 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o at 4 00 mg l 1 cacl2 at 1 12 mg l 1 with inorganic carbon ic as nahco3 or co2 at 101 mg c l 1 15 pumps were not set in two withdrawal lines to keep the groundwater flow rates of the influent and effluent constant the effluent from the aquifer was discharged through an overflow weir to maintain the water level hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced using a solid polymer electrolyte membrane electrode 16 and injected using peristaltic pumps from the bottoms located at 0 45 m and 1 45 m from the inlet respectively to avoid the growth of algae the aquifer and every tube were covered with a light shielding curtain or aluminum foil the apparatus was placed in a temperature maintained chamber 20 2 c details regarding the start up can be found elsewhere 15 during the start up of the reactor 13 3 mg l 1 of nitrate was fed 360 ml d 1 of h2 gas was injected and the flowrate was maintained at 0 29 m d 1 after steady denitrification performance was achieved three phases of operation were performed as shown in table 1 phase i started on day 343 when the h2 gas injection volume was increased until an injection volume of 580 ml d 1 was attained to improve the performance of denitrification in the aquifer while the flowrate was maintained at 0 29 m d 1 the molar ratio of influent nitrate load to h2 gas injection or n h ratio in phase 1 was regarded as the base for the subsequent phases the n h ratio was controlled by the flowrate and the h2 gas injection volume not by the influent nitrate concentration after 36 weeks of operation during phase 1 the h2 gas injection volume was decreased suddenly to examine the resilience of the reactor to unexpected gas injection failure phase 2 started on day 777 when the normalized n h ratio was increased to1 3 to determine whether an accumulation of a toxic denitrification intermediate nitrite would be observed in addition to examine the effects of a higher load of nitrate the normalized n h ratio was further increased stepwise on days 808 828 and 850 until the maximum ratio of 2 2 was reached phase 3 started on day 868 when the normalized n h ratio was decreased to 1 6 after which the flowrate and h2 gas injection volume were decreased stepwise to the same condition as in phase 1 to determine whether the aquifer effluent quality could be recovered 2 2 mathematical model advection dispersion transport and biochemical reaction mechanisms were incorporated into a one dimensional model concentrations and gas diffusion were assumed to be uniform with width and depth in the experimental apparatus the zones influenced by h2 or o2 gas covered lengths of 10 cm each from the injection point i e 20 cm in total the microbial biofilms attached to the glass beads occupied no physical space in the model and mass transfer resistance through biofilms was neglected influent nitrate concentrations were set as constant in the model the initial and boundary conditions were determined based on data obtained at the beginning of the experiment average values of influent concentrations or assumed to be specific values i e all substrate utilization rates and growth rates were set at 0 concentrations of bacteria were set at 10 mg l 1 horizontal flow rates and gas injection volumes were inputs of the model and the values were changed according to the operating condition horizontal flow rates and gas injection volumes were inputs of the model and the values were changed according to the experimental condition table 1 the mathematical model was coded in fortran language and compiled by intel visual fortran composer xe2013 intel inc us the programming code is available in a data repository provided by the journal 17

model and experimental results of effluent quality of nitrate and nitrite after day 500 are shown in fig 2 good fits of the model to the experimental data were obtained for both nitrate and nitrite during phase 1 during this phase h2 gas injection volume was decreased suddenly at around day 600 effluent nitrate concentration consequently increased but attained its original state after the injection volume was resumed the model responded quickly to this situation indicating that the model was resilient to rapid change of gas injection volume meanwhile nitrite was not observed in the effluent during phase 1 including the short period of h2 gas injection failures demonstrating that the model suppressed the accumulation of nitrite during phase 2 the normalized n h ratio was increased to 2 2 which was more than double the loading of the condition in phase 1 as the normalized n h ratio was increased effluent nitrate concentrations increased which was shown in the model as well nitrite concentrations determined using the model and experimentally were 0 mg l 1 during the entire experiment period except on the 20th day after the n h ratio was increased during this period nitrite accumulation was observed in the model this is because temporal depression of nitrification occurred in the o2 gas injection zone when the nitrogen load increased however accumulation was suppressed even when the n h ratio was subsequently increased which is consistent with the experimental data because the production of nitrite from nitrate decreased when nitrate loadings were made higher nitrite concentrations in the h2 gas influence zone became smaller and were reduced via nitrification to 0 mg l 1 in the effluent the model results maintained no nitrite in the effluent even though the maximum normalized n h ratio was implemented as the normalized n h ratio was decreased during phase 3 effluent nitrate concentrations decreased as stated before from day 910 a model input i e flow rate was controlled resulting in oscillation of the model output when the normalized n h ratio was resumed to 1 0 it approached 5 mg l 1 future studies will be needed to determine the numerical stability when flow rates are decreased substantially nitrite accumulation was not observed in either the model or the experimental data over the phase overall the model could predict the effluent quality of nitrate and nitrite 3 2 theoretical investigation of stable denitrification process the concentration profiles of nitrate nitrite do and dh in the aquifer during phase 1 were examined when a stable denitrification performance was maintained the results of the model represent the mean values during the period from day 700 to day 770 and were compared with the experimental data obtained during the same period as shown in figs 3 and 4 the model results are in good agreement with the experimental data the model clearly demonstrates that denitrification proceeded at the h2 gas injection zone in the aquifer shown as the gray part in fig 3 the model shows a removal of nitrate up to the distance of 0 6 m from the inlet confirming that hydrogenotrophic denitrification was effectively achieved in the system however the model shows a rapid decrease in nitrate concentration at 0 35 m and a rapid increase in nitrite concentration at 0 45 m from the inlet whereas a slighter decrease of nitrate concentration and no accumulation of nitrite were observed in the experimental data with respect to this difference previous works by sakakibara et al 29 and kuroda et al 30 could provide an insight into improving the model they established mathematical models for a consecutive bioreaction taking place in anaerobic biofilm reactors they concluded that intermediates accumulate in biofilms enhancing the removal rates of the intermediates similarly because the denitrification process involves the formation of intermediates including nitrite accumulations of nitrite in biofilms may enhance nitrite removal rates the experimental results reflect this situation and a better fit may be obtained if biofilm kinetics were incorporated into the model in this study mass transfer resistances were neglected because diffusion coefficients were not obtained during the study another possible reason is that this difference may have been caused by the parameter settings of rm no3 and rm no2 although the rm no3 value was higher than the rm no2 value in the model it is possible that denitrifying bacteria in the aquifer had lower nitrate utilization and higher nitrite utilization capacities as reported in previous studies 4 11 at 1 05 m and farther the model demonstrates the effect of nitrification caused by o2 gas injection nitrate concentration increases gradually due to the oxidation of nitrite resulting in a gradual decline in nitrite concentrations both the model results for nitrate and nitrite eventually fit the experimental data the model and experimental data in fig 4 show that the decline and recovery of do were observed experimentally and were predicted from the model there was a small discrepancy in the zone influenced by h2 gas injection do is completely consumed in the model whereas 2 mg l 1 of do was retained in the aquifer the rm o2 value might have been slightly overestimated however this parameter setting should have only a minor effect on the model output of denitrification performance in the aquifer as indicated by the sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 4 concentrations of dh at 0 45 m 0 75 m and 1 05 m from the inlet were around 0 4 mg l 1 whereas those at other sampling points were 0 mg l 1 in the experimental results and substantial increase of dh at the position of hydrogen gas injection and in its downstream before the oxygen gas injection was shown in the experimental data compared to the model the substrate utilization rates for dh are coupled to the reaction rates of denitrification and hydrogen oxidation see eq 13 when such a denitrification performance is achieved as demonstrated in fig 3 the experimental data of dh should be much lower according to the stoichiometry shown in eq 23 dh concentrations should be maintained at nearly 0 mg l 1 for the experimentally obtained reduction of nitrate considering the solubility of h2 in water 31 thus the model results of dh are consistent with the stoichiometric calculation it cannot be denied that trapped hydrogen gas in the aquifer was included in the sampling liquid resulting in such a high dh concentration i e 0 4 mg l 1 the model was highly effective at predicting the denitrification performance in the aquifer and responded quickly to h2 and o2 gas injection to determine which parameters had the greatest influence on the model output specifically the effluent quality of nitrate a sensitivity analysis was performed the target parameters were maximum substrate utilization rates for nitrate nitrite and oxygen half saturation constants for nitrate nitrite and oxygen and decay and microbial detachment coefficients each parameter was changed by 10 and a sensitivity index was defined as the variation of the effluent nitrate concentrations at day 500 for 10 variation of the parameter the model was run for 500 days the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 5 the model output was most sensitive to changes in substrate utilization rates related to the denitrification process a 10 change in the maximum substrate utilization rates for nitrate and nitrite modified the effluent nitrate concentration by 14 2 and 6 9 respectively the change in the other parameters resulted in less than 3 modification indicating that they had little impact on the effluent nitrate concentration these results were consistent with a previous study of hydrogenotrophic denitrification 26 4 conclusion a mathematical model for an in situ hydrogenotrophic denitrification and oxidation process was developed the model could fairly predict the effluent quality of nitrate in the aquifer responding to sudden decreases in h2 gas injected as well as different n h ratios nitrite concentrations of both model results and experimental data were maintained at approximately 0 mg l 1 over all periods of the experiment in addition based on the analysis of concentration profiles the model clearly demonstrated the occurrence of denitrification and nitrification in the aquifer confirming a fairly good fit of model results to experimental data there were some differences between experimental data and model results for nitrate nitrite do and dh concentrations in the denitrification zone this implies the existence of mass transfer resistance in biofilms therefore incorporation of mass transfer resistances in the model may lead to a better fit nevertheless the model was highly effective for predicting the denitrification performance in the aquifer responding to h2 and o2 gas injection according to the sensitivity analysis denitrification

14501,this paper presents a mathematical model for an in situ hydrogenotrophic denitrification and oxidation process in an experimental scale aquifer this model was developed to investigate the stable denitrification performance of the aquifer as well as the effects of varying the molar ratio of nitrate load to hydrogen gas injection n h ratio on the effluent quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite concentrations under a long term operation the model could fairly predict the effluent quality in terms of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the aquifer in response to the sudden decrease in h2 gas injection as well as different n h ratios furthermore the model clearly demonstrated that denitrification and nitrification proceeded in each zone injected with h2 gas or o2 gas respectively and that stable treatment can be achieved there were some differences between the experimental data and the model results for nitrate nitrite dissolved oxygen and dissolved hydrogen at the h2 injection zone implying that mass transfer rates in biofilm should be taken into consideration for more precise modeling a sensitivity analysis showed that effluent quality in terms of nitrate concentration was the most sensitive to changes in maximum nitrate and nitrite utilization rates keywords in situ hydrogenotrophic denitrification mathematical model nitrate removal groundwater 1 introduction the remediation of nitrate contaminated groundwater has been emergent globally because the consumption of nitrate contaminated water poses carcinogenic risks to humans 1 one of the remediation technologies implemented for this purpose is a biological denitrification process in this process nitrate is biologically reduced to non toxic nitrogen gas with organic or inorganic electron donors 2 4 because in situ application of biological denitrification processes to underground aquifers does not require groundwater withdrawal it can reduce operational costs compared to other remediation technologies 5 schipper and vojvodic vukovic 6 succeeded in maintaining a 95 nitrate removal efficiency in a pilot scale plant for five years using an in situ heterotrophic denitrification process however clogging due to excessive growth of microorganisms might occur in a heterotrophic denitrification process in which organic compounds such as methanol 7 ethanol 8 and sucrose 9 are supplied as electron donors in addition secondary pollution caused by these compounds is a concern because of lower growth rates and the non toxicity of the electron donor an autotrophic denitrification process using hydrogen gas has been proposed 10 11 the operation is simple because only injection of hydrogen gas into the aquifer is necessary the electric power required in electrolysis to generate hydrogen gas could be provided by solar power given the advantages in terms of purification performance and cost this process has been considered one of the most promising and cost effective alternative methods for remediation of nitrate contaminated aquifers 12 13 however although long term continuous and stable removal performance of the technology should be demonstrated well before its application no previous study has achieved such performance to our knowledge in our prior studies 14 15 continuous experiments were conducted for more than 800 days and nitrate was reduced to nitrogen gas with slight accumulations of nitrite in the hydrogen injected zone but oxygen was supplied subsequently in a downstream oxygen injected zone resulting in the complete oxidation of nitrite to nitrate furthermore nitrous oxide n2o considered an intermediate product was not detected during the treatment the effectiveness of the in situ process with injection of hydrogen and oxygen gases was demonstrated experimentally however theoretical investigations had not been conducted fully those investigations are important for a quantitative analysis of the performance leading to proper management of the environmental technology in addition they may be helpful for design considerations when the system is scaled up in this study a mathematical model was developed to investigate the stable denitrification performance and the effects of varying molar ratio of nitrate loads to hydrogen gas injection on the model output of effluent water qualities such as nitrate and nitrite 2 methodology 2 1 long term denitrification and oxidation process a schematic of the experimental scale aquifer used for this study is shown in fig 1 the reactor consisted of custom made acrylic panels 1950 mm in length 25 mm in width and 780 mm in height packed with glass beads φ 2 mm as the carrier of microorganisms the total and effective liquid volumes of the reactor were 40 l and 16 l respectively sampling ports were arranged horizontally and vertically within 300 mm intervals concentrations of eight sampling points including influent and effluent were measured mixing three samples from ports located at a same distance from the inlet nitrate and nitrite were measured with ion chromatography hic 10 a shimadzu kyoto japan dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured with a do meter ud 1 central kagaku corp tokyo japan and a ph meter cyberscan ph 510 eutech instruments singapore respectively dissolved hydrogen dh concentration was measured by headspace method i e a water sample taken from the reactor was put in a bottle sealed with a butyl rubber septum and the bottle was placed after turning it upside down in a thermostatic chamber at 65 c for two hours to make an equilibrium condition between liquid and gas phases after that hydrogen concentration in the gas phase was measured with gas chromatography gc 8 a shimadzu kyoto japan and then dh concentration was calculated using henry s law synthetic groundwater was fed and withdrawn through five lines in total with peristaltic pumps the synthetic groundwater contained nano3 at 15 06 mg n l 1 k2hpo4 at 1 76 mg l 1 kh2po4 at 2 08 mg l 1 nacl at 0 96 mg l 1 fecl3 6h2o at 1 92 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o at 4 00 mg l 1 cacl2 at 1 12 mg l 1 with inorganic carbon ic as nahco3 or co2 at 101 mg c l 1 15 pumps were not set in two withdrawal lines to keep the groundwater flow rates of the influent and effluent constant the effluent from the aquifer was discharged through an overflow weir to maintain the water level hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced using a solid polymer electrolyte membrane electrode 16 and injected using peristaltic pumps from the bottoms located at 0 45 m and 1 45 m from the inlet respectively to avoid the growth of algae the aquifer and every tube were covered with a light shielding curtain or aluminum foil the apparatus was placed in a temperature maintained chamber 20 2 c details regarding the start up can be found elsewhere 15 during the start up of the reactor 13 3 mg l 1 of nitrate was fed 360 ml d 1 of h2 gas was injected and the flowrate was maintained at 0 29 m d 1 after steady denitrification performance was achieved three phases of operation were performed as shown in table 1 phase i started on day 343 when the h2 gas injection volume was increased until an injection volume of 580 ml d 1 was attained to improve the performance of denitrification in the aquifer while the flowrate was maintained at 0 29 m d 1 the molar ratio of influent nitrate load to h2 gas injection or n h ratio in phase 1 was regarded as the base for the subsequent phases the n h ratio was controlled by the flowrate and the h2 gas injection volume not by the influent nitrate concentration after 36 weeks of operation during phase 1 the h2 gas injection volume was decreased suddenly to examine the resilience of the reactor to unexpected gas injection failure phase 2 started on day 777 when the normalized n h ratio was increased to1 3 to determine whether an accumulation of a toxic denitrification intermediate nitrite would be observed in addition to examine the effects of a higher load of nitrate the normalized n h ratio was further increased stepwise on days 808 828 and 850 until the maximum ratio of 2 2 was reached phase 3 started on day 868 when the normalized n h ratio was decreased to 1 6 after which the flowrate and h2 gas injection volume were decreased stepwise to the same condition as in phase 1 to determine whether the aquifer effluent quality could be recovered 2 2 mathematical model advection dispersion transport and biochemical reaction mechanisms were incorporated into a one dimensional model concentrations and gas diffusion were assumed to be uniform with width and depth in the experimental apparatus the zones influenced by h2 or o2 gas covered lengths of 10 cm each from the injection point i e 20 cm in total the microbial biofilms attached to the glass beads occupied no physical space in the model and mass transfer resistance through biofilms was neglected influent nitrate concentrations were set as constant in the model the initial and boundary conditions were determined based on data obtained at the beginning of the experiment average values of influent concentrations or assumed to be specific values i e all substrate utilization rates and growth rates were set at 0 concentrations of bacteria were set at 10 mg l 1 horizontal flow rates and gas injection volumes were inputs of the model and the values were changed according to the operating condition horizontal flow rates and gas injection volumes were inputs of the model and the values were changed according to the experimental condition table 1 the

model and experimental results of effluent quality of nitrate and nitrite after day 500 are shown in fig 2 good fits of the model to the experimental data were obtained for both nitrate and nitrite during phase 1 during this phase h2 gas injection volume was decreased suddenly at around day 600 effluent nitrate concentration consequently increased but attained its original state after the injection volume was resumed the model responded quickly to this situation indicating that the model was resilient to rapid change of gas injection volume meanwhile nitrite was not observed in the effluent during phase 1 including the short period of h2 gas injection failures demonstrating that the model suppressed the accumulation of nitrite during phase 2 the normalized n h ratio was increased to 2 2 which was more than double the loading of the condition in phase 1 as the normalized n h ratio was increased effluent nitrate concentrations increased which was shown in the model as

14502,over the last few decades the presence of micropollutants in the wastewater stream is imposing a serious concern worldwide membrane bioreactor mbr technology has been widely employed for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with micropollutants hence the aim of this paper is to provide a consolidate review on the present state of research and advancement in mbr technology along with its augmentation with other wastewater treatment technologies for micropollutant removal sustainability and operating cost assessment for its feasibility the potential application of mbr and hybrid mbr systems in micropollutant removal along with the fate removal mechanism various factors affecting the mbr system efficiency and the operational cost involved were also been discussed in detail further based on the available technologies on mbr the authors discussed the future research perspective for micropollutant removal from the effluent stream with an objective of the circular economy keywords membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment micropollutant removal hybrid mbr systems 1 introduction for the past few decades the available water sources are getting depleted worldwide due to numerous factors including agricultural and industrial activities urbanization climate change population growth and incessant consumption of water these have resulted in the need to explore new sources of water worldwide 1 agricultural and industrial activities and domestic usage of fresh water generate wastewater containing micropollutants when it is discharged into the aquatic environment without proper treatment leading to serious environmental and human health concerns 2 3 micropollutants are a vast group of chemical substances found in the environment at very low concentrations ngl 1 μgl 1 these substances include synthetic organic compounds namely pesticides personal care cosmetic products industrial chemicals food additives and detergents and some naturally occurring substances such as estrogens they create detrimental effects on ecosystems and pollute drinking water resources even when present at trace concentrations 2 over 100 000 chemicals have been labeled as micropollutants by the european union eu and out of which 30 000 70 000 chemicals are used daily for various activities 3 although some regions countries including the eu and canada have implemented some regulations for the discharge of water wastewater containing micropollutants into the environment 4 6 there are no strict standards set until now for the discharge of these pollutants the eu has recently listed 45 priority substances enlisting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs phthalates pesticides metals and endocrine disruptors that act as a threat to the environment directive 2013 39

pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and steroid hormones are not yet enlisted in the general pollutants micropollutants are known to be toxic and bioaccumulate due to their persistent nature however it is important to study the biological effects of these compounds in detail to set regulatory limits for such compounds furthermore environmental protection organizations and scientific research communities must take into account the synergistic or antagonistic effects of these pollutants for understanding their actual impact on human health and environment moreover suitable wastewater treatment and recycling by appropriate methods can limit their release into the environment in this context the conventional activated sludge processes casp employed at wastewater treatment plants wwtps are inefficient in completely eliminating the micropollutants because these are mainly designed to eliminate simple organic matter and nutrients from the wastewater 8 further wwtps are not well equipped to monitor the levels of micropollutants in the source wastewater 9 hence there is a need to re design the casp system in wwtps for a better handling and control of the micropollutants some modifications such as change in the operating conditions e g hydraulic retention time supplementation with inorganic nutrients vigorous mixing aeration addition of surfactants and bioaugumentation have been suggested towards this objective 10 but the outcomes are not that satisfactory for the removal of micropollutants 11 post treatment techniques mainly physicochemical techniques such as adsorption on activated carbon nanofiltration nf advanced oxidation processes aops based techniques including photo catalytic degradation photo oxidation and ozonation have also been tested for micropollutant removal 12 these approaches are unattractive owing to one or other limitations like high energy demand high investment cost use of harsh environmental conditions secondary sludge disposal problem requirement of toxic chemicals etc further micropollutants are present in the various aquatic environments including wastewater surface water groundwater and drinking water 13 also based on the nature of micropollutants conventional vs modern treatment techniques employed in mbr technology and recent developments in mbr and mbr integrated systems are elaborated finally typical case studies pertaining to mbr for micropollutants removal and cost analysis for operating mbr are also presented 2 occurrence of micropollutants and their impact on the environment 2 1 occurrence of micropollutants in wastewater and surface water table 1 and fig 1 present the list of regularly detected micropollutants along with their average concentration in wastewater and surface water the concentration of these compounds in wastewater may fluctuate because of different factors including production rate sales and usage of products per capita water consumption day and excretion rate climatic conditions 14 the manufacturing and utilization of products consisting of micropollutants also decide the quantity of micropollutants that reaches the wwtps 15 2 2 occurrence of micropollutants in groundwater and drinking water contamination of groundwater with micropollutants is mostly caused by sewer systems seepage of septic tanks interaction between ground and surface water through soil landfill leachate and permeation of contaminated water from agricultural lands micropollutants levels are found to be low in ground water as compared to that of surface water 16 most commonly found micropollutants in the ground water are triclosan sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs these compounds are also prevalent in surface water and wastewater which confirms an association of the occurrence of micropollutants in various water bodies 17 2 3 impact of micropollutants on the environment most of the micropollutants are considered as very harmful to the ecosystem including aquatic species causes genotoxicity estrogenicity and mutagenicity wild animals and humans due to their bioaccumulative and non biodegradable nature for instance the feminization of male fish was induced by the exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds edcs 7 9 an incessant discharge of edcs in the environment leads to reproductive and developmental abnormalities of highly sensitive species even at a low concentration in addition augmentation of antibiotic resistant organisms in the environment proves to be an additional risk the ever increasing and indiscriminant use of antibiotics to improve the health of humans and animals have led to the evolution of antibiotic resistant genes at several environmental matrices the discharge of micropollutants in the ecosystem is expected to further increase in the future due to population growth and strong reliance on pharmaceutics 3 micropollutant removal from wastewater various physico chemical and biological treatment technologies were investigated for the removal of micropollutant from the water several physico chemical methods viz coagulation flocculation adsorption and advanced oxidation process are reported to perform sufficiently well in treating micropollutants however chemical treatment methods are employed mostly where the biological treatment techniques fail this is because the biological treatment methods like activated sludge constructed wetland membrane bioreactor are cost effective and environmentally benign treatment technologies for the micropollutant removal from wastewater in recent times some hybrid techniques combining the biological and physico chemical methods came into existence and have opened new ways for treating the wastewater containing micropollutant in an exceptionally great way therefore the present section gives an overview of the aforementioned technologies for the treatment of wastewater containing micropollutants 3 1 physico chemical treatment 3 1 1 coagulation flocculation in this method colloidal particles often called as coagulants are utilized to remove the micropollutants by adsorption which ultimately settles down as flocs in general coagulation flocculation removes suspended solids and organic matter present in wastewater by the addition of metals salts or metal hydroxides iron or aluminum based salts micropollutants are adsorbed onto metal hydroxide or onto the flocs produced during this process and collected in the form of sludge for further disposal or treatment 18 the physicochemical properties of a micropollutant determine its adsorption onto metal hydroxide or onto the flocs in general hydrophobic pollutants are better treated by the coagulation flocculation technique the sorption of hydrophobic micropollutants was predicted by its octanol water partition coefficient kow many micropollutants such as musks polycyclic aromatic compounds and humic acid can be satisfactorily removed by this process the main disadvantage of this process is that micropollutants with a low sorption potential for coagulants colloids formed during this process are not removed well 18 19 3 1 2 pollutant removal by activated carbon adsorption pollutant removal by activated carbons acs takes place through the process of adsorption wherein the pollutant gets diffused onto the surface and thereafter onto the pores of the activated carbon since the pollutants are removed by diffusion process hydrophobic pollutants such as toluene and chlorinated solvents show better removal efficiency than the hydrophilic or highly water soluble pollutants 20 various pollutants that are adsorbed by acs include xenobiotic compounds pharmaceutically active compounds endocrine disrupting compounds edcs and other refractory organics pollutant removal by acs depends on various factors such as particle size ph of the pollutant containing wastewater concentration and molecular weight of the pollutant adsorbent dose and presence of other co contaminants in the wastewater for instance vyrides et al 20 reported that acs with an average size less than 0 25 mm adsorbed 98 of micropollutant whereas those with an average size of 0 75 mm yielded only up to 50 cod removal the high removal efficiency at small size of acs is due to the large surface area and low diffusion resistance than those at a large particle size 3 2 advanced oxidation processes aops complete mineralization or transformation of pollutants to their less toxic forms can be achieved by chemical oxidation processes among the different chemical oxidation processes aops are proven to be the most effective in generating hydroxyl radicals oh thereby causing the degradation of organic pollutants present in wastewater an important feature of aops is its non selective nature in oxidizing the pollutants for instance micropollutants ranging from the most complex form to the simplest single ring organic molecule can be degraded at a very high reaction rate finally leaving inorganic ions co2 and h2o as the final products 19 21 the main disadvantage of aops is the presence of hydroxyl scavenging species carbohydrates proteins or inorganic ions like sulfide bicarbonate and carbonate in wastewater which leads to scarcity of available free oxidants for pollutant degradation and ultimately reduces the pollutant removal efficiency 3 3 biological treatment systems 3 3 1 treating aerobic anaerobic and facultative bacteria micropollutant degradation by bacteria depends on various factors such as contact time microbial community and bioavailability of the pollutants to hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms etc 1 2 studies on bacterial degradation of diverse micropollutants such as bisphenol a nonylphenol polycyclic aromatic organics and many other pharmaceutical compounds have been reported by many researchers 7 22 the removal efficiency of micropollutants by these bacteria varies within the range of 60 100 depending on the concentration of micropollutants and hydraulic retention time of the wastewater wastewater containing beta blockers an endocrine disrupting compound was treated with these aerobic and anaerobic treatments and its removal efficiency was less when compared to the other class of micropollutants 1 3 3 2 constructed wetland a feasible biological system for treating micropollutant wastewater is based on constructed wetland which is designed engineered and operated under controlled environment so as to mimic the natural wetlands in a constructed wetland the pollutant removal takes place by the combination integration of three main processes such as biodegradation a biological process adsorption a physicochemical process and oxidation a chemical process all the three processes occur amid plants substrate and soil 23 in this removal process using constructed wetlands soil plays a major role by providing proper support material and nutrients for the plant growth it further acts as a matrix for the microbial growth and metabolism 24 3 3 3 membrane bioreactor mbr membrane bioreactors are considered as the most recent technology for the treatment of wastewater containing micropollutants and they can be made compact based on the volume of water that needs to be treated furthermore treatment efficiency using a mbr is higher than the other biological systems due to a very high microbial population in the immediate vicinity of the membrane surface ensuring the complete removal of pollutant before the wastewater gets filtered through the membrane in addition due to the membrane sieving effect pollutants with a molecular weight greater than the molecular weight cut off of the membranes are retained thereby bringing it in contact with the degrading microorganisms inside the mbr for its complete degradation 19 details of the different membrane bioreactors strategies to improve this upcoming technology and operating cost assessment are provided in a separate section of this paper 3 3 4 hybrid reactor system hybrid reactor systems are very well suited for treating wastewater containing micropollutants of different nature in this system biological treatment is followed by chemical processes or vice versa based on the treatment requirements biological system comprising of either aerobic or anaerobic systems are found to be suitable for treating edcs and pharmaceutical compounds activated carbon based adsorption method is effective in removing micropollutants such as pesticides antibiotics and analgesics mbr process is efficient to treat wastewater with micropollutants even at an elevated concentration wherein the other treatment techniques particularly the constructed wetland is found to be ineffective 19 25 thus a combination of these methods called hybrid treatment systems can be applied for treating wastewater containing micropollutants for e g a hybrid system using mbr followed by oxidation process is beneficial for the complete removal of edcs and pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater similarly oxidation followed by a biological treatment system is found to be effective yielding nearly 100 removal efficiency in treating wastewater containing beta blockers and pesticides 19 21 25 4 mbrs for micropollutant removal 4 1 micropollutant removal using mbr system over the past two decades membrane bioreactors mbrs have been designed and operated for treatment of a variety of pollutants such as particulates carbonaceous substances nutrients and pathogenic microorganisms 26 compared with these pollutants which can be removed easily by conventional methods the removal of certain other pollutants particularly the micropollutants pharmaceuticals personal care products steroid hormones surfactants industrially generated chemicals etc is often very different therefore examination of the fate and removal of micropollutants during wastewater treatment is very much crucial for any of the treatment process to avoid their discharge into the environment 27 in this section characterization and different removal processes utilizing mbrs with a focus on the fate and mechanism of micropollutant removal are discussed membrane bioreactor mbr systems seem to be promising under this scenario due to their several advantages including high performance efficiency compared to conventional activated sludge treatment plant casp less space requirement environment friendliness therefore it has been recognized as a key technology for water reuse and recycling in many developed and developing countries 28 mbr is a hybrid process integrating the membrane technique with biological treatment which enables casp to be operated as a single step process by avoiding the need for a secondary clarifier fig 2 compares the conventional wastewater treatment process with that employing mbr technology also table 2 enlists various advantageous and limitations of mbr system for micropollutant removal in general mbr system is categorized into two kinds in accordance with the configuration 1 submerged membrane bioreactor smbr and 2 side stream membrane bioreactor fig 2 shows a brief schematic of mbr system earlier the side stream mbr was developed where the membrane module is placed outside the bioreactor for the recirculation pump due to its high energy consumption in 1980s submerged mbr system was further developed where the membrane module was submerged within the bioreactor thus permitting the effluent to pass through with sludge retention in a smbr aeration maintains the activated sludge in suspended mode limiting the membrane fouling fig 3 represents different types of membrane fouling mechanism within a mbr system for determining the fouling mechanism associated with the microfiltration of the membrane system hermia s fouling models viz a complete b standard c intermediate pore blocking and d cake filtration models are applied 44 in complete pore blocking the size of the solute particle is larger than the pore size of the filtration membrane leading to surface pore blocking and not block inside pores of the membrane standard pore blocking takes place because of the non uniform pore paths whereas the intermediate pore blocking occurs when the solute particle size and membrane pore size are nearly same 45 cake filtration is related to the state where particles bigger than the average pore size mount up on the surface of the membrane thus forming a cake the potential features of mbr plants such as high efficiency of separation solid liquid and high concentration of biomass compared to those with casp tanks affect the cell metabolism and bacterial environment which restricts the growth and thereby the sludge production mbrs have gained more interest in the last decade mainly due to the significant reduction in the cost of membranes and the energy requirements during its development process 46 mbr and mbr associated systems e g mbr with reverse osmosis ro microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf are being developed for the removal of micropollutants from wastewater prior to their discharge into the environment fig 4 in mbr plants separation of solids biological sludge from the treated wastewater can be achieved by membrane filtration using uf mf with pore sizes in the range 0 01 0 1 μm moreover if permeated water through the mbr system contains some viruses and dissolved organic compounds these can be eliminated using dense membrane processes called nf ro before reusing the water 47 typically the integrated processes of mbr technology combined with ro nf system is employed to obtain water suitable for drinking purposes and irrigation applications with reduced salinity 48 mbrs are adopted for the treatment of almost all classes of micropollutants such as edcs pharmaceutical compounds pesticides etc removal efficiency of 15 endocrine disrupting compounds each at a concentration in the range 1 5 μg l 1 by mbr technology varied between 92 and 99 for each of these compounds 25 personal care products pcps such as salicylic acid and propyl paraben were completely removed using an mbr system removal efficiencies of 99 97 and 70 80 were obtained for triclosan atenolol and beta blockers respectively using this system 49 however in case of treating wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds a mixed performance is observed by using mbr technology for example antibiotics ofloxacin sulfamethaxazole and erythromycin and analgesics lorazepam citalopram ibuprofen carbamazepine and primidone were removed with an efficiency in the range 75 95 using this technology 1 however in the case of many other pharmaceutical compounds the removal efficiency is not satisfactory overall the removal efficiency of different micropollutants using mbr system follows the order endocrine disrupting compounds beta blockers pharmaceutical compounds pesticides 19 25 34 the mbr processes and integrated mbr systems for the removal of micropollutants have been described in the literature by several authors the micropollutants removal using mbr and mbr integrated systems is influenced by various factors which have not been elaborated in the available literature these factors include microbial community structure its activities and effect on mbr performance and fouling effect of operating conditions on removal efficiency integrated mbr systems and hybrid processes for micropollutant removal therefore this review aims to summarize and evaluate all those factors affecting micropollutants removal using mbr processes and integrated mbr system 4 2 different integrated mbr systems and hybrid processes for micropollutant removal integrated approaches involving mbrs with some other processes such as advanced oxidation process aops membrane distillation process bio entrapped membrane bioreactor granular mbrs etc are of recent focus as these combined processes improve permeate quality mitigates membrane fouling problem and enhance the treatment efficiency fig 5 presents a brief schematic of different types of integrated mbr systems that were already been utilized for wastewater treatment 4 2 1 advanced oxidation processes aops mbr aops are generally recognized for their capability to remove various organic pollutants from wastewater by converting it to easily biodegradable intermediates however suspended solids present in waste stream acts as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals is a major problem 50 in this mbr plays a vital role in removing the suspended solids from effluents for improving the efficiency of degradation process the integrated aop mbr process totally depends upon the amount of biodegradable organics and recalcitrant pollutants present in the wastewater if biodegradable organics are less in comparison with recalcitrant pollutants aops are used prior to the biological treatment step and vice versa in case of more biodegradable organics than recalcitrant organics in the wastewater 51 laera et al 51 examined the removal of simulated wastewater containing nalidixic acid utilized in treating urinary tract infection by integrating a mbr system with either uv h2o2 or ozonation process and by including chemical oxidation in the recirculation stream of the mbr since mbr system alone was inefficient to treat the wastewater integrating it with ozonation completely removed all the intermediate metabolites during the chemical oxidation in a similar study by mascolo et al 52 the degradation of acyclovir from pharmaceutical wastewater was achieved by integrating mbr with ozonation process the ozonation reactor was kept in the recycling mode of the mbr effluent and showed a removal efficiency of 99 in the final effluent qu et al 53 reported a high quality effluent by integrating thermophilic submerged aerobic membrane bioreactor and electrochemical oxidation technology for treating paper and pulp effluent giacobbo et al 54 evaluated an integrated approach involving mbr photoelectrooxidation for tannery wastewater treatment and using this approach biological oxygen demand bod present in the wastewater was completely removed by the mbr whereas chemical oxygen demand cod was removed by photoelectrooxidation process in another study lopez et al 55 reported the permeate effluent from a mbr system as ready to use high quality water integrating it with solar photo catalysis with mbr system for treating pesticide containing wastewater integrating the electrocoagulation technique with mbr system is also shown to be useful for the removal of organic pollutants and inorganics from wastewater stream fig 5 during electrocoagulation metal ions are generated at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode which further assists in easy removal of the flocculated particles by skimming from the surface 56 vijaykumar and balasubramanian 57 used aluminum as anode and stainless steel as cathode in an electrocoagulation setup integrated with mbr for heavy metal removal chromium copper and zinc with a removal efficiency of 90 the integrated system improved both the permeate flux and the membrane life fard et al 58 integrated electrocoagulation electrofenton and electron fenton processes with mbr system and reported a zero excess sludge generation the aops aided in overcoming the membrane fouling problem thereby a longer membrane life and its performance were achieved 4 2 2 reverse osmosis and forward osmosis membrane system membrane bioreactor in combination with osmotic techniques is found to be better in producing quality water with low energy consumption 50 in the conventional mbr system the removal of some trace recalcitrant organic micropollutants that are hydrophobic by adsorption onto suspended solids in wastewater which retain the contaminants inside the bioreactor for their biodegradation is difficult 59 a study performed by ogawa et al 14 reported that no major variation in the permeate water quality obtained from the nanofiltration and ro membranes in mbr for treating municipal wastewater since very less fouling occurred during its operation 50 de jager et al 60 achieved 75 cod removal and 94 turbidity removal 12 admi american dye manufacturing index lower limit of potable water 17 admi from textile effluent by employing a pilot scale dual stage mbr system incorporated with an ultrafiltration membrane farias et al 61 found that an increase in the sludge retention time srt resulted in an enhanced removal of carbohydrates from municipal wastewater which however increased the ro membrane fouling moreover improved removal efficiency was achieved by operating forward osmosis fo at a low hydraulic pressure 50 tan et al 62 examined the effect of silver nanoparticles on the performance of an osmotic mbr comprising of cellulose triacetate fo membrane for treatment of synthetic municipal wastewater the results demonstrated that the inclusion of silver nanoparticle reduced the nitrifying efficiency with the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps which led to foul the membrane 63 both the sludge quality and membrane fouling played a vital role on the performance of ombr system in addition low water flux and accumulation of salts are two major disadvantages of the ombr system 50 praveen et al 64 utilized the forward osmotic hollow fiber mbr fohfmbr with pseudomonas putida for treating high strength saline phenolic wastewater in this study the membrane was successfully regenerated through osmotic backwashing which reduces the membrane fouling problem ding et al 65 reported an enhancement in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater by using integrated anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr with forward osmosis fo systems the permeate flux was declined with an increase in the temperature from 25 c to 35 c due to reduced microbial growth this resulted in accumulation of membrane foulants cornelissen et al 66 integrated ro and fo systems for wastewater treatment in which the fo was utilized for pumping the wastewater while ro was used for the separation and recycling the draw water it was proposed that ro membrane is cost effective in comparison with fo membrane although the latter achieved better recovery as it is not limited by osmotic gradient moreover fo system requires less energy in comparison with ro furthermore for enhanced treatment efficiency over prolonged treatment time it is recommended to bioaugment the system with salt tolerant microbes or follows shorter srt 4 2 3 granular mbr aerobic granular sludge systems are currently utilized for treating wastewater with high content of organic 67 68 these systems are efficient to perform simultaneous nitrification and denitrification inside the granules due to its compact spherical structure 50 vijayalayan et al 69 reported the treatment of synthetic wastewater by combining sequencing batch airlift reactor sbar with membrane airlift bioreactor mabr in sbar the aerobic granules were cultivated for handling both nitrification high aeration and denitrification low aeration whereas in mabr both aerobic and anoxic zones exist a reduction in the membrane fouling was observed due to the granular sludge cultivated in the integrated system zhao et al 11 reported the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps using an aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor the integrated system provides good removal of cod ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus along with rapid but unstable sludge granules in another report li et al 70 examined anammox anaerobic ammonia oxidation granules formation and evaluated its performance using a submerged anaerobic mbr under complete mixing and continuous feeding condition removal efficiency upto 88 of total nitrogen content was achieved in the system and the granules showed excellent activity high resistance to shock loadings rapid growth rate besides the system was found to operate with minimum fouling for wastewater 4 2 4 membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr this type of integrated system uses a combination of thermophilic bioprocess along with membrane distillation process 50 both hydrophobic and microporous membrane produces water vapor across the thermal gradient generating the quality water in comparison with the mbr system mdbr is capable of achieving excellent organic removal efficiency for municipal wastewater recuperation along with reduced sludge generation 71 moreover it is cost effective mitigates membrane fouling and achieves high performance 72 wijekoon et al 73 examined the performance of mdbr for the removal of trace organic contaminants trocs representing pharmaceutical and personal care products and achieved a very high removal of the pollutants the removal of trocs was attributed to biodegradation rejection by membrane distillation and adsorption onto the sludge also removal efficiency of total organic carbon and total nitrogen was 99 and 96 respectively by utilizing only the mbr system compounds such as carbamazepine and diclofenac could not be removed efficiently phattaranawik et al 74 reported very good removal efficiency of micropollutants from organic wastewater using mdbr along with a reduction in toc reduced greenhouse gas emissions and salt concentration as compared with mbr ro integrated system in another study mdbr system with rubrobacter and caldalkalibacillus sp employed was used to treat synthetic wastewater 75 thus mdbr system can be utilized for the efficient removal of persistent organic compounds from high temperature wastewater 4 2 5 biofilm bio entrapped membrane bioreactor in biofilm mbr the addition of biosupport inside the mbr minimizes suspended solid concentration which in turn reduces the fouling of the membrane leyva diaz et al 76 examined the performance of biofilm mbr containing carriers under two different conditions anoxic and aerobic for nitrification and denitrification of wastewater respectively in both the cases the system yielded a better efficiency than mbr without carrier subtil et al 77 reported the enhanced removal efficiency of ammonia and total nitrogen and reduction in the membrane fouling rate using a bio film mbr system yang et al 38 compared the performance of biofilm mbr with that of a conventional mbr and reported an enhanced removal of ammonical nitrogen and total nitrogen from wastewater specific oxygen utilization rate sour in the system showed a greater microbial activity in the biofilm mbr ng et al 78 compared two different integrated process i e bioentrapped membrane reactor bemr and salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor msmbr for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment in bemr activated sludge entrapped in its bio carriers was used however it could not tolerate the hypersaline conditions whereas the msmbr was able to efficiently degrade persistent compounds with reduced membrane fouling table 3 represents the different types of mbr and hybrid mbr systems utilized for micropollutant removal 4 3 micropollutant removal mechanism using mbr system the removal of micropollutants from wastewater by a mbr system is due to the physical retention by membrane biodegradation air stripping sorption and photo transformation 79 80 for apolar pollutants sorption followed by membrane retention of the solids is the main mechanism involved for its removal whereas for polar pollutants biodegradation is the prime mechanism and sorption is very limited 1 when the size of micropollutants is much lower than the pore size of microfiltration membrane limited area for sorption is available however the sorption of micropolluatants occurs due to the formation of an additional secondary layer by the deposition of micropollutants 45 81 while the highly volatile trace organic from the wastewater is removed by air stripping volatilization and is considered insignificant as the majority of the pollutants have a henry constant 0 005 82 for hydrophobic pollutants the biosorption occurs on to the activated sludge and for hydrophilic pollutants it is primarily followed by the biodegradation 83 further the participation of numerous degraded intermediate byproducts metabolites imposes its negative impact on the removal mechanism by biodegradation and sorption 84 4 3 1 sorption in this phenomenon the pollutants make association with the solid phases activated sludge few pollutants get sorbed into the sludge while most of them remain as it is for quantifying the sorption of micropollutants the solid water distribution coefficient k d plays an vital role and is defined as the pollutant concentration present in the solid to concentration present in the aqueous phase at equilibrium 37 k d l kg 1 value at equilibrium can be expressed by the equation 1 85 1 k d c s o r b e d x s s s s o lub l e where c sorbed sorbed compound μg l 1 x ss concentration of the suspended solid in wastewater kg l 1 and s soluble concentration of the soluble part of the compound μg l 1 the two major mechanisms resulting in the sorption of a pollutant into the primary and secondary activated sludge are adsorption electrostatic interaction of positively charged groups of micropollutants with the negatively charged surface of microbes 37 and absorption hydrophobic interactions of pollutants with the lipophilic cell membrane of the microorganisms and the lipid fractions of the sludge 39 absorption is characterized by the octanol water partition coefficient kow value 39 micropollutants other than hormones and musk fragrances e g galaxolide and tanolide have a kd value less than 500 l kg 1 and hence sorption is minimum 86 a low log kow value also infers about the sorption phenomena indicating the hydrophobicity of the pollutants and hence is first sorbed in the activated sludge followed by biodegradation 87 normally the kd value is a bit higher in the primary sludge in comparison with activated sludge clearly depicting the inhibition in the primary sludge 4 3 2 biodegradation biodegradation is a well known biological phenomenon where microbes are capable of degrading the micropollutants and are dependent on the redox conditions prevailing in the contaminated aqueous system 39 88 89 it is the most important phenomena for the micropollutant removal in a mbr system and follows the pseudo first order degradation kinetics eq 2 3 2 d c d t k b i o l x s s s s o lub l e where c concentration of the micropollutant μg l 1 ssoluble concentration of the soluble part of the micropollutant μg l 1 kbiol pseudo first order reaction rate constant l gss 1 day 1 and xss concentration of the suspended solid gss l 1 and t time day since the aerobic conditions are much favorable to microbes microbial consortia present inside the mbr system it is also favorable conditions for biodegradation the removal efficiency of ibuprofen acetaminophen fenoprofen 17α ethynylestradiol fenofibric acid roxithromycine and tonalide was reported to be greater than 80 in the mbr sludge 98 90 a similar negative charge between anti inflammatory drugs and activated sludge makes the sorption limited and making the biodegradation as the chief removal phenomenon 85 furthermore micropollutants such as carbamazepine diazepam indomethacin are few lipid regulators and beta blockers are persistent compounds which showed a very least biodegradation 20 and hence the washout of such pollutants will also be a menace during continuous mbr operation 43 91 henceforth mbr systems having a high srt for naproxen diclofenac mefenamic acid gemofibrozil and indomethacin were reported as a viable option for such kind of cases 90 according to kbiol value for musk fragrances both sorption and biodegradation were responsible for their removal 91 in addition the difference in the biodegradation removal rate is totally dependent on the sludge origin sludge age wastewater composition microbial consortium and aeration 92 4 3 3 stripping volatilization stripping involves the gaseous pollutant removal from the aerobic wwtps containing micropollutants the stripping is mainly dependent on vapor pressure of wastewater i e henry s constant h and hydrophobicity 1 as majority of the micropollutants have their very low value of h log kow value kow octanol water partition coefficient practically the phenomenon is insignificant volatilization is significant when h value is high 39 50 93 and the same is calculated by the below expression 94 3 b i s t r i p p e d c i a i r q a i r q h c i d i s s a e r q q where bi stripped amount of pollutant i removed μg d 1 ci air concentration of pollutant i in gas phase μg

is insignificant for pharmaceuticals 82 and estrogens 27 because of low h value and hydrophobicity though celestolide is considerably removed by air stripping 27 4 4 factors affecting mbr efficiency for micropollutants removal various aspects are responsible for the effectiveness of a mbr system for micropollutants removal from wastewater biological factors that affect the operation of a mbr are as follows age of the sludge and its concentration aerobic anaerobic or anoxic environment prevailing in the membrane compartments wastewater constituents and other physical parameters such as temperature ph and conductivity physicochemical properties of the micropollutants operating conditions of mbr characteristics of the wastewater ph organic matter concentration and ionic strength and membrane characteristics are also among the prime factors responsible for affecting the mbr wastewater treatment efficiency 4 4 1 molecular weight and complexity of micropollutants physicochemical properties of the micropollutants highly affect the performance of a mbr system 83 micropollutants such as estrone and 17α ethynylestradiol were removed upto 80 and 99 respectively in a bench top mbr system 83 95 96 bo et al 86 showed a removal efficiency of 8 38 for diclofenac with srt in between 20 48 days whereas clofibric acid was removed considerably after acclimatization of microbes to the activated sludge 86 with an increase in the srt micropollutants such as ketoprofen and naproxen possessing double aromatic rings depicted an enhanced removal using mbr system due to the presence of diverse microbial population which is acclimatization and able to degrade the aromatic rings although it is difficult to correlate the removal efficiency and compound complexity but usually it can be accomplished that aliphatic monocyclic aromatic compounds having electron donating group are readily biodegraded whereas polycyclic compounds having electron withdrawing group are difficult to degrade in comparison 27 97 4 4 2 operating conditions various literatures reported the effect of different operating conditions that lead to increase decrease mbr efficiency in relation with the micropollutant removal effluent quality membrane fouling energy utilization etc these conditions are discussed in detail below 4 4 2 1 sludge retention time amongst the most significant parameters for mbr operation srt is an important factor during wastewater filtration as it controls membrane fouling srt may be defined as the average time period for which the activated solid sludge is retained in the mbr system 39 in mbr treatment can be performed with high srt various studies have reported the enhanced micropollutants removal with an increase in the srt 81 94 kimura et al 98 reported an enhancement in acidic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by increasing srt from 15 days to 65 days a boost in the removal from 83 99 and 50 82 for ketoprofen and clofibric acid respectively was reported similarly for 17α ethynylestradiol 11 increase in the removal efficiency was achieved by increasing srt more than 20 days 94 high srt enhances the removal efficiency of micropollutants lowers the sludge yield and improves the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration though for the majority of micropollutants srt between 20 and 30 days is sufficient for their removal in mbr system 1 however a high energy input is needed for the viscous mlss in order to decrease the membrane fouling furthermore a high srt beyond critical point leads to severe fouling and ageing of the membrane also for pharmaceutical wastewater the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt was evaluated using a bench top scale mbr system 86 4 4 2 2 effect of ph for a mbr system containing ionisable micropollutants ph plays a significant part in the removal efficiency 99 ph ranging between 6 7 is generally suggested for the biological treatment tadkaew et al 99 reported the effect of mixed liquor ph in between 5 9 for selected micropollutants it was found that sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac were ionisable ph dependent maximum removal was obtained at ph 5 when compared to less acidic conditions whereas for pharmaceutical wastewater containing ibuprofen clofibric acid and diclofenac the removal was efficient at acidic ph 100 101 due to the hydrophobicity of these compounds at ph 5 the removal of bisphenol a and carbamazepine was comparatively independent and not affected by the mixed liquor ph 99 although bisphenol a showed a better removal than carbamazepine due to its hydrophobic nature further the alteration of ph and hrt did not improve the removal efficiency 86 whereas ibuprofen was degraded under neutral and acidic ph at low ph conditions the biodegradation of clofibric acid was reduced due to decline in the microbial activity in addition the functional groups of the compounds play a major role in determining the removal efficiency 27 for example hormone possessing phenolic and hydroxyl groups dissociates at a ph above their pka value resulting in enhanced charge repulsion between the microbial surface sludge and the membrane thereby reduces the adsorption and removal efficiency 4 4 2 3 effect of redox conditions by performing the mbr at diverse redox conditions results in high microbial variety and activity suarez et al 94 reported a significant amount of biodegradation of certain micropollutants naproxen 17α ethynylestradiol and ibuprofen under aerobic conditions whereas some compounds galaxolide and tonalide can be degraded under both aerobic and anoxic conditions many literatures have reported that anoxic conditions are capable enough for removal of micropollutants from wastewater 102 for example under anoxic conditions 95 of diuron biodegradation was achieved in comparison with only 60 using aerobic conditions 94 nitrification showed a partial removal of micropollutants such as gemfibrozil diclofenac bezafibrate and ketoprofen a high srt in mbr system also enables the enrichment of nitrifying bacteria resulting in removal of certain trace micropollutants 103 4 4 2 4 effect of temperature it is well established that microorganism growth and activity are affected by the change in temperature 33 although most of the micropollutant removal using mbr system takes place at room temperature such as ibuprofen acetaminophen bezafibrate and naproxen 42 insignificant variation in the removal efficiency was observed for both carbamazepine and diclofenac at room temperature 104 the removal of most hydrophobic micropollutants in a mbr system log dow 3 2 was stable at ph 8 with working temperature of 20 c to 35 c while raising the temperature upto 45 c a clear decline in the removal rate was observed this decline in the removal efficiency can be attributed to the decrease in the metabolic activity and sludge disintegration in addition an enhancement in the soluble microbial products smp was noticed with increasing the temperature from 20 c to 45 c which further leads to membrane fouling 33 in some cases the temperature in the range of 18 23 c had an encouraging outcome for antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin atenolol ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole removal 94 105 4 5 operating cost of mbr system despite the fact that mbr system involves the energy operation yet not any substantial study was involved for its energy consumption 37 although cost of membrane decreased considerably 106 globally the market for mbr system valued around 425 7 million 2014 and is expected to touch 777 7 million 2019 with an annual growth rate of 12 8 1 usually the mbr system depends on different factors but its operating cost is usually higher than the conventional activated sludge process because much energy is required for the aeration around 60 70 of the overall price to reduce the membrane fouling 30 107 the total energy required for 1 m3 of the treated water from mbr system is around 1 kw h 82 whereas for a ro system the total energy needed is 3 4 kw h 108 this cost is low in case of casp 109 in an mbr system operating cost may absolutely be compensated by biogas recuperation 110 for operating a plant having a capacity of 20 851 m3 d 1 618 602 per year is required whereas for an activated sludge process having srt of 15 days 241 000 per year is needed 1 the expenditure for sludge treatment is inversely proportional to the aeration cost 111 further kim et al 112 reported that for an mbr augmented with a conventional anaerobic reactor the energy required for fluidization of both the reactors was approximately 0 058 kw h m 3 it is equivalent to the energy that could be recovered only by 30 of the methane generated via an mbr operated by using 0 028 kw h m 3 112 also a decade ago jeison and van lier 113 reported that the membrane prices were on a higher note in comparison to the energy consumption cost for an an mbr system estimating 0 5 m 3 and 0 046 m 3 of the effluent respectively though the elevated degree of automation process reduces the labor cost the cost for a membrane to replace is estimated to be 10 14 of the overall operation cost 1 henceforth to diminish the energy needed for aeration i course bubbling aeration for constant membrane cleaning 107 ii better aeration regime 114 and iii air cycling or intermittent bubbling 30 are few areas by which the operational cost can be reduced 5 future perspective for the proper advancement and wide scale implementation of mbr for micropollutant removal from wastewater a proactive approach to redress the aforementioned concerns is very essential mbr system has proven to be very efficient for removal of many persistent organic micropollutants the integrated approach can augment this efficiency to further enhance the removal efficiency of the conventional mbr however the major roadblocks to the augmented system are its high energy consumption and cost of operation micropollutants generated from the pharmaceutical industries usually have low removal efficiency with mbr this problem might be resolved by the addition of specific enzymes in mbr system for the removal of these persistent organic micropollutants besides this utilization of enzymes instead of microbes will lower the menace of emerging resistance to micropollutants however the production of hazardous transformed metabolites or by products during enzymatic treatment reduces its efficiency enzyme immobilization and mediator cost reduction through the available natural resources can play a vital role to mitigate this issue furthermore membrane fouling is among the foremost contrivances in the mbr system the extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major contributor in the mbr fouling mechanism the level of eps in the wastewater stream among other factors can also rise due to seasonal variations and the improper discharge of un utilized pharmaceuticals from residence and hospitals the pharmaceutical companies additionally contribute a huge amount of their own micropollutants into the wastewater stream these micropollutants in combination with the municipal wastewater make the membrane fouling an even more difficult issue to deal with public awareness is imperative in this regard and the proper labeling of the respective drugs will encourage patients persons to discard them properly also very commonly utilized technique to prevent membrane fouling is aeration and aggressive cleaning is not effective in mbr system involvement of various pretreatment methods operating conditions membrane categories will play a vital role for enhancing the removal efficiency as well as in reducing the membrane fouling the newly developed mbr configuration may assure low energy consumption along with the reduced cost for fouling mitigation for example biocatalytic membrane reactor bmr with proper biocatalyst can be used for in situ degradation of foulant the emphasis should be given to the development of innovative processes to make the aeration in a mbr system more efficient while consuming less energy at the same time new mbr designs such as electrochemical membrane bioreactor could be used as an energy efficient wastewater technology also evaluation of biofilm thickness nutrient gradient and simulated dissolved oxygen may save energy time and cost an in depth study on the effect of various additives viz alum zeolites and activated carbon on membrane fouling is much needed a balanced modeling of the degree of fouling and operating conditions is very much essential similarly the potential application of promising membrane operations e g forward osmosis membrane distillation membrane emulsification should be explored although fo and md have a good potential in low membrane fouling along with high removal efficiency for small molecular weight recalcitrant organic pollutants present in the wastewater stream conflict of interest authors do not have any conflict of interest 
14502,over the last few decades the presence of micropollutants in the wastewater stream is imposing a serious concern worldwide membrane bioreactor mbr technology has been widely employed for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with micropollutants hence the aim of this paper is to provide a consolidate review on the present state of research and advancement in mbr technology along with its augmentation with other wastewater treatment technologies for micropollutant removal sustainability and operating cost assessment for its feasibility the potential application of mbr and hybrid mbr systems in micropollutant removal along with the fate removal mechanism various factors affecting the mbr system efficiency and the operational cost involved were also been discussed in detail further based on the available technologies on mbr the authors discussed the future research perspective for micropollutant removal from the effluent stream with an objective of the circular economy keywords membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment micropollutant removal hybrid mbr systems 1 introduction for the past few decades the available water sources are getting depleted worldwide due to numerous factors including agricultural and industrial activities urbanization climate change population growth and incessant consumption of water these have resulted in the need to explore new sources of water worldwide 1 agricultural and industrial activities and domestic usage of fresh water generate wastewater containing micropollutants when it is discharged into the aquatic environment without proper treatment leading to serious environmental and human health concerns 2 3 micropollutants are a vast group of chemical substances found in the environment at very low concentrations ngl 1 μgl 1 these substances include synthetic organic compounds namely pesticides personal care cosmetic products industrial chemicals food additives and detergents and some naturally occurring substances such as estrogens they create detrimental effects on ecosystems and pollute drinking water resources even when present at trace concentrations 2 over 100 000 chemicals have been labeled as micropollutants by the european union eu and out of which 30 000 70 000 chemicals are used daily for various activities 3 although some regions countries including the eu and canada have implemented some regulations for the discharge of water wastewater containing micropollutants into the environment 4 6 there are no strict standards set until now for the discharge of these pollutants the eu has recently listed 45 priority substances enlisting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs phthalates pesticides metals and endocrine disruptors that act as a threat to the environment directive 2013 39 eu 4 7 in addition 17 organic compounds of emerging concern cec out of which five are pharmaceuticals are enlisted in the watch list of substances for wide monitoring by the eu decision 2015 495 eu 5 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and steroid hormones are not yet enlisted in the general pollutants micropollutants are known to be toxic and bioaccumulate due to their persistent nature however it is important to study the biological effects of these compounds in detail to set regulatory limits for such compounds furthermore environmental protection organizations and scientific research communities must take into account the synergistic or antagonistic effects of these pollutants for understanding their actual impact on human health and environment moreover suitable wastewater treatment and recycling by appropriate methods can limit their release into the environment in this context the conventional activated sludge processes casp employed at wastewater treatment plants wwtps are inefficient in completely eliminating the micropollutants because these are mainly designed to eliminate simple organic matter and nutrients from the wastewater 8 further wwtps are not well equipped to monitor the levels of micropollutants in the source wastewater 9 hence there is a need to re design the casp system in wwtps for a better handling and control of the micropollutants some modifications such as change in the operating conditions e g hydraulic retention time supplementation with inorganic nutrients vigorous mixing aeration addition of surfactants and bioaugumentation have been suggested towards this objective 10 but the outcomes are not that satisfactory for the removal of micropollutants 11 post treatment techniques mainly physicochemical techniques such as adsorption on activated carbon nanofiltration nf advanced oxidation processes aops based techniques including photo catalytic degradation photo oxidation and ozonation have also been tested for micropollutant removal 12 these approaches are unattractive owing to one or other limitations like high energy demand high investment cost use of harsh environmental conditions secondary sludge disposal problem requirement of toxic chemicals etc further micropollutants are present in the various aquatic environments including wastewater surface water groundwater and drinking water 13 also based on the nature of micropollutants conventional vs modern treatment techniques employed in mbr technology and recent developments in mbr and mbr integrated systems are elaborated finally typical case studies pertaining to mbr for micropollutants removal and cost analysis for operating mbr are also presented 2 occurrence of micropollutants and their impact on the environment 2 1 occurrence of micropollutants in wastewater and surface water table 1 and fig 1 present the list of regularly detected micropollutants along with their average concentration in wastewater and surface water the concentration of these compounds in wastewater may fluctuate because of different factors including production rate sales and usage of products per capita water consumption day and excretion rate climatic conditions 14 the manufacturing and utilization of products consisting of micropollutants also decide the quantity of micropollutants that reaches the wwtps 15 2 2 occurrence of micropollutants in groundwater and drinking water contamination of groundwater with micropollutants is mostly caused by sewer systems seepage of septic tanks interaction between ground and surface water through soil landfill leachate and permeation of contaminated water from agricultural lands micropollutants levels are found to be low in ground water as compared to that of surface water 16 most commonly found micropollutants in the ground water are triclosan sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs these compounds are also prevalent in surface water and wastewater which confirms an association of the occurrence of micropollutants in various water bodies 17 2 3 impact of micropollutants on the environment most of the micropollutants are considered as very harmful to the ecosystem including aquatic species causes genotoxicity estrogenicity and mutagenicity wild animals and humans due to their bioaccumulative and non biodegradable nature for instance the feminization of male fish was induced by the exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds edcs 7 9 an incessant discharge of edcs in the environment leads to reproductive and developmental abnormalities of highly sensitive species even at a low concentration in addition augmentation of antibiotic resistant organisms in the environment proves to be an additional risk the ever increasing and indiscriminant use of antibiotics to improve the health of humans and animals have led to the evolution of antibiotic resistant genes at several environmental matrices the discharge of micropollutants in the ecosystem is expected to further increase in the future due to population growth and strong reliance on pharmaceutics 3 micropollutant removal from wastewater various physico chemical and biological treatment technologies were investigated for the removal of micropollutant from the water several physico chemical methods viz coagulation flocculation adsorption and advanced oxidation process are reported to perform sufficiently well in treating micropollutants however chemical treatment methods are employed mostly where the biological treatment techniques fail this is because the biological treatment methods like activated sludge constructed wetland membrane bioreactor are cost effective and environmentally benign treatment technologies for the micropollutant removal from wastewater in recent times some hybrid techniques combining the biological and physico chemical methods came into existence and have opened new ways for treating the wastewater containing micropollutant in an exceptionally great way therefore the present section gives an overview of the aforementioned technologies for the treatment of wastewater containing micropollutants 3 1 physico chemical treatment 3 1 1 coagulation flocculation in this method colloidal particles often called as coagulants are utilized to remove the micropollutants by adsorption which ultimately settles down as flocs in general coagulation flocculation removes suspended solids and organic matter present in wastewater by the addition of metals salts or metal hydroxides iron or aluminum based salts micropollutants are adsorbed onto metal hydroxide or onto the flocs produced during this process and collected in the form of sludge for further disposal or treatment 18 the physicochemical properties of a micropollutant determine its adsorption onto metal hydroxide or onto the flocs in general hydrophobic pollutants are better treated by the coagulation flocculation technique the sorption of hydrophobic micropollutants was predicted by its octanol water partition coefficient kow many micropollutants such as musks polycyclic aromatic compounds and humic acid can be satisfactorily removed by this process the main disadvantage of this process is that micropollutants with a low sorption potential for coagulants colloids formed during this process are not removed well 18 19 3 1 2 pollutant removal by activated carbon adsorption pollutant removal by activated carbons acs takes place through the process of adsorption wherein the pollutant gets diffused onto the surface and thereafter onto the pores of the activated carbon since the pollutants are removed by diffusion process hydrophobic pollutants such as toluene and chlorinated solvents show better removal efficiency than the hydrophilic or highly water soluble pollutants 20 various pollutants that are adsorbed by acs include xenobiotic compounds pharmaceutically active compounds endocrine disrupting compounds edcs and other refractory organics pollutant removal by acs depends on various factors such as particle size ph of the pollutant containing wastewater concentration and molecular weight of the pollutant adsorbent dose and presence of other co contaminants in the wastewater for instance vyrides et al 20 reported that acs with an average size less than 0 25 mm adsorbed 98 of micropollutant whereas those with an average size of 0 75 mm yielded only up to 50 cod removal the high removal efficiency at small size of acs is due to the large surface area and low diffusion resistance than those at a large particle size 3 2 advanced oxidation processes aops complete mineralization or transformation of pollutants to their less toxic forms can be achieved by chemical oxidation processes among the different chemical oxidation processes aops are proven to be the most effective in generating hydroxyl radicals oh thereby causing the degradation of organic pollutants present in wastewater an important feature of aops is its non selective nature in oxidizing the pollutants for instance micropollutants ranging from the most complex form to the simplest single ring organic molecule can be degraded at a very high reaction rate finally leaving inorganic ions co2 and h2o as the final products 19 21 the main disadvantage of aops is the presence of hydroxyl scavenging species carbohydrates proteins or inorganic ions like sulfide bicarbonate and carbonate in wastewater which leads to scarcity of available free oxidants for pollutant degradation and ultimately reduces the pollutant removal efficiency 3 3 biological treatment systems 3 3 1 treating aerobic anaerobic and facultative bacteria micropollutant degradation by bacteria depends on various factors such as contact time microbial community and bioavailability of the pollutants to hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms etc 1 2 studies on bacterial degradation of diverse micropollutants such as bisphenol a nonylphenol polycyclic aromatic organics and many other pharmaceutical compounds have been reported by many researchers 7 22 the removal efficiency of micropollutants by these bacteria varies within the range of 60 100 depending on the concentration of micropollutants and hydraulic retention time of the wastewater wastewater containing beta blockers an endocrine disrupting compound was treated with these aerobic and anaerobic treatments and its removal efficiency was less when compared to the other class of micropollutants 1 3 3 2 constructed wetland a feasible biological system for treating micropollutant wastewater is based on constructed wetland which is designed engineered and operated under controlled environment so as to mimic the natural wetlands in a constructed wetland the pollutant removal takes place by the combination integration of three main processes such as biodegradation a biological process adsorption a physicochemical process and oxidation a chemical process all the three processes occur amid plants substrate and soil 23 in this removal process using constructed wetlands soil plays a major role by providing proper support material and nutrients for the plant growth it further acts as a matrix for the microbial growth and metabolism 24 3 3 3 membrane bioreactor mbr membrane bioreactors are considered as the most recent technology for the treatment of wastewater containing micropollutants and they can be made compact based on the volume of water that needs to be treated furthermore treatment efficiency using a mbr is higher than the other biological systems due to a very high microbial population in the immediate vicinity of the membrane surface ensuring the complete removal of pollutant before the wastewater gets filtered through the membrane in addition due to the membrane sieving effect pollutants with a molecular weight greater than the molecular weight cut off of the membranes are retained thereby bringing it in contact with the degrading microorganisms inside the mbr for its complete degradation 19 details of the different membrane bioreactors strategies to improve this upcoming technology and operating cost assessment are provided in a separate section of this paper 3 3 4 hybrid reactor system hybrid reactor systems are very well suited for treating wastewater containing micropollutants of different nature in this system biological treatment is followed by chemical processes or vice versa based on the treatment requirements biological system comprising of either aerobic or anaerobic systems are found to be suitable for treating edcs and pharmaceutical compounds activated carbon based adsorption method is effective in removing micropollutants such as pesticides antibiotics and analgesics mbr process is efficient to treat wastewater with micropollutants even at an elevated concentration wherein the other treatment techniques particularly the constructed wetland is found to be ineffective 19 25 thus a combination of these methods called hybrid treatment systems can be applied for treating wastewater containing micropollutants for e g a hybrid system using mbr followed by oxidation process is beneficial for the complete removal of edcs and pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater similarly oxidation followed by a biological treatment system is found to be effective yielding nearly 100 removal efficiency in treating wastewater containing beta blockers and pesticides 19 21 25 4 mbrs for micropollutant removal 4 1 micropollutant removal using mbr system over the past two decades membrane bioreactors mbrs have been designed and operated for treatment of a variety of pollutants such as particulates carbonaceous substances nutrients and pathogenic microorganisms 26 compared with these pollutants which can be removed easily by conventional methods the removal of certain other pollutants particularly the micropollutants pharmaceuticals personal care products steroid hormones surfactants industrially generated chemicals etc is often very different therefore examination of the fate and removal of micropollutants during wastewater treatment is very much crucial for any of the treatment process to avoid their discharge into the environment 27 in this section characterization and different removal processes utilizing mbrs with a focus on the fate and mechanism of micropollutant removal are discussed membrane bioreactor mbr systems seem to be promising under this scenario due to their several advantages including high performance efficiency compared to conventional activated sludge treatment plant casp less space requirement environment friendliness therefore it has been recognized as a key technology for water reuse and recycling in many developed and developing countries 28 mbr is a hybrid process integrating the membrane technique with biological treatment which enables casp to be operated as a single step process by avoiding the need for a secondary clarifier fig 2 compares the conventional wastewater treatment process with that employing mbr technology also table 2 enlists various advantageous and limitations of mbr system for micropollutant removal in general mbr system is categorized into two kinds in accordance with the configuration 1 submerged membrane bioreactor smbr and 2 side stream membrane bioreactor fig 2 shows a brief schematic of mbr system earlier the side stream mbr was developed where the membrane module is placed outside the bioreactor for the recirculation pump due to its high energy consumption in 1980s submerged mbr system was further developed where the membrane module was submerged within the bioreactor thus permitting the effluent to pass through with sludge retention in a smbr aeration maintains the activated sludge in suspended mode limiting the membrane fouling fig 3 represents different types of membrane fouling mechanism within a mbr system for determining the fouling mechanism associated with the microfiltration of the membrane system hermia s fouling models viz a complete b standard c intermediate pore blocking and d cake filtration models are applied 44 in complete pore blocking the size of the solute particle is larger than the pore size of the filtration membrane leading to surface pore blocking and not block inside pores of the membrane standard pore blocking takes place because of the non uniform pore paths whereas the intermediate pore blocking occurs when the solute particle size and membrane pore size are nearly same 45 cake filtration is related to the state where particles bigger than the average pore size mount up on the surface of the membrane thus forming a cake the potential features of mbr plants such as high efficiency of separation solid liquid and high concentration of biomass compared to those with casp tanks affect the cell metabolism and bacterial environment which restricts the growth and thereby the sludge production mbrs have gained more interest in the last decade mainly due to the significant reduction in the cost of membranes and the energy requirements during its development process 46 mbr and mbr associated systems e g mbr with reverse osmosis ro microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf are being developed for the removal of micropollutants from wastewater prior to their discharge into the environment fig 4 in mbr plants separation of solids biological sludge from the treated wastewater can be achieved by membrane filtration using uf mf with pore sizes in the range 0 01 0 1 μm moreover if permeated water through the mbr system contains some viruses and dissolved organic compounds these can be eliminated using dense membrane processes called nf ro before reusing the water 47 typically the integrated processes of mbr technology combined with ro nf system is employed to obtain water suitable for drinking purposes and irrigation applications with reduced salinity 48 mbrs are adopted for the treatment of almost all classes of micropollutants such as edcs pharmaceutical compounds pesticides etc removal efficiency of 15 endocrine disrupting compounds each at a concentration in the range 1 5 μg l 1 by mbr technology varied between 92 and 99 for each of these compounds 25 personal care products pcps such as salicylic acid and propyl paraben were completely removed using an mbr system removal efficiencies of 99 97 and 70 80 were obtained for triclosan atenolol and beta blockers respectively using this system 49 however in case of treating wastewater containing pharmaceutical compounds a mixed performance is observed by using mbr technology for example antibiotics ofloxacin sulfamethaxazole and erythromycin and analgesics lorazepam citalopram ibuprofen carbamazepine and primidone were removed with an efficiency in the range 75 95 using this technology 1 however in the case of many other pharmaceutical compounds the removal efficiency is not satisfactory overall the removal efficiency of different micropollutants using mbr system follows the order endocrine disrupting compounds beta blockers pharmaceutical compounds pesticides 19 25 34 the mbr processes and integrated mbr systems for the removal of micropollutants have been described in the literature by several authors the micropollutants removal using mbr and mbr integrated systems is influenced by various factors which have not been elaborated in the available literature these factors include microbial community structure its activities and effect on mbr performance and fouling effect of operating conditions on removal efficiency integrated mbr systems and hybrid processes for micropollutant removal therefore this review aims to summarize and evaluate all those factors affecting micropollutants removal using mbr processes and integrated mbr system 4 2 different integrated mbr systems and hybrid processes for micropollutant removal integrated approaches involving mbrs with some other processes such as advanced oxidation process aops membrane distillation process bio entrapped membrane bioreactor granular mbrs etc are of recent focus as these combined processes improve permeate quality mitigates membrane fouling problem and enhance the treatment efficiency fig 5 presents a brief schematic of different types of integrated mbr systems that were already been utilized for wastewater treatment 4 2 1 advanced oxidation processes aops mbr aops are generally recognized for their capability to remove various organic pollutants from wastewater by converting it to easily biodegradable intermediates however suspended solids present in waste stream acts as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals is a major problem 50 in this mbr plays a vital role in removing the suspended solids from effluents for improving the efficiency of degradation process the integrated aop mbr process totally depends upon the amount of biodegradable organics and recalcitrant pollutants present in the wastewater if biodegradable organics are less in comparison with recalcitrant pollutants aops are used prior to the biological treatment step and vice versa in case of more biodegradable organics than recalcitrant organics in the wastewater 51 laera et al 51 examined the removal of simulated wastewater containing nalidixic acid utilized in treating urinary tract infection by integrating a mbr system with either uv h2o2 or ozonation process and by including chemical oxidation in the recirculation stream of the mbr since mbr system alone was inefficient to treat the wastewater integrating it with ozonation completely removed all the intermediate metabolites during the chemical oxidation in a similar study by mascolo et al 52 the degradation of acyclovir from pharmaceutical wastewater was achieved by integrating mbr with ozonation process the ozonation reactor was kept in the recycling mode of the mbr effluent and showed a removal efficiency of 99 in the final effluent qu et al 53 reported a high quality effluent by integrating thermophilic submerged aerobic membrane bioreactor and electrochemical oxidation technology for treating paper and pulp effluent giacobbo et al 54 evaluated an integrated approach involving mbr photoelectrooxidation for tannery wastewater treatment and using this approach biological oxygen demand bod present in the wastewater was completely removed by the mbr whereas chemical oxygen demand cod was removed by photoelectrooxidation process in another study lopez et al 55 reported the permeate effluent from a mbr system as ready to use high quality water integrating it with solar photo catalysis with mbr system for treating pesticide containing wastewater integrating the electrocoagulation technique with mbr system is also shown to be useful for the removal of organic pollutants and inorganics from wastewater stream fig 5 during electrocoagulation metal ions are generated at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode which further assists in easy removal of the flocculated particles by skimming from the surface 56 vijaykumar and balasubramanian 57 used aluminum as anode and stainless steel as cathode in an electrocoagulation setup integrated with mbr for heavy metal removal chromium copper and zinc with a removal efficiency of 90 the integrated system improved both the permeate flux and the membrane life fard et al 58 integrated electrocoagulation electrofenton and electron fenton processes with mbr system and reported a zero excess sludge generation the aops aided in overcoming the membrane fouling problem thereby a longer membrane life and its performance were achieved 4 2 2 reverse osmosis and forward osmosis membrane system membrane bioreactor in combination with osmotic techniques is found to be better in producing quality water with low energy consumption 50 in the conventional mbr system the removal of some trace recalcitrant organic micropollutants that are hydrophobic by adsorption onto suspended solids in wastewater which retain the contaminants inside the bioreactor for their biodegradation is difficult 59 a study performed by ogawa et al 14 reported that no major variation in the permeate water quality obtained from the nanofiltration and ro membranes in mbr for treating municipal wastewater since very less fouling occurred during its operation 50 de jager et al 60 achieved 75 cod removal and 94 turbidity removal 12 admi american dye manufacturing index lower limit of potable water 17 admi from textile effluent by employing a pilot scale dual stage mbr system incorporated with an ultrafiltration membrane farias et al 61 found that an increase in the sludge retention time srt resulted in an enhanced removal of carbohydrates from municipal wastewater which however increased the ro membrane fouling moreover improved removal efficiency was achieved by operating forward osmosis fo at a low hydraulic pressure 50 tan et al 62 examined the effect of silver nanoparticles on the performance of an osmotic mbr comprising of cellulose triacetate fo membrane for treatment of synthetic municipal wastewater the results demonstrated that the inclusion of silver nanoparticle reduced the nitrifying efficiency with the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps which led to foul the membrane 63 both the sludge quality and membrane fouling played a vital role on the performance of ombr system in addition low water flux and accumulation of salts are two major disadvantages of the ombr system 50 praveen et al 64 utilized the forward osmotic hollow fiber mbr fohfmbr with pseudomonas putida for treating high strength saline phenolic wastewater in this study the membrane was successfully regenerated through osmotic backwashing which reduces the membrane fouling problem ding et al 65 reported an enhancement in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater by using integrated anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr with forward osmosis fo systems the permeate flux was declined with an increase in the temperature from 25 c to 35 c due to reduced microbial growth this resulted in accumulation of membrane foulants cornelissen et al 66 integrated ro and fo systems for wastewater treatment in which the fo was utilized for pumping the wastewater while ro was used for the separation and recycling the draw water it was proposed that ro membrane is cost effective in comparison with fo membrane although the latter achieved better recovery as it is not limited by osmotic gradient moreover fo system requires less energy in comparison with ro furthermore for enhanced treatment efficiency over prolonged treatment time it is recommended to bioaugment the system with salt tolerant microbes or follows shorter srt 4 2 3 granular mbr aerobic granular sludge systems are currently utilized for treating wastewater with high content of organic 67 68 these systems are efficient to perform simultaneous nitrification and denitrification inside the granules due to its compact spherical structure 50 vijayalayan et al 69 reported the treatment of synthetic wastewater by combining sequencing batch airlift reactor sbar with membrane airlift bioreactor mabr in sbar the aerobic granules were cultivated for handling both nitrification high aeration and denitrification low aeration whereas in mabr both aerobic and anoxic zones exist a reduction in the membrane fouling was observed due to the granular sludge cultivated in the integrated system zhao et al 11 reported the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps using an aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor the integrated system provides good removal of cod ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus along with rapid but unstable sludge granules in another report li et al 70 examined anammox anaerobic ammonia oxidation granules formation and evaluated its performance using a submerged anaerobic mbr under complete mixing and continuous feeding condition removal efficiency upto 88 of total nitrogen content was achieved in the system and the granules showed excellent activity high resistance to shock loadings rapid growth rate besides the system was found to operate with minimum fouling for wastewater 4 2 4 membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr this type of integrated system uses a combination of thermophilic bioprocess along with membrane distillation process 50 both hydrophobic and microporous membrane produces water vapor across the thermal gradient generating the quality water in comparison with the mbr system mdbr is capable of achieving excellent organic removal efficiency for municipal wastewater recuperation along with reduced sludge generation 71 moreover it is cost effective mitigates membrane fouling and achieves high performance 72 wijekoon et al 73 examined the performance of mdbr for the removal of trace organic contaminants trocs representing pharmaceutical and personal care products and achieved a very high removal of the pollutants the removal of trocs was attributed to biodegradation rejection by membrane distillation and adsorption onto the sludge also removal efficiency of total organic carbon and total nitrogen was 99 and 96 respectively by utilizing only the mbr system compounds such as carbamazepine and diclofenac could not be removed efficiently phattaranawik et al 74 reported very good removal efficiency of micropollutants from organic wastewater using mdbr along with a reduction in toc reduced greenhouse gas emissions and salt concentration as compared with mbr ro integrated system in another study mdbr system with rubrobacter and caldalkalibacillus sp employed was used to treat synthetic wastewater 75 thus mdbr system can be utilized for the efficient removal of persistent organic compounds from high temperature wastewater 4 2 5 biofilm bio entrapped membrane bioreactor in biofilm mbr the addition of biosupport inside the mbr minimizes suspended solid concentration which in turn reduces the fouling of the membrane leyva diaz et al 76 examined the performance of biofilm mbr containing carriers under two different conditions anoxic and aerobic for nitrification and denitrification of wastewater respectively in both the cases the system yielded a better efficiency than mbr without carrier subtil et al 77 reported the enhanced removal efficiency of ammonia and total nitrogen and reduction in the membrane fouling rate using a bio film mbr system yang et al 38 compared the performance of biofilm mbr with that of a conventional mbr and reported an enhanced removal of ammonical nitrogen and total nitrogen from wastewater specific oxygen utilization rate sour in the system showed a greater microbial activity in the biofilm mbr ng et al 78 compared two different integrated process i e bioentrapped membrane reactor bemr and salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor msmbr for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment in bemr activated sludge entrapped in its bio carriers was used however it could not tolerate the hypersaline conditions whereas the msmbr was able to efficiently degrade persistent compounds with reduced membrane fouling table 3 represents the different types of mbr and hybrid mbr systems utilized for micropollutant removal 4 3 micropollutant removal mechanism using mbr system the removal of micropollutants from wastewater by a mbr system is due to the physical retention by membrane biodegradation air stripping sorption and photo transformation 79 80 for apolar pollutants sorption followed by membrane retention of the solids is the main mechanism involved for its removal whereas for polar pollutants biodegradation is the prime mechanism and sorption is very limited 1 when the size of micropollutants is much lower than the pore size of microfiltration membrane limited area for sorption is available however the sorption of micropolluatants occurs due to the formation of an additional secondary layer by the deposition of micropollutants 45 81 while the highly volatile trace organic from the wastewater is removed by air stripping volatilization and is considered insignificant as the majority of the pollutants have a henry constant 0 005 82 for hydrophobic pollutants the biosorption occurs on to the activated sludge and for hydrophilic pollutants it is primarily followed by the biodegradation 83 further the participation of numerous degraded intermediate byproducts metabolites imposes its negative impact on the removal mechanism by biodegradation and sorption 84 4 3 1 sorption in this phenomenon the pollutants make association with the solid phases activated sludge few pollutants get sorbed into the sludge while most of them remain as it is for quantifying the sorption of micropollutants the solid water distribution coefficient k d plays an vital role and is defined as the pollutant concentration present in the solid to concentration present in the aqueous phase at equilibrium 37 k d l kg 1 value at equilibrium can be expressed by the equation 1 85 1 k d c s o r b e d x s s s s o lub l e where c sorbed sorbed compound μg l 1 x ss concentration of the suspended solid in wastewater kg l 1 and s soluble concentration of the soluble part of the compound μg l 1 the two major mechanisms resulting in the sorption of a pollutant into the primary and secondary activated sludge are adsorption electrostatic interaction of positively charged groups of micropollutants with the negatively charged surface of microbes 37 and absorption hydrophobic interactions of pollutants with the lipophilic cell membrane of the microorganisms and the lipid fractions of the sludge 39 absorption is characterized by the octanol water partition coefficient kow value 39 micropollutants other than hormones and musk fragrances e g galaxolide and tanolide have a kd value less than 500 l kg 1 and hence sorption is minimum 86 a low log kow value also infers about the sorption phenomena indicating the hydrophobicity of the pollutants and hence is first sorbed in the activated sludge followed by biodegradation 87 normally the kd value is a bit higher in the primary sludge in comparison with activated sludge clearly depicting the inhibition in the primary sludge 4 3 2 biodegradation biodegradation is a well known biological phenomenon where microbes are capable of degrading the micropollutants and are dependent on the redox conditions prevailing in the contaminated aqueous system 39 88 89 it is the most important phenomena for the micropollutant removal in a mbr system and follows the pseudo first order degradation kinetics eq 2 3 2 d c d t k b i o l x s s s s o lub l e where c concentration of the micropollutant μg l 1 ssoluble concentration of the soluble part of the micropollutant μg l 1 kbiol pseudo first order reaction rate constant l gss 1 day 1 and xss concentration of the suspended solid gss l 1 and t time day since the aerobic conditions are much favorable to microbes microbial consortia present inside the mbr system it is also favorable conditions for biodegradation the removal efficiency of ibuprofen acetaminophen fenoprofen 17α ethynylestradiol fenofibric acid roxithromycine and tonalide was reported to be greater than 80 in the mbr sludge 98 90 a similar negative charge between anti inflammatory drugs and activated sludge makes the sorption limited and making the biodegradation as the chief removal phenomenon 85 furthermore micropollutants such as carbamazepine diazepam indomethacin are few lipid regulators and beta blockers are persistent compounds which showed a very least biodegradation 20 and hence the washout of such pollutants will also be a menace during continuous mbr operation 43 91 henceforth mbr systems having a high srt for naproxen diclofenac mefenamic acid gemofibrozil and indomethacin were reported as a viable option for such kind of cases 90 according to kbiol value for musk fragrances both sorption and biodegradation were responsible for their removal 91 in addition the difference in the biodegradation removal rate is totally dependent on the sludge origin sludge age wastewater composition microbial consortium and aeration 92 4 3 3 stripping volatilization stripping involves the gaseous pollutant removal from the aerobic wwtps containing micropollutants the stripping is mainly dependent on vapor pressure of wastewater i e henry s constant h and hydrophobicity 1 as majority of the micropollutants have their very low value of h log kow value kow octanol water partition coefficient practically the phenomenon is insignificant volatilization is significant when h value is high 39 50 93 and the same is calculated by the below expression 94 3 b i s t r i p p e d c i a i r q a i r q h c i d i s s a e r q q where bi stripped amount of pollutant i removed μg d 1 ci air concentration of pollutant i in gas phase μg

is insignificant for pharmaceuticals 82 and estrogens 27 because of low h value and hydrophobicity though celestolide is considerably removed by air stripping 27 4 4 factors affecting mbr efficiency for micropollutants removal various aspects are responsible for the effectiveness of a mbr system for micropollutants removal from wastewater biological factors that affect the operation of a mbr are as follows age of the sludge and its concentration aerobic anaerobic or anoxic environment prevailing in the membrane compartments wastewater constituents and other physical parameters such as temperature ph and conductivity physicochemical properties of the micropollutants operating conditions of mbr characteristics of the wastewater ph organic matter concentration and ionic strength and membrane characteristics are also among the prime factors responsible for affecting the mbr wastewater treatment efficiency 4 4 1 molecular weight and complexity of micropollutants physicochemical properties of the micropollutants highly affect the performance of a mbr system 83 micropollutants such as estrone and 17α ethynylestradiol were removed upto 80 and 99 respectively in a bench top mbr system 83 95 96 bo et al 86 showed a removal efficiency of 8 38 for diclofenac with srt in between 20 48 days whereas clofibric acid was removed considerably after acclimatization of microbes to the activated sludge 86 with an increase in the srt micropollutants such as ketoprofen and naproxen possessing double aromatic rings depicted an enhanced removal using mbr system due to the presence of diverse microbial population which is acclimatization and able to degrade the aromatic rings although it is difficult to correlate the removal efficiency and compound complexity but usually it can be accomplished that aliphatic monocyclic aromatic compounds having electron donating group are readily biodegraded whereas polycyclic compounds having electron withdrawing group are difficult to degrade in comparison 27 97 4 4 2 operating conditions various literatures reported the effect of different operating conditions that lead to increase decrease mbr efficiency in relation with the micropollutant removal effluent quality membrane fouling energy utilization etc these conditions are discussed in detail below 4 4 2 1 sludge retention time amongst the most significant parameters for mbr operation srt is an important factor during wastewater filtration as it controls membrane fouling srt may be defined as the average time period for which the activated solid sludge is retained in the mbr system 39 in mbr treatment can be performed with high srt various studies have reported the enhanced micropollutants removal with an increase in the srt 81 94 kimura et al 98 reported an enhancement in acidic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment by increasing srt from 15 days to 65 days a boost in the removal from 83 99 and 50 82 for ketoprofen and clofibric acid respectively was reported similarly for 17α ethynylestradiol 11 increase in the removal efficiency was achieved by increasing srt more than 20 days 94 high srt enhances the removal efficiency of micropollutants lowers the sludge yield and improves the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration though for the majority of micropollutants srt between 20 and 30 days is sufficient for their removal in mbr system 1 however a high energy input is needed for the viscous mlss in order to decrease the membrane fouling furthermore a high srt beyond critical point leads to severe fouling and ageing of the membrane also for pharmaceutical wastewater the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt was evaluated using a bench top scale mbr system 86 4 4 2 2 effect of ph for a mbr system containing ionisable micropollutants ph plays a significant part in the removal efficiency 99 ph ranging between 6 7 is generally suggested for the biological treatment tadkaew et al 99 reported the effect of mixed liquor ph in between 5 9 for selected micropollutants it was found that sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac were ionisable ph dependent maximum removal was obtained at ph 5 when compared to less acidic conditions whereas for pharmaceutical wastewater containing ibuprofen clofibric acid and diclofenac the removal was efficient at acidic ph 100 101 due to the hydrophobicity of these compounds at ph 5 the removal of bisphenol a and carbamazepine was comparatively independent and not affected by the mixed liquor ph 99 although bisphenol a showed a better removal than carbamazepine due to its hydrophobic nature further the alteration of ph and hrt did not improve the removal efficiency 86 whereas ibuprofen was degraded under neutral and acidic ph at low ph conditions the biodegradation of clofibric acid was reduced due to decline in the microbial activity in addition the functional groups of the compounds play a major role in determining the removal efficiency 27 for example hormone possessing phenolic and hydroxyl groups dissociates at a ph above their pka value resulting in enhanced charge repulsion between the microbial surface sludge and the membrane thereby reduces the adsorption and removal efficiency 4 4 2 3 effect of redox conditions by performing the mbr at diverse redox conditions results in high microbial variety and activity suarez et al 94 reported a significant amount of biodegradation of certain micropollutants naproxen 17α ethynylestradiol and ibuprofen under aerobic conditions whereas some compounds galaxolide and tonalide can be degraded under both aerobic and anoxic conditions many literatures have reported that anoxic conditions are capable enough for removal of micropollutants from wastewater 102 for example under anoxic conditions 95 of diuron biodegradation was achieved in comparison with only 60 using aerobic conditions 94 nitrification showed a partial removal of micropollutants such as gemfibrozil diclofenac bezafibrate and ketoprofen a high srt in mbr system also enables the enrichment of nitrifying bacteria resulting in removal of certain trace micropollutants 103 4 4 2 4 effect of temperature it is well established that microorganism growth and activity are affected by the change in temperature 33 although most of the micropollutant removal using mbr system takes place at room temperature such as ibuprofen acetaminophen bezafibrate and naproxen 42 insignificant variation in the removal efficiency was observed for both carbamazepine and diclofenac at room temperature 104 the removal of most hydrophobic micropollutants in a mbr system log dow 3 2 was stable at ph 8 with working temperature of 20 c to 35 c while raising the temperature upto 45 c a clear decline in the removal rate was observed this decline in the removal efficiency can be attributed to the decrease in the metabolic activity and sludge disintegration in addition an enhancement in the soluble microbial products smp was noticed with increasing the temperature from 20 c to 45 c which further leads to membrane fouling 33 in some cases the temperature in the range of 18 23 c had an encouraging outcome for antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin atenolol ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole removal 94 105 4 5 operating cost of mbr system despite the fact that mbr system involves the energy operation yet not any substantial study was involved for its energy consumption 37 although cost of membrane decreased considerably 106 globally the market for mbr system valued around 425 7 million 2014 and is expected to touch 777 7 million 2019 with an annual growth rate of 12 8 1 usually the mbr system depends on different factors but its operating cost is usually higher than the conventional activated sludge process because much energy is required for the aeration around 60 70 of the overall price to reduce the membrane fouling 30 107 the total energy required for 1 m3 of the treated water from mbr system is around 1 kw h 82 whereas for a ro system the total energy needed is 3 4 kw h 108 this cost is low in case of casp 109 in an mbr system operating cost may absolutely be compensated by biogas recuperation 110 for operating a plant having a capacity of 20 851 m3 d 1 618 602 per year is required whereas for an activated sludge process having srt of 15 days 241 000 per year is needed 1 the expenditure for sludge treatment is inversely proportional to the aeration cost 111 further kim et al 112 reported that for an mbr augmented with a conventional anaerobic reactor the energy required for fluidization of both the reactors was approximately 0 058 kw h m 3 it is equivalent to the energy that could be recovered only by 30 of the methane generated via an mbr operated by using 0 028 kw h m 3 112 also a decade ago jeison and van lier 113 reported that the membrane prices were on a higher note in comparison to the energy consumption cost for an an mbr system estimating 0 5 m 3 and 0 046 m 3 of the effluent respectively though the elevated degree of automation process reduces the labor cost the cost for a membrane to replace is estimated to be 10 14 of the overall operation cost 1 henceforth to diminish the energy needed for aeration i course bubbling aeration for constant membrane cleaning 107 ii better aeration regime 114 and iii air cycling or intermittent bubbling 30 are few areas by which the operational cost can be reduced 5 future perspective for the proper advancement and wide scale implementation of mbr for micropollutant removal from wastewater a proactive approach to redress the aforementioned concerns is very essential mbr system has proven to be very efficient for removal of many persistent organic micropollutants the integrated approach can augment this efficiency to further enhance the removal efficiency of the conventional mbr however the major roadblocks to the augmented system are its high energy consumption and cost of operation micropollutants generated from the pharmaceutical industries usually have low removal efficiency with mbr this problem might be resolved by the addition of specific enzymes in mbr system for the removal of these persistent organic micropollutants besides this utilization of enzymes instead of microbes will lower the menace of emerging resistance to micropollutants however the production of hazardous transformed metabolites or by products during enzymatic treatment reduces its efficiency enzyme immobilization and mediator cost reduction through the available natural resources can play a vital role to mitigate this issue furthermore membrane fouling is among the foremost contrivances in the mbr system the extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major contributor in the mbr fouling mechanism the level of eps in the wastewater stream among other factors can also rise due to seasonal variations and the improper discharge of un utilized pharmaceuticals from residence and hospitals the pharmaceutical companies additionally contribute a huge amount of their own micropollutants into the wastewater stream these micropollutants in combination with the municipal wastewater make the membrane fouling an even more difficult issue to deal with public awareness is imperative in this regard and the proper labeling of the respective drugs will encourage patients persons to discard them properly also very commonly utilized technique to prevent membrane fouling is aeration and aggressive cleaning is not effective in mbr system involvement of various pretreatment methods operating conditions membrane categories will play a vital role for enhancing the removal efficiency as well as in reducing the membrane fouling the newly developed mbr configuration may assure low energy consumption along with the reduced cost for fouling mitigation for example biocatalytic membrane reactor bmr with proper biocatalyst can be used for in situ degradation of foulant the emphasis should be given to the development of innovative processes to make the aeration in a mbr system more efficient while consuming less energy at the same time new mbr designs such as electrochemical membrane bioreactor could be used as an energy efficient wastewater technology also evaluation of biofilm thickness nutrient gradient and simulated dissolved oxygen may save energy time and cost an in depth study on the effect of various additives viz alum zeolites and activated carbon on membrane fouling is much needed a balanced modeling of the degree of fouling and operating conditions is very much essential similarly the potential application of promising membrane operations e g forward osmosis membrane distillation membrane emulsification should be explored although fo and md have a good potential in low membrane fouling along with high removal efficiency for small molecular weight recalcitrant organic pollutants present in the wastewater stream conflict of interest authors do not have any conflict of interest 
14503,in this work a highly visible light active and reusable photocatalyst was synthesized by incorporation of sulfur cations into the lattice of titanium dioxide tio2 the prepared photocatalyst was immobilized on aluminum plates by polysiloxane for repetitive use in photocatalysis experiments suspended and attached catalysts were used for degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp under direct irradiation of a metal halide lamp in contrast the degradation of 2 4 dcp by suspended catalyst was faster than attached catalyst however the trends of degradation rates by attached catalyst indicate that the mineralization of 2 4 dcp could be extended for additional time to attain the same efficiency of suspended catalyst at initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency of 2 4 dcp was higher than 97 after 480 min the degradation rates in five consecutive cycles were 98 96 90 86 and 80 4 indicating high reusability and stability of the catalyst even after long periods of photocatalytic reaction the photocatalytic degradation rates of 2 4 dcp by suspended and attached catalysts were described by langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model keywords 2 4 dcp pesticide photocatalytic polysiloxane wastewater 1 introduction pesticide and herbicide residues exist in aquatic environment as a consequence of excessive use of commercial pesticides in agriculture or careless disposal of packages and containers 1 moreover pesticides could be found in higher concentrations in the liquid waste of agrochemical industries 2 the main problems of pesticides and herbicides are the high toxicity and low biodegradability which make the traditional biological treatment methods inappropriate 3 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp is one of the commonly used toxic organics in the production of pesticides and herbicides 4 liquid 2 4 dcp could be absorbed by skin and it can cause fatal problems like instantaneous renal failure liver damage and various other organ failure 5 advanced oxidation processes aops are reported as the most appropriate methods for treatment of industrial wastewater and degradation of bio resistant organics 6 very strong reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals are produced during the aops in aqueous solutions 7 bio resistant organic molecules are attacked by hydroxyl radicals and gradually degraded to benign intermediate by products and end products such as h2o and co2 8 among aops photocatalysis may be considered the most sustainable and cost efficient process due to low energy consumption and the prospect of utilizing solar light 9 in photocatalytic processes nano scale powders such as tio2 and wo3 are used as a semiconductor materials for production of reactive hydroxyl radicals 10 11 conventional tio2 catalysts are only high active under uv light so they have limited efficiency under solar light 12 however tio2 could be modified by doping various materials to extend the absorption limit from uv region to visible light region which will improve the photocatalytic activity under solar light 13 among those materials sulfur have been recognized as one of the efficient dopants to reduce the band gap of tio2 and enhance its photocatalytic activity in visible region 14 recently many researchers reported the application of novel sulfur doped catalysts for degradation of several organic contaminants tian et al doped sulfer with graphene quantum dots graphene tio2 nanotubes composite to get enhanced photocatalytic activity 15 elbakkay et al prepared a novel composite of sulfur doped tio2 and sulfur doped reduced graphene oxide for photo electro chemical water splitting 16 chen et al prepared cationic s doped tio2 sio2 visible light photocatalyst by co hydrolysis method for degradation of nitrobenzene p chlorophenol and phenol in water under different light sources 17 cheng et al prepared nano tubes of s tio2 tio2 for effective photo electro catalytic degradation of diclofenac 18 most of the reports in the literature used the photocatalyst powders in suspension 19 however some problems are reported to be associated with suspended catalyst such as the high turbidity which may increase the light scattering in the solution and the limited prospect of reuse due to the difficulty of particles collection 20 some researchers tried to immobilize tio2 on glass plates using heat attachment methods to develop photocatalyst plates that could be used in degradation of dyes 21 the photocatalytic efficiency of the immobilized tio2 was promising however the attachment method consumed excessive energy due to the high temperature 20 on the other hand the use of bonding materials such as polysiloxane for the attachment of photocatalyst is not reported in the literature polysiloxane is a non hardening water resistant material that used in several applications and powders could be attached to it with high durability 22 in this work sulfur doped tio2 s tio2 powder was prepared and immobilized on aluminum plates by polysiloxane the prepared s tio2 was employed in suspended and attached state for degradation of 2 4 dcp in water metal halide lamps have been reported to irradiate closer spectral composition to solar light and they have been widely used in solar simulators 23 consequently the experiments were conducted under a metal halide lamp to exploit both uv and visible light the advantages of using the catalyst in attached state have been deeply discussed 2 materials and method 2 1 materials 2 4 dcp 98 methanol and acetic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich taniumisopropoxide ethanol and ferric chloride were obtained from wako japan thiourea was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd all chemicals were of analytical grade and have been used without further modifications 2 2 experimental procedure the synthesis of the s tio2 catalyst was performed according to previously reported work 24 26 thiourea and titaniumisopropoxide and were mixed at a molar ratio of 4 1 in ethanol vigorous stirring of solution was performed by magnetic stirrer for 1 h at room temperature under reduced pressure a white slurry was obtained after evaporation of ethanol the slurry was kept for 48 h at room temperature then the white powder was collected the obtained residuals were calcinated at different temperatures under aerated conditions and yellow powder was resulted the prepared catalyst was immobilized on circular aluminum plates using polysiloxane all the used plates are aluminum grade 3003 with diameter of 65 mm and thickness of 2 mm the weight of the plate was about 18 524 gm first circular aluminum plate was roughed down in a workshop about 1 mm layer of polysiloxane was placed on the plate surface and 1 8 gm of s tio2 powder was distributed carefully the plate was allowed to dry for 24 h in room temperature then it was scrubbed to remove free catalyst particles and washed by distilled water the plate was placed at the bottom of a 250 ml pyrex beaker and 100 ml of contaminated water was added the beaker top is opened and exposed to light at a distance of 150 mm from the source the light source is a 400 w metal halide lamp philips having λmax intensity and photon flux of 510 nm 1 02 10 7 and 220 μw cm 2 respectively emission profile for a typical halide lamp is shown in fig s1 23 the beaker is placed on a magnetic stirrer to attain homogeneous contact between the solution and the attached catalyst during the experiment the same reactor was used for the suspended catalyst without placing the catalyst plate in the beaker 2 3 analytical method 2 4 dcp was quantified by hplc system agilent 1200 series the system includes a quaternary pump an auto sampler and a photodiode array detector the samples were filtered by whatman syringe filters 0 2 μm an aliquot of 25 μl was injected into a column apollo c18 with a diameter of 4 6 mm and length of 150 mm at column temperature 40 c the mobile phase was distilled water methanol acetic acid v v v 39 60 1 at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 1 the peak of 2 4 dcp was detected at a wavelength of 280 nm total organic carbon toc was measured by toc analyzer analytik jena ag co germany a transmission electron microscopy tem image was recorded using fei tecnai g2 f20 microscope operating at 200 kv provided with a carbon grid sample holder the crystalline phases of s tio2 particles were detected by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv with d tex ultra analysis using cu kα radiation the raman spectra were recorded using a rmp 330laser raman spectroscopy system jasco japan in order to select the optimum calcination temperature relative surface areas of calcinated powders were determined by brunauer emmett teller bet analysis using a surface area analyzer micromeritics flowsorb ii2300 energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy was observed by joel jem 2100 the band gap energies of the prepared catalysts were calculated by uv vis spectroscopy using the kubelka munk function by plotting the graph between f r hν 1 2 on y axis and hν on x axis 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of s tio2 the relative surface area of the powder calcinated at 400 c was 88 8 m2 g in general increasing the calcination temperature led to decrease of anatase content and relative surface area the following are the suggested anatase content percentage and relative surface area at different calcination temperature 25 400 c 3 h 88 8 m2 g 100 400 c 10 h 62 1 8 m2 g 100 500 c 3 h 32 8 m2 g 99 500 c 10 h 28 5 m2 g 98 600 c 3 h 12 5 m2 g 51 600 c 10 h 10 9 m2 g 45 700 c 3 h 8 8 m2 g 0 700 c 10 h 7 5 m2 g 0 the catalyst calcinated at 400 c was favored to carry out this work due its high anatase content and relative surface area a tem image of the prepared s tio2 catalyst is shown in fig 1 a the image analysis indicated that the catalyst particles have diameters ranging from 9 to 20 nm the small nano scale particles with random shapes suggest high surface area which is required for enhancing the photocatalytic activity 28 moreover it seems that titania species and sulfur species are crystallized together and they have not agglomerated separately the xrd pattern of the prepared catalyst is shown in fig 1 b an obvious peak was observed at 2θ 25 5 which is attributed in the literature to active anatase tio2 29 additional peaks were observed at 2θ 25 5 37 6 48 1 54 20 55 4 and 62 5 which are attributed to the 1 0 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 and 2 0 4 planes of anatase phase of titanium oxide jcpds no 21 1272 30 small peak was detected at 2θ 30 5 which may be due to the residual amounts of brookite phase of titania 31 there are no other peaks that could be attributed to other catalyst components in addition the anatase tio2 crystals are of high purity which confirm the dominance of anatase 26 the anatase phase was reported that improves the photocatalytic activity more than other phases like rutile and brookite 31 32 no specific peaks is ascribed to sulfur because its ions are suggested to be uniformly dispersed with the anatase crystallite 33 raman spectra of the prepared s tio2 are shown in fig 1 c raman scattering was detected at 140 cm 1 which is attributed to pure anatase phase 34 in addition three clear peaks were observed at 390 510 and 635 cm 1 which are also attributed to anatase phase of titania 35 the presence of weak peaks at 235 and 315 cm 1 is probably due to the residuals of brookite phase of titania while there are no peaks detected due to rutile phase which comply with the results of xrd analysis the edx pattern is shown in fig 1 d a peak of titanium appears around 0 5 kev another two intense peaks were observed around 4 3 and 4 8 kev these intense peaks are ascribed to the bulk form of tio2 33 small peaks for sulfur were observed between 2 0 2 5 kev similar sulfur peaks were reported to appear in similar catalysts in the literature 33 36 the edx of bare tio2 is shown in fig s2 the peaks that have been ascribed for sulfur are not observed in bare tio2 pattern which prove the existence of sulfur in the prepared s tio2 catalyst the plot of transformed kubelka munk function versus the energy of the absorbed light is shown in fig 1 e according to eq 1 1 f r 1 r 2 2 r where r is the reflectance and hυ is the photon energy the value of band gap is the intersection of the extrapolating linear portion of f r hν 1 2 versus hυ with the x axis 27 the band gap of s tio2 is 2 42 ev on the other hand the band gap of bare tio2 is 2 97 ev as shown in fig s2 the decreasing of band gap is mainly attributed to the doping of sulfur 26 lower bang gap is expected to enhance the moving of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band and hence the photo catalyst will be more active under visible light 37 3 2 photocatalytic activity of suspended catalyst the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp at initial concentrations of 10 25 and 50 mg l using suspended s tio2 are shown in fig 2 a the photocatalytic experiments conducted using s tio2 dose of 0 8 g l 1 and without ph adjustment preliminary experiments under different ph were carried out to evaluate the effect of ph but no significant improvement was detected moreover the photocatalytic activity at lower ph was inhibited due to the decrease in repulsive forces between catalyst particulates and the increase of agglomeration 38 therefore all photocatalytic experiments in this work were conducted without modification of ph the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp at initial concentrations of 10 25 and 50 mg l using suspended s tio2 are shown in fig 2a the photocatalytic experiments were conducted using suspended s tio2 dose of 0 8 g l 1 the stirring was started in dark for 30 min at the beginning of all experiments but the concentration of 2 4 dcp was almost the same which suggests that any removal will be due to photocatalytic degradation not due to adsorption at initial 2 4 dcp concentration of 10 mg l 1 the degradation was 90 after 180 min the degradation was slightly increased to 94 in the next 60 min at initial concentration of 25 and 50 mg l 1 the degradation efficiencies were 91 and 72 respectively after 240 min of irradiation the decrease in degradation efficiency at higher initial concentration is attributed to the need of additional hydroxyl radicals to react with the additional amount of 2 4 dcp molecules 2 on the other hand if the degradation efficacy is calculated based on the degradation rate not as a percentage of initial concentration then it is considered that the higher efficacy is attained at initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 because 36 mg l 1 of 2 4 dcp were removed in 240 min the degradation trends suggest to extend the irradiation time to get more removal of 2 4 dcp at higher initial concentrations similar experiments were performed using bare tio2 as shown fig s3 it is clear that doping sulfur with tio2 improved the photocatalytic activity due to the decreasing of band gap the influence of catalyst dose was investigated by varying the amount of added catalyst from 0 1 to 0 8 g l 1 at initial 2 4 dcp concentration of 25 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2b using a dose of 0 1 g l 1 attained a limited degradation efficiency of 44 increasing the catalyst dose resulted in higher degradation rates using catalyst doses of 0 25 0 5 and 0 8 g l 1 improved the degradation efficiency to 74 80 and 91 respectively the enhancement of degradation activity resulting from using higher catalyst doses is mostly due to the greater active photocatalyst surface area which leads vigorous generation of hydroxyl radicals 2 however excessive increase in catalyst dose may cause high turbidity levels in water which may detract the block of light from reaching the active sites of catalyst 39 moreover at higher catalyst doses the collision between particles will increase which may promote the agglomeration of catalyst particulates and decrease the active sites 40 thus the optimal dose for the suspended photocatalysis process is considered 0 8 g l 1 in this study 3 3 photocatalytic activity of attached catalyst the performance of 2 4 dcp degradation of at initial concentrations of 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 using attached catalyst are shown in fig 3 at initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency was 82 which was lower than the efficiency of suspended catalyst by 12 after 240 min of irradiation the degradation efficiencies at initial concentrations of 25 and 50 mg l 1 were 66 and 51 respectively the degradation efficiencies are significantly lower than suspended catalysts in the equal irradiation time however the trends of degradation rates indicate that the mineralization of 2 4 dcp could be extended for additional time to get better final efficiency additional experiments were carried out at initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 fig 4 indicated that high degradation rates could be continued for additional 240 min and attain degradation efficiencies higher than 97 the lower efficiency of attached catalyst compared to suspended catalyst is logically attributed to two reasons firstly the interaction between the hydroxyl radicals on the active sites of the catalyst and the 2 4 dcp molecules is limited to the ground of the reactor while in the case of suspended catalyst the interaction takes place in all the reaction volume secondly a big part of the surface area of the catalyst particulates is embedded in polysiloxane layer or agglomerated with other particles which detracts the utilized part of the catalyst moreover the light should penetrate the whole depth of the water to reach the attached catalyst at the bottom of the reactor according to previously explained reasons it is suggested to increase the surface area of the reactor with minimizing the depth to utilize more catalyst surface and to enhance the interaction between the catalyst and contaminant molecules on the other hand the favorability of attached catalyst could be established if the reusability and cost effectiveness have been taken into consideration thus the reusability of attached catalyst is discussed in the next part 3 4 reusability of attached catalyst fig 4 depicts the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp in five consecutive experiments at initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 the experiments were executed in longer periods 480 min and under the same conditions the final degradation efficiency for the 5 cycles were 98 96 90 86 and 80 4 respectively the degradation rate trends in the additional cycles indicate high efficiency and stability of the catalyst even after long periods of photocatalytic processes it is suggested that there is no accumulation or deposition occurred on active photocatalyst surface area and hence hydroxyl radicals were continuously generated during the long time irradiation the decrease in overall degradation efficiency in the third cycle may be attributed to the scouring of photocatalyst surface by the shear and friction forces which have been resulted from the vigorous stirring of water at the bottom of the reactor generally the reusability results indicated that the attached s tio2 by polysiloxane has good stability and high potential for reuse in consecutive manner since the collection of suspended catalysts is very difficult especially nano scale catalysts the use of s tio2 as attached catalyst is favored than suspended catalyst even if attached photocatalytic process requires additional irradiation time because it will minimize the cost of providing new catalyst 3 5 toc removal fig 5 depicts the removal of toc during the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp using suspended and attached catalysts the removal efficiencies of toc after 240 min of irradiation were 74 and 50 using suspended and attached catalysts respectively these results are in accordance with the degradation of 2 4 dcp which previously indicated faster degradation when using suspended catalyst figs 2 3 in both experiments toc was gradually decreased due to the mineralization of 2 4 dcp however the toc removal is lower than 2 4 dcp removal because sequential organic intermediates are formed during the process before the complete degradation to carbon dioxide and water 30 it is reported that parachlorophenol superoxide radical will produced from the oxidation of 2 4 dcp then it will be decomposed to 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone m z 123 and 4 chlorocyclopenta 1 3 dien 1 ol 41 in addition a portion of 2 4 dcp may dechlorinated to mono chlorophenols which were further mineralized to benzenediol 42 moreover the chlorine atom in the para position of the aromatic ring may be replaced by a hydroxyl radical to generate 2 chlorohydroquinone which may be transformed to 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone by further attack of hydroxyl radicals 43 some of the generated intermediates may be oxidized to form maleic oxalic and fumaric acids which may partially degraded to acetic acid and formic acid 44 45 these intermediates cause longer existence of toc in water before they are finally oxidized to benign end products like carbon dioxide and water 3 6 degradation kinetics the kinetics of 2 4 dcp degradation by suspended and attached catalysts were studied by modified langmuir hinshelwood model it has been reported that langmuir hinshelwood model is appropriate to rationalize the degradation of organic contaminants by photocatalysis 46 47 the model links the concentration of the 2 4 dcp c and the degradation rate r in the solution at irradiation time t as expressed by eq 2 48 2 r d c d t k r k a d c 1 k a d c where kr is the rate constant and kad is the adsorption equilibrium constant if the removal by adsorption is not considered or the substrate concentration is relatively small in a photocatalytic reaction eq 1 can be expressed as a pseudo first order equation with an apparent first order rate constant kapp as shown in eq 3 19 3 l n c 0 c k r k a d t k a p p t where c0 is the initial concentration of 2 4 dcp fig 6 depicts the linear relation of ln c0 c and the reaction time kapp and r2 were calculated for suspended and attached catalysts at different initial concentrations of 2 4 dcp and the results are shown in table 1 the degradation rates of 2 4 dcp in suspended catalyst experiments were higher than those in attached catalyst experiments this finding accordance with the previously discussed comparison between suspended and attached catalysts high correlations with langmuir hinshelwood model were observed for the attached catalyst experiments r2 0 991 0 998 on the other hand moderate correlations were observed for those of suspended catalyst r2 0 938 0 994 accordingly langmuir hinshelwood model is suggested to describe the kinetics of 2 4 dcp removal by attached s tio2 3 7 degradation mechanism trapping experiments of active species were carried out by using isopropanol iso as the hydroxyl radical scavenger 49 ammonium oxalate for inhibiting the superoxide radical 50 and ascorbic acid aa as the hole radical scavenger 51 as shown in fig 7 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2 4 dcp 25 mg l with suspended s tio2 0 8 g l was 91 after 4 h after the addition of scavengers the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp under the same conditions was reduced to 52 19 6 and 31 5 by adding 1 mm iso ao and aa respectively the significant influence of iso confirms that hydroxyl radical species plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp was also reduced with the presence of 1 mm ao which suggests that superoxide radical is an important active species in the process of 2 4 dcp degradation moreover the addition of 1 mm ao remarkably reduced 2 4 dcp degradation suggesting that holes contributes to photocatalytic degradation the same trend was observed in the case of attached s tio2 experiments as the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp was reduced to 24 8 7 6 and 15 6 after the addition of 1 mm iso ao and aa respectively as shown in fig 7 b from the above results the superoxide radicals holes and hydroxyl radicals are responsible for the oxidation of 2 4 dcp superoxide radicals and holes contribute in the oxidation process more than hydroxyl radicals 4 conclusions in the present work s tio2 nano sized particles were prepared and used as suspended and attached catalyst for photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp the tem analysis indicated that catalyst particles have diameters ranging from 9 to 20 nm suggesting high surface area at initial concentration of 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 the degradation efficiencies were 94 91 and 72 by suspended catalyst and 82 66 and 51 by attached catalyst respectively however the mineralization of 2 4 dcp by attached catalyst could be extended for additional time to get the same efficiency of suspended catalyst the degradation rates in five sequential cycles were 98 96 90 86 and 80 4 respectively indicating high reusability and stability of the catalyst the removal of toc after 240 min of irradiation were 74 and 50 using suspended and attached catalysts respectively the toc removal rates

14503,in this work a highly visible light active and reusable photocatalyst was synthesized by incorporation of sulfur cations into the lattice of titanium dioxide tio2 the prepared photocatalyst was immobilized on aluminum plates by polysiloxane for repetitive use in photocatalysis experiments suspended and attached catalysts were used for degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp under direct irradiation of a metal halide lamp in contrast the degradation of 2 4 dcp by suspended catalyst was faster than attached catalyst however the trends of degradation rates by attached catalyst indicate that the mineralization of 2 4 dcp could be extended for additional time to attain the same efficiency of suspended catalyst at initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency of 2 4 dcp was higher than 97 after 480 min the degradation rates in five consecutive cycles were 98 96 90 86 and 80 4 indicating high reusability and stability of the catalyst even after long periods of photocatalytic reaction the photocatalytic degradation rates of 2 4 dcp by suspended and attached catalysts were described by langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model keywords 2 4 dcp pesticide photocatalytic polysiloxane wastewater 1 introduction pesticide and herbicide residues exist in aquatic environment as a consequence of excessive use of commercial pesticides in agriculture or careless disposal of packages and containers 1 moreover pesticides could be found in higher concentrations in the liquid waste of agrochemical industries 2 the main problems of pesticides and herbicides are the high toxicity and low biodegradability which make the traditional biological treatment methods inappropriate 3 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp is one of the commonly used toxic organics in the production of pesticides and herbicides 4 liquid 2 4 dcp could be absorbed by skin and it can cause fatal problems like instantaneous renal failure liver damage and various other organ failure 5 advanced oxidation processes aops are reported as the most appropriate methods for treatment of industrial wastewater and degradation of bio resistant organics 6 very strong reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals are produced during the aops in aqueous solutions 7 bio resistant organic molecules are attacked by hydroxyl radicals and gradually degraded to benign intermediate by products and end products such as h2o and co2 8 among aops photocatalysis may be considered the most sustainable and cost efficient process due to low energy consumption and the prospect of utilizing solar light 9 in photocatalytic processes nano scale powders such as tio2 and wo3 are used as a semiconductor materials for production of reactive hydroxyl radicals 10 11 conventional tio2 catalysts are only high active under uv light so they have limited efficiency under solar light 12 however tio2 could be modified by doping various materials to extend the absorption limit from uv region to visible light region which will improve the photocatalytic activity under solar light 13 among those materials sulfur have been recognized as one of the efficient dopants to reduce the band gap of tio2 and enhance its photocatalytic activity in visible region 14 recently many researchers reported the application of novel sulfur doped catalysts for degradation of several organic contaminants tian et al doped sulfer with graphene quantum dots graphene tio2 nanotubes composite to get enhanced photocatalytic activity 15 elbakkay et al prepared a novel composite of sulfur doped tio2 and sulfur doped reduced graphene oxide for photo electro chemical water splitting 16 chen et al prepared cationic s doped tio2 sio2 visible light photocatalyst by co hydrolysis method for degradation of nitrobenzene p chlorophenol and phenol in water under different light sources 17 cheng et al prepared nano tubes of s tio2 tio2 for effective photo electro catalytic degradation of diclofenac 18 most of the reports in the literature used the photocatalyst powders in suspension 19 however some problems are reported to be associated with suspended catalyst such as the high turbidity which may increase the light scattering in the solution and the limited prospect of reuse due to the difficulty of particles collection 20 some researchers tried to immobilize tio2 on glass plates using heat attachment methods to develop photocatalyst plates that could be used in degradation of dyes 21 the photocatalytic efficiency of the immobilized tio2 was promising however the attachment method consumed excessive energy due to the high temperature 20 on the other hand the use of bonding materials such as polysiloxane for the attachment of photocatalyst is not reported in the literature polysiloxane is a non hardening water resistant material that used in several applications and powders could be attached to it with high durability 22 in this work sulfur doped tio2 s tio2 powder was prepared and immobilized on aluminum plates by polysiloxane the prepared s tio2 was employed in suspended and attached state for degradation of 2 4 dcp in water metal halide lamps have been reported to irradiate closer spectral composition to solar light and they have been widely used in solar simulators 23 consequently the experiments were conducted under a metal halide lamp to exploit both uv and visible light the advantages of using the catalyst in attached state have been deeply discussed 2 materials and method 2 1 materials 2 4 dcp 98 methanol and acetic acid were purchased from sigma aldrich taniumisopropoxide ethanol and ferric chloride were obtained from wako japan thiourea was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd all chemicals were of analytical grade and have been used without further modifications 2 2 experimental procedure the synthesis of the s tio2 catalyst was performed according to previously reported work 24 26 thiourea and titaniumisopropoxide and were mixed at a molar ratio of 4 1 in ethanol vigorous stirring of solution was performed by magnetic stirrer for 1 h at room temperature under reduced pressure a white slurry was obtained after evaporation of ethanol the slurry was kept for 48 h at room temperature then the white powder was collected the obtained residuals were calcinated at different temperatures under aerated conditions and yellow powder was resulted the prepared catalyst was immobilized on circular aluminum plates using polysiloxane all the used plates are aluminum grade 3003 with diameter of 65 mm and thickness of 2 mm the weight of the plate was about 18 524 gm first circular aluminum plate was roughed down in a workshop about 1 mm layer of polysiloxane was placed on the plate surface and 1 8 gm of s tio2 powder was distributed carefully the plate was allowed to dry for 24 h in room temperature then it was scrubbed to remove free catalyst particles and washed by distilled water the plate was placed at the bottom of a 250 ml pyrex beaker and 100 ml of contaminated water was added the beaker top is opened and exposed to light at a distance of 150 mm from the source the light source is a 400 w metal halide lamp philips having λmax intensity and photon flux of 510 nm 1 02 10 7 and 220 μw cm 2 respectively emission profile for a typical halide lamp is shown in fig s1 23 the beaker is placed on a magnetic stirrer to attain homogeneous contact between the solution and the attached catalyst during the experiment the same reactor was used for the suspended catalyst without placing the catalyst plate in the beaker 2 3 analytical method 2 4 dcp was quantified by hplc system agilent 1200 series the system includes a quaternary pump an auto sampler and a photodiode array detector the samples were filtered by whatman syringe filters 0 2 μm an aliquot of 25 μl was injected into a column apollo c18 with a diameter of 4 6 mm and length of 150 mm at column temperature 40 c the mobile phase was distilled water methanol acetic acid v v v 39 60 1 at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 1 the peak of 2 4 dcp was detected at a wavelength of 280 nm total organic carbon toc was measured by toc analyzer analytik jena ag co germany a transmission electron microscopy tem image was recorded using fei tecnai g2 f20 microscope operating at 200 kv provided with a carbon grid sample holder the crystalline phases of s tio2 particles were detected by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv with d tex ultra analysis using cu kα radiation the raman spectra were recorded using a rmp 330laser raman spectroscopy system jasco japan in order to select the optimum calcination temperature relative surface areas of calcinated powders were determined by brunauer emmett teller bet analysis using a surface area analyzer micromeritics flowsorb ii2300 energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy was observed by joel jem 2100 the band gap energies of the prepared catalysts were calculated by uv vis spectroscopy using the kubelka munk function by plotting the graph between f r hν 1 2 on y axis and hν on x axis 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of s tio2 the relative surface area of the powder calcinated at 400 c was 88 8 m2 g in general increasing the calcination temperature led to decrease of anatase content and relative surface area the following are the suggested anatase content percentage and relative surface area at different calcination temperature 25 400 c 3 h 88 8 m2 g 100 400 c 10 h 62 1 8 m2 g 100 500 c 3 h 32 8 m2 g 99 500 c 10 h 28 5 m2 g 98 600 c 3 h 12 5 m2 g 51 600 c 10 h 10 9 m2 g 45 700 c 3 h 8 8 m2 g 0 700 c 10 h 7 5 m2 g 0 the catalyst calcinated at 400 c was favored to carry out this work due its high anatase content and relative surface area a tem image of the prepared s tio2 catalyst is shown in fig 1 a the image analysis indicated that the catalyst particles have diameters ranging from 9 to 20 nm the small nano scale particles with random shapes suggest high surface area which is required for enhancing the photocatalytic activity 28 moreover it seems that titania species and sulfur species are crystallized together and they have not agglomerated separately the xrd pattern of the prepared catalyst is shown in fig 1 b an obvious peak was observed at 2θ 25 5 which is attributed in the literature to active anatase tio2 29 additional peaks were observed at 2θ 25 5 37 6 48 1 54 20 55 4 and 62 5 which are attributed to the 1 0 1 0 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 and 2 0 4 planes of anatase phase of titanium oxide jcpds no 21 1272 30 small peak was detected at 2θ 30 5 which may be due to the residual amounts of brookite phase of titania 31 there are no other peaks that could be attributed to other catalyst components in addition the anatase tio2 crystals are of high purity which confirm the dominance of anatase 26 the anatase phase was reported that improves the photocatalytic activity more than other phases like rutile and brookite 31 32 no specific peaks is ascribed to sulfur because its ions are suggested to be uniformly dispersed with the anatase crystallite 33 raman spectra of the prepared s tio2 are shown in fig 1 c raman scattering was detected at 140 cm 1 which is attributed to pure anatase phase 34 in addition three clear peaks were observed at 390 510 and 635 cm 1 which are also attributed to anatase phase of titania 35 the presence of weak peaks at 235 and 315 cm 1 is probably due to the residuals of brookite phase of titania while there are no peaks detected due to rutile phase which comply with the results of xrd analysis the edx pattern is shown in fig 1 d a peak of titanium appears around 0 5 kev another two intense peaks were observed around 4 3 and 4 8 kev these intense peaks are ascribed to the bulk form of tio2 33 small peaks for sulfur were observed between 2 0 2 5 kev similar sulfur peaks were reported to appear in similar catalysts in the literature 33 36 the edx of bare tio2 is shown in fig s2 the peaks that have been ascribed for sulfur are not observed in bare tio2 pattern which prove the existence of sulfur in the prepared s tio2 catalyst the plot of transformed kubelka munk function versus the energy of the absorbed light is shown in fig 1 e according to eq 1 1 f r 1 r 2 2 r where r is the reflectance and hυ is the photon energy the value of band gap is the intersection of the extrapolating linear portion of f r hν 1 2 versus hυ with the x axis 27 the band gap of s tio2 is 2 42 ev on the other hand the band gap of bare tio2 is 2 97 ev as shown in fig s2 the decreasing of band gap is mainly attributed to the doping of sulfur 26 lower bang gap is expected to enhance the moving of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band and hence the photo catalyst will be more active under visible light 37 3 2 photocatalytic activity of suspended catalyst the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp at initial concentrations of 10 25 and 50 mg l using suspended s tio2 are shown in fig 2 a the photocatalytic experiments conducted using s tio2 dose of 0 8 g l 1 and without ph adjustment preliminary experiments under different ph were carried out to evaluate the effect of ph but no significant improvement was detected moreover the photocatalytic activity at lower ph was inhibited due to the decrease in repulsive forces between catalyst particulates and the increase of agglomeration 38 therefore all photocatalytic experiments in this work were conducted without modification of ph the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp at initial concentrations of 10 25 and 50 mg l using suspended s tio2 are shown in fig 2a the photocatalytic experiments were conducted using suspended s tio2 dose of 0 8 g l 1 the stirring was started in dark for 30 min at the beginning of all experiments but the concentration of 2 4 dcp was almost the same which suggests that any removal will be due to photocatalytic degradation not due to adsorption at initial 2 4 dcp concentration of 10 mg l 1 the degradation was 90 after 180 min the degradation was slightly increased to 94 in the next 60 min at initial concentration of 25 and 50 mg l 1 the degradation efficiencies were 91 and 72 respectively after 240 min of irradiation the decrease in degradation efficiency at higher initial concentration is attributed to the need of additional hydroxyl radicals to react with the additional amount of 2 4 dcp molecules 2 on the other hand if the degradation efficacy is calculated based on the degradation rate not as a percentage of initial concentration then it is considered that the higher efficacy is attained at initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 because 36 mg l 1 of 2 4 dcp were removed in 240 min the degradation trends suggest to extend the irradiation time to get more removal of 2 4 dcp at higher initial concentrations similar experiments were performed using bare tio2 as shown fig s3 it is clear that doping sulfur with tio2 improved the photocatalytic activity due to the decreasing of band gap the influence of catalyst dose was investigated by varying the amount of added catalyst from 0 1 to 0 8 g l 1 at initial 2 4 dcp concentration of 25 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2b using a dose of 0 1 g l 1 attained a limited degradation efficiency of 44 increasing the catalyst dose resulted in higher degradation rates using catalyst doses of 0 25 0 5 and 0 8 g l 1 improved the degradation efficiency to 74 80 and 91 respectively the enhancement of degradation activity resulting from using higher catalyst doses is mostly due to the greater active photocatalyst surface area which leads vigorous generation of hydroxyl radicals 2 however excessive increase in catalyst dose may cause high turbidity levels in water which may detract the block of light from reaching the active sites of catalyst 39 moreover at higher catalyst doses the collision between particles will increase which may promote the agglomeration of catalyst particulates and decrease the active sites 40 thus the optimal dose for the suspended photocatalysis process is considered 0 8 g l 1 in this study 3 3 photocatalytic activity of attached catalyst the performance of 2 4 dcp degradation of at initial concentrations of 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 using attached catalyst are shown in fig 3 at initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency was 82 which was lower than the efficiency of suspended catalyst by 12 after 240 min of irradiation the degradation efficiencies at initial concentrations of 25 and 50 mg l 1 were 66 and 51 respectively the degradation efficiencies are significantly lower than suspended catalysts in the equal irradiation time however the trends of degradation rates indicate that the mineralization of 2 4 dcp could be extended for additional time to get better final efficiency additional experiments were carried out at initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 fig 4 indicated that high degradation rates could be continued for additional 240 min and attain degradation efficiencies higher than 97 the lower efficiency of attached catalyst compared to suspended catalyst is logically attributed to two reasons firstly the interaction between the hydroxyl radicals on the active sites of the catalyst and the 2 4 dcp molecules is limited to the ground of the reactor while in the case of suspended catalyst the interaction takes place in all the reaction volume secondly a big part of the surface area of the catalyst particulates is embedded in polysiloxane layer or agglomerated with other particles which detracts the utilized part of the catalyst moreover the light should penetrate the whole depth of the water to reach the attached catalyst at the bottom of the reactor according to previously explained reasons it is suggested to increase the surface area of the reactor with minimizing the depth to utilize more catalyst surface and to enhance the interaction between the catalyst and contaminant molecules on the other hand the favorability of attached catalyst could be established if the reusability and cost effectiveness have been taken into consideration thus the reusability of attached catalyst is discussed in the next part 3 4 reusability of attached catalyst fig 4 depicts the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp in five consecutive experiments at initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 the experiments were executed in longer periods 480 min and under the same conditions the final degradation efficiency for the 5 cycles were 98 96 90 86 and 80 4 respectively the degradation rate trends in the additional cycles indicate high efficiency and stability of the catalyst even after long periods of photocatalytic processes it is suggested that there is no accumulation or deposition occurred on active photocatalyst surface area and hence hydroxyl radicals were continuously generated during the long time irradiation the decrease in overall degradation efficiency in the third cycle may be attributed to the scouring of photocatalyst surface by the shear and friction forces which have been resulted from the vigorous stirring of water at the bottom of the reactor generally the reusability results indicated that the attached s tio2 by polysiloxane has good stability and high potential for reuse in consecutive manner since the collection of suspended catalysts is very difficult especially nano scale catalysts the use of s tio2 as attached catalyst is favored than suspended catalyst even if attached photocatalytic process requires additional irradiation time because it will minimize the cost of providing new catalyst 3 5 toc removal fig 5 depicts the removal of toc during the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp using suspended and attached catalysts the removal efficiencies of toc after 240 min of irradiation were 74 and 50 using suspended and attached catalysts respectively these results are in accordance with the degradation of 2 4 dcp which previously indicated faster degradation when using suspended catalyst figs 2 3 in both experiments toc was gradually decreased due to the mineralization of 2 4 dcp however the toc removal is lower than 2 4 dcp removal because sequential organic intermediates are formed during the process before the complete degradation to carbon dioxide and water 30 it is reported that parachlorophenol superoxide radical will produced from the oxidation of 2 4 dcp then it will be decomposed to 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone m z 123 and 4 chlorocyclopenta 1 3 dien 1 ol 41 in addition a portion of 2 4 dcp may dechlorinated to mono chlorophenols which were further mineralized to benzenediol 42 moreover the chlorine atom in the para position of the aromatic ring may be replaced by a hydroxyl radical to generate 2 chlorohydroquinone which may be transformed to 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone by further attack of hydroxyl radicals 43 some of the generated intermediates may be oxidized to form maleic oxalic and fumaric acids which may partially degraded to acetic acid and formic acid 44 45 these intermediates cause longer existence of toc in water before they are finally oxidized to benign end products like carbon dioxide and water 3 6 degradation kinetics the kinetics of 2 4 dcp degradation by suspended and attached catalysts were studied by modified langmuir hinshelwood model it has been reported that langmuir hinshelwood model is appropriate to rationalize the degradation of organic contaminants by photocatalysis 46 47 the model links the concentration of the 2 4 dcp c and the degradation rate r in the solution at irradiation time t as expressed by eq 2 48 2 r d c d t k r k a d c 1 k a d c where kr is the rate constant and kad is the adsorption equilibrium constant if the removal by adsorption is not considered or the substrate concentration is relatively small in a photocatalytic reaction eq 1 can be expressed as a pseudo first order equation with an apparent first order rate constant kapp as shown in eq 3 19 3 l n c 0 c k r k a d t k a p p t where c0 is the initial concentration of 2 4 dcp fig 6 depicts the linear relation of ln c0 c and the reaction time kapp and r2 were calculated for suspended and attached catalysts at different initial concentrations of 2 4 dcp and the results are shown in table 1 the degradation rates of 2 4 dcp in suspended catalyst experiments were higher than those in attached catalyst experiments this finding accordance with the previously discussed comparison between suspended and attached catalysts high correlations with langmuir hinshelwood model were observed for the attached catalyst experiments r2 0 991 0 998 on the other hand moderate correlations were observed for those of suspended catalyst r2 0 938 0 994 accordingly langmuir hinshelwood model is suggested to describe the kinetics of 2 4 dcp removal by attached s tio2 3 7 degradation mechanism trapping experiments of active species were carried out by using isopropanol iso as the hydroxyl radical scavenger 49 ammonium oxalate for inhibiting the superoxide radical 50 and ascorbic acid aa as the hole radical scavenger 51 as shown in fig 7 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2 4 dcp 25 mg l with suspended s tio2 0 8 g l was 91 after 4 h after the addition of scavengers the removal efficiency of 2 4 dcp under the same conditions was reduced to 52 19 6 and 31 5 by adding 1 mm iso ao and aa respectively the significant influence of iso confirms that hydroxyl radical species plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp was also reduced with the presence of 1 mm ao which suggests that superoxide radical is an important active species in the process of 2 4 dcp degradation moreover the addition of 1 mm ao remarkably reduced 2 4 dcp degradation suggesting that holes contributes to photocatalytic degradation the same trend was observed in the case of attached s tio2 experiments as the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp was reduced to 24 8 7 6 and 15 6 after the addition of 1 mm iso ao and aa respectively as shown in fig 7 b from the above results the superoxide radicals holes and hydroxyl radicals are responsible for the oxidation of 2 4 dcp superoxide radicals and holes contribute in the oxidation process more than hydroxyl radicals 4 conclusions in the present work s tio2 nano sized particles were prepared and used as suspended and attached catalyst for photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dcp the tem analysis indicated that catalyst particles have diameters ranging from 9 to 20 nm suggesting high surface area at initial concentration of 10 25 and 50 mg l 1 the degradation efficiencies were 94 91 and 72 by suspended catalyst and 82 66 and 51 by attached catalyst respectively however the mineralization of 2

14504,nitrogen discharged from wastewater treatment plants contributes greatly to the eutrophication of receiving water bodies the multiple anoxic and aerobic ao process can enhance nitrogen removal while the concomitant emission of nitrous oxide n2o attracts growing attention nitrogen removal and n2o emission in a constant flow multiple ao process were evaluated the effects of dissolved oxygen do carbon source as well as feeding mode on n2o emission were investigated the removal percentages of ammonia and total nitrogen were 99 8 and 74 1 respectively limited do the presence of organic carbon and high nitrite concentrations enhanced n2o emission during nitrification endogenous denitrification of nitrite showed a high n2o emission potential especially for one time dosing of nitrite nosz encoding n2o reductase was widely distributed in proteobacteria 39 6 β proteobacteria 31 6 and the genera of ralstonia 20 0 the study suggested that high do concentration and the absence of organic carbon during nitrification avoidance of endogenous denitrifying nitrite during denitrification and the constant feeding operation mode were all beneficial to minimize n2o emission keywords constant flow low do multiple ao microbial community n2o reductase 1 introduction nitrogen containing wastewater discharged into water bodies would cause the proliferation of algae further resulting in eutrophication 1 in conventional biological nitrogen removal processes ammonium nitrogen nh4 n is oxidized to nitrite nitrogen no2 n by autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and further to nitrate nitrogen no3 n by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob no3 n is then reduced to no2 n nitric oxide nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 sequentially by heterotrophic denitrifiers accompanied with the utilization of organic carbon 2 in order to improve nitrogen removal efficiency it is suggested to oxidize ammonia to nitrite firstly and then reduce nitrite to n2o or n2 directly which is the theory of partial nitrification and denitrification pnd 3 4 the multiple anoxic and aerobic ao process has been reported as an enhanced nitrogen removal process via pnd 5 however nitrite accumulation during pnd in the multiple ao process would probably stimulate n2o emission as nitrite is the precursor of n2o and the inhibitor of n2o reductase 6 7 n2o is a typical greenhouse gas and the major ozone depleting substance with the global warming potential 298 times of carbon dioxide and the lifecycle is up to 114 years in the atmosphere 8 9 therefore the emission of n2o has drawn increasing concern recently n2o can only be removed through the reduction catalyzed by the n2o reductase the function gene nosz encoding n2o reductase is widely distributed in heterotrophic denitrifiers 10 for denitrifiers without the genes nosz the final denitrification product is n2o 11 therefore further study on the distribution of microbial community and especially the gene nosz is helpful to explore n2o mitigation strategies the transition between anoxic and aerobic conditions and other dynamic changes may enhance n2o emission 12 13 wang et al 14 found that 10 1 of the influent ammonia was emitted as n2o in an intermittent anoxic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr by contrast some researchers recognized that n2o emission in the continuous and stable process was lower than that in the sbr process 7 15 in an anoxic oxic continuous stirred tank reactor with a do concentration lower than 2 mg l and a long anoxic duration n2o could be almost completely denitrified to n2 even though nitrite accumulation ratio reached at 70 80 16 therefore it s hypothesized that the constant flow operation mode could decrease the n2o emission in the multiple ao process while few researches have been conducted in this study a constant flow multiple ao process was operated under the condition of low do concentration nitrogen removal and n2o emission were investigated under different do concentrations electron acceptors and feeding modes in addition the distribution characteristics of microbial community and gene nosz were analyzed finally strategies for the minimization of n2o

percentages of cod nh4 n and po4 p were 95 2 99 8 and 99 7 respectively in this multiple ao system nh4 n was diluted in the anaerobic tank and mainly removed in oxic tanks with contributions of 30 6 37 5 and 22 3 in oxic tanks i ii and iii respectively in the anaerobic tank and anoxic tank i and ii the removed nox n no2 n plus no3 n accounted for 62 3 13 7 and 22 1 of the total nox n removed denitrification was the main pathway for nitrogen removal with a proportion of 48 nitrogen discharged in effluent and wasted sludge contributed to 23 0 and 22 7 of the total load respectively the tn removal percentage was 74 1 similarly 86 of tn was removed through pnd in a continuous plug flow process under alternating anoxic and oxic conditions and step feeding mode 19 in a sequential multiple ao process 73 1 85 8 of tn was removed under different anoxic to aerobic duration ratios 20 3 2 n2o emission during nitrification nitrogen dynamics during nitrification under different do concentrations heterotrophic activity and no2 n concentrations are shown in figs s1 s2 and s3 respectively the corresponding kinetics are listed in table 2 under the condition of high do concentration hdo nh4 n oxidation rate rnh4 n no2 n accumulation rate rno2 n and no3 n production rate rno3 n were all higher than those at the low do concentration ldo the decline of rnh4 n and rno3 n with the decrease of do concentration demonstrated that the activity of aob was limited by low do concentrations theoretically nh4 n would be completely oxidized to no2 n and no3 n during nitrification so rnh4 n should be equal to the accumulation rate of nox n rnox n in this study the ratio of rnox n to rnh4 n was 94 7 under hdo and 59 7 under ldo it appeared that the denitrifying activity was inhibited under hdo conditions while relatively high under ldo conditions previous researches proved that denitrifiers could utilize internal organic carbon and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurred under low do concentrations 21 the n2o emission factor under ldo was 1 1 which was 82 higher than that of hdo condition 0 6 indicating that n2o reductase was sensitive to do 22 and the production of n2o was enhanced under low do conditions some autotrophic nitrifiers such as nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosomonas eutropha typical aob can denitrify nitrite under oxygen limited conditions with n2o as the main product and this process is named as nitrifier aerobic denitrification 23 24 when the do concentration was relatively low 0 1 2 0 mg l more n2o was generated mainly from nitrifier denitrification as the activity of n2o reductase was inhibited 24 a similar research found that the n2o emission factor in a nitrifying system decreased from 10 6 to 2 4 when do concentration increased from 0 2 to 3 0 mg l and n2o was mainly emitted through nitrifier denitrification 25 from previous researches 2 15 the emission factor of n2o varied a lot in different wastewater treatment processes or under different do concentrations after the long term acclimation of the constant flow operation microorganisms tented to produce less n2o rnh4 n of the batch reactor with pre aeration was higher than that with anaerobic agitation the activity of ammonia oxidase was inhibited under anaerobic agitation while gradually recovered when transferred to aerobic condition 26 rnh4 n under the addition of carbon source was always higher than that without the addition of carbon source because of the consumption of ammonia by heterotrophs besides with the addition of carbon source rnh4 n was obvious higher than rnox n the obvious nitrogen loss was caused by heterotrophic denitrification resulting in tn removal percentages of 45 6 and 43 6 for the pretreatments of aeration and anaerobic agitation respectively with the addition of carbon source n2o emission factors under the pretreatment of aeration and anaerobic agitation were 18 8 and 23 2 respectively significantly higher than 0 9 and 0 8 without the addition of carbon source it indicated that the activity of heterotrophic denitrification had a great impact on n2o emission during nitrification while the different pretreatment exerted little impact on n2o emission under aerobic conditions the inhibition of oxygen on the heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate nitrite and n2o was different where the denitrification of n2o was inhibited much more seriously than nitrate and nitrite resulting in incomplete denitrification and the net production of n2o 27 28 in nitrification with different no2 n dosage rnh4 n decreased as the dosage of no2 n increased from 5 to 20 mg l under diverse no2 n dosages rnox n rnh4 n were always higher than 96 2 indicating low denitrification activities the n2o emission factor increased linearly with an increase of no2 n dosage r2 0 98 demonstrating that a high concentration of no2 n would accelerate the emission of n2o the results were in accordance with kim et al 29 and mannina et al 30 where n2o emitted in the ammonia oxidation system increased obviously after the addition of nitrite mainly through nitrifier denitrification by aob 3 3 n2o emission during denitrification dynamics of nitrogen during denitrification with exogenous carbon source are shown in figs s4 and s5 and those with endogenous carbon source are shown in figs s6 and s7 the corresponding kinetics are listed in table 3 denitrification rates of no2 n and no3 n with exogenous carbon source were 6 42 and 6 14 mg g vss h and were 3 88 and 4 71 mg g vss h with endogenous carbon source particularly the denitrification rates with exogenous carbon source were 65 5 and 30 4 higher than those of endogenous carbon source when using no2 n and no3 n as the electron acceptor respectively it showed that the accumulation of nitrite during endogenous denitrification was higher than that under exogenous conditions as the proceeding of denitrification dissolved n2o increased gradually which accounted for 61 8 and 47 4 of no2 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with the n2o emission factors of 3 7 and 4 7 by contrast dissolved n2o n accounted for 39 4 and 14 7 of no3 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with the n2o emission factors of 2 2 and 1 7 under continuous dosing conditions the denitrification rates of no2 n and no3 n with exogenous carbon source were 6 35 and 7 21 mg g vss h and were 2 38 and 4 63 mg g vss h with endogenous carbon source the no2 n accumulation rate during endogenous denitrification of no3 n was 11 1 times of exogenous denitrification dissolved n2o n accounted for 56 0 and 56 4 of no2 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with the n2o emission factors of 2 9 and 3 8 by contrast dissolved n2o n accounted for 25 2 and 2 3 of no3 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with n2o emission factors of 1 2 and 0 4 compared with nitrate denitrification n2o emission was obviously stimulated under nitrite denitrification conditions it was demonstrated that high concentration of nitrite could inhibit the activity of n2o reductase 31 33 a majority of researches indicated that the accumulation of nitrite tend to accelerate n2o production 2 34 30 13 in addition the degradation rate of endogenous carbon source phb was relatively slower than exogenous carbon sources naac when denitrification with endogenous carbon source the denitrifying enzymes of no3 n could out compete that of no2 n resulting in the accumulation of no2 n and high emission of n2o n 9 35 as shown in this study dosing mode influenced the generation and emission of n2o the accumulations of dissolved and gaseous n2o under the one time dosing mode were always higher than that of the continuous dosing mode liang et al 36 and pijuan et al 15 also found lower n2o emission in continuous feeding systems than batch feeding system under continuous dosing mode nitrogen concentration was lower than the one time dosing mode especially for the lower accumulation of nitrite or free nitrite acid which could inhibit the activity of n2o reductase resulting in the decrease of n2o emission eventually 3 4 microbial community and nosz distribution microbial community was analyzed as shown in fig 2 the most abundant microorganisms at the phylum level were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes with the proportions of 33 5 29 1 and 13 8 respectively the dominant microorganisms at the class level were β proteobacteria δ proteobacteria cytophagia saprospirae and phycisphaerae with the proportions of 18 3 10 8 10 2 9 9 and 6 1 respectively β proteobacteria was related to nutrients removal and denitrifiers were mainly distributed in this class 10 at the genus level nitrospira and the unclassified nitrosomonadaceae were the main nitrifiers which accounted for 2 6 and 0 6 respectively it was found that low do and short hrt were beneficial for the growth of nitrospira 37 potential denitrifiers such as unclassified saprospiraceae proteiniclasticum thauera and dechloromonas 38 were identified in the present study with relative abundances of 3 7 1 0 0 9 and 0 8 dechloromonas could synthesize intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate from sodium acetate which tended to be enriched when denitrification with naac 39 the abundance of unclassified comamonadaceae was 1 0 in this study which was considered to be responsible for the reduction of nitrate and could survive under low do concentrations 10 40 in addition less abundant microorganisms in the present system such as flavobacterium pseudomonas zoogloea unclassified haliangiaceae comamonas and thermomonas were also identified as denitrifiers and contributed to nitrogen removal 41 42 for microorganisms containing gene nosz 39 6 of which were distributed in the phylum of proteobacteria and 31 6 in the class of β proteobacteria which was in accordance with the result of 16s rrna similarly more than 80 of nosz distributed in the phylum of proteobacteria and 70 in the class of β proteobacteria in a step feeding multiple ao process 18 the distribution of nosz at the genus level is shown in fig 3 gene nosz mainly distributed in the genera of ralstonia paracoccus acidovorax thauera and cupriavidus with relative abundances of 20 0 7 2 6 7 3 5 and 1 4 respectively according to the result of 16s rrna thauera was the main denitrifier containing nosz it was reported that paracoccus was a complete denitrifier while only a few strains of ralstonia and thauera were complete denitrifiers 43 it was revealed that the abundance of denitrifiers containing nosz such as paracoccus acidovorax dechloromonas and rhizobium was higher in continuous system than in batch feeding system 36 which was related to the high nitrogen removal efficiency and lower n2o emission in continuous feeding systems 3 5 mitigation strategies for n2o emission n2o could be generated during nitrification and denitrification with the most important influencing factors of low do high nitrite and inadequate carbon source 2 44 13 from the results of batch nitrification experiments n2o emission was positively correlated to nitrite concentration so it was essential to prevent the nitrite accumulation the activity of nob could be inhibited under low do concentrations which would result in the accumulation of nitrite and then increase in the n2o emission from previous researches high n2o emission was observed especially under the condition of low do concentration 14 in addition the presence of organic carbon in the nitrification system would cause competition between autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophs resulting in incomplete heterotrophic denitrification 45 it was demonstrated that heterotrophic denitrification of nitrite was the main cause of n2o emission in autotrophic partial nitrification 46 therefore increasing do concentrations and avoiding the presence of organic carbon in nitrifying systems could mitigate the n2o emission from the results of batch denitrification experiments emission factors of n2o during nitrite denitrification were extremely high especially during endogenous denitrification similarly it was found that the increase of phb utilization could enhance n2o accumulation substantially 47 therefore avoiding endogenous nitrite denitrification could be applied to the mitigation of n2o emission during denitrification besides feeding mode was also essential for the diminishment of n2o emission under constant feeding mode nitrogen was gradually and continuously dosed which generating relatively low nitrogen concentrations and nitrite accumulation therefore low n2o emission could be maintained as the less inhibition of n2o reductase 4 conclusions nh4 n and tn removal percentages reached 99 8 and 74 1 in the constant flow multiple ao process limited do the presence of organic carbon and high nitrite concentration enhanced n2o emission during nitrification the highest n2o emission factor was obtained during endogenous denitrification with the one time dosing of nitrite the genera of nitrospira and unclassified nitrosomonadaceae were the main nitrifiers gene nosz mainly distributed in the phylum of proteobacteria the class of β proteobacteria and the genera of ralstonia for the minimization of n2o emission it is suggested to increase the concentration of do and reduce the presence of organic carbon during nitrification avoid endogenous nitrite

14504,nitrogen discharged from wastewater treatment plants contributes greatly to the eutrophication of receiving water bodies the multiple anoxic and aerobic ao process can enhance nitrogen removal while the concomitant emission of nitrous oxide n2o attracts growing attention nitrogen removal and n2o emission in a constant flow multiple ao process were evaluated the effects of dissolved oxygen do carbon source as well as feeding mode on n2o emission were investigated the removal percentages of ammonia and total nitrogen were 99 8 and 74 1 respectively limited do the presence of organic carbon and high nitrite concentrations enhanced n2o emission during nitrification endogenous denitrification of nitrite showed a high n2o emission potential especially for one time dosing of nitrite nosz encoding n2o reductase was widely distributed in proteobacteria 39 6 β proteobacteria 31 6 and the genera of ralstonia 20 0 the study suggested that high do concentration and the absence of organic carbon during nitrification avoidance of endogenous denitrifying nitrite during denitrification and the constant feeding operation mode were all beneficial to minimize n2o emission keywords constant flow low do multiple ao microbial community n2o reductase 1 introduction nitrogen containing wastewater discharged into water bodies would cause the proliferation of algae further resulting in eutrophication 1 in conventional biological nitrogen removal processes ammonium nitrogen nh4 n is oxidized to nitrite nitrogen no2 n by autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and further to nitrate nitrogen no3 n by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob no3 n is then reduced to no2 n nitric oxide nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 sequentially by heterotrophic denitrifiers accompanied with the utilization of organic carbon 2 in order to improve nitrogen removal efficiency it is suggested to oxidize ammonia to nitrite firstly and then reduce nitrite to n2o or n2 directly which is the theory of partial nitrification and denitrification pnd 3 4 the multiple anoxic and aerobic ao process has been reported as an enhanced nitrogen removal process via pnd 5 however nitrite accumulation during pnd in the multiple ao process would probably stimulate n2o emission as nitrite is the precursor of n2o and the inhibitor of n2o reductase 6 7 n2o is a typical greenhouse gas and the major ozone depleting substance with the global warming potential 298 times of carbon dioxide and the lifecycle is up to 114 years in the atmosphere 8 9 therefore the emission of n2o has drawn increasing concern recently n2o can only be removed through the reduction catalyzed by the n2o reductase the function gene nosz encoding n2o reductase is widely distributed in heterotrophic denitrifiers 10 for denitrifiers without the genes nosz the final denitrification product is n2o 11 therefore further study on the distribution of microbial community and especially the gene nosz is helpful to explore n2o mitigation strategies the transition between anoxic and aerobic conditions and other dynamic changes may enhance n2o emission 12 13 wang et al 14 found that 10 1 of the influent ammonia was emitted as n2o in an intermittent anoxic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr by contrast some researchers recognized that n2o emission in the continuous and stable process was lower than that in the sbr process 7 15 in an anoxic oxic continuous stirred tank reactor with a do concentration lower than 2 mg l and a long anoxic duration n2o could be almost completely denitrified to n2 even though nitrite accumulation ratio reached at 70 80 16 therefore it s hypothesized that the constant flow operation mode could decrease the n2o emission in the multiple ao process while few researches have been conducted in this study a constant flow multiple ao process was operated under the condition of low do concentration nitrogen removal and n2o emission were investigated under different do

percentages of cod nh4 n and po4 p were 95 2 99 8 and 99 7 respectively in this multiple ao system nh4 n was diluted in the anaerobic tank and mainly removed in oxic tanks with contributions of 30 6 37 5 and 22 3 in oxic tanks i ii and iii respectively in the anaerobic tank and anoxic tank i and ii the removed nox n no2 n plus no3 n accounted for 62 3 13 7 and 22 1 of the total nox n removed denitrification was the main pathway for nitrogen removal with a proportion of 48 nitrogen discharged in effluent and wasted sludge contributed to 23 0 and 22 7 of the total load respectively the tn removal percentage was 74 1 similarly 86 of tn was removed through pnd in a continuous plug flow process under alternating anoxic and oxic conditions and step feeding mode 19 in a sequential multiple ao process 73 1 85 8 of tn was removed under different anoxic to aerobic duration ratios 20 3 2 n2o emission during nitrification nitrogen dynamics during nitrification under different do concentrations heterotrophic activity and no2 n concentrations are shown in figs s1 s2 and s3 respectively the corresponding kinetics are listed in table 2 under the condition of high do concentration hdo nh4 n oxidation rate rnh4 n no2 n accumulation rate rno2 n and no3 n production rate rno3 n were all higher than those at the low do concentration ldo the decline of rnh4 n and rno3 n with the decrease of do concentration demonstrated that the activity of aob was limited by low do concentrations theoretically nh4 n would be completely oxidized to no2 n and no3 n during nitrification so rnh4 n should be equal to the accumulation rate of nox n rnox n in this study the ratio of rnox n to rnh4 n was 94 7 under hdo and 59 7 under ldo it appeared that the denitrifying activity was inhibited under hdo conditions while relatively high under ldo conditions previous researches proved that denitrifiers could utilize internal organic carbon and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurred under low do concentrations 21 the n2o emission factor under ldo was 1 1 which was 82 higher than that of hdo condition 0 6 indicating that n2o reductase was sensitive to do 22 and the production of n2o was enhanced under low do conditions some autotrophic nitrifiers such as nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosomonas eutropha typical aob can denitrify nitrite under oxygen limited conditions with n2o as the main product and this process is named as nitrifier aerobic denitrification 23 24 when the do concentration was relatively low 0 1 2 0 mg l more n2o was generated mainly from nitrifier denitrification as the activity of n2o reductase was inhibited 24 a similar research found that the n2o emission factor in a nitrifying system decreased from 10 6 to 2 4 when do concentration increased from 0 2 to 3 0 mg l and n2o was mainly emitted through nitrifier denitrification 25 from previous researches 2 15 the emission factor of n2o varied a lot in different wastewater treatment processes or under different do concentrations after the long term acclimation of the constant flow operation microorganisms tented to produce less n2o rnh4 n of the batch reactor with pre aeration was higher than that with anaerobic agitation the activity of ammonia oxidase was inhibited under anaerobic agitation while gradually recovered when transferred to aerobic condition 26 rnh4 n under the addition of carbon source was always higher than that without the addition of carbon source because of the consumption of ammonia by heterotrophs besides with the addition of carbon source rnh4 n was obvious higher than rnox n the obvious nitrogen loss was caused by heterotrophic denitrification resulting in tn removal percentages of 45 6 and 43 6 for the pretreatments of aeration and anaerobic agitation respectively with the addition of carbon source n2o emission factors under the pretreatment of aeration and anaerobic agitation were 18 8 and 23 2 respectively significantly higher than 0 9 and 0 8 without the addition of carbon source it indicated that the activity of heterotrophic denitrification had a great impact on n2o emission during nitrification while the different pretreatment exerted little impact on n2o emission under aerobic conditions the inhibition of oxygen on the heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate nitrite and n2o was different where the denitrification of n2o was inhibited much more seriously than nitrate and nitrite resulting in incomplete denitrification and the net production of n2o 27 28 in nitrification with different no2 n dosage rnh4 n decreased as the dosage of no2 n increased from 5 to 20 mg l under diverse no2 n dosages rnox n rnh4 n were always higher than 96 2 indicating low denitrification activities the n2o emission factor increased linearly with an increase of no2 n dosage r2 0 98 demonstrating that a high concentration of no2 n would accelerate the emission of n2o the results were in accordance with kim et al 29 and mannina et al 30 where n2o emitted in the ammonia oxidation system increased obviously after the addition of nitrite mainly through nitrifier denitrification by aob 3 3 n2o emission during denitrification dynamics of nitrogen during denitrification with exogenous carbon source are shown in figs s4 and s5 and those with endogenous carbon source are shown in figs s6 and s7 the corresponding kinetics are listed in table 3 denitrification rates of no2 n and no3 n with exogenous carbon source were 6 42 and 6 14 mg g vss h and were 3 88 and 4 71 mg g vss h with endogenous carbon source particularly the denitrification rates with exogenous carbon source were 65 5 and 30 4 higher than those of endogenous carbon source when using no2 n and no3 n as the electron acceptor respectively it showed that the accumulation of nitrite during endogenous denitrification was higher than that under exogenous conditions as the proceeding of denitrification dissolved n2o increased gradually which accounted for 61 8 and 47 4 of no2 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with the n2o emission factors of 3 7 and 4 7 by contrast dissolved n2o n accounted for 39 4 and 14 7 of no3 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with the n2o emission factors of 2 2 and 1 7 under continuous dosing conditions the denitrification rates of no2 n and no3 n with exogenous carbon source were 6 35 and 7 21 mg g vss h and were 2 38 and 4 63 mg g vss h with endogenous carbon source the no2 n accumulation rate during endogenous denitrification of no3 n was 11 1 times of exogenous denitrification dissolved n2o n accounted for 56 0 and 56 4 of no2 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with the n2o emission factors of 2 9 and 3 8 by contrast dissolved n2o n accounted for 25 2 and 2 3 of no3 n denitrified using exogenous and endogenous carbon source respectively with n2o emission factors of 1 2 and 0 4 compared with nitrate denitrification n2o emission was obviously stimulated under nitrite denitrification conditions it was demonstrated that high concentration of nitrite could inhibit the activity of n2o reductase 31 33 a majority of researches indicated that the accumulation of nitrite tend to accelerate n2o production 2 34 30 13 in addition the degradation rate of endogenous carbon source phb was relatively slower than exogenous carbon sources naac when denitrification with endogenous carbon source the denitrifying enzymes of no3 n could out compete that of no2 n resulting in the accumulation of no2 n and high emission of n2o n 9 35 as shown in this study dosing mode influenced the generation and emission of n2o the accumulations of dissolved and gaseous n2o under the one time dosing mode were always higher than that of the continuous dosing mode liang et al 36 and pijuan et al 15 also found lower n2o emission in continuous feeding systems than batch feeding system under continuous dosing mode nitrogen concentration was lower than the one time dosing mode especially for the lower accumulation of nitrite or free nitrite acid which could inhibit the activity of n2o reductase resulting in the decrease of n2o emission eventually 3 4 microbial community and nosz distribution microbial community was analyzed as shown in fig 2 the most abundant microorganisms at the phylum level were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and planctomycetes with the proportions of 33 5 29 1 and 13 8 respectively the dominant microorganisms at the class level were β proteobacteria δ proteobacteria cytophagia saprospirae and phycisphaerae with the proportions of 18 3 10 8 10 2 9 9 and 6 1 respectively β proteobacteria was related to nutrients removal and denitrifiers were mainly distributed in this class 10 at the genus level nitrospira and the unclassified nitrosomonadaceae were the main nitrifiers which accounted for 2 6 and 0 6 respectively it was found that low do and short hrt were beneficial for the growth of nitrospira 37 potential denitrifiers such as unclassified saprospiraceae proteiniclasticum thauera and dechloromonas 38 were identified in the present study with relative abundances of 3 7 1 0 0 9 and 0 8 dechloromonas could synthesize intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate from sodium acetate which tended to be enriched when denitrification with naac 39 the abundance of unclassified comamonadaceae was 1 0 in this study which was considered to be responsible for the reduction of nitrate and could survive under low do concentrations 10 40 in addition less abundant microorganisms in the present system such as flavobacterium pseudomonas zoogloea unclassified haliangiaceae comamonas and thermomonas were also identified as denitrifiers and contributed to nitrogen removal 41 42 for microorganisms containing gene nosz 39 6 of which were distributed in the phylum of proteobacteria and 31 6 in the class of β proteobacteria which was in accordance with the result of 16s rrna similarly more than 80 of nosz distributed in the phylum of proteobacteria and 70 in the class of β proteobacteria in a step feeding multiple ao process 18 the distribution of nosz at the genus level is shown in fig 3 gene nosz mainly distributed in the genera of ralstonia paracoccus acidovorax thauera and cupriavidus with relative abundances of 20 0 7 2 6 7 3 5 and 1 4 respectively according to the result of 16s rrna thauera was the main denitrifier containing nosz it was reported that paracoccus was a complete denitrifier while only a few strains of ralstonia and thauera were complete denitrifiers 43 it was revealed that the abundance of denitrifiers containing nosz such as paracoccus acidovorax dechloromonas and rhizobium was higher in continuous system than in batch feeding system 36 which was related to the high nitrogen removal efficiency and lower n2o emission in continuous feeding systems 3 5 mitigation strategies for n2o emission n2o could be generated during nitrification and denitrification with the most important influencing factors of low do high nitrite and inadequate carbon source 2 44 13 from the results of batch nitrification experiments n2o emission was positively correlated to nitrite concentration so it was essential to prevent the nitrite accumulation the activity of nob could be inhibited under low do concentrations which would result in the accumulation of nitrite and then increase in the n2o emission from previous researches high n2o emission was observed especially under the condition of low do concentration 14 in addition the presence of organic carbon in the nitrification system would cause competition between autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophs resulting in incomplete heterotrophic denitrification 45 it was demonstrated that heterotrophic denitrification of nitrite was the main cause of n2o emission in autotrophic partial nitrification 46 therefore increasing do concentrations and avoiding the presence of organic carbon in nitrifying systems could mitigate the n2o emission from the results of batch denitrification experiments emission factors of n2o during nitrite denitrification were extremely high especially during endogenous denitrification similarly it was found that the increase of phb utilization could enhance n2o accumulation substantially 47 therefore avoiding endogenous nitrite denitrification could be applied to the mitigation of n2o emission during denitrification besides feeding mode was also essential for the diminishment of n2o emission under constant feeding mode nitrogen was gradually and continuously dosed which generating relatively low nitrogen concentrations and nitrite accumulation therefore low n2o emission could be maintained as the less inhibition of n2o reductase 4 conclusions nh4 n and tn removal percentages reached 99 8 and 74 1 in the constant flow multiple ao process limited do the presence of organic carbon and high nitrite concentration enhanced n2o emission during nitrification the highest n2o emission factor was obtained during endogenous denitrification with the one time dosing of nitrite the genera of nitrospira and unclassified nitrosomonadaceae were the main nitrifiers gene nosz mainly distributed in the phylum of proteobacteria the class of β proteobacteria and the genera of ralstonia for the minimization of n2o emission it is suggested to increase the concentration of do and reduce the presence of organic carbon during nitrification avoid endogenous nitrite denitrification during denitrification and operate the system under constant feeding mode acknowledgements this research was supported by the major science and technology program for water pollution
