8215,study area kikuletwa catchment upper pangani river basin tanzania study focus this study compared yearly blue and green water fluxes using four different methods senay s method sn senay et al 2016 van eekelen method ek van eekelen et al 2015 the budyko method simons et al 2020 and the soil water balance swb model fao and ihe delft 2019 the yearly blue and green water fluxes of different land use land cover lulc classes were estimated using an ensemble of seven global remote sensing based evapotranspiration products ensemble et and the chirps rainfall dataset the ensemble et was created from seven global rs based surface energy balance models gleam cmrs et ssebop alexi sebs etmonitor and mod16 new hydrological insights our study found that the ek method was able to map blue and green water fluxes with realistic results for irrigated and non irrigation cultivated areas budyko and swb gave too high blue water fluxes for the non irrigated agricultural areas whereas the budyko and swb models were not able to show a clear difference in blue water fluxes in irrigated versus non irrigated areas on the other hand the sn method estimated no blue water fluxes in more than half of the identified irrigated areas three of the four methods estimate the highest blue water fluxes 318 582 mm y in forested areas while the swb model estimates the highest blue water fluxes in irrigated banana and coffee 278 mm y overall we conclude that the ek method yielded the most realistic spatial pattern of blue water fluxes when compared to the irrigated land use map whereas swb could be considered after further calibration if higher temporal data resolution e g monthly is required keywords evapotranspiration water fluxes water management land use land cover 1 introduction water is an increasingly scarce resource globally and life and livelihoods are threatened due to lack of access to safe and affordable water for domestic agriculture and industrial uses agriculture and food production are by far the largest consumer of available blue water resources 70 of total water withdrawals globally fao 2017 hereby blue water is defined as the water situated in rivers lakes wetlands and shallow aquifers however these estimates of water consumption do not take into consideration the direct use of rainfall green water in agricultural food production luo and tao 2016 green water is the water stored in the root zone soil moisture as the result of precipitation and it can be used in rainfed and irrigated agriculture it is important to make this distinction as interventions to improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture needed to deal with the looming water scarcity vastly differ between blue and green water uses hoekstra 2019 further water resources management can benefit from estimating blue and green water fluxes aggregated by land use land cover lulc types for example to develop water budgets monitor aquifer depletion monitor water rights compliance and to optimize irrigation anderson et al 2012 since this data cannot be measured directly in the field several methods have been developed to estimate blue and green water fluxes however these methods have not been compared or evaluated systematically most of the methods have been applied to croplands from regional scale chukalla et al 2015 nouri et al 2019 to global scale hoekstra et al 2011 liu and yang 2010 van eekelen et al 2015 and velpuri and senay 2017 developed methods for assessing blue and green water fluxes for various lulcs such as natural forest shrublands and commercial forest plantations in particular the last class is applicable to countries such as south africa which lists water use of commercial forest plantations in its policies as part of streamflow reducing activities albaugh et al 2013 this importance is highlighted by van eekelen et al 2015 who estimated that natural forest and commercial forest plantations in the incomati basin in south africa consume between 391 and 433 mm y of blue water similarly velpuri and senay 2017 found for the united states of america that evergreen broadleaf forest is the largest blue water consumer 350 mm year the methods for estimating blue and green water fluxes can be grouped into two categories data based approaches and modelling approaches data based approaches use rainfall p and evapotranspiration et data sets senay et al 2016 assume that in semi arid conditions p 300 mm year most of the rainfall evaporates so if et exceeds p irrigation water from ground or surface is applied blue water fluxes they state that this method is only applicable in semi arid irrigated areas van eekelen et al 2015 on other hand applied an effective rainfall factor assuming not all rainfall will be stored in the unsaturated zone to be available for uptake by plants green water fluxes the authors applied the method for annual timescales at both catchment and field scale using both ground data and remote sensing data similarly budyko developed a simple approach for catchment scale blue and green water fluxes analysis based on climatological characteristics of the study area budyko 1974 which combines data on p et and the aridity index eto p where eto is reference evapotranspiration model based approaches for estimating blue and green water fluxes consist of adaptations to hydrological models hanasaki et al 2010 kiptala et al 2014 soil water balance models fao and ihe delft 2019 crop models chukalla et al 2015 karandish and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 zhuo et al 2016 and phenology based models velpuri and senay 2017 hanasaki et al 2010 estimated blue and green water fluxes by tracing the sources of blue water from the hydrological cycle using the global water resource model h08 the blue water estimates were further categorized into three subgroups stream flow medium size reservoirs 50 50 km and non renewable and non local blue water the approach assumes that irrigated cropland always receives its full irrigation water requirement which may result in an overestimation of the blue water also based on these assumptions water withdrawal from rivers may exceed the environmental water limits the authors therefore suggest that further validation is required kiptala et al 2014 adapted a distributed hydrological model by using remote sensing et data as an input to improve the model performance for the upper pangani river basin in tanzania by tracing blue water use from two zones saturated and unsaturated zone the model was able to improve in particular the dry season flow estimates on the slopes of mt kilimanjaro and mt meru where smallholder farmers are practicing dry season irrigation in addition the total blue water consumption for the upper pangani was in line with the estimates from the pangani basin water board fao and ihe delft 2019 developed a pixel based soil water balance model specifically for estimating blue and green water fluxes to be used for developing water accounting of a river basin the model separates et into blue and green by tracking the soil moisture balance and by determining if the et is satisfied only from rainfall and water stored in the soil moisture or if additional water blue water is required for closing the balance similar to kiptala et al 2014 the model uses remote sensing data as input and can be applied from field catchment regional to global scale output from crop models such as aquacrop have also been used to estimate blue and green water fluxes chukalla et al 2015 karandish and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 zhuo et al 2016 aquacrop keeps track of the soil water balance over time by simulating different sources of water in the soil and flows leaving the soil the model can simulate various degrees of water supply going from rain fed supplementary irrigation to deficit and full irrigation the crop model considers the contribution of the capillary rise from shallow groundwater into the soil chukalla et al 2015 developed a model using the aquacrop outputs to partition blue and green transpiration and blue and green soil evaporation by tracking the pathways of rainwater and irrigation water in crop cultivation areas the model has been applied in hyper arid arid semi arid sub humid and humid environments chukalla et al 2015 karandish and hoekstra 2017 finally velpuri and senay 2017 used the phenology based veget model to estimate green water fluxes by tracking the pathways and magnitude of rainfall in the soil vegetation system which was compared to their et estimates using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model the difference between the et from veget model and et from ssebop is then defined as blue water fluxes although there is a range of approaches for estimating blue and green water fluxes it is difficult to assess which one is more reliable as these fluxes cannot be measured the main objectives of the present study are therefore to compare and evaluate different methods to estimate blue and green water fluxes for a semi arid cultivated catchment to gain a better understanding of the disparities between blue water fluxes from different methods for agricultural land use and to analyse blue and green water fluxes contribution of different methods for all lulc types and the possible causes of differences between the methods further we evaluated the methods for estimating blue and green water fluxes for different lulc classes by comparing the spatial distribution of blue water fluxes for irrigated and non irrigated land use classes with local information this comparison can serve as indirect validation of methods used in water resources assessment and for excluding certain methods from further use 2 method and data 2 1 study area the kikuletwa catchment is one of the sub catchments of the pangani river basin located in eastern africa fig 1 the catchment covers a total area of 6 077 km2 rainfall within the catchment is bi modal with long rains masika from march to june and short rains vuli from november to december the catchment hydrological year starts from 1st october to 30th september the following year the catchment has five tributaries nduruma themi usa kikuletwa sanya kware kikafu karanga rivers whereby three of the tributaries nduruma themi and usa kikuletwa rivers have recently turned ephemeral due to increased water consumption komakech 2013 the water resources of the kikuletwa catchment are characterized by the occurrence of springs originating along the slopes of mt meru and mt kilimanjaro the largest springs are chemka rundugai and kware springs providing 90 of the water during the dry season kikuletwa river is one of the two large rivers discharging into nyumba ya mungu dam pbwo iucn 2006 the primary water uses in the catchment are agriculture by small scale farmers practicing supplementary and full scale irrigation on the slopes of mt meru and mt kilimanjaro mining domestic water uses for the main cities arusha and moshi large scale commercial farms tourist facilities and pastoralists increased population has led small scale farmers to expand their lands and irrigation systems hence using more water for irrigation to supplement rainfall komakech and van der zaag 2013 as a result some sections of the main kikuletwa river have changed from perennial to ephemeral rivers komakech 2013 2 2 data 2 2 1 lulc maps three lulc maps were created using landsat 8 30 m resolution images from three months march august and october 2016 respectively representing the three main seasons in the catchment msigwa et al 2019 the march map represents the lulc during the long wet season masika the august map represents the dry season and the october one the short rainy seasons vuli fig 2 additional information such as crop calendar site visits and farmers interviews were used for developing the detailed seasonal lulc maps the crop calendar and site visits were used to identify the crop types twenty land use classes were identified in the wet season and 19 classes were identified for the dry and short rainy seasons there are four main irrigated crop groups in the kikuletwa catchment sugarcane banana and coffee mixed crops and banana coffee and maize see also kiptala et al 2013 the details of how the lulc maps were created and validated can be found in msigwa et al 2019 2 2 2 rainfall maps although several spatial rainfall sources are available for the study area we selected the data from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps based on the comparative assessment done by gebrechokos et al 2018 in east africa the study showed that chirps outperformed the other rainfall products african rainfall climatology version 2 arc2 observational reanalysis hybrid orh and regional climatic models rcms with a good performance in capturing daily rainfall characteristics such as number of wet days 0 17 deviation total rainfall 4 5 deviation average daily rainfall 7 7 deviation amounts of wet periods 17 deviation and duration of wet 13 4 deviation and dry periods 17 6 deviation over 21 validated areas including tanzania gebrechorkos et al 2018 chirps is a quasi global 50 s 50 n higher resolution 0 05 daily pentanal and monthly dataset it uses the tropical rainfall mission multi satellite precipitation analysis version 7 tmpa 3b42v7 to calibrate global cold cloud duration ccd rainfall estimates and interpolated gauge products funk et al 2015 huffman et al 2007 before using the data for our analysis we evaluated the chirps dataset with data from fifteen rainfall stations at different elevations between 696 2 000 m within and around the kikuletwa catchment the nashsutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and goodness of fit r2 were computed to compare the monthly chirps rainfall estimates and measured rainfall for each station 2 2 3 reference evapotranspiration maps reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated from the fao penman monteith equation for standard 12 cm grass allen et al 1998 using the weather data from global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 and radiation data from cfsr national center for atmospheric research 2017 the method has been applied successfully under a wide range of climate conditions al zayed et al 2016 alemayehu et al 2017

maps used in the kikuletwa catchment are derived from an ensemble et product developed by ihe delft using seven remote sensing based global scale et products ihe delft 2020 all the et products are

detailed information on the et products description and method are found in hugo et al 2019 the et product is evaluated for the study area by comparing the basin water balance at three gauged stations karangai kikuletwa power station kps and tanzania plantation company tpc over a period of six years 2008 2013 fig 1 shows the location of the three stations the principle of water balance for the estimation of et has been used in the past to validate remote sensing et for basin or sub basin level simons et al 2016 velpuri et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2020 the general water balance equation eq 2 for the three sub catchments was used 2 e t w b p q δ s δ t where p q and δs δt are the annual catchment precipitation runoff and change in storage per year respectively the analysis from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace which provides estimates of the total water storage anomalies twsa which also includes groundwater storage change ramillien et al 2008 shows that the storage change in the kikuletwa catchment is less than 4 of the rainfall surplus hence the change in storage was assumed to be 0 δs δt 0 and therefore p et should be equal to q at the downstream end of the catchment simons et al 2016 2 3 blue and green water fluxes estimation methods this section briefly describes the methods used for estimating blue and green water fluxes from the total et the methods have been applied to the kikuletwa catchment at an annual temporal resolution the hydrological years from 2011 to 2014 were chosen for the comparison of blue and green water fluxes four methods are considered in this study namely sn senay et al 2016 ek van eekelen et al 2015 budyko method simons et al 2020 and soil water balance method swb fao and ihe delft 2019 2 3 1 sn method the sn method senay et al 2016 estimates blue water consumption as the differences between mean annual precipitation and mean annual actual evapotranspiration et p the method assumes that when et exceeds p the exceeding amount is due to an additional source of water supply the studied region must be semi arid with rainfall not exceeding 300 mm year as the method assumes that q and δs δt are negligible senay et al 2016 most of the precipitation is lost to evaporation leaving a negligible amount for runoff eqs 3 and 4 show how the blue and green water fluxes etblue and etgreen are estimated from total et 3 e t b l u e e t t o t a l p 4 e t g r e e n e t t o t a l e t b l u e 2 3 2 ek method the ek method van eekelen et al 2015 expresses the total et as the sum of etblue and etgreen eq 4 van eekelen et al 2015 assumes that et in rainfed agro ecosystem is mostly etgreen and this information can be used to estimate etgreen in irrigated areas to normalize for precipitation a ratio is calculated by dividing etgreen over p for the rainfed areas fet p to take into account that not all the annual rainfall infiltrates and is stored in the unsaturated zone for uptake by the roots eq 5 the blue water etblue is then the difference between the total et and etgreen 5 e t g r e e n f e t p p the map of fet p was determined using maps of et and p of rainfed agro ecosystem lulc classes the analysis to obtain the fet p map was obtained based on an analysis using five years 2010 2014 of et and p maps of the kikuletwa catchment since the map of fet p applies to selected rainfed land use class only the fet p fraction ratio map is spatially interpolated using the average fet p values from surrounding areas that are known to be rainfed the rainfall map is used together with an interpolated fet p map to estimate etgreen 2 3 3 budyko method the budyko method de boer 2016 uses the budyko curve to split et into etgreen and etblue the budyko curve plots the ratio of et to p as a function of the ratio of eto to p also known as aridity index eq 6 budyko 1974 poortinga et al 2017 6 e t g r e e n p tanh 1 1 e x p ˆ 0 5 where e t o p the concept is illustrated in fig 3 which shows the relation of et eto and p for all data points in the kikuletwa catchment as well as the budyko curve values plotted below the budyko curve indicate rainfed landscapes whereas values plotted above the line indicate irrigated landscape the budyko method was developed for applications at a basin scale not at pixel level and for long term analysis we therefore computed the split between etblue and etgreen on a monthly time scale but then aggregated the results at an annual scale hydrological years from 2011 to 2014 in our python implementation of the method we introduced two assumptions 1 if rainfall is sufficient etgreen should account for a least 10 of the total et 2 the etgreen is a function of rainfall and rainfall from previous months can be used in the computation of etgreen of the current month based on the land use type retention capacity to take this second point into account we used a moving average length in months as a function of land use type table 1 when we calculated etgreen in january in cropped areas for example we took into account the rainfall and eto for december and january for computing eqs 6 and 4 2 3 4 soil water balance model the soil water balance model used in this study is a pixel based vertical water balance model which computes blue and green water fluxes fao and ihe delft 2019 the total et is initially subtracted from the soil moisture supplied by rainfall sgreen t when sgreen t is insufficient for et the difference will be supplied by surface or groundwater uptake etgreen becomes the amount which can be supplied by the soil moisture whereas the difference will become etblue see eqs 7 and 4 fig 4 shows the main flows and fluxes in the soil water balance model the inputs of the model include precipitation actual evapotranspiration interception lulc map root depth and saturated water content from hihydrosoil a high resolution soil map of hydraulic properties de boer 2016 we computed the split between etblue and etgreen on a monthly time scale but then aggregated the results to annual values of hydrological year from 2011 2014 7 e t g r e e n if s g r e e n t e t e t s g r e e n t where the soil moisture sgreen t is computed as the soil moisture storage at the end of the previous timestep sgreen t 1 plus the effective rainfall p i minus recharge rgreen and surface runoff qsro green eq 8 8 s g r e e n t s g r e e n t 1 p i r g r e e n q s r o g r e e n where the surface runoff qsro green is calculated using an adjusted version of the soil conservation service runoff method the adjusted version replaces the classical curve numbers with a dynamic soil moisture deficit term that better reflects the dry and wet season infiltration versus runoff behavior choudhury and digirolamo 1998 schaake et al 1996 as the curve number method has been developed for event based runoff we calculated qsro green on a daily basis dividing the effective rainfall by the number of rainy days n and a calibration parameter f to account for the soil moisture variation due to drying up and filling up within a month the total surface runoff for a month is then multiplied by n 9 q s r o r a i n 0 i f p 0 p i n 2 p i n f s s a t s r a i n t 1 n i f p 0 where the saturated soil moisture s s a t is calculated by multiplying the saturated water content θ s a t by the effective root depth rd for each land cover class estimated based on the effective root depth by yang et al 2016 the reader is referred to the report by fao and ihe delft 2019 for detailed information about the model and its application 2 4 evaluation of the four methods it is expected that an acceptable method will have the following characteristics 1 it estimates low blue water fluxes for non irrigated areas 2 it is able to identify blue water consumption for most of the irrigated areas 3 it estimates significantly higher blue water consumption for the irrigated areas than the non irrigated and natural areas 4 it estimates low blue water fluxes for natural areas except for wetlands and deep rooted forested areas we evaluated the performance of the methods based on these four characteristics and by analyzing the spatial distribution of blue water fluxes using lulc maps with known irrigated areas in the kikuletwa catchment a one way anova with lsd least significant difference post hoc test was performed by assuming there is no significant difference between the means of all the four methods and between each of the two methods sn vs ek ek vs swb and swb vs budyko 3 results 3 1 validation of remotely sensed p and et in the kikuletwa catchment the chirps monthly rainfall data showed a good agreement with station data fig 5 the statistical analysis for 15 stations is presented in table 2 whereby the overall nse r2 slope pbias and relative bias was 0 87 0 83 0 96 4 6 and 0 95 respectively the comparison of water balance et etwb and the remote sensing et showed good agreement nse 0 77 for kikuletwa power station kps which covered 86 of the total catchment area msigwa et al 2019 the overall agreement of etwb and remote sensing et is slightly lower nse 0 42 for the whole catchment at tpc station the results of the statistical analysis between remote sensing et and etwb at the three gauged stations fig 1 is summarized in table 3 3 2 blue and green water fluxes average annual blue water fluxes mm y maps using the four methods were produced for the period 2011 2014 fig 6 the blue water consumption ranges between 0 850 mm year blue water fluxes are high in the highlands of mount kilimanjaro and meru dominated by dense forest irrigated banana and coffee and in irrigated sugarcane on the lower eastern side of the catchment all four methods show lower blue water fluxes in the lowlands in some areas in the lowlands high blue water fluxes are obtained which are consistent with known irrigation schemes fig 9 including the tpc sugarcane plantation located in the south east corner of the catchment the method by ek and sn estimated zero blue water fluxes in more than half of the catchment area about 76 and 51 of the total area was identified as having no blue water consumption using the sn and ek method respectively in addition the swb and budyko methods identified only 3 and 0 of the total area to have no blue water respectively however according to the lulc map fig 2 only 23 of the total area are irrigated agricultural land and 44 of the total area dominated by lulc classes such as grazed grassland rainfed maize and sparse vegetation is unlikely to consume blue water fig 7 shows the relative contribution of blue and green water fluxes to total et for all the methods the spatial distribution of blue and green water fluxes significantly varies according to the method used the budyko method estimates that 29 59 of the total et in forested areas of mount kilimanjaro is green water fluxes while other methods estimate green water fluxes to reach up to 80 of the total et the sn method shows that in more than half of the catchment green water fluxes is equal to the total et the ek method can clearly distinguish between irrigated and non irrigated areas with blue water flux over irrigated areas being 20 higher than for the non irrigated areas the budyko method indicates that 30 of the total et is blue water which is consumed in more than half of the catchment area fig 8 compares the calculated blue and green water fluxes with the total et for all lulc classes with a previous study by kiptala et al 2014 across the lulc classes the budyko method gives the highest blue water the lulc class with the highest blue water fluxes are dense forest followed by irrigated areas for all the methods in this study except for the swb method where the highest blue water fluxes are found in irrigated banana and coffee the budyko method estimates the lowest green water fluxes for all the lulc the average green water fluxes for the sn and ek methods are similar in the natural lulc types except for forested areas the difference in green water flux estimates between the sn and ek methods is less than 30 mm year for most natural land cover types 3 3 blue and green water fluxes analysis of agricultural land uses the location of the agricultural land use classes is presented in fig 9 while the average annual blue and green water fluxes for the agricultural land uses from the four methods are presented in fig 10 the budyko method gives the highest estimates of blue water fluxes and lowest estimates of green water fluxes while sn method shows the lowest blue water fluxes and highest green water fluxes for all agricultural land uses swb and ek methods show similar estimates of blue and green water fluxes with a difference of less than 50 mm y except for the rainfed maize the average blue water fluxes from the ek method in rainfed maize is low compared to the estimates of the swb and budyko methods whereas the sn method shows zero blue water fluxes for rainfed maize fig 8 the one way anova with lsd least significant difference post hoc test of the average values shows that there is no significant difference in blue water fluxes estimated by the sn and ek methods and by the swb and ek methods for all the lulc classes however there is a significant difference in the blue water fluxes estimated between the budyko method and other methods as well as sn and swb methods the average blue water fluxes estimate for irrigated sugarcane is similar in the budyko and ek methods whereas the blue water fluxes estimates in budyko and other methods for the other lulc types are distinctly different the blue water fluxes for irrigated sugarcane and non irrigated land cover in this study significantly differs from the estimates by kiptala et al 2014 this may be partly due to the higher total et estimates used in their study in our study we found that the swb method has the highest blue water fluxes on irrigated banana and coffee 278 mm y while other methods showed the highest blue water fluxes in dense forest followed by the irrigated banana and coffee figs 11 and 12 kiptala et al 2014 calculated the blue water fluxes for the upper pangani basin kikuletwa is one of its sub catchments and found the highest blue water fluxes in irrigated sugarcane 466 mm y followed by irrigated banana and coffee 266 mm y however all the methods compared in our study show different values of blue water fluxes compared to the study by kiptala et al 2014 the largest difference is seen in the irrigated sugarcane where the blue water fluxes are almost double the amount estimated by all methods in our study this could be due to the fact that our catchment is a sub catchment of the upper pangani river basin and thus we do not cover the entire extent of the irrigated sugarcane plantations located in the lowlands also our study used detailed land use maps of 30 m resolution and both studies used different et products resulting in different average and total et for the different lulc types 3 4 blue and green water fluxes of natural lulc classes the natural lulc classes have larger variations in blue water fluxes among the different methods used in this study and that by kiptala et al 2014 fig 8 the values from two methods sn and ek seem to agree in the estimation of blue water fluxes from most natural lands except for natural water woodlands and forests blue water fluxes in all natural lands are less than 100 mm y as estimated using both the sn and ek methods according to all four methods forested areas are dependent on blue water and the blue water fluxes ranges from 180 590 mm yr other studies confirm that blue water fluxes in the forested areas plays a significant role van eekelen et al 2015 velpuri and senay 2017 for instance the analysis by velpuri and senay 2017 for different lulc classes in the united states found that the forested areas have higher blue water fluxes than other lulc classes 3 5 evaluation of the four methods the comparison of the methods for blue water consumption in irrigated areas shows that generally all the methods estimate significant blue water consumption in the irrigated areas fig 11 for the sn method a significant portion of irrigated areas estimate 0 mm y of blue water fluxes including the lower areas in the basin dominated by irrigated mixed crops the ek method captures the blue water consumption in more irrigated areas compared to the sn method whereas swb and budyko methods are able to capture blue water consumption in all irrigated areas the comparison of the methods for blue water consumption in rainfed areas shows blue water consumption in rainfed areas for all the methods fig 12 all methods estimated blue water consumption in rainfed areas which might indicate supplementary irrigation however the spatial distribution and the total amount of blue water fluxes significantly differ between methods in rainfed maize areas the yellowish polygon in fig 12 only 30 of the area indicates blue water fluxes 100 mm y according to sn and ek methods whereas the budyko method indicates that most areas in rainfed areas consume blue water 100 mm y the swb shows smaller areas in rainfed areas consuming blue water compared to the budyko method further the evaluation based on irrigated versus rainfed areas shows that all the methods have higher average values of blue water fluxes in irrigated areas than the rainfed areas fig 8 all methods show a significant difference between the irrigated and rainfed areas however the swb and budyko methods show higher blue water fluxes more than 70 mm y in rainfed areas than the ek and sn methods the final evaluation was conducted based on the blue water fluxes in irrigated and non irrigated areas all methods estimate blue water fluxes to be higher in irrigated areas than in non irrigated natural areas the ek method shows the highest difference reaching 100 mm y between the irrigated and non irrigated natural areas 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of blue water fluxes of the four methods the sn method estimated blue water fluxes mostly in dense forest irrigated areas including banana and coffee in highland areas and sugarcane in lowland areas the sn method has limits in its application as the method does not perform well in areas with p 300 mm year senay et al 2016 which is the case for a large part of our study area in this study the sn method was not able to identify blue water consumption in most of the irrigated areas in the lowlands receiving average rainfall of 300 mm year finally the method clearly distinguished the irrigated from rainfed areas and non irrigated natural areas this is mainly due to the fact that the method is not able to identify a significant number of pixels that are irrigated e g 85 of total irrigated pixels have less than 50 mm y of blue water fluxes as a result we recommend against using the method in this or similar tropical catchments with comparable characteristics the budyko method was developed for basin analyses and longer time series this study analyses only four hydrological years and estimates the blue and green water fluxes per land use types the blue water fluxes estimates more than 30 of total et using the budyko method is the highest for all lulc classes compared to the other methods the blue water fluxes in the natural and rainfed areas are therefore likely to be overestimated the method also does not distinguish a significant difference between the irrigated and non irrigated land use classes the method is not recommended for this particular catchment and a similar analysis should be performed before the application of the budyko method in other catchments the ek method was able to correctly identify irrigated areas and non irrigated areas based on the blue water fluxes estimate visual evaluation shows that the spatial patterns of blue water fluxes have a strong resemblance to the irrigated land use locations about 51 of the total area which mainly represents non irrigated areas shows no blue water consumption the blue water fluxes estimated for the forested area were 452 mm y 35 of the et and seem to be overestimated the forested areas in the catchment receive the maximum rainfall of 2000 2500 mm yr as a result there is sufficient green water available for forested ecosystems and the reliance on blue water resources is expected to be less this dependence should certainly be lower than in the irrigated areas however to understand whether these forests are tapping shallow groundwater resources needs further investigation the swb method shows differences in blue water fluxes between irrigated and non irrigated pixels the method was able to identify non irrigated areas that depend completely on green water such as grasslands however the swb method depends on a number of parameters such as the available rootzone depth per land use which could lead to over or under estimation of blue water fluxes in specific lulc classes examples are the over estimation of blue water fluxes in rainfed and natural land use classes and under estimation of blue water fluxes in the forested areas compared to the other three methods sn budyko and ek we therefore recommend the use of the ek method for this catchment or other similar tropical catchments if high temporal resolution is not needed and the purpose of the analysis is mainly the identification of irrigated areas the ek method will lead to better results when used in catchments that have exclusively rainfed areas that are known and mapped which is needed for the estimation of the effective rainfall factor for higher temporal resolution analyses or when no rainfed areas could be mapped we recommend the swb method for application but recommend further checks of the equations and calibrations to improve the estimation of parameters such as soil moisture and base flow have been implemented 4 2 limitations the partitioning methods assessed in this study were developed for different purposes and conditions in this study they were applied at annual and across different lulc classes and climatological conditions which may have influenced the results the sn method according to senay et al 2016 is only applicable for semi arid areas with rainfall less than 300 mm y as it assumes that all the precipitation is lost as evaporation hence it neglects runoff and soil infiltration large parts of the pangani basin receive rainfall that exeeds 300 mm y this is likely the reason for the underestimation of blue water consumption in the areas with high rainfall however surprisingly the sn method was also not able to identify blue water consumption in the irrigated areas located in the dry lowlands the ek method considers an effective rainfall factor to take into account runoff and infiltration estimated from purely rainfed areas however most rainfed areas in the kikuletwa catchment also use supplementary irrigation thereby affecting the results it is apparent that the ek method also estimates blue water consumption in rainfed and natural areas the budyko method presents an approach used for long time series and at basin scale the comparison with the other methods shows that using this concept to estimate green and blue water consumption spatially does not provide good results finally the swb method requires parameterization of the root zone depth per land use class this is currently based on values from literature the results show under and over estimation of blue water fluxes for specific land use classes further reviewing of the parameterization is needed to improve the results for all methods the temporal timescale of one year was applied except for the swb method which aggregated monthly values even though irrigation is typically a seasonal activity the other source of the discrepancies is the input data which is primarily from remote sensing and shows either over or under estimation when compared to ground measurements for example validation of et data with water balance shows that with remote sensing et the catchment has the best statistics values nse 0 77 pearson 0 9 rmse 25 mm and bias 1 01 at one outlet that covers 86 of the entire catchment whereas comparison with the entire catchment resulted in a lower regression value of 0 42 this could be due to uncertainties in the remote sensing et products used to create ensemble et such as modis which is proven to be inconsistent when validated with flux tower based et in south africa ramoelo et al 2014 but could also be related to surface groundwater interactions that are also influenced by the irrigation however the catchment water balance closed at two gauged stations including the gauge representing the whole catchment has a rmse of 34 mm only the rainfall data chirps on average showed a good correlation of 0 83 with the ground rainfall stations in the higher areas of mount kilimanjaro and meru there are no ground truth stations to compare with the remote sensing p also the validation data had errors including unexpected and unrealistic high values of p or water levels however not more than 10 unrealistic values were detected for each parameter p and water levels this could be due to human error since these data are manually recorded such errors were corrected by taking the average of the five values of the same week of the day in which the error was found however because the presented results used the same data the discrepancies are due to method differences 5 conclusion understanding the amount of blue water use is important when managing groundwater and river water resources within a catchment or to understand the blue and green water footprint in crop production to propose ways of increasing production falkenmark and rockström 2006 hoekstra 2019 hoekstra et al 2011 however methods for quantification of blue and green water fluxes have not been systematically compared and evaluated especially in the tropical catchments in sub saharan africa in this study we compared four methods for estimating blue and green water fluxes in the kikuletwa catchment in tanzania swb ek sn and budyko over the period 2011 2014 in the absence of ground data the validation of these methods for separating blue and green water fluxes from total et can only be done indirectly through evaluating known patterns and comparing the results of the different methods our study contributes to improved understanding of the fluxes of different sources of water and how well different methods estimate blue and green water fluxes in the kikuletwa catchment but also to highlight their general applicability and limitations we evaluated the four methods using seasonal lulc maps that showed the known natural irrigated and rainfed areas a detailed seasonal lulc maps was used to identify the rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas and natural areas and was used for evaluation purposes at the catchment scale the evaluated methods give similar spatial distribution of blue and green water fluxes but their relative contribution to total et varies based on the method used the sn and ek methods show that more than half of the catchment is 90 100 green water sources dependent while according to the swb model only 14 of the total pixels are green water dependent and according to the budyko method the entire area shows blue water fluxes the non agricultural land use classes show much higher green water dependence for all methods except the budyko method and the three method results are comparable with the study by kiptala et al 2014 our study found that the ek method was able to map blue and green water fluxes with realistic results for irrigated rainfed and natural areas budyko and swb gave too high blue water fluxes for the rainfed areas neither the budyko nor swb model are able to clearly distinguish blue water consumption from irrigated rainfed and natural areas since rainfed and natural areas indicated blue water consumption from these methods on the other hand the sn method estimates of blue water fluxes are zero in more than half of the identified irrigated areas the ek method is a simple method that can be used for historical mapping of blue and green water fluxes in tropical catchments as the spatial distribution of blue water fluxes for the van eekelen et al 2015 method matches that of irrigated land use map as compared to other methods this method shows a distinction of blue water from irrigated natural and rain fed land use classes three of the four methods estimate the highest blue water fluxes 318 582 mm y in forested areas while the swb model estimates the highest blue water fluxes in irrigated banana and coffee 278 mm y overall we conclude that the ek method yields the most realistic spatial pattern of blue water fluxes as compared to irrigated land use map the swb could be considered when higher temporal data resolution e g monthly is needed after calibration overall the results show that highland areas which are dominated by forest irrigated banana and coffee and irrigated banana coffee and maize have higher blue water fluxes than the lowland areas dominated by crops such as maize and vegetables this is different from what is assumed by the water authorities i e there is a higher blue water fluxes in the lower lands due to expansion of small scale farming during the dry season leading to drying of rivers in the catchment although the comparative results are specifically for the kikuletwa catchment the study demonstrates the importance of assessing the different methods for splitting et into green and blue water fluxes our study areas have several climate conditions from plain semi arid to mountainous areas as high as 5800 m as a result the findings of this study can be applied to other tropical catchments the study recommends further comparison studies to consider expanding the scale from the catchment to tropical catchments worldwide for all the lulc types for sustainable water resource management information on blue and green water needs to be reliable not all the methods can be applied to all catchments this was most certainly the case for a heterogeneous catchment like kikuletwa hence the methods used to estimate blue and green water fluxes need to be screened specifically per river catchment further research should also consider the validation of the blue water fluxes with spatial and temporal distributed ground data typically global analyses of blue and green water fluxes are performed for only a few selected crops however we propose broadening the analysis to include other lulc types also it is important that the analysis of blue and green water fluxes is conducted at high resolution 30 m or less for cultivated catchments such as kikuletwa due to small scale agriculture if information at farm level is needed our study used available 250 250 m resolution et to provide estimates of average blue and green water fluxes per lulc types the aim was to evaluate methods to be used at larger scales with readily available data and provide information for river basin water managers that are mapping blue and green water uses and users additionally longer time series analyses of blue and green water fluxes are important to evaluate the trend for

2016 van eekelen method ek van eekelen et al 2015 the budyko method simons et al 2020 and the soil water balance swb model fao and ihe delft 2019 the yearly blue and green water fluxes of different land use land cover lulc classes were estimated using an ensemble of seven global remote sensing based evapotranspiration products ensemble et and the chirps rainfall dataset the ensemble et was created from seven global rs based surface energy balance models gleam cmrs et ssebop alexi sebs etmonitor and mod16 new hydrological insights our study found that the ek method was able to map blue

budyko and swb models were not able to show a clear difference in blue water fluxes in irrigated versus non irrigated areas on the other hand the sn method estimated no blue water fluxes in more than

could be considered after further calibration if higher temporal data resolution e g monthly is required keywords evapotranspiration water fluxes water management land use land cover 1 introduction water is an increasingly scarce resource globally and life and livelihoods are threatened due to lack of access to safe and affordable water for domestic agriculture and industrial uses agriculture and food production are by far the largest consumer of available blue water resources 70 of total water withdrawals globally fao 2017 hereby blue water is defined as the water situated in rivers lakes wetlands and shallow aquifers however these estimates of water consumption do not take into consideration the direct use of rainfall green water in agricultural food production luo and tao 2016 green water is the water stored in the root zone soil moisture as the result of precipitation and it can be used in rainfed and irrigated agriculture it is important to make this distinction as interventions to improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture needed to deal with the looming water scarcity vastly differ between blue and green water uses hoekstra 2019 further water resources management can benefit from estimating blue and green water fluxes aggregated by land use land cover lulc types for example to develop water budgets monitor aquifer depletion monitor water rights compliance and to optimize irrigation anderson et al 2012 since this data cannot be measured directly in the field several methods have been developed to estimate blue and green water fluxes however these methods have not been compared or evaluated systematically most of the methods have been applied to croplands from regional scale chukalla et al 2015 nouri et al 2019 to global scale hoekstra et al 2011 liu and yang 2010 van eekelen et al 2015 and velpuri and senay 2017 developed methods for assessing blue and green water fluxes for various lulcs such as natural forest shrublands and commercial forest plantations in particular the last class is applicable to countries such as south africa which lists water use of commercial forest plantations in its policies as part of streamflow reducing activities albaugh et al 2013 this importance is highlighted by van eekelen et al 2015 who estimated that natural forest and commercial forest plantations in the incomati basin in south africa consume between 391 and 433 mm y of blue water similarly velpuri and senay 2017 found for the united states of america that evergreen broadleaf forest is the largest blue water consumer 350 mm year the methods for estimating blue and green water fluxes can be grouped into two categories data based approaches and modelling approaches data based approaches use rainfall p and evapotranspiration et data sets senay et al 2016 assume that in semi arid conditions p 300 mm year most of the rainfall evaporates so if et exceeds p irrigation water from ground or surface is applied blue water fluxes they state that this method is only applicable in semi arid irrigated areas van eekelen et al 2015 on other hand applied an effective rainfall factor assuming not all rainfall will be stored in the unsaturated zone to be available for uptake by plants green water fluxes the authors applied the method for annual timescales at both catchment and field scale using both ground data and remote sensing data similarly budyko developed a simple approach for catchment scale blue and green water fluxes analysis based on climatological characteristics of the study area budyko 1974 which combines data on p et and the aridity index eto p where eto is reference evapotranspiration model based approaches for estimating blue and green water fluxes consist of adaptations to hydrological models hanasaki et al 2010 kiptala et al 2014 soil water balance models fao and ihe delft 2019 crop models chukalla et al 2015 karandish and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 zhuo et al 2016 and phenology based models velpuri and senay 2017 hanasaki et al 2010 estimated blue and green water fluxes by tracing the sources of blue water from the hydrological cycle using the global water resource model h08 the blue water estimates were further categorized into three subgroups stream flow medium size reservoirs 50 50 km and non renewable and non local blue water the approach assumes that irrigated cropland always receives its full irrigation water requirement which may result in an overestimation of the blue water also based on these assumptions water withdrawal from rivers may exceed the environmental water limits the authors therefore suggest that further validation is required kiptala et al 2014 adapted a distributed hydrological model by using remote sensing et data as an input to improve the model performance for the upper pangani river basin in tanzania by tracing blue water use from two zones saturated and unsaturated zone the model was able to improve in particular the dry season flow estimates on the slopes of mt kilimanjaro and mt meru where smallholder farmers are practicing dry season irrigation in addition the total blue water consumption for the upper pangani was in line with the estimates from the pangani basin water board fao and ihe delft 2019 developed a pixel based soil water balance model specifically for estimating blue and green water fluxes to be used for developing water accounting of a river basin the model separates et into blue and green by tracking the soil moisture balance and by determining if the et is satisfied only from rainfall and water stored in the soil moisture or if additional water blue water is required for closing the balance similar to kiptala et al 2014 the model uses remote sensing data as input and can be applied from field catchment regional to global scale output from crop models such as aquacrop have also been used to estimate blue and green water fluxes chukalla et al 2015 karandish and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 zhuo et al 2016 aquacrop keeps track of the soil water balance over time by simulating different sources of water in the soil and flows leaving the soil the model can simulate various degrees of water supply going from rain fed supplementary irrigation to deficit and full irrigation the crop model considers the contribution of the capillary rise from shallow groundwater into the soil chukalla et al 2015 developed a model using the aquacrop outputs to partition blue and green transpiration and blue and green soil evaporation by tracking the pathways of rainwater and irrigation water in crop cultivation areas the model has been applied in hyper arid arid semi arid sub humid and humid environments chukalla et al 2015 karandish and hoekstra 2017 finally velpuri and senay 2017 used the phenology based veget model to estimate green water fluxes by tracking the pathways and magnitude of rainfall in the soil vegetation system which was compared to their et estimates using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model the difference between the et from veget model and et from ssebop is then defined as blue water fluxes although there is a range of approaches for estimating blue and green water fluxes it is difficult to assess which one is more reliable as these fluxes cannot be measured the main objectives of the present study are therefore to compare and evaluate different methods to estimate blue and green water fluxes for a semi arid cultivated catchment to gain a better understanding of the disparities between blue water fluxes from different methods for agricultural land use and to analyse blue and green water fluxes contribution of different methods for all lulc types and the possible causes of differences between the methods further we evaluated the methods for estimating blue and green water fluxes for different lulc classes by comparing the spatial distribution of blue water fluxes for irrigated and non irrigated land use classes with local information this comparison can serve as indirect validation of methods used in water resources assessment and for excluding certain methods from further use 2 method and data 2 1 study area the kikuletwa catchment is one of the sub catchments of the pangani river basin located in eastern africa fig 1 the catchment covers a total area of 6 077 km2 rainfall within the catchment is bi modal with long rains masika from march to june and short rains vuli from november to december the catchment hydrological year starts from 1st october to 30th september the following year the catchment has five tributaries nduruma themi usa kikuletwa sanya kware kikafu karanga rivers whereby three of the tributaries nduruma themi and usa kikuletwa rivers have recently turned ephemeral due to increased water consumption komakech 2013 the water resources of the kikuletwa catchment are characterized by the occurrence of springs originating along the slopes of mt meru and mt kilimanjaro the largest springs are chemka rundugai and kware springs providing 90 of the water during the dry season kikuletwa river is one of the two large rivers discharging into nyumba ya mungu dam pbwo iucn 2006 the primary water uses in the catchment are agriculture by small scale farmers practicing supplementary and full scale irrigation on the slopes of mt meru and mt kilimanjaro mining domestic water uses for the main cities arusha and moshi large scale commercial farms tourist facilities and pastoralists increased population has led small scale farmers to expand their lands and irrigation systems hence using more water for irrigation to supplement rainfall komakech and van der zaag 2013 as a result some sections of the main kikuletwa river have changed from perennial to ephemeral rivers komakech 2013 2 2 data 2 2 1 lulc maps three lulc maps were created using landsat 8 30 m resolution images from three months march august and october 2016 respectively representing the three main seasons in the catchment msigwa et al 2019 the march map represents the lulc during the long wet season masika the august map represents the dry season and the october one the short rainy seasons vuli fig 2 additional information such as crop calendar site visits and farmers interviews were used for developing the detailed seasonal lulc maps the crop calendar and site visits were used to identify the crop types twenty land use classes were identified in the wet season and 19 classes were identified for the dry and short rainy seasons there are four main irrigated crop groups in the kikuletwa catchment sugarcane banana and coffee mixed crops and banana coffee and maize see also kiptala et al 2013 the details of how the lulc maps were created and validated can be found in msigwa et al 2019 2 2 2 rainfall maps although several spatial rainfall sources are available for the study area we selected the data from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station

we evaluated the chirps dataset with data from fifteen rainfall stations at different elevations between 696 2 000 m within and around the kikuletwa catchment the nashsutcliffe efficiency coefficient

detailed information on the et products description and method are found in hugo et al 2019 the et product is evaluated for the study area by comparing the basin water balance at three gauged stations karangai kikuletwa power station kps and tanzania plantation company tpc over a period of six years 2008 2013 fig 1 shows the location of the three stations the principle of water balance for the estimation of et has been used in the past to validate remote sensing et for basin or sub basin level simons et al 2016 velpuri et al 2013 weerasinghe et al 2020 the general water balance equation eq 2 for the three sub catchments was used 2 e t w b p q δ s δ t where p q and δs δt are the annual catchment precipitation runoff and change in storage per year respectively the analysis from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace which provides estimates of the total water storage anomalies twsa which also includes groundwater storage change ramillien et al 2008 shows that the storage change in the kikuletwa catchment is less than 4 of the rainfall surplus hence the change in storage was assumed to be 0 δs δt 0 and therefore p et should be equal to q at the downstream end of the catchment simons et al 2016 2 3 blue and green water fluxes estimation methods this section briefly describes the methods used for estimating blue and green water fluxes from the total et the methods have been applied to the kikuletwa catchment at an annual temporal resolution the hydrological years from 2011 to 2014 were chosen for the comparison of blue and green water fluxes four methods are considered in this study namely sn senay et al 2016 ek van eekelen et al 2015 budyko method simons et al 2020 and soil water balance method swb fao and ihe delft 2019 2 3 1 sn method the sn method senay et al 2016 estimates blue water consumption as the differences between mean annual precipitation and mean annual actual evapotranspiration et p the method assumes that when et exceeds p the exceeding amount is due to an additional source of water supply the studied region must be semi arid with rainfall not exceeding 300 mm year as the method assumes that q and δs δt are negligible senay et al 2016 most of the precipitation is lost to evaporation leaving a negligible amount for runoff eqs 3 and 4 show how the blue and green water fluxes etblue and etgreen are estimated from total et 3 e t b l u e e t t o t a l p 4 e t g r e e n e t t o t a l e t b l u e 2 3 2 ek method the ek method van eekelen et al 2015 expresses the total et as the sum of etblue and etgreen eq 4 van eekelen et al 2015 assumes that et in rainfed agro ecosystem is mostly etgreen and this information can be used to estimate etgreen in irrigated areas to normalize for precipitation a ratio is calculated by dividing etgreen over p for the rainfed areas fet p to take into account that not all the annual rainfall infiltrates and is stored in the unsaturated zone for uptake by the roots eq 5 the blue water etblue is then the difference between the total et and etgreen 5 e t g r e e n f e t p p the map of fet p was determined using maps of et and p of rainfed agro ecosystem lulc classes the analysis to obtain the fet p map was obtained based on an analysis using five years 2010 2014 of et and p maps of the kikuletwa catchment since the map of fet p applies to selected rainfed land use class only the fet p fraction ratio map is spatially interpolated using the average fet p values from surrounding areas that are known to be rainfed the rainfall map is used together with an interpolated fet p map to estimate etgreen 2 3 3 budyko method the budyko method de boer 2016 uses the budyko curve to split et into etgreen and etblue the budyko curve plots the ratio of et to p as a function of the ratio of eto to p also known as aridity index eq 6 budyko 1974 poortinga et al 2017 6 e t g r e e n p tanh 1 1 e x p ˆ 0 5 where e t o p the concept is illustrated in fig 3 which shows the relation of et eto and p for all data points in the kikuletwa catchment as well as the budyko curve values plotted below the budyko curve indicate rainfed landscapes whereas values plotted above the line indicate irrigated landscape the budyko method was developed for applications at a basin scale not at pixel level and for long term analysis we therefore computed the split between etblue and etgreen on a monthly time scale but then aggregated the results at an annual scale hydrological years from 2011 to 2014 in our python implementation of the method we introduced two assumptions 1 if rainfall is sufficient etgreen should account for a least 10 of the total et 2 the etgreen is a function of rainfall and rainfall from previous months can be used in the computation of etgreen of the current month based on the land use type retention capacity to take this second point into account we used a moving average length in months as a function of land use type table 1 when we calculated etgreen in january in cropped areas for example we took into account the rainfall and eto for december and january for computing eqs 6 and 4 2 3 4 soil water balance model the soil water balance model used in this study is a pixel based vertical water balance model which computes blue and green water fluxes fao and ihe delft 2019 the total et is initially subtracted from the soil moisture supplied by rainfall sgreen t when sgreen t is insufficient for et the difference will be supplied by surface or groundwater uptake etgreen becomes the amount which can be supplied by the soil moisture whereas the difference will become etblue see eqs 7 and 4 fig 4 shows the main flows and fluxes in the soil water balance model the inputs of the model include precipitation actual evapotranspiration interception lulc map root depth and saturated water content from hihydrosoil a high resolution soil map of hydraulic properties de boer 2016 we computed the split between etblue and etgreen on a monthly time scale but then aggregated the results to annual values of hydrological year from 2011 2014 7 e t g r e e n if s g r e e n t e t e t s g r e e n t where the soil moisture sgreen t is computed as the soil moisture storage at the end of the previous timestep sgreen t 1 plus the effective rainfall p i minus recharge rgreen and surface runoff qsro green eq 8 8 s g r e e n t s g r e e n t 1 p i r g r e e n q s r o g r e e n where the surface runoff qsro green is calculated using an adjusted version of the soil conservation service runoff method the adjusted version replaces the classical curve numbers with a dynamic soil moisture deficit term that better reflects the dry and wet season infiltration versus runoff behavior choudhury and digirolamo 1998 schaake et al 1996 as the curve number method has been developed for event based runoff we calculated qsro green on a daily basis dividing the effective rainfall by the number of rainy days n and a calibration parameter f

based on the effective root depth by yang et al 2016 the reader is referred to the report by fao and ihe delft 2019 for detailed information about the model and its application 2 4 evaluation of the four methods it is expected that an acceptable method will have the following characteristics 1 it estimates low blue water fluxes for non irrigated areas 2 it is able to identify blue water consumption for most of the irrigated areas 3 it estimates significantly higher blue water consumption for the irrigated areas than the non irrigated and natural areas 4 it estimates low blue water fluxes for natural areas except for wetlands and deep rooted forested areas we evaluated the performance of the methods based on these four characteristics and by analyzing the spatial distribution of blue water fluxes using lulc maps with known irrigated areas in the kikuletwa catchment a one way anova with lsd least significant difference post hoc test was performed by assuming there is no significant difference between the means of all the four methods and between each of the two methods sn vs ek ek vs swb and swb vs budyko 3 results 3 1 validation of remotely sensed p and et in the kikuletwa catchment the chirps monthly rainfall data showed a good agreement with station data fig 5 the statistical analysis for 15 stations is presented in table 2 whereby the overall nse r2 slope

which covered 86 of the total catchment area msigwa et al 2019 the overall agreement of etwb and remote sensing et is slightly lower nse 0 42 for the whole catchment at tpc station the results of the statistical analysis between remote sensing et and etwb at the three gauged stations fig 1 is summarized in table 3 3 2 blue and green water fluxes average annual blue water fluxes mm y maps using the four methods were produced for the period 2011 2014 fig 6 the blue water consumption ranges between 0 850 mm year blue water fluxes are high in the highlands of mount kilimanjaro and meru dominated by dense forest irrigated banana and coffee and in irrigated sugarcane on the lower eastern side of the catchment all four methods show lower blue water fluxes in the lowlands in some areas in the lowlands high blue water fluxes are obtained which are consistent with known irrigation schemes fig 9 including the tpc sugarcane plantation located in the south east corner of the catchment the method by ek and sn estimated zero blue water fluxes in more than half of the catchment area about 76 and 51 of the total area was identified as having no blue water consumption using the sn and ek method respectively in addition the swb and budyko methods identified only 3 and 0 of the total area to have no blue water respectively however according to the lulc map fig 2 only 23 of the total area are irrigated agricultural land and 44 of the total area dominated by lulc classes such as grazed grassland rainfed maize and sparse vegetation is unlikely to consume blue water fig 7 shows the relative contribution of blue and green water fluxes to total et for all the methods the spatial distribution of blue and green water fluxes significantly varies according to the method used the budyko method estimates that 29 59 of the total et in forested areas of mount kilimanjaro is green water fluxes while other methods estimate green water fluxes to reach up to 80 of the total et the sn method shows that in more than half of the catchment green water fluxes is equal to the total et the ek method can clearly distinguish between irrigated and non irrigated areas with blue water flux over irrigated areas being 20 higher than for the non irrigated areas the budyko method indicates that 30 of the total et is blue water which is consumed in more than half of the catchment area fig 8 compares the calculated blue and green water fluxes with the total et for all lulc classes with a previous study by kiptala et al 2014 across the lulc classes the budyko method gives the highest blue water the lulc class with the highest blue water fluxes are dense forest followed by irrigated areas for all the methods in this study except for the swb method where the highest blue water fluxes are found in irrigated banana and coffee the budyko method estimates the lowest green water fluxes for all the lulc the average green water fluxes for the sn and ek methods are similar in the natural lulc types except for forested areas the difference in green water flux estimates between the sn and ek methods is less than 30 mm year for most natural land cover types 3 3 blue and green water fluxes analysis of agricultural land uses the location of the agricultural land use classes is presented in fig 9 while the average annual blue and green water fluxes for the agricultural land uses from the four methods are presented in fig 10 the budyko method gives the highest estimates of blue water fluxes and lowest estimates of green water fluxes while sn method shows the lowest blue water fluxes and highest green water fluxes for all agricultural land uses swb and ek methods show similar estimates of blue and green water fluxes with a difference of less than 50 mm y except for the rainfed maize the average blue water fluxes from the ek method in rainfed maize is low compared to the estimates of the swb and budyko methods whereas the sn method shows zero blue water fluxes for rainfed maize fig 8 the one way anova with lsd least significant difference post hoc test of the average values shows that there is no significant difference in blue water fluxes estimated by the sn and ek methods and by the swb and ek methods for all the lulc classes however there is a significant difference in the blue water fluxes estimated between the budyko method and other methods as well as sn and swb methods the average blue water fluxes estimate for irrigated sugarcane is similar in the budyko and ek methods whereas the blue water fluxes estimates in budyko and other methods for the other lulc types are distinctly different the blue water fluxes for irrigated sugarcane and non irrigated land cover in this study significantly differs from the estimates by kiptala et al 2014 this may be partly due to the higher total et estimates used in their study in our study we found that the swb method has the highest blue water fluxes on irrigated banana and coffee 278 mm y while other methods showed the highest blue water fluxes in dense forest followed by the irrigated banana and coffee figs 11 and 12 kiptala et al 2014 calculated the blue water fluxes for the upper pangani basin kikuletwa is one of its sub catchments and found the highest blue water fluxes in irrigated sugarcane 466 mm y followed by irrigated banana and coffee 266 mm y however all the methods compared in our study show different values of blue water fluxes compared to the study by kiptala et al 2014 the largest difference is seen in the irrigated sugarcane where the blue water fluxes are almost double the amount estimated by all methods in our study this could be due to the fact that our catchment is a sub catchment of the upper pangani river basin and thus we do not cover the entire extent of the irrigated sugarcane plantations located in the lowlands also our study used detailed land use maps of 30 m resolution and both studies used different et products resulting in different average and total et for the different lulc types 3 4 blue and green water fluxes of natural lulc classes the natural lulc classes have larger variations in blue water fluxes among the different methods used in this study and that by kiptala et al 2014 fig 8 the values from two methods sn and ek seem to agree in the estimation of blue water fluxes from most natural lands except for natural water woodlands and forests blue water fluxes in all natural lands are less than 100 mm y as estimated using both the sn and ek methods according to all four methods forested areas are dependent on blue water and the blue water fluxes ranges from 180 590 mm yr other studies confirm that blue water fluxes in the forested areas plays a significant role van eekelen et al 2015 velpuri and senay 2017 for instance the analysis by velpuri and senay 2017 for different lulc classes in the united states found that the forested areas have higher blue water fluxes than other lulc classes 3 5 evaluation of the four methods the comparison of the methods for blue water consumption in irrigated areas shows that generally all the methods estimate significant blue water consumption in the irrigated areas fig 11 for the sn method a significant portion of irrigated areas estimate 0 mm y of blue water fluxes including the lower areas in the basin dominated by irrigated mixed crops the ek method captures the blue water consumption in more irrigated areas compared to the sn method whereas swb and budyko methods are able to capture blue water consumption in all irrigated areas the comparison of the methods for blue water consumption in rainfed areas shows blue water consumption in rainfed areas for all the methods fig 12 all methods estimated blue water consumption in rainfed areas which might indicate supplementary irrigation however the spatial distribution and the total amount of blue water fluxes significantly differ between methods in rainfed maize areas the yellowish polygon in fig 12 only 30 of the area indicates blue water fluxes 100 mm y according to sn and ek methods whereas the budyko method indicates that most areas in rainfed areas consume blue water 100 mm y the swb shows smaller areas in rainfed areas consuming blue water compared to the budyko method further the evaluation based on irrigated versus rainfed areas shows that all the methods have higher average values of blue water fluxes in irrigated areas than the rainfed areas fig 8 all methods show a significant difference between the irrigated and rainfed areas however the swb and budyko methods show higher blue water fluxes more than 70 mm y in rainfed areas than the ek and sn methods the final evaluation was conducted based on the blue water fluxes in irrigated and non irrigated areas all methods estimate blue water fluxes to be higher in irrigated areas than in non irrigated natural areas the ek method shows the highest difference reaching 100 mm y between the irrigated and non irrigated natural areas 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of blue water fluxes of the four methods the sn method estimated blue water fluxes mostly in dense forest irrigated areas including banana and coffee in highland areas and sugarcane in lowland areas the sn method has limits in its application as the method does not perform well in areas with p 300 mm year senay et al 2016 which is the case for a large part of our study area in this study the sn method was not able to identify blue water consumption in most of the irrigated areas in the lowlands receiving average rainfall of 300 mm year finally the method clearly distinguished the irrigated from rainfed areas and non irrigated natural areas this is mainly due to the fact that the method is not able to identify a significant number of pixels that are irrigated e g 85 of total irrigated pixels have less than 50 mm y of blue water fluxes as a result we recommend against using the method in this or similar tropical catchments with comparable characteristics the budyko method was developed for basin analyses and longer time series this study analyses only four hydrological years and estimates the blue and green water fluxes per land use types the blue water fluxes estimates more than 30 of total et using the budyko method is the highest for all lulc classes compared to the other methods the blue water fluxes in the natural and rainfed areas are therefore likely to be overestimated the method also does not distinguish a significant difference between the irrigated and non irrigated land use classes the method is not recommended for this particular catchment and a similar analysis should be performed before the application of the budyko method in other catchments the ek method was able to correctly identify irrigated areas and non irrigated areas based on the blue water fluxes estimate visual evaluation shows that the spatial patterns of blue water fluxes have a strong resemblance to the irrigated land use locations about 51 of the total area which mainly represents non irrigated areas shows no blue water consumption the blue water fluxes estimated for the forested area were 452 mm y 35 of the et and seem to be overestimated the forested areas in the catchment receive the maximum rainfall of 2000 2500 mm yr as a result there is sufficient green water available for forested ecosystems and the reliance on blue water resources is expected to be less this dependence should certainly be lower than in the irrigated areas however to understand whether these forests are tapping shallow groundwater resources needs further investigation the swb method shows differences in blue water fluxes between irrigated and non irrigated pixels the method was able to identify non irrigated areas that depend completely on green water such as grasslands however the swb method depends on a number of parameters such as the available rootzone depth per land use which could lead to over or under estimation of blue water fluxes in specific lulc classes examples are the over estimation of blue water fluxes in rainfed and natural land use classes and under estimation of blue water fluxes in the forested areas compared to the other three methods sn budyko and ek we therefore recommend the use of the ek method for this catchment or other similar tropical catchments if high temporal resolution is not needed and the purpose of the analysis is mainly the identification of irrigated areas the ek method will lead to better results when used in catchments that have exclusively rainfed areas that are known and mapped which is needed for the estimation of the effective rainfall factor for higher temporal resolution analyses or when no rainfed areas could be mapped we recommend the swb method for application but recommend further checks of the equations and calibrations to improve the estimation of parameters such as soil moisture and base flow have been implemented 4 2 limitations the partitioning methods assessed in this study were developed for different purposes and conditions in this study they were applied at annual and across different lulc classes and climatological conditions which may have influenced the results the sn method according to senay et al 2016 is only applicable for semi arid areas with rainfall less than 300 mm y as it assumes that all the precipitation is lost as evaporation hence it neglects runoff and soil infiltration large parts of the pangani basin receive rainfall that exeeds 300 mm y this is likely the reason for the underestimation of blue water consumption in the areas with high rainfall however surprisingly the sn method was also not able to identify blue water consumption in the irrigated areas located in the dry lowlands the ek method considers an effective rainfall factor to take into account runoff and infiltration estimated from purely rainfed areas however most rainfed areas in the kikuletwa catchment also use supplementary irrigation thereby affecting the results it is apparent that the ek method also estimates blue water consumption in rainfed and natural areas the budyko method presents an approach used for long time series and at basin scale the comparison with the other methods shows that using this concept to estimate green and blue water consumption spatially does not provide good results finally the swb method requires parameterization of the root zone depth per land use class this is currently based on values from literature the results show under and over estimation of blue water fluxes for specific land use classes further reviewing of the parameterization is needed to improve the results for all methods the temporal timescale of one year was applied except for the swb method which aggregated monthly values even though irrigation is typically a seasonal activity the other source of the discrepancies is the input data which is primarily from remote sensing and shows either over or under estimation when compared to ground measurements for example validation of et data with water balance shows that with remote sensing et the catchment has the best statistics values nse 0 77 pearson 0 9 rmse 25 mm and bias 1 01 at one outlet that covers 86 of the entire catchment whereas comparison with the entire catchment resulted in a lower regression value of 0 42 this could be due to uncertainties in the remote sensing et products used to create ensemble et such as modis which is proven to be inconsistent when validated with flux tower based et in south africa ramoelo et al 2014 but could also be related to surface groundwater interactions that are also influenced by the irrigation however the catchment water balance closed at two gauged stations including the gauge representing the whole catchment has a rmse of 34 mm only the rainfall data chirps on average showed a good correlation of 0 83 with the ground rainfall stations in the higher areas of mount kilimanjaro and meru there are no ground truth stations to compare with the remote sensing p also the validation data had errors including unexpected and unrealistic high values of p or water levels however not more than 10 unrealistic values were detected for each parameter p and water levels this could be due to human error since these data are manually recorded such errors were corrected by taking the average of the five values of the same week of the day in which the error was found however because the presented results used the same data the discrepancies are due to method differences 5 conclusion understanding the amount of blue water use is important when managing groundwater and river water resources within a catchment or to understand the blue and green water footprint in crop production to propose ways of increasing production falkenmark and rockström 2006 hoekstra 2019 hoekstra et al 2011 however methods for quantification of blue and green water fluxes have not been systematically compared and evaluated especially in the tropical catchments in sub saharan africa in this study we compared four methods for estimating blue and green water fluxes in the kikuletwa catchment in tanzania swb ek sn and budyko over the period 2011 2014 in the absence of ground data the validation of these methods for separating blue and green water fluxes from total et can only be done indirectly through evaluating known patterns and comparing the results of the different methods our study contributes to improved understanding of the fluxes of different sources of water and how well different methods estimate blue and green water fluxes in the kikuletwa catchment but also to highlight their general applicability and limitations we evaluated the four methods using seasonal lulc maps that showed the known natural irrigated and rainfed areas a detailed seasonal lulc maps was used to identify the rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas and natural areas and was used for evaluation purposes at the catchment scale the evaluated methods give similar spatial distribution of blue and green water fluxes but their relative contribution to total et varies based on the method used the sn and ek methods show that more than half of the catchment is 90 100 green water sources dependent while according to the swb model only 14 of the total pixels are green water dependent and according to the budyko method the entire area shows blue water fluxes the non agricultural land use classes show much higher green water dependence for all methods except the budyko method and the three method results are comparable with the study by kiptala et al 2014 our study found that the ek method was able to map blue and green water fluxes with realistic results for irrigated rainfed and natural areas budyko and swb gave too high blue water fluxes for the rainfed areas neither the budyko nor swb model are able to clearly distinguish blue water consumption from irrigated rainfed and natural areas since rainfed and natural areas indicated blue water consumption from these methods on the other hand the sn method estimates of blue water fluxes are zero in more than half of the identified irrigated areas the ek method is a simple method that can be used for historical mapping of blue and green water fluxes in tropical catchments as the spatial distribution of blue water fluxes for the van eekelen et al 2015 method matches that of irrigated land use map as compared to other methods this method shows a distinction of blue water from irrigated natural and rain fed land use classes three of the four methods estimate the highest blue water fluxes 318 582 mm y in forested areas while the swb model estimates the highest blue water fluxes in irrigated banana and coffee 278 mm y overall we conclude that the ek method yields the most realistic spatial pattern of blue water fluxes as compared to irrigated land use map the swb could be considered when higher temporal data resolution e g monthly is needed after calibration overall the results show that highland areas which are dominated by forest irrigated banana and coffee and irrigated banana coffee and maize have higher blue water fluxes than the lowland areas dominated by crops such as maize and vegetables this is different from what is assumed by the water authorities i e there is a higher blue water fluxes in the lower lands due to expansion of small scale farming during the dry season leading to drying of rivers in the catchment although the comparative results are specifically for the kikuletwa catchment the study demonstrates the importance of assessing the different methods for splitting et into green and blue water fluxes our study areas have several climate conditions from plain semi arid to mountainous areas as high as 5800 m as a result the findings of this study can be applied to other tropical catchments the study recommends further comparison studies to consider expanding the scale from the catchment to tropical catchments worldwide for all the lulc types for sustainable water resource management information on blue and green water needs to be reliable not all the methods can be applied to all catchments this was most certainly the case for a heterogeneous catchment like kikuletwa hence the methods used to estimate blue and green water fluxes need to be screened specifically per river catchment further research should also consider the validation of the blue water fluxes with spatial and temporal distributed ground data typically global analyses of blue and green water fluxes are performed for only a few selected crops however we propose broadening the analysis to include other lulc types also it is important that the analysis of blue and green water fluxes is conducted at high resolution 30 m or less for cultivated catchments such as kikuletwa due to small scale agriculture if information at farm level is needed our study used available 250 250 m resolution et to provide estimates of average blue and green water fluxes per lulc types the aim was to evaluate methods to be used at larger scales with readily available data and provide information for river basin water managers that are mapping blue and green water uses and users additionally longer time series analyses of blue and green water fluxes are important to evaluate the trend for

8216,study region our study region is the baltic sea drainage basin bsdb which covers an area of 1 8 mio km2 distributed over 14 countries in northern europe study focus we use a large scale hydrological and nutrient transport model e hype to model basin wide impacts of measure scenarios on the baltic sea where eutrophication is a critical issue for the marine ecosystem we constructed measure scenarios based on stakeholder acceptance established in workshops in different regions around the baltic these measures include local stream reach to catchment scale measures aiming to reduce nutrient transport into the stream network buffer strips stormwater ponds and measures aiming to reduce regional nutrient source releases fertiliser leaching rates rural household emissions new hydrological insights for the region nutrient load reductions are often needed to reduce eutrophication and improve overall surface water quality in fresh water and enclosed bays and seas where dilution is limited and load emissions have long residence times to reduce riverine nutrient loads remediation measures are necessary e g establishment of buffer strips or improved wastewater treatment such measures are however typically not designed to target nutrient load reductions at sea outlets but rather focus on local improvements here we show that measures notwithstanding other meliorating ecosystem benefits must include reductions in load emissions across large basin areas to impact integrated net loads into coastal sea basins because reduction measures that only target nutrient delivery to the stream network typically cannot be implemented in a significant enough proportion of the total drainage area of large coastal river basins our impact scenarios show bsdb wide nutrient reductions of up to 9 for nitrogen and phosphorus compared to a reference scenario if load emissions are reduced in the scenario assumptions keywords baltic sea e hype hydrological modelling nutrient load reduction scenario impacts water quality 1 introduction anthropogenically driven eutrophication is a global problem of surface water bodies in landscapes under human use excessive emissions of macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus originate from various diffuse and point sources and are subsequently transported along surface and sub surface water flow paths these riverine nutrient loads impact water quality in downstream aquatic ecosystems from local headwater streams through lake and river systems all the way down to marine ecosystems at river outlets where they are discharged into the sea in the baltic sea drainage basin bsdb the impact of nutrient load pollution on the marine ecosystem is amplified because the baltic sea is an enclosed sea with limited water exchange with the open ocean which exacerbates eutrophication compared to more open sea basins this has been long acknowledged by the scientific and decision making communities and led to the establishment of the baltic sea action plan bsap through the helsinki commission helcom which prescribes reduction goals for nitrogen and phosphorus loads for all member states helcom 2013 it is however not clear how these goals can be achieved effectively by the member states and how projected climate change and possible modifications of land uses or other anthropogenic drivers affect future riverine nutrient load dynamics to the baltic sea basin in the 21st century large scale hydrological model applications can serve as effective tools to dynamically predict basin wide nutrient transports coherently over large areas thus they allow to investigate impacts from environmental change and implementation of remediation measures using projected forcing data across the model domain in particular such model frameworks can provide impact estimates of basin wide load reductions for different types of measures e g source reduction edge of field and in stream retention removal for the bsdb several such studies have been undertaken previously for instance arheimer et al 2012 used a hype model application to estimate the impact of climate change and extensive reductions in diffuse and point nutrient emissions they then related their results to bsap reduction targets for the end century period with results indicating difficulties to achieve all bsap targets and added uncertainty due to climate change impacts on flow and nutrient loads moreover wulff et al 2014 studied impacts and cost efficiencies of nutrient reduction measures and land use change in the bsdb using a multi model environment and utilised their basin scale model to highlight the importance of downstream retention for identifying cost effective reduction measures other studies used modelled discharge projections in combination with other predictors to estimate future trends in nutrient loads to the baltic sea e g hägg et al 2014 combined baltic sea scale climate change discharge scenarios with consumption and population growth scenarios as proxy for changes in anthropogenic sources and used simple regression models to estimate future nutrient transport change trajectories showing strong impacts of human source changes compared to climate impacts especially in the southern basin parts decisions to support implementation of edge of field and in stream remediation measures for reducing nutrient loads to surface waters e g constructed wetlands e g arheimer and wittgren 2002 fisher and acreman 1999 riparian buffers hoffmann et al 2009 or re meandering of small streams are typically made by regional government bodies and target the ecological status of local waters moreover these measures often fulfil multiple purposes along with load reduction e g enhanced fish spawning habitats increased biodiversity or re establishment of recreation areas other policy based measures e g the nitrate directive council directive 91 676 eec and the urban waste water directive directive 98 15 ec and directive 91 271 eec take effect more uniformly on national to trans national scales as changes in fertiliser application rules or stricter legislation on wastewater discharge quality the latter often target large scale remediation goals such as the overall load to the baltic sea studies of the cost effectiveness of measures targeting water quality have indicated that the outcome depends on both the specific location where a measure is implemented and on the scale where the effect is considered whether at the local waters or at the outlet of a larger river basin c f arheimer et al 2005 carolus et al 2020 balana et al 2015 in addition the process of climate change adds uncertainty to the effect estimates for different measures e g arheimer et al 2012 to address this scenario modelling of the effect of measures in a future climate can provide useful information when planning for cost effective nutrient reduction here we use the hydrological and nutrient transport model e hype hundecha et al 2016 to investigate the bsdb wide impacts of four widely applicable remediation measures under present and future climate and socioeconomic conditions in contrast to previous studies e g arheimer et al 2012 hägg et al 2014 wulff et al 2014 the remediation measures originate from real life multi sector stakeholder consultations four focus areas in the region were selected the selection was guided by local stakeholders acceptance of remedial measures as tools for nutrient load reduction and thus their likeliness to be implemented rather than their expected efficiency on nutrient load reductions seat downstream sea outlets the reasoning behind the pan baltic impact modelling approach presented here is to provide insight into potential large scale impacts or lack thereof of a selected ensemble of remediation measures on nutrient loads to the baltic sea basin understanding how the measures can potentially affect future nutrient loads at different spatial scales is essential to policy makers and stakeholders at the baltic sea regional scale our results add to the understanding of local remediation measure implementation at this scale the impact of stakeholder selected measures is evaluated at three different spatial scales catchment scale showing the spatial distribution of impacts for individual e hype catchments most relevant to local decision making stakeholders sea outlet basin scale providing impacts of measures in net loads to the baltic sea and baltic sea wide aggregates showing impacts to the overall load from land areas the latter are contextualised by load change estimates under mid century climate and socio economy projections 2 material and methods 2 1 hype model and e hype set up for the baltic sea drainage basin for the scenario modelling conducted in this study we use an integrated hydrological and nutrient transport model set up for the baltic sea drainage basin bsdb this model set up is part of the pan european model e hype and model calibration was performed on the full european domain hundecha et al 2016 we will therefore refer to the model set up as e hype here even though we conducted scenario analyses on the bsdb sub domain only e hype is a model set up of the conceptual hype model hydrological predictions for the environment which is an open source integrated rainfall runoff and nutrient transport model for a detailed model process description see lindström et al 2010 and https hypeweb smhi se model water hype uses sub basins to divide the landscape as opposed to uniformly spaced grid cells this approach allows to use high resolution catchment delineation and at the same time to aggregate sub basins to hydrologically meaningful sizes making hype computationally efficient for large scale applications each sub basin acts as an independent reactor with individual sub basins being hydrologically connected through a routing scheme fluxes and states are computed at each time step for hydrological response units hru defined within these catchments hrus are derived from landscape properties e g mapped soil and land cover types conceptually hrus consist of up to three stacked subsurface storages linear reservoirs with explicitly defined depths with a single groundwater table and a number of flow path conceptualisations for recharge and release e g snow cover evapotranspiration saturation and infiltration excess matrix flow macropore flow and tile drainage hype also includes a lake module which is embedded in the river routing scheme in order to tie nutrient turn over to modelled hydro dynamics hype explicitly accounts for soil porosity and field capacity wilting point storage volumes nutrient pools are coupled to these volumes hrus in hype are parameterised for the whole domain which allows for consistent parameterisation of ungauged areas e g strömqvist et al 2012 hundecha et al 2016 data required for setting up the model include spatial data for delineation and hru definition climate forcing data precipitation and air temperature calibration data some gauges of stream discharge and nutrient concentrations and land management data sources e g point source releases crop fractions and land management practices e hype has been developed as a large scale modelling tool for europe continuously over several years for a detailed description of the model set up and complete lists of data sources see e g donnelly et al 2016 hundecha et al 2016 the bsdb in e hype is delineated into 7200 sub basins for each of which model results can be computed the most recent developments of e hype v 3 1 4 include extensions and updates to input data e g estimates for point sources crop management and in soil nitrate turnover as well as a re calibration of model processes using updated observation series of riverine nutrient concentrations hrus in e hype are based on aggregated corine land cover 2006 classes with global land cover 2000 classes for areas not covered by corine in combination with aggregated fao unesco soil map of the world classes within the bsdb 13 land use classes exist fig a1a in appendix agricultural areas are classified into four land use classes totaling 34 of the bsdb area soils in the bsdb are classified into seven classes grouping mineral soils into three textural classes plus moraine material and shallow soils and soils with dominant organic material into another class fig a1b soils under agricultural land use are dominated by medium and fine mineral soil classes with a total of 74 of soils under agriculture falling into these classes in the bsdb all hrus with agricultural land use are assumed to include tile drainage at a depth of 0 75 m in the model with the exception of those on coarse soils input data assumptions with particular relevance for the scenarios of measures presented here include estimates of rural household emissions and fertiliser rates 2 2 modelling nutrients from rural households rural household emissions in e hype are conceptualised as constant emissions based on catchment wide release estimates emitted loads are routed partly into subsurface nutrient pools and partly into local streams subsurface releases then undergo a much stronger retention and removal within the catchment especially for phosphorus which is efficiently trapped in soil pools the subsurface fraction is estimated to 75 with the remaining 25 being emitted to the stream network directly this partition serves as a simplistic conceptualisation of the various retention mechanisms at individual household installations which range from intentional or accidental seepage of septic tanks to actual removal and transport for off site treatment in e hype releases are estimated from a combination of several data sources gross per capita releases amount to 13 5 g d 1 for nitrogen and 2 1 g d 1 for phosphorus swedish epa 1995 nutrient removal efficiencies for treatment of rural household emissions and percentages of population connected to facilities with different treatment levels were taken from national scale categorised percentages published by the european environmental agency eea for 2005 eea 2013 rural population number estimates in each e hype catchment were calculated from data of the history database of the global environment hyde for 2005 goldewijk et al 2011 these hyde population estimates however do not include information on connectivity to sewer systems so that eea treatment percentages and hyde rural population fractions required an additional merging procedure eea treatment percentages were distributed over hyde population fractions in each e hype catchment with better treatment first distributed among any urban population in the catchment this procedure results in varying treatment efficiencies for urban and rural population in individual e hype catchments but this variation is assumed to lie well within the uncertainty bounds of the overall estimation chain and are therefore deemed acceptable 2 3 modelling nutrients from fertiliser inputs fertiliser inputs in e hype is tied to regionalised crop classes with nitrogen and phosphorus rates for mineral fertiliser and manure defined for each crop class individually application dates are pre defined with up to two applications possible for each crop class per year fertiliser amounts are added to the upper two soil layers at fixed ratios across the e hype domain crop classes are further differentiated into regions owing to climate gradients and different agricultural structures over the large model domain e hype crop regions are based on eurostat nuts regions nomenclature of territorial units for statistics at level 2 for estimates of regional fertiliser inputs rates we then used results from the capri model common agricultural policy regionalised impact analysis a quantitative agricultural sector modelling system britz et al 2007 and the eurostat farm structure survey fss eurostat 2016 other crop characteristics as e g growth season and harvesting dates were extracted from the mirca2000 data set portmann et al 2010 all nutrient related data sources represent a reference period of around 2001 2010 which was subsequently used in calibration for in stream nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations 2 4 parameter estimation and model evaluation like many large scale hydrological model applications e hype is calibrated for an optimised performance across the full model domain as opposed to an optimisation of single observation points calibration of model parameters regulating discharge was conducted using automatic calibration routines hundecha et al 2016 calibration of parameters for riverine nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus was then performed with the calibrated discharge model combining automatic parameter optimisation and manual tuning both nutrient and discharge calibration used the representative gauged basin rgb approach to estimate parameterisations for ungauged areas within the model domain donnelly et al 2016 strömqvist et al 2012 discharge calibration was evaluated at a monthly time step during 1981 2000 using median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 and percentage bias pbias eqn 2 1 n s e 1 i 1 n s i m i o b s i 2 i 1 n o b s i o b s 2 2 p b i a s i 1 n s i m i o b s i i 1 n o b s i 100 nse and pbias were 0 55 and 0 5 respectively across stations without strong regulation influence in europe stations were screened visually for evidence of regulation in time series and flow duration curves and classified accordingly for the bsdb domain corresponding medians were slightly better for nse at 0 66 and similar for pbias at 0 6 flow performances were rated satisfactory for nse and good for pbias in the context of large scale hydrological modelling moriasi et al 2007 there is a considerable spread in performance across gauging stations in the bsdb with regional patterns of under and over estimations of long term discharges fig 1 a b large volumetric biases in discharge often coincide with low nse scores and are considered to be a combined effect of regional biases in forcing data evapotranspiration estimates and effects of water human water abstraction and transfer between river systems unknown to the model the scandinavian mountain range is a notable exception to this pattern discharge volumes are underestimated in this region while nse values remain still high due to the strong seasonality of snow melt dominated discharge dynamics which is adequately captured by the model note that polish gauging stations were only added after the calibration and are shown here for a reference only total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations produced by the model are more uncertain than discharges nutrient turnover processes are more complex and more influenced by management decisions that are largely generalised in the model e g fertiliser amounts and timing there were also less nutrient observation stations available for the calibration within the e hype domain than for discharges and no stations in the southern baltic region x of nutrient monitoring sites were sampled with at least a bi weekly tine step e hype nutrient concentrations were calibrated for a 2001 2010 period the median relative error was 8 and 10 for tp and tn respectively across the e hype domain and 6 and 9 for tp and tn respectively across the bsdb 2 5 remedial measures of baltic sea drainage basin within the scope of this study we defined four remediation measures which could be implemented widely in the bsdb as part of programmes of measures which address various local environmental issues while also reduce nutrient loads in surface waters these measures include 1 the establishment of buffer strips along streams in agricultural areas 2 decreased fertiliser amounts due to technological advances in farming technology e g precision farming 3 establishment of storm water retention ponds in semi urban areas and 4 a theoretical scenario of nearly eliminating rural household sewage releases to explore the overall impact of a significant source load reduction on loads at sea outlets this set of measures was selected from a larger number of measures identified during multi sector stakeholder discussions in four case study areas in four countries that border the baltic sea walczykiewicz et al 2017 the measures were assumed to be applied uniformly following the same general rules based on land use or soil type across the bsdb the intent was to apply the measures at a rather extensive scope in order to be able to evaluate their mitigation potential for the baltic sea buffer strips were established at two different levels a basic buffer strip 2 m wide was simulated along all streams that flow through agricultural land and a wider 6 meter buffer strip was simulated along streams in agricultural areas for catchments where at least 25 of the land use was agriculture and at least 10 of soils were classified as medium or medium fine signifying high levels of exposure for erosion and high erodibility of the exposed surfaces technological advances in agriculture were assumed to result in a 5 reduction in n and p fertiliser application due to implementation of precision farming and auto steering on large farms 100 ha mainly due to reduced overlap the area weighted proportion of large farms from eurostat ec europa eu 2016 was used on a country level to estimate the total reduction retention ponds were assumed to be constructed downstream of urban catchments the proportion of urban area runoff that was treated via retention ponds varied with percent imperviousness the proportion was determined using a cumulative distribution function and assuming 5 15 30 45 and 60 of the area being treated for imperviousness thresholds for 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentiles the design characteristics for each retention pond were approximated from directly connected impervious area sutherland 1995 and a surface area to drainage area ratio usepa 1986 rural household sewage releases were assumed to decrease to 10 of the estimated emitted nitrogen and phosphorus loads for 2005 reference conditions the 90 load reduction was applied to current net releases in each e hype catchment after current treatment i e to estimates based on rural population and current removal efficiencies reductions relative to gross releases are therefore higher in catchments with low treatment efficiency and lower vice versa emissions were still routed to streams and sub surface pools as in the reference model this reduction assumption should be considered as a more theoretical domain wide assumption compared to the other scenario measures this assumption can be unrealistic to achieve in practice in certain parts of the domain due to already high treatment efficiencies and corresponding low releases it allowed us however to provide an indication of possible improvements in bsdb wide net load releases into the sea under the assumption of a significant bsdb wide source release reduction 2 6 scenario modelling to allow for long term planning and management on international level within the bsdb the year 2050 was selected as a projection time frame for simulating future scenarios this translates to a 30 year model period centred around 2050 2036 2065 the changes were compared to the baseline simulation using 30 years during a recent time period 1981 2010 model simulations were started 10 years prior each evaluation period to allow for the model state variables to set the climate model data were used for both reference baseline and the future 2050s time periods to ensure consistency for the cross comparison during each evaluation period all other model inputs such as land use point source discharges or management practices were considered constant precipitation and air temperature were the only time dependent model inputs in order to determine long term average characteristics for each time period solely as driven by the climate and socioeconomics the same model inputs used in the calibration reflecting 2010 2012 with the exception of the climate forcing data were used in the model runs for the reference period the future period 2050s was represented by a combination of climate model projections and a plausible socioeconomic development in the bsdb remediation measures were applied over the bsdb through changes in e hype parametrisation for both the current and future periods daily outputs from e hype were aggregated to mean annual loads at three different spatial scales to investigate spatial load patterns and expected impacts of remediation measure scenarios in different regions in the bsdb results were first evaluated at a local scale for individual catchments which provides an insight into the local impact variation local here being e hype catchments i e the smallest modelled spatial unit the catchment scale reflects the perspective which local decision makers often take when designing programmes of measures with a focus on improving local to regional conditions of a specific river basin under their responsibility the second level of spatial aggregation is at the sea outlet basins that integrate the upstream average net load emissions this reflects a much larger basin perspective where the focus is on net loads into the baltic sea and changes thereof regardless of local impacts of measures throughout the drainage basin upstream of the sea outlets while at the same time considering regional variation from different river basins around the baltic sea the highest level of aggregation is at the bsdb with total loads summarized from all land areas draining to the baltic sea this scale reflects the focus of international cooperation and agreements with the goal of reducing nutrient loads to the baltic sea and improving its overall environmental status 2 7 climate data two climate models were selected from a larger euro cordex coordinated regional downscaling experiment ensemble of dynamically downscaled climate change projections from the cmip5 global climate model ensemble www cordex org e g jacob et al 2014 for rcp8 5 riahi et al 2007 the two chosen climate model projections represent the high end of projected changes over the study area in precipitation and air temperature respectively rather than the full ensemble spread the selection was based on mid century changes in summer under the assumption that changes in summer most strongly influence changes in nutrient dynamics however the higher end of projected changes on annual scale is also represented bartosova et al 2019 the chosen climate model projections were further downscaled statistically using distribution based downscaling dbs bias correction yang et al 2010 this was done on the rcms 0 44 grid and towards watch forcing data era interim wfdei reanalysis forcing data reference period 1971 2000 2 8 socioeconomic assumptions land use agriculture population life style legislation and economic development are important drivers that change over time and can significantly affect generation and transport of nutrients to the baltic sea we have selected shared socioeconomic pathway 2 ssp2 the middle of the road development pathway van vuuren et al 2011 as interpreted by zandersen et al 2016 for the bsdb and implemented in e hype by bartosova et al 2019 to represent one plausible development by 2050s ssp2 follows recent development trends with some progress towards achieving the united nation s sustainable development goals all assumptions build on spatially differentiated projections of ultimate change factors population size urbanisation sewage treatment efficiency and food production from the international institute for applied systems analys iiasa ssp database riahi et al 2017 adapted into proximate change factors mapped to e hype bartosova et al 2019 significant changes in nutrient source releases include a 5 increase in nitrogen efficiency in agriculture a 30 decrease in atmospheric deposition of nitrogen a 20 and 25 reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads respectively associated with urban wastewater discharges and a 17 reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads associated with rural wastewater discharges no land use change was projected for this particular pathway note that these changes are expected to affect only the simulated nutrient source loads not the simulated flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of current nutrient loads average annual tn loads emitted from e hype catchments during the reference period show a strong gradient in a general north south direction fig 2a upper map on top of this general pattern the mapped loads reveal a local catchment to catchment variation as a combined result of differences in catchment properties and size the north south gradient reflects the climate gradient and subsequent differences in population density and land cover characteristics with agriculture dominating in the south and production forest in the north this gradient becomes even more prominent when looking at integrated unit area loads from baltic sea outlets fig 2a lower map where the effect of catchment size is cancelled out and the highest unit area loads occur in areas dominated by intensive agriculture in the south of the basin small coastal basins show a more irregular spatial pattern due to larger variation in land use at a smaller local scale the modelled spatial pattern for tp loads looks similar to tn fig 3a however the highest unit area loads for phosphorus are not only coupled to agriculture but also to population density and sewage treatment emissions high unit area phosphorus loads were modelled even for several south eastern parts of the basin where unit area nitrogen loads are comparatively lower table 1 3 2 impact of measures on nutrient loads at local scale modelled impact from the combined measures at the catchment level figs 2b and 3 b upper maps shows a large spatial variation with little impact in the northern half dominated by sparsely populated forested areas the overall pattern is comparable to that of tn and tp loads this agreement is not surprising since all measures considered here are coupled to either agricultural practice or human population this similarity in local change patterns is corroborated by change figures summarised as area proportions of the bsdb with classified change magnitudes table 2 local loads were reduced by at least 5 in 53 of the bsdb area for both tn and tp loads and by at least 10 in 28 and 30 of the bsdb area for tn and tp loads respectively as a result of all measures combined there are however marked differences in the responses of the two nutrients when looking at the local impact of individual measures figs 2c and 3 c upper maps buffers showed no noticeable impact on nitrogen loads because nitrogen is predominantly transported in dissolved form along sub surface pathways in e hype phosphorus loads from agricultural areas are however reduced when surface runoff with eroded particles flows over the buffers buffers had the biggest impact in the southern and south western parts of the basin with smaller impacts in more easterly agricultural areas this difference could be explained by differences in soil textures and precipitation patterns and resulting differences in the importance of surface water flow dominant crop types and other factors such as fertilization rates and timing or sowing and harvesting dates can also influence the overall impact of buffer strips within e hype s conceptual model framework reductions in phosphorus loads of at least 10 were projected for 14 of the bsdb area table 2 the fertiliser reduction measure as modelled here affects only large scale farms where investing in technological advances is more likely to be economically viable compared to small farms as a result the farm structure is visible at a local scale with higher impacts on nitrogen loads occurring in countries where large farms dominate another factor reflected in the change pattern is regionally estimated fertiliser application rates with change pattern being the most prominent where the fertiliser application rates are high at the same time other local characteristics such as soil types or nitrogen reduction processes in soils groundwater or surface water can affect the measure performance impacts were negligible for phosphorus due to changes in phosphorus loads not being as directly coupled to fertiliser application practices as nitrogen loads due to the effect of legacy phosphorus in modelled loads the legacy phosphorus pools in agricultural topsoils are large compared to annual fertiliser amounts and can dampen the immediate impact of fertiliser rates on phosphorus loads especially when the change is relatively small 5 reduction at large farms phosphorus load reductions from agricultural soils have been shown to require more profound changes in fertiliser management which aim for effectively reducing the amount of phosphorus stored in agricultural topsoils in relation to what is plant available during growth periods withers et al 2014 legacy pools can also delay impacts of reduction measures on nitrogen loads as subsurface transport paths can significantly delay load exports at catchment level howden et al 2011 within the conceptual model framework of hype subsurface transport paths estimates are likely to be at the short end given that the model parametrisation is primarily driven by discharge dynamics which is most effective for fast transport paths whereas nitrogen export delay would be mainly affected by the slow end of the catchment wide transport path distribution for the interpretation of modelled reduction scenario effects this translates into that potential impact delays on nitrogen loads because of legacy nitrogen are likely to be under estimated as part of the epistemic uncertainty in the hype model concept overall the modelled impact of reduced fertiliser application under the chosen assumptions is low with 13 of the bsdb area showing a local nitrogen load reduction of at least 2 5 and only 3 of the area exceeding 5 reduction projected phosphorus load reductions under the chosen assumptions remain under 2 5 in all areas table 2 stormwater ponds measures conceptualised as internal lakes in catchments with urban land use showed a much more localised impact on nitrogen and phosphorus loads phosphorus loads were affected more than nitrogen loads because lakes are more efficient traps for mainly particulate phosphorus than for mainly dissolved nitrogen stormwater retention ponds are often implemented primarily due to their positive impact on flood reduction and flood water retention in vulnerable areas and thus represent measures with potential benefits for stakeholders across different sectors modelled changes to riverine nutrient loads represent a desirable side effect in this study with the ponds acting similarly to constructed on stream wetlands that specifically target nutrient load reduction goals simulated load reductions exceeding 5 of the local reference loads were simulated in 3 of the bsdb area for nitrogen and 9 for phosphorus stronger reductions exceeding 10 were rare for nitrogen 0 5 of the area while such reductions were achieved for phosphorus in 3 of the area the rural treatment measure scenario with the chosen release and reduction assumptions i e near elimination of rural household releases showed the greatest impact of all modelled measures reductions are particularly pronounced in the southern and eastern half of the basin where the current load contributions from rural sources i e for the reference year 2005 are comparatively high and thus represent a large share of the total loads nitrogen and phosphorus loads are reduced significantly at the local scale with reductions of at least 5 in 39 and 37 of the bsdb area for nitrogen and phosphorus loads respectively and reductions at least 20 in 15 and 10 of the bsdb area for nitrogen and phosphorus loads respectively 3 3 impact of measures on nutrient loads at sea outlets spatial variation of upstream effects is smoothed out in the integrated net loads at sea outlets only impacts which take effect over large areas in a particular basin result in an effective change at this scale figs 2b c and 3 b c lower maps internal retention of local loads in a basin can reduce net loads at the outlets particularly in lake rich regions or large basins with long in stream travel times in terms of measure impacts at sea outlets this translates into diminished measure efficiencies where the internal retention is high cf phosphorus reductions at catchment and outlet scales for swedish parts of baltic proper basin fig 3b average modelled retention amounts ranged from under 2 5 to more than 60 for both nitrogen and phosphorus at the bsdb sea outlet basins during the reference period fig 4 the areas of highest retention at sea outlets are basins upstream of the largest lake systems in the region lake ladoga and the finnish lake systems in the eastern parts and lake vänern and vättern to the west lakes with large volumes and long turnover times act as efficient sinks of upstream n and p loads retention in basins without large lake systems is lower with subtle differences between tn and tp modelled retention of tn is generally higher than tp in the northern parts of the bsdb possibly owing to instream denitrification of nitrogen loads originating from atmospheric deposition this effect is masked in the southern parts of the bsdb where loads are higher and stem from multiple sources for both nitrogen and phosphorus for the combined measures scenario the strongest impact at this scale is projected for the southern basin parts mainly due to the effectiveness of the rural source elimination scenario in these areas isolated local effects in small upstream catchments e g most stormwater pond measure impacts have little effect on loads at the corresponding sea outlets unless they are located in small coastal basins overall changes are low to moderate over large areas with 18 and 50 of the bsdb area showing less than 2 5 load reduction i e low impact for the combined scenario for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively table 2 tn loads are reduced more than the tp loads in most categories with 50 and 35 of the area showing a reduction of at least 5 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively the area fraction with reductions less than 2 5 is in excess of 90 for most individual measure scenarios except for the rural treatment scenario which showed stronger reductions of both phosphorus and nitrogen loads over larger areas and buffers which showed a moderate reduction of phosphorus loads larger than 2 5 over about 20 of the area 3 4 cross scale comparison of load reductions our integrated bsdb wide model approach allows us to quantify scale dependencies of modelled load reductions in response to measure scenarios while local impacts of measure scenario can be significant reduction in net loads to the baltic sea are much lower local in this context means e hype model catchments at a median size of 215 km2 in the bsdb the highest reductions modelled at this scale are in excess of 80 for individual measures in a small number of catchments cf table 2 included in of the less than 20 bracket impacts at higher resolution e g down to individual stream reaches may become even higher but landscape the heterogeneity at these scales is no longer represented adequately in regionally driven hydrological model like e hype to provide meaningful assistance with impact projections nonetheless even the cross scale comparison between e hype catchment and sea outlet scales highlight the differences in impacts for nitrogen e g about 2 of the bsdb area 127 catchments achieved at least 40 reduction at a local catchment level but only 3 sea outlet basins with very small areas about 8600 km2 combined less than 0 1 of bsdb show at least 40 reduction in net loads to the baltic sea aggregated average modelled net loads to the baltic sea allow assessing the overall impact of the selected measure scenarios at this scale fig 5 e hype results at this scale illustrate a lack of impact of the measure scenarios unless they involve considerable reductions in nutrient source releases large scale impacts are almost negligible for measures that target an increased retention removal without changing the source releases ranging from no to 2 6 reduction of the total nutrient loads aggregated to the baltic sea fig 5 if the targeted measure significantly reduce nutrient source releases as in the rural source elimination scenario nutrient loads were reduced to about 7 the fertiliser reduction scenario which also reduced anthropogenic source releases had lower impact compared to rural treatment because the scenario assumptions translated to a comparatively small area where the reduction was applied new regulation approaches for fertiliser management might result in higher reduction impacts than under the assumptions taken here e g spatially differentiated regulation based on reduction potential for nitrogen refsgaard et al 2019 or phosphorus fertiliser application strategies that minimise wash off and subsequent loss through either soil sorption or direct transfer to the stream network kleinman et al 2011 miller et al 2020 reported in a scenario based analysis of nitrogen loads to the chesapeake bay drainage basin that ca half of the tn load from fertiliser sources could be removed by eliminating fertiliser leakage from the highest contributing areas only which amounted to ca 10 of the total agricultural area this illustrates the potential for improvements under new regulation approaches our integrated model approach also allowed us to compare nutrient loads to the baltic sea under combined and individual measures scenarios in order to examine for evidence of synergies or antergies in the combined load reductions combined reductions are slightly lower than individual reductions combined for modelled tn and tp loads to the baltic sea 9 3 vs 9 4 for tn 8 4 vs 8 9 for tp but the differences are too small to indicate reduced efficiencies under combined conditions at the bsdb outlet scale most of the impacts were achieved in the part of the bsdb that drains to baltic proper see drainage basin outline in figs 2b and 3 b the baltic proper is defined as the central sea basin of the baltic sea distinguished from the gulf of bothnia to the north the gulf of finland to the east and the belt sea to the east the baltic proper drainage basin includes the largest fraction of agricultural land of the overall bsdb as well the largest human population the nutrient load reductions for the baltic proper drainage basins are slightly higher than for the whole bsdb with the largest differences again seen for rural treatment measures combining all measures led to about 12 and 9 reductions for the baltic proper drainage basin and bsdb respectively fig 5 as we move from local through sea outlet to the bsdb scale we see an overall decrease in the magnitude of nutrient load reductions spatial aggregation reduces area fractions for the reduction categories at the extreme ends minimum and maximum reductions because upstream variation vanishes from the distribution there are two main reasons for the decrease in the reductions first the measures are not applied to all catchments at the same scope but rather the scope varies with anthropogenic activities agriculture and urbanisation as the loads move downstream contributions from catchments with and without the measures are accumulated the smaller the scope of the implemented measures the faster the overall load reductions decrease across scales second nutrients can be retained or reduced in surface water for example through sedimentation or denitrification hence measures that are implemented upstream of areas with significant retention or reduction will not have a significant effect on nutrient loads at the sea outlets in particular constructed remediation measures typically lack sufficient spatial allocation scoping to contribute significantly to nutrient load reductions at the large basin scale the implementation strategy considers local effects but does not necessarily target effects across large areas this is coherent with previous model based evaluation of the effects of constructed wetlands in southern sweden where negligible impacts were found on nutrient loads at sea outlets despite an extensive implementation effort arheimer and pers 2017 3 5 nutrient load reductions at the baltic sea scale under environmental change nutrient load reductions can change depending on the environmental conditions fig 5 this is especially true for aggregated loads due to co dependent effects of nutrients on algae production and transformation processes following higher order rate behaviour when comparing reference and 2050s nutrient loads to the baltic sea without any mitigation measures nitrogen loads show an overall decrease under 2050s conditions whereas phosphorus shows an overall increase climate change itself is projected to increase nutrient loads significantly as a result of increased discharge volumes bartosova et al 2019 however large reduction in nitrogen sources under ssp2 and especially the expected 30 decrease of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen counteracts the increase projected from the climate change alone while the ssp2 assumptions also include decrease in phosphorus load released into the bsdb it is not sufficient to counteract the larger projected increase in phosphorus load ockenden et al 2017 changes in phosphorus loads are more closely related to changes in precipitation due to their close association with surface runoff the spatial pattern of impacts associated with individual or combined measures projected for 2050s conditions did not change from the overall pattern under current conditions however we see mostly similar or lower load reductions under 2050s conditions compared to the reference conditions for both nutrients fig 5 modelled nitrogen reductions for the rural treatment scenario e g are 6 7 under reference conditions and 6 during the 2050s period with rcp8 5 and ssp2 the only notable exceptions are phosphorus load reductions for buffers and stormwater ponds the projected increased phosphorus load reductions for buffers from 1 8 to 2 6 reduction can be likely related due to the higher proportion of surface flows projected for the 2050s 3 6 confidence and uncertainty in modelled scenario impacts modelling the impact of scenarios always carries considerable uncertainty with sources of uncertainty originating in all steps of the modelling chain from climate forcing data through the impact model structure and calibration to scenario assumptions modelling the effects of remediation measures on riverine nutrient loads at large basin scales is particularly challenging in this regard because of the lack of detailed data on nutrient source releases and the unpredictability of local management choices both of which require strong assumptions and simplifications in conceptual model representation hydrological model approaches are on the other hand effective tools i to estimate over large areas and with adequate spatial resolution variables such as nutrient loads for which measurements are not readily available and ii to dynamically assess impacts of change in climate and other environmental conditions using a scenario approach for impact modelling in this study we used a minimal climate model ensemble with 2 members which allows us in a limited way to explore uncertainty in projected climate change impacts and relate it to overall modelled change magnitudes under measure scenarios modelled tn loads at the baltic sea scale under 2050s rcp8 5 and ssp2 assumptions showed an impact range of less than 1 between the two climate model members while tp loads showed a larger range around 6 between the two members illustrating larger climate projection uncertainty for tp mobilisation and transport processes cf fig 5 than for tn processes total water discharge to the baltic sea was projected to increase between 14 and 19 with the two models i e a strong change signal despite a wide range in projected magnitude bartosova et al 2019 used a four member ensemble designed to represent a range of projected changes in temperature and precipitation that included the two climate models chosen here for a similar impact analysis on bsdb wide nutrient loads one of the four members projected lower impacts particularly on tp loads compared to the impact range of our ensemble but none projected higher impacts they found however a strong impact of socio economic management scenario alternatives on nutrient loads which outweighed the climate ensemble impact spread this highlights the relative importance of considering the management scenario uncertainty in nutrient load projections for mid century projections in this region projection uncertainties in the measure scenarios themselves are arguably impossible to quantify but originate from a number of distinguishable sources measure efficiency itself varies with local conditions and can be hard to quantify exactly a priori phosphorus load reduction in buffer strips e g depends on biogeochemical processes in a several flow paths within the buffer zone with strong local variations hoffmann et al 2009 our results aim to show what load reductions can be expected over larger areas and furthermore to highlight the importance of source reductions for large scale effects using a theoretical elimination scenario for one of the relevant load sources in the bsdb nutrient reductions are also a function of hydrological conditions and thus variable in time e g johannesson et al 2015 we aimed to alleviate the effects of this uncertainty by showing changes in long term averages which cover a wide range of hydrological conditions nonetheless while models as e hype simulate time dynamic flow processes small scale dynamics at field scale are necessarily simplified in the model framework reducing the real world variation in the model results management related effects pose another uncertainty source in the scenarios for example agricultural production is governed by changing climate and economic conditions and adaptation of farmers to these conditions which translates into uncertainty in agricultural practices relevant to nutrient loads e g crop cover and fertiliser rates huttunen et al 2015 our integrated bsdb wide measure scenario impact modelling should thus be interpreted as benchmarks which provide an understanding of change directions and relative impact magnitudes although they have to be contextualised with the underlying model assumptions this holds particularly true for the rural source elimination scenario which assumes load reductions that are unrealistic real world targets but serves as a theoretical end point benchmark to illustrate impact ranges at the bsdb scale as a whole large scale dynamic model approaches necessarily simplify local catchment variations which have an influence on actual measure efficiency at the individual sites stormwater ponds e g were assumed here to be implemented whenever the urban area criterion in an e hype catchment was fulfilled the meaningfulness of an actual implementation in a specific place would of course depend on many more factors in the local settings as would its design properties such as e g the drainage area of the constructed ponds other important factors for actual implementation are cost effectivity and acceptance for instance fertilizer reductions and reductions in point source emissions have been shown to be important measures for reducing nitrogen loads across the bsdb in a cost effective way elofsson 2003 carolus et al 2020 reveal from a hydrological modelling study of 16 nutrient mitigation measures for three different european catchment areas the latvian berze the swedish helge and the german selke rivers a substantial local variability of the effectivity of measures due to different conditions such as land use soil or hydrological pathways pointing towards the need for regionally tailored programmes of measures to high effectivity the effectiveness of constructed wetlands to reduce nutrient loads has been shown to depend on source emission amounts upstream of implemented wetlands with cost efficiencies out competing buffer zones and catch crops in cases where large sources were filtered efficiently gachango et al 2015 such studies illustrate that overall the cost effectiveness always also depend on local conditions in addition to the effects of large scale scoping and within basin retention as highlighted by our large scale impact model results nontheless our results provide a set of what if benchmarks for large scale impacts of locally implemented measures and as such can provide useful boundary conditions for scenario impact analyses of the baltic sea ecosystem itself e g neumann and schernewski 2005 and guide effective policy development to support helcom load reduction goals established in the bsap in addition to the variation in efficiency of constructed measures large scale modelling approaches face the challenge of correctly estimating the current state of measure implementation data on rural wastewater emissions e g are not available in detail over large areas and thus have to be estimated using appropriate proxy data here we used published data sources on population numbers and treatment efficiencies as proxies to calculate rural wastewater emissions for the reference period 2001 2010 at the e hype catchment resolution updated data on treatment efficiencies eea 2017 indicate an improved treatment in some of the helcom member states during the period up to the most recent published data for 2015 for poland e g overall fraction of population with treated wastewater increased from 60 2 of the population in 2005 to 72 6 in 2015 and the fraction for tertiary treatment increased from 37 3 58 9 during the same period this suggests that a part of the load reductions we projected for the rural wastewater measure have already been achieved as of today 4 conclusions this study focussed on the integrated large scale effects of local nutrient load reduction measures modelled for the baltic sea region where current nutrient loads at sea outlets have a negative impact on marine ecosystems the key message from our scenario driven model analysis is that reduction of source releases and scoping of measures should be the first considerations for choosing effective measures at this scale our results illustrate a diminishing effect of local measures on nutrient load reductions as the evaluation point moves from local to the bsdb scale if i measures do not include substantial reductions of nutrient source releases or ii do not have a wide scope i e are not applied over large areas even though our scenario assumptions themselves were not driven by nutrient reduction goals for the baltic sea it is worth noting that the mean modelled reductions in nutrient loads the baltic sea under reference climate conditions and our combined measures scenario amount to 54 kilotons for total nitrogen and 2 2 kilotons for total phosphorus respectively this falls short of the estimated reduction needs of 118 kilotons for nitrogen and 15 kilotons for phosphorus to achieve good environmental status in the baltic sea as targeted in the baltic sea action plan helcom 2013 and highlights the need to specifically design programmes of measures which target large scale reduction goals alongside local i e stream reach to catchment scale goals these findings are not per se conflicting with significant load reductions in local catchments and other potential remediation goals such as increased biodiversity within the basin they do however indicate a need to consider specifically basin wide load reductions because adequate reductions might not be achieved merely as a by product of locally effective remediation measures this in turn may pose a challenge for policy makers and other decision makers involved in designing programs of measures which integrate local and large scale improvements in order to achieve substantial nutrient load reduction at the bsdb scale we need to reduce nutrient emissions sufficiently at their sources we also found these conclusions to apply under 2050s conditions combining climate change and socio economic changes which showed similar effects of measure scenarios as under reference conditions 2050s middle of the road conditions also indicate decreasing loads for nitrogen mainly as a result of reduced atmospheric deposition which compensated the increased loads projected from climate change alone 2050s phosphorus loads which did not include significant source changes indicate a net increase as a result of the projected climate and socioeconomic conditions

hydrological and nutrient transport model e hype to model basin wide impacts of measure scenarios on the baltic sea where eutrophication is a critical issue for the marine ecosystem we constructed measure scenarios based on stakeholder acceptance established in workshops in different regions around the baltic these measures include local stream reach to catchment scale measures aiming to reduce nutrient transport into the stream network buffer strips stormwater ponds and measures aiming to reduce regional nutrient source releases fertiliser leaching rates rural household emissions new hydrological insights for the region nutrient load reductions are often needed to reduce eutrophication and improve overall surface water quality in fresh water and enclosed bays and seas where dilution is limited and load emissions have long residence times to reduce riverine nutrient loads remediation measures are necessary e g establishment of buffer strips or improved wastewater treatment such measures are however typically not designed to target nutrient load reductions at sea outlets but rather focus on local improvements here we show that measures notwithstanding other meliorating ecosystem benefits must include reductions in load emissions across large basin areas to impact integrated net loads into coastal sea basins because reduction measures that only target nutrient delivery to the stream network typically cannot be implemented in a significant enough proportion of the total drainage area of large coastal river basins our impact scenarios show bsdb wide nutrient reductions of up to 9 for nitrogen and phosphorus compared to a reference scenario if load emissions are reduced in the scenario assumptions keywords baltic sea e hype hydrological modelling nutrient load reduction scenario impacts water quality 1 introduction anthropogenically driven eutrophication is a global problem of surface water bodies in landscapes under human use excessive emissions of macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus originate from various diffuse and point sources and are subsequently transported along surface and sub surface water flow paths these riverine nutrient loads impact water quality in downstream aquatic ecosystems from local headwater streams through lake and river systems all the way down to marine ecosystems at river outlets where they are discharged into the sea in the baltic sea drainage basin bsdb the impact of nutrient load pollution on the marine ecosystem is amplified because the baltic sea is an enclosed sea with limited water exchange with the open ocean which exacerbates eutrophication compared to more open sea basins this has been long acknowledged by the scientific and decision making communities and led to the establishment of the baltic sea action plan bsap through the helsinki commission helcom which prescribes reduction goals for nitrogen and phosphorus loads for all member states helcom 2013 it is however not clear how these goals can be achieved effectively by the member states and how projected climate change and possible modifications of land uses or other anthropogenic drivers affect future riverine nutrient load dynamics to the baltic sea basin in the 21st century large scale hydrological model applications can serve as effective tools to dynamically predict basin wide nutrient transports coherently over large areas thus they allow to investigate impacts from environmental change and implementation of remediation measures using projected forcing data across the model domain in particular such model frameworks can provide impact estimates of basin wide load reductions for different types of measures e g source reduction edge of field and in stream retention removal for the bsdb several such studies have been undertaken previously for instance arheimer et al 2012 used a hype model application to estimate the impact of climate change and extensive reductions in diffuse and point nutrient emissions they then related their results to bsap reduction targets for the end century period with results indicating difficulties to achieve all bsap targets and added uncertainty due to climate change impacts on flow and nutrient loads moreover wulff et al 2014 studied impacts and cost efficiencies of nutrient reduction measures and land use change in the bsdb using a multi model environment and utilised their basin scale model to highlight the importance of downstream retention for identifying cost effective reduction measures other studies used modelled discharge projections in combination with other predictors to estimate future trends in nutrient loads to the baltic sea e g hägg et al 2014 combined baltic sea scale climate change discharge scenarios with consumption and population growth scenarios as proxy for changes in anthropogenic sources and used simple regression models to estimate future nutrient transport change trajectories showing strong impacts of human source changes compared to climate impacts especially in the southern basin parts decisions to support implementation of edge of field and in stream remediation measures for reducing nutrient loads to surface waters e g constructed wetlands e g arheimer and wittgren 2002 fisher and acreman 1999 riparian buffers hoffmann et al 2009 or re meandering of small streams are typically made by regional government bodies and target the ecological status of local waters moreover these measures often fulfil multiple purposes along with load reduction e g enhanced fish spawning habitats increased biodiversity or re establishment of recreation areas other policy based measures e g the nitrate directive council directive 91 676 eec and the urban waste water directive directive 98 15 ec and directive 91 271 eec take effect more uniformly on national to trans national scales as changes in fertiliser application rules or stricter legislation on wastewater discharge quality the latter often target large scale remediation goals such as the overall load to the baltic sea studies of the cost effectiveness of measures targeting water quality have indicated that the outcome depends on both the specific location where a measure is implemented and on the scale where the effect is considered whether at the local waters or at the outlet of a larger river basin c f arheimer et al 2005 carolus et al 2020 balana et al 2015 in addition the process of climate change adds uncertainty to the effect estimates for different measures e g arheimer et al 2012 to address this scenario modelling of the effect of measures in a future climate can provide useful information when planning for cost effective nutrient reduction here we use the hydrological and nutrient transport model e hype hundecha et al 2016 to investigate the bsdb wide impacts of four widely applicable remediation measures under present and future climate and socioeconomic conditions in contrast to previous studies e g arheimer et al 2012 hägg et al 2014 wulff et al 2014 the remediation measures originate from real life multi sector stakeholder consultations four focus areas in the region were selected the selection was guided by local stakeholders acceptance of remedial measures as tools for nutrient load reduction and thus their likeliness to be implemented rather than their expected efficiency on nutrient load reductions seat downstream sea outlets the reasoning behind the pan baltic impact modelling approach presented here is to provide insight into potential large scale impacts or lack thereof of a selected ensemble of remediation measures on nutrient loads to the baltic sea basin understanding how the measures can potentially affect future nutrient loads at different spatial scales is essential to policy makers and stakeholders at the baltic sea regional scale our results add to the understanding of local remediation measure implementation at this scale the impact of stakeholder selected measures is evaluated at three different spatial scales catchment scale showing the spatial distribution of impacts for individual e hype catchments most relevant to local decision making stakeholders sea outlet basin scale providing impacts of measures in net loads to the baltic sea and baltic sea wide aggregates showing impacts to the overall load from land areas the latter are contextualised by load change estimates under mid century climate and socio economy projections 2 material and methods 2 1 hype model and e hype set up for the baltic sea drainage basin for the scenario modelling conducted in this study we use an integrated hydrological and nutrient transport model set up for the baltic sea drainage basin bsdb this model set up is part of the pan european model e hype and model calibration was performed on the full european domain hundecha et al 2016 we will therefore refer to the model set up as e hype here even though we conducted scenario analyses on the bsdb sub domain only e hype is a model set up of the conceptual hype model hydrological predictions for the environment which is an open source integrated rainfall runoff and nutrient transport model for a detailed model process description see lindström et al 2010 and https hypeweb smhi se model water hype uses sub basins to divide the landscape as opposed to uniformly spaced grid cells this approach allows to use high resolution catchment delineation and at the same time to aggregate sub basins to hydrologically meaningful sizes making hype computationally efficient for large scale applications each sub basin acts as an independent reactor with individual sub basins being hydrologically connected through a routing scheme fluxes and states are computed at each time step for hydrological response units hru defined within these catchments hrus are derived from landscape properties e g mapped soil and land cover types conceptually hrus consist of up to three stacked subsurface storages linear reservoirs with explicitly defined depths with a single groundwater table and a number of flow path conceptualisations for recharge and release e g snow cover evapotranspiration saturation and infiltration excess matrix flow macropore flow and tile drainage hype also includes a lake module which is embedded in the river routing scheme in order to tie nutrient turn over to modelled hydro dynamics hype explicitly accounts for soil porosity and field capacity wilting point storage volumes nutrient pools are coupled to these volumes hrus in hype are parameterised for the whole domain which allows for consistent parameterisation of ungauged areas e g strömqvist et al 2012 hundecha et al 2016 data required for setting up the model include spatial data for delineation and hru definition climate forcing data precipitation and air temperature calibration data some gauges of stream discharge and nutrient concentrations and land management data sources e g point source releases crop fractions and land management practices e hype has been developed as a large scale modelling tool for europe continuously over several years for a detailed description of the model set up and complete lists of data sources see e g donnelly et al 2016 hundecha et al 2016 the bsdb in e hype is delineated into 7200 sub basins for each of which model results can be computed the most recent developments of e hype v 3 1 4 include extensions and updates to input data e g estimates for point sources crop management and in soil nitrate turnover as well as a re calibration of model processes using updated observation series of riverine nutrient concentrations hrus in e hype are based on aggregated corine land cover 2006 classes with global land cover 2000 classes for areas not covered by corine in combination with aggregated fao unesco soil map of the world classes within the bsdb 13 land use classes exist fig a1a in appendix agricultural areas are classified into four land use classes totaling 34 of the bsdb area soils in the bsdb are classified into seven classes grouping mineral soils into three textural classes plus moraine material and shallow soils and soils with dominant organic material into another class fig a1b soils under agricultural land use are dominated by medium and fine mineral soil classes with a total of 74 of soils under agriculture falling into these classes in the bsdb all hrus with agricultural land use are assumed to include tile drainage at a depth of 0 75 m in the model with the exception of those on coarse soils input data assumptions with particular relevance for the scenarios of measures presented here include estimates of rural household emissions and fertiliser rates 2 2 modelling nutrients from rural households rural household emissions in e hype are conceptualised as constant emissions based on catchment wide release estimates emitted loads are routed partly into subsurface nutrient pools and partly into local streams subsurface releases then undergo a much stronger retention and removal within the catchment especially for phosphorus which is efficiently trapped in soil pools the subsurface fraction is estimated to 75 with the remaining 25 being emitted to the stream network directly this partition serves as a simplistic conceptualisation of the various retention mechanisms at individual household installations which range from intentional or accidental seepage of septic tanks to actual removal and transport for off site treatment in e hype releases are estimated from a combination of several data sources gross per capita releases amount to 13 5 g d 1 for nitrogen and 2 1 g d 1 for phosphorus swedish epa 1995 nutrient removal efficiencies for treatment of rural household emissions and percentages of population connected to facilities with different treatment levels were taken from national scale categorised percentages published by the european environmental agency eea for 2005 eea 2013 rural population number estimates in each e hype catchment were calculated from data of the history database of the global environment hyde for 2005 goldewijk et al 2011 these hyde population estimates however do not include information on connectivity to sewer systems so that eea treatment percentages and hyde rural population fractions required an additional merging procedure eea treatment percentages were distributed over hyde population fractions in each e hype catchment with better treatment first distributed among any urban population in the catchment this procedure results in varying treatment efficiencies for urban and rural population in individual e hype catchments but this variation is assumed to lie well within the uncertainty bounds of the overall estimation chain and are therefore deemed acceptable 2 3 modelling nutrients from fertiliser inputs fertiliser inputs in e hype is tied to regionalised crop classes with nitrogen and phosphorus rates for mineral fertiliser and manure defined for each crop class individually application dates are pre defined with up to two applications possible for each crop class per year fertiliser amounts are added to the upper two soil layers at fixed ratios across the e hype domain crop classes are further differentiated into regions owing to climate gradients and different agricultural structures over the large model domain e hype crop regions are based on eurostat nuts regions nomenclature of territorial units for statistics at level 2 for estimates of regional fertiliser inputs rates we then used results from the capri model common agricultural policy regionalised impact analysis a quantitative agricultural sector modelling system britz et al 2007 and the eurostat farm structure survey fss eurostat 2016 other crop characteristics as e g growth season and harvesting dates were extracted from the mirca2000 data set portmann et al 2010 all nutrient related data sources represent a reference period of around 2001 2010 which was subsequently used in calibration for in stream nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations 2 4 parameter estimation and model evaluation like many large scale hydrological model applications e hype is calibrated for an optimised performance across the full model domain as opposed to an optimisation of single observation points calibration of model parameters regulating discharge was conducted using automatic calibration routines hundecha et al 2016 calibration of parameters for riverine nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus was then performed with the calibrated discharge model combining automatic parameter optimisation and manual tuning both nutrient and discharge calibration used the representative gauged basin rgb approach to estimate parameterisations for ungauged areas within the model domain donnelly et al 2016 strömqvist et al 2012 discharge calibration was evaluated at a monthly time step during 1981 2000 using median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 and percentage bias pbias eqn 2 1 n s e 1 i 1 n s i m i o b s i 2 i 1 n o b s i o b s 2 2 p b i a s i 1 n s i m i o b s i i 1 n o b s i 100 nse and pbias were 0 55 and 0 5 respectively across stations without strong regulation influence in europe stations were screened visually for evidence of regulation in time series and flow duration curves and classified accordingly for the bsdb domain corresponding medians were slightly better for nse at 0 66 and similar for pbias at 0 6 flow performances were rated satisfactory for nse and good for pbias in the context of large scale hydrological modelling moriasi et al 2007 there is a considerable spread in performance across gauging stations in the bsdb with regional patterns of under and over estimations of long term discharges fig 1 a b large volumetric biases in discharge often coincide with low nse scores and are considered to be a combined effect of regional biases in forcing data evapotranspiration estimates and effects of water human water abstraction and transfer between river systems unknown to the model the scandinavian mountain range is a notable exception to this pattern discharge volumes are underestimated in this region while nse values remain still high due to the strong seasonality of snow melt dominated discharge dynamics which is adequately captured by the model note that polish gauging stations were only added after the calibration and are shown here for a reference only total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations produced by the model are more uncertain than discharges nutrient turnover processes are more complex and more influenced by management decisions that are largely generalised in the model e g fertiliser amounts and timing there were also less nutrient observation stations available for the calibration within the e hype domain than for discharges and no stations in the southern baltic region x of nutrient monitoring sites were sampled with at least a bi weekly tine step e hype nutrient concentrations were calibrated for a 2001 2010 period the median relative error was 8 and 10 for tp and tn respectively across the e hype domain and 6 and 9 for tp and tn respectively across the bsdb 2 5 remedial measures of baltic sea drainage basin within the scope of this study we defined four remediation measures which could be implemented widely in the bsdb as part of programmes of measures which address various local environmental issues while also reduce nutrient loads in surface waters these measures include 1 the establishment of buffer strips along streams in agricultural areas 2 decreased fertiliser amounts due to technological advances in farming technology e g precision farming 3 establishment of storm water retention ponds in semi urban areas and 4 a theoretical scenario of nearly eliminating rural household sewage releases to explore the overall impact of a significant source load reduction on loads at sea outlets this set of measures was selected from a larger number of measures identified during multi sector stakeholder discussions in four case study areas in four countries that border the baltic sea walczykiewicz et al 2017 the measures were assumed to be applied uniformly following the same general rules based on land use or soil type across the bsdb the intent was to apply the measures at a rather extensive scope in order to be able to evaluate their mitigation potential for the baltic sea buffer strips were established at two different levels a basic buffer strip 2 m wide was simulated along all streams that flow through agricultural land and a wider 6 meter buffer strip was simulated along streams in agricultural areas for catchments where at least 25 of the land use was agriculture and at least 10 of soils were classified as medium or medium fine signifying high levels of exposure for erosion and high erodibility of the exposed surfaces technological advances in agriculture were assumed to result in a 5 reduction in n and p fertiliser application due to implementation of precision farming and auto steering on large farms 100 ha mainly due to reduced overlap the area weighted proportion of large farms from eurostat ec europa eu 2016 was used on a country level to estimate the total reduction retention ponds were assumed to be constructed downstream of urban catchments the proportion of urban area runoff that was treated via retention ponds varied with percent imperviousness the proportion was determined using a cumulative distribution function and assuming 5 15 30 45 and 60 of the area being treated for imperviousness thresholds for 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentiles the design characteristics for each retention pond were approximated from directly connected impervious area sutherland 1995 and a surface area to drainage area ratio usepa 1986 rural household sewage releases were assumed to decrease to 10 of the estimated emitted nitrogen and phosphorus loads for 2005 reference conditions the 90 load reduction was applied to current net releases in each e hype catchment after current treatment i e to estimates based on rural population and current removal efficiencies reductions relative to gross releases are therefore higher in catchments with low treatment efficiency and lower vice versa emissions were still routed to streams and sub surface pools as in the reference model this reduction assumption should be considered as a more theoretical domain wide assumption compared to the other scenario measures this assumption can be unrealistic to achieve in practice in certain parts of the domain due to already high treatment efficiencies and corresponding low releases it allowed us however to provide an indication of possible improvements in bsdb wide net load releases into the sea under the assumption of a significant bsdb wide source release reduction 2 6 scenario modelling to allow for long term planning and management on international level within the bsdb the year 2050 was selected as a projection time frame for simulating future scenarios this translates to a 30 year model period centred around 2050 2036 2065 the changes were compared to the baseline simulation using 30 years during a recent time period 1981 2010 model simulations were started 10 years prior each evaluation period to allow for the model state variables to set the climate model data were used for both reference baseline and the future 2050s time periods to ensure consistency for the cross comparison during each evaluation period all other model inputs such as land use point source discharges or management practices were considered constant precipitation and air temperature were the only time dependent model inputs in order to determine long term average characteristics for each time period solely as driven by the climate and socioeconomics the same model inputs used in the calibration reflecting 2010 2012 with the exception of the climate forcing data were used in the model runs for the reference period the future period 2050s was represented by a combination of climate model projections and a plausible socioeconomic development in the bsdb remediation measures were applied over the bsdb through changes in e hype parametrisation for both the current and future periods daily outputs from e hype were aggregated to mean annual loads at three different spatial scales to investigate spatial load patterns and expected impacts of remediation measure scenarios in different regions in the bsdb results were first evaluated at a local scale for individual catchments which provides an insight into the local impact variation local here being e hype catchments i e the smallest modelled spatial unit the catchment scale reflects the perspective which local decision makers often take when designing programmes of measures with a focus on improving local to regional conditions of a specific river basin under their responsibility the second level of spatial aggregation is at the sea outlet basins that integrate the upstream average net load emissions this reflects a much larger basin perspective where the focus is on net loads into the baltic sea and changes thereof regardless of local impacts of measures throughout the drainage basin upstream of the sea outlets while at the same time considering regional variation from different river basins around the baltic sea the highest level of aggregation is at the bsdb with total loads summarized from all land areas draining to the baltic sea this scale reflects the focus of international cooperation and agreements with the goal of reducing nutrient loads to the baltic sea and improving its overall environmental status 2 7 climate data two climate models were selected from a larger euro cordex coordinated regional downscaling experiment ensemble of dynamically downscaled climate change projections from the cmip5 global climate model ensemble www cordex org e g jacob et al 2014 for rcp8 5 riahi et al 2007 the two chosen climate model projections represent the high end of projected changes over the study area in precipitation and air temperature respectively rather than the full ensemble spread the selection was based on mid century changes in summer under the assumption that changes in summer most strongly influence changes in nutrient dynamics however the higher end of projected changes on annual scale is also represented bartosova et al 2019 the chosen climate model projections were further downscaled statistically using distribution based downscaling dbs bias correction yang et al 2010 this was done on the rcms 0 44 grid and towards watch forcing data era interim wfdei reanalysis forcing data reference period 1971 2000 2 8 socioeconomic assumptions land use agriculture population life style legislation and economic development are important drivers that change over time and can significantly affect generation and transport of nutrients to the baltic sea we have selected shared socioeconomic pathway 2 ssp2 the middle of the road development pathway van vuuren et al 2011 as interpreted by zandersen et al 2016 for the bsdb and implemented in e hype by bartosova et al 2019 to represent one plausible development by 2050s ssp2 follows recent development trends with some progress towards achieving the united nation s sustainable development goals all assumptions build on spatially differentiated projections of ultimate change factors population size urbanisation sewage treatment efficiency and food production from the international institute for applied systems analys iiasa ssp database riahi et al 2017 adapted into proximate change factors mapped to e hype bartosova et al 2019 significant changes in nutrient source releases include a 5 increase in nitrogen efficiency in agriculture a 30 decrease in atmospheric deposition of nitrogen a 20 and 25 reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads respectively associated with urban wastewater discharges and a 17 reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads associated with rural wastewater discharges no land use change was projected for this particular pathway note that these changes are expected to affect only the simulated nutrient source loads not the simulated flows 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of current nutrient loads average annual tn loads emitted from e hype catchments during the reference period show a strong gradient in a general north south direction fig 2a upper map on top of this general pattern the mapped loads reveal a local catchment to catchment variation as a combined result of differences in catchment properties and size the north south gradient reflects the climate gradient and subsequent differences in population density and land cover characteristics with agriculture dominating in the south and production forest in the north this gradient becomes even more prominent when looking at integrated unit area loads from baltic sea outlets fig 2a lower map where the effect of catchment size is cancelled out and the highest unit area loads occur in areas dominated by intensive agriculture in the south of the basin small coastal basins show a more irregular spatial pattern due to larger variation in land use at a smaller local scale the modelled spatial pattern for tp loads looks similar to tn fig 3a however the highest unit area loads for phosphorus are not only coupled to agriculture but also to population density and sewage treatment emissions high unit area phosphorus loads were modelled even for several south eastern parts of the basin where unit area nitrogen loads are comparatively lower table 1 3 2 impact of measures on nutrient loads at local scale modelled impact from the combined measures at the catchment level figs 2b and 3 b upper maps shows a large spatial variation with little impact in the northern half dominated by sparsely populated forested areas the overall pattern is comparable to that of tn and tp loads this agreement is not surprising since all measures considered here are coupled to either agricultural practice or human population this similarity in local change patterns is corroborated by change figures summarised as area proportions of the bsdb with classified change magnitudes table 2 local loads were reduced by at least 5 in 53 of the bsdb area for both tn and tp loads and by at least 10 in 28 and 30 of the bsdb area for tn and tp loads respectively as a result of all measures combined there are however marked differences in the responses of the two nutrients when looking at the local impact of individual measures figs 2c and 3 c upper maps buffers showed no noticeable impact on nitrogen loads because nitrogen is predominantly transported in dissolved form along sub surface pathways in e hype phosphorus loads from agricultural areas are however reduced when surface runoff with eroded particles flows over the buffers buffers had the biggest impact in the southern and south western parts of the basin with smaller impacts in more easterly agricultural areas this difference could be explained by differences in soil textures and precipitation patterns and resulting differences in the importance of surface water flow dominant crop types and other factors such as fertilization rates and timing or sowing and harvesting dates can also influence the overall impact of buffer strips within e hype s conceptual model framework reductions in phosphorus loads of at least 10 were projected for 14 of the bsdb area table 2 the fertiliser reduction measure as modelled here affects only large scale farms where investing in technological advances is more likely to be economically viable compared to small farms as a result the farm structure is visible at a local scale with higher impacts on nitrogen loads occurring in countries where large farms dominate another factor reflected in the change pattern is regionally estimated fertiliser application rates with change pattern being the most prominent where the fertiliser application rates are high at the same time other local characteristics such as soil types or nitrogen reduction processes in soils groundwater or surface water can affect the measure performance impacts were negligible for phosphorus due to changes in phosphorus loads not being as directly coupled to fertiliser application practices as nitrogen loads due to the effect of legacy phosphorus in modelled loads the legacy phosphorus pools in agricultural topsoils are large compared to annual fertiliser amounts and can dampen the immediate impact of fertiliser rates on phosphorus loads especially when the change is relatively small 5 reduction at large farms phosphorus load reductions from agricultural soils have been shown to require more profound changes in fertiliser management which aim for effectively reducing the amount of phosphorus stored in agricultural topsoils in relation to what is plant available during growth periods withers et al 2014 legacy pools can also delay impacts of reduction measures on nitrogen loads as subsurface transport paths can significantly delay load exports at catchment level howden et al 2011 within the conceptual model framework of hype subsurface transport paths estimates are likely to be at the short end given that the model parametrisation is primarily driven by discharge dynamics which is most effective for fast transport paths whereas nitrogen export delay would be mainly affected by the slow end of the catchment wide transport path distribution for the interpretation of modelled reduction scenario effects this translates into that potential impact delays on nitrogen loads because of legacy nitrogen are likely to be under estimated as part of the epistemic uncertainty in the hype model concept overall the modelled impact of reduced fertiliser application under the chosen assumptions is low with 13 of the bsdb area showing a local nitrogen load reduction of at least 2 5 and only 3 of the area exceeding 5 reduction projected phosphorus load reductions under the chosen assumptions remain under 2 5 in all areas table 2 stormwater ponds measures conceptualised as internal lakes in catchments with urban land use showed a much more localised impact on nitrogen and phosphorus loads phosphorus loads were affected more than nitrogen loads because lakes are more efficient traps for mainly particulate phosphorus than for mainly dissolved nitrogen stormwater retention ponds are often implemented primarily due to their positive impact on flood reduction and flood water retention in vulnerable areas and thus represent measures with potential benefits for stakeholders across different sectors modelled changes to riverine nutrient loads represent a desirable side effect in this study with the ponds acting similarly to constructed on stream wetlands that specifically target nutrient load reduction goals simulated load reductions exceeding 5 of the local reference loads were simulated in 3 of the bsdb area for nitrogen and 9 for phosphorus stronger reductions exceeding 10 were rare for nitrogen 0 5 of the area while such reductions were achieved for phosphorus in 3 of the area the rural treatment measure scenario with the chosen release and reduction assumptions i e near elimination of rural household releases showed the greatest impact of all modelled measures reductions are particularly pronounced in the southern and eastern half of the basin where the current load contributions from rural sources i e for the reference year 2005 are comparatively high and thus represent a large share of the total loads nitrogen and phosphorus loads are reduced significantly at the local scale with reductions of at least 5 in 39 and 37 of the bsdb area for nitrogen and phosphorus loads respectively and reductions at least 20 in 15 and 10 of the bsdb area for nitrogen and phosphorus loads respectively 3 3 impact of measures on nutrient loads at sea outlets spatial variation of upstream effects is smoothed out in the integrated net loads at sea outlets only impacts which take effect over large areas in a particular basin result in an effective change at this scale figs 2b c and 3 b c lower maps internal retention of local loads in a basin can reduce net loads at the outlets particularly in lake rich regions or large basins with long in stream travel times in terms of measure impacts at sea outlets this translates into diminished measure efficiencies where the internal retention is high cf phosphorus reductions at catchment and outlet scales for swedish parts of baltic proper basin fig 3b average modelled retention amounts ranged from under 2 5 to more than 60 for both nitrogen and phosphorus at the bsdb sea outlet basins during the reference period fig 4 the areas of highest retention at sea outlets are basins upstream of the largest lake systems in the region lake ladoga and the finnish lake systems in the eastern parts and lake vänern and vättern to the west lakes with large volumes and long turnover times act as efficient sinks of upstream n and p loads retention in basins without large lake systems is lower with subtle differences between tn and tp modelled retention of tn is generally higher than tp in the northern parts of the bsdb possibly owing to instream denitrification of nitrogen loads originating from atmospheric deposition this effect is masked in the southern parts of the bsdb where loads are higher and stem from multiple sources for both nitrogen and phosphorus for the combined measures scenario the strongest impact at this scale is projected for the southern basin parts mainly due to the effectiveness of the rural source elimination scenario in these areas isolated local effects in small upstream catchments e g most stormwater pond measure impacts have little effect on loads at the corresponding sea outlets unless they are located in small coastal basins overall changes are low to moderate over large areas with 18 and 50 of the bsdb area showing less than 2 5 load reduction i e low impact for the combined scenario for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively table 2 tn loads are reduced more than the tp loads in most categories with 50 and 35 of the area showing a reduction of at least 5 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively the area fraction with reductions less than 2 5 is in excess of 90 for most individual measure scenarios except for the rural treatment scenario which showed stronger reductions of both phosphorus and nitrogen loads over larger areas and buffers which showed a moderate reduction of phosphorus loads larger than 2 5 over about 20 of the area 3 4 cross scale comparison of load reductions our integrated bsdb wide model approach allows us to quantify scale dependencies of modelled load reductions in response to measure scenarios while local impacts of measure scenario can be significant reduction in net loads to the baltic sea are much lower local in this context means e hype model catchments at a median size of 215 km2 in the bsdb the highest reductions modelled at this scale are in excess of 80 for individual measures in a small number of catchments cf table 2 included in of the less than 20 bracket impacts at higher resolution e g down to individual stream reaches may become even higher but landscape the heterogeneity at these scales is no longer represented adequately in regionally driven hydrological model like e hype to provide meaningful assistance with impact projections nonetheless even the cross scale comparison between e hype catchment and sea outlet scales highlight the differences in impacts for nitrogen e g about 2 of the bsdb area 127 catchments achieved at least 40 reduction at a local catchment level but only 3 sea outlet basins with very small areas about 8600 km2 combined less than 0 1 of bsdb show at least 40 reduction in net loads to the baltic sea aggregated average modelled net loads to the baltic sea allow assessing the overall impact of the selected measure scenarios at this scale fig 5 e hype results at this scale illustrate a lack of impact of the measure scenarios unless they involve considerable reductions in nutrient source releases large scale impacts are almost negligible for measures that target an increased retention removal without changing the source releases ranging from no to 2 6 reduction of the total nutrient loads aggregated to the baltic sea fig 5 if the targeted measure significantly reduce nutrient source releases as in the rural source elimination scenario nutrient loads were reduced to about 7 the fertiliser reduction scenario which also reduced anthropogenic source releases had lower impact compared to rural treatment because the scenario assumptions translated to a comparatively small area where the reduction was applied new regulation approaches for fertiliser management might result in higher reduction impacts than under the assumptions taken here e g spatially differentiated regulation based on reduction potential for nitrogen refsgaard et al 2019 or phosphorus fertiliser application strategies that minimise wash off and subsequent loss through either soil sorption or direct transfer to the stream network kleinman et al 2011 miller et al 2020 reported in a scenario based analysis of nitrogen loads to the chesapeake bay drainage basin that ca half of the tn load from fertiliser sources could be removed by eliminating fertiliser leakage from the highest contributing areas only which amounted to ca 10 of the total agricultural area this illustrates the potential for improvements under new regulation approaches our integrated model approach also allowed us to compare nutrient loads to the baltic sea under combined and individual measures scenarios in order to examine for evidence of synergies or antergies in the combined load reductions combined reductions are slightly lower than individual reductions combined for modelled tn and tp loads to the baltic sea 9 3 vs 9 4 for tn 8 4 vs 8 9 for tp but the differences are too small to indicate reduced efficiencies under combined conditions at the bsdb outlet scale most of the impacts were achieved in the part of the bsdb that drains to baltic proper see drainage basin outline in figs 2b and 3 b the baltic proper is defined as the central sea basin of the baltic sea distinguished from the gulf of bothnia to the north the gulf of finland to the east and the belt sea to the east the baltic proper drainage basin includes the largest fraction of agricultural land of the overall bsdb as well the largest human population the nutrient load reductions for the baltic proper drainage basins are slightly higher than for the whole bsdb with the largest differences again seen for rural treatment measures combining all measures led to about 12 and 9 reductions for the baltic proper drainage basin and bsdb respectively fig 5 as we move from local through sea outlet to the bsdb scale we see an overall decrease in the magnitude of nutrient load reductions spatial aggregation reduces area fractions for the reduction categories at the extreme ends minimum and maximum reductions because upstream variation vanishes from the distribution there are two main reasons for the decrease in the reductions first the measures are not applied to all catchments at the same scope but rather the scope varies with anthropogenic activities agriculture and urbanisation as the loads move downstream contributions from catchments with and without the measures are accumulated the smaller the scope of the implemented measures the faster the overall load reductions decrease across scales second nutrients can be retained or reduced in surface water for example through sedimentation or denitrification hence measures that are implemented upstream of areas with significant retention or reduction will not have a significant effect on nutrient loads at the sea outlets in particular constructed remediation measures typically lack sufficient spatial allocation scoping to contribute significantly to nutrient load reductions at the large basin scale the implementation strategy considers local effects but does not necessarily target effects across large areas this is coherent with previous model based evaluation of the effects of constructed wetlands in southern sweden where negligible impacts were found on nutrient loads at sea outlets despite an extensive implementation effort arheimer and pers 2017 3 5 nutrient load reductions at the baltic sea scale under environmental change nutrient load reductions can change depending on the environmental conditions fig 5 this is especially true for aggregated loads due to co dependent effects of nutrients on algae production and transformation processes following higher order rate behaviour when comparing reference and 2050s nutrient loads to the baltic sea without any mitigation measures nitrogen loads show an overall decrease under 2050s conditions whereas phosphorus shows an overall increase climate change itself is projected to increase nutrient loads significantly as a result of increased discharge volumes bartosova et al 2019 however large reduction in nitrogen sources under ssp2 and especially the expected 30 decrease of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen counteracts the increase projected from the climate change alone while the ssp2 assumptions also include decrease in phosphorus load released into the bsdb it is not sufficient to counteract the larger projected increase in phosphorus load ockenden et al 2017 changes in phosphorus loads are more closely related to changes in precipitation due to their close association with surface runoff the spatial pattern of impacts associated with individual or combined measures projected for 2050s conditions did not change from the overall pattern under current conditions however we see mostly similar or lower load reductions under 2050s conditions compared to the reference conditions for both nutrients fig 5 modelled nitrogen reductions for the rural treatment scenario e g are 6 7 under reference conditions and 6 during the 2050s period with rcp8 5 and ssp2 the only notable exceptions are phosphorus load reductions for buffers and stormwater ponds the projected increased phosphorus load reductions for buffers from 1 8 to 2 6 reduction can be likely related due to the higher proportion of surface flows projected for the 2050s 3 6 confidence and uncertainty in modelled scenario impacts modelling the impact of scenarios always carries considerable uncertainty with sources of uncertainty originating in all steps of the modelling chain from climate forcing data through the impact model structure and calibration to scenario assumptions modelling the effects of remediation measures on riverine nutrient loads at large basin scales is particularly challenging in this regard because of the lack of detailed data on nutrient source releases and the unpredictability of local management choices both of which require strong assumptions and simplifications in conceptual model representation hydrological model approaches are on the other hand effective tools i to estimate over large areas and with adequate spatial resolution variables such as nutrient loads for which measurements are not readily available and ii to dynamically assess impacts of change in climate and other environmental conditions using a scenario approach for impact modelling in this study we used a minimal climate model ensemble with 2 members which allows us in a limited way to explore uncertainty in projected climate change impacts and relate it to overall modelled change magnitudes under measure scenarios modelled tn loads at the baltic sea scale under 2050s rcp8 5 and ssp2 assumptions showed an impact range of less than 1 between the two climate model members while tp loads showed a larger range around 6 between the two members illustrating larger climate projection uncertainty for tp mobilisation and transport processes cf fig 5 than for tn processes total water discharge to the baltic sea was projected to increase between 14 and 19 with the two models i e a strong change signal despite a wide range in projected magnitude bartosova et al 2019 used a four member ensemble designed to represent a range of projected changes in temperature and precipitation that included the two climate models chosen here for a similar impact analysis on bsdb wide nutrient loads one of the four members projected lower impacts particularly on tp loads compared to the impact range of our ensemble but none projected higher impacts they found however a strong impact of socio economic management scenario alternatives on nutrient loads which outweighed the climate ensemble impact spread this highlights the relative importance of considering the management scenario uncertainty in nutrient load projections for mid century projections in this region projection uncertainties in the measure scenarios themselves are arguably impossible to quantify but originate from a number of distinguishable sources measure efficiency itself varies with local conditions and can be hard to quantify exactly a priori phosphorus load reduction in buffer strips e g depends on biogeochemical processes in a several flow paths within the buffer zone with strong local variations hoffmann et al 2009 our results aim to show what load reductions can be expected over larger areas and furthermore to highlight the importance of source reductions for large scale effects using a theoretical elimination scenario for one of the relevant load sources in the bsdb nutrient reductions are also a function of hydrological conditions and thus variable in time e g johannesson et al 2015 we aimed to alleviate the effects of this uncertainty by showing changes in long term averages which cover a wide range of hydrological conditions nonetheless while models as e hype simulate time dynamic flow processes small scale dynamics at field scale are necessarily simplified in the model framework reducing the real world variation in the model results management related effects pose another uncertainty source in the scenarios for example agricultural production is governed by changing climate and economic conditions and adaptation of farmers to these conditions which translates into uncertainty in agricultural practices relevant to nutrient loads e g crop cover and fertiliser rates huttunen et al 2015 our integrated bsdb wide measure scenario impact modelling should thus be interpreted as benchmarks which provide an understanding of change directions and relative impact magnitudes although they have to be contextualised with the underlying model assumptions this holds particularly true for the rural source elimination scenario which assumes load reductions that are unrealistic real world targets but serves as a theoretical end point benchmark to illustrate impact ranges at the bsdb scale as a whole large scale dynamic model approaches necessarily simplify local catchment variations which have an influence on actual measure efficiency at the individual sites stormwater ponds e g were assumed here to be implemented whenever the urban area criterion in an e hype catchment was fulfilled the meaningfulness of an actual implementation in a specific place would of course depend on many more factors in the local settings as would its design properties such as e g the drainage area of the constructed ponds other important factors for actual implementation are cost effectivity and acceptance for instance fertilizer reductions and reductions in point source emissions have been shown to be important measures for reducing nitrogen loads across the bsdb in a cost effective way elofsson 2003 carolus et al 2020 reveal from a hydrological modelling study of 16 nutrient mitigation measures for three different european catchment areas the latvian berze the swedish helge and the german selke rivers a substantial local variability of the effectivity of measures due to different conditions such as land use soil or hydrological pathways pointing towards the need for regionally tailored programmes of measures to high effectivity the effectiveness of constructed wetlands to reduce nutrient loads has been shown to depend on source emission amounts upstream of implemented wetlands with cost efficiencies out competing buffer zones and catch crops in cases where large sources were filtered efficiently gachango et al 2015 such studies illustrate that overall the cost effectiveness always also depend on local conditions in addition to the effects of large scale scoping and within basin retention as highlighted by our large scale impact model results nontheless our results provide a set of what if benchmarks for large scale impacts of locally implemented measures and as such can provide useful boundary conditions for scenario impact analyses of the baltic sea ecosystem itself e g neumann and schernewski 2005 and guide effective policy development to support helcom load reduction goals established in the bsap in addition to the variation in efficiency of constructed measures large scale modelling approaches face the challenge of correctly estimating the current state of measure implementation data on rural wastewater emissions e g are not available in detail over large areas and thus have to be estimated using appropriate proxy data here we used published data sources on population numbers and treatment efficiencies as proxies to calculate rural wastewater emissions for the reference period 2001 2010 at the e hype catchment resolution updated data on treatment efficiencies eea 2017 indicate an improved treatment in some of the helcom member states during the period up to the most recent published data for 2015 for poland e g overall fraction of population with treated wastewater increased from 60 2 of the population in 2005 to 72 6 in 2015 and the fraction for tertiary treatment increased from 37 3 58 9 during the same period this suggests that a part of the load reductions we projected for the rural wastewater measure have already been achieved as of today 4 conclusions this study focussed on the integrated large scale effects of local nutrient load reduction measures modelled for the baltic sea region where current nutrient loads at sea outlets have a negative impact on marine ecosystems the key message from our scenario driven model analysis is that reduction of source releases and scoping of measures should be the first considerations for choosing effective measures at this scale our results illustrate a diminishing effect of local measures on nutrient load reductions as the evaluation point moves from local to the bsdb scale if i measures do not include substantial reductions of nutrient source releases or ii do not have a wide scope i e are not applied over large areas even though our scenario assumptions themselves were not driven by nutrient reduction goals for the baltic sea it is worth noting that the mean modelled reductions in nutrient loads the baltic sea under reference climate conditions and our combined measures scenario amount to 54 kilotons for total nitrogen and 2 2 kilotons for total phosphorus respectively this falls short of the estimated reduction needs of 118 kilotons for nitrogen and 15 kilotons for phosphorus to achieve good environmental status in the baltic sea as targeted in the baltic sea action plan helcom 2013 and highlights the need to specifically design programmes of measures which target large scale reduction goals alongside local i e stream reach to catchment scale goals these findings are not per se conflicting with significant load reductions in local catchments and other potential remediation goals such as increased biodiversity within the basin they do however indicate a need to consider specifically basin wide load reductions because adequate reductions might not be achieved merely as a by product of locally effective remediation measures this in turn may pose a challenge for policy makers and other decision makers involved in designing programs of measures which integrate local and large scale improvements in order to achieve substantial nutrient load reduction at the bsdb scale we need to reduce nutrient emissions sufficiently at their sources we also found these conclusions to apply under 2050s conditions combining climate change and socio economic changes which showed similar effects of measure scenarios as under reference conditions 2050s middle of the road conditions also indicate decreasing loads for nitrogen mainly as a result of reduced atmospheric deposition which compensated the increased loads projected from climate change alone 2050s phosphorus loads which did not include significant source changes indicate a net increase as a result of the projected climate and socioeconomic conditions

8217,study region this study focused on the mono river basin in west africa study focus the lack of extensive and functional measurement networks for flood monitoring introduces satellite based rainfall datasets as an alternative which needs however to be evaluated beforehand this study investigated the performance of four satellite and gauge based rainfall products climate hazards group

alarm ratio far at dekadal scale based on nse values of hydrologic modelling best results were achieved by persiann followed by gpcc and tamsat but chirps performed worst with negative values by filling the gaps of gauge data with the satellite based products we noticed that filling the missing does not necessarily improve the quality of the data and that may not be needed in the case of the mono basin if interpolation methods like kriging are applied keywords flood mono river basin satellite based rainfall products 1 introduction precipitation datasets are important in climate risks management jones and boer 2004 lack of information on precipitation can jeopardize people s livelihood and security that is particularly true in the context of global warming and climate change whereby high variability and substantial changes are observed in rainfall patterns along with natural disasters like storm flood drought and wildfires which are expected to increase in magnitude and intensity during the next decades ipcc 2014 however in developing countries like those in sub saharan africa precipitation datasets are characterized by non existing records or large gaps in time series githungo et al 2016 in the transboundary basin of mono river shared by the republics of benin and togo flood events are recurrent and trigger enormous damages undp 2011 2010 which are expected to worsen in the future amoussou et al 2020 koubodana et al 2020 lamboni et al 2019 lawin et al 2019a however majority of rain gauges about 20 distributed within the basin do not have complete time series of at least 30 years and previous studies use different methods to manage missing data pearson correlation with neighbouring station koubodana et al 2020 spatial interpolation with ordinary kriging amoussou et al 2020 2014 lawin et al 2019a remotely sensed rainfall products represent a good alternative in dealing with non existing or incomplete records some of the advantages of such data are their relatively fine spatial resolution and consistency of their time series remotely sensed data can be retrieved from infrared sensors microwave sensors or based on weather radars hong et al 2018 a number of studies have been carried out in sub saharan africa at various spatial and time scales in order to evaluate the performance of satellite based rainfall product le coz and van de giesen 2020 the increase of such studies supports scientific research and disaster management in areas characterized by sparsely gauged rainfall stations network dinku 2019 many studies demonstrated good performances of remotely sensed rainfall products in the fields of hydrology climatology agriculture ecosystem management and basically for natural hazards management asadullah et al 2008

precipitation datasets in six basins in west africa and concluded that cmorph crt persiann cdr tamsat chirps tmpa 3b42 rfe 2 0 gpcc and tmpa 3b42 rt provide satisfactory results whereas cmorph raw and cfsr performed poorly dembélé and zwart dembélé and zwart 2016 evaluated seven satellite based precipitation products arc 2 0 chirps persiann cdr rfe 2 0 tamsat trmm and tarcat over burkina faso at annual monthly decadal and daily scales these authors found out that all evaluated products except tarcat performed well at monthly and annual scale and showed poor results at daily scale larbi et al larbi et al 2018 evaluated the performance of chirps data at reproducing trend and extremes in the vea catchment in ghana and noticed the satellite based data has high seasonal agreement with station data ogbu et al ogbu et al 2020 analysed chirps persiann cdr and tamsat over nigeria and found that chirps is more in line with observations in all climatic zones while the performance of persiann and tamsat are season and location specific the results of these previous studies have shown the good performances of chirps persiann cdr and tamsat and gpcc at representing regional and local climate and their suitability for hydrological purposes in different regions in western africa moreover these products provide long time series datasets of at least 30 years to support long term analysis of the climate thus this study aims at assessing three satellite based chirps persiann cdr tamsat and one gauge based gpcc rainfall products in the mono river basin to support gaps handling in precipitation datasets and more specifically for flood management purposes therefore the ability of the selected products was assessed at daily dekadal seasonal and annual scales using continuous and categorical statistics 2 material and method 2 1 study area the mono river catchment is a transboundary catchment shared by two west african countries the republics of benin and togo fig 1 it covers an area of 23 592 56 km2 and is located between latitudes 6 36 n and 9 39 n and longitudes 0 62 e and 1 99 e this area is characterized by a subequatorial climate with a bimodal rainfall cycle two rainy seasons and two dry seasons in the southern part latitude inferior to 7 n and a tropical climate zone with unimodal rainfall season one rainy and one dry season in the central and northern parts of the basin latitude greater than 7 n amoussou 2010 lawin et al 2019b however between 7 n and 8 n rainfall regime is transitional the peak is recorded in july and is relatively maintained till september in a typical subequatorial area of the basin two peaks are recorded in june and october while the peak rainfall is reached in august in tropical areas average annual rainfall ranges from 1000 mm per year in the south to about 1200 mm per year in the north 2 2 data rainfall data from 28 rain gauges were collected inside and near the mono river catchment the catchment disposes of three 3 synoptic stations that provide complete rainfall time series and temperature over at least 30 years to allow a long term analysis these stations are located in tabligbo in the south atakpamé in the central part and sokodé in the northern part of the catchment further details about their location are provided in table 1 rainfall temperature and discharge data used in this study were collected from national meteorological services of togo meteo togo and benin direction de la meteorologie national the three synoptic stations presented in table 1 were used for the grid to point analysis due to the completeness of their time series four rainfall datasets were assessed in this study the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data version v2 0 chirps precipitation estimation

station data version 2 0 funk et al 2014 chirps is a gridded rainfall time series developed by the u s geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros centre and the climate hazard group of university of california santa barbara ucsb for seasonal drought monitoring it merges in situ observations and other data input sources such as the monthly precipitation climatology chpclim the quasi global geostationary thermal infrared satellite observations from the climate prediction center cpc and from national climatic data center ncdc the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 and the atmospheric model rainfall fields from the noaa climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record hereafter referred to as persiann uses gridded infrared data from the gridsat b1 satellite and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv hourly precipitation data as input data which are further adjusted with the version 2 2 of the monthly product of the global precipitation climatology project gpcp 2 2 ashouri et al 2015 gehne et al 2016 tamsat was developed for africa by the university of reading based on thermal infrared imagery from the meteosat satellite maidment et al 2014 tarnavsky et al 2014 it also uses gauge observations and has a fine resolution of 0 0375 approximately 4 km the global precipitation climatology centre full data daily version 2018 ziese et al 2018 hereafter gpcc is a gauge based gridded precipitation dataset developed by the deutscher wetterdienst with data provided by national meteorological and hydrological services global and regional data collections as well as the global telecommunication system gts of the world meteorological organisation wmo it is based on more than 35 000 station gauges per month and uses the spheremap scheme for interpolation schneider et al 2018 the gpcc dataset have a relatively coarse spatial resolution of 1 the characteristics of the satellite and gauge products used in this study are shown in table 2 the four products were selected based on previous studies dembélé and zwart 2016 ogbu et al 2020 poméon et al 2017 that demonstrated satisfactory results over west africa furthermore gpcc which is typically not a satellite product is also of interest in this study because of its common use as reference precipitation dataset and because of its good performance in other studies adeyewa and nakamura 2003 poméon et al 2017 ziese et al 2018 to harmonize the time span of the various datasets and based on the available gauge data the period 1983 2012 was considered as study period the products were downloaded and extracted at station grid point and evaluated against gauge rainfall time series rainfall estimate from a satellite product at a given station point is the value of rainfall in the grid in which that station falls 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 grid to point evaluation in the grid to point approach satellite products were evaluated against observed time series by assessing the mean annual rainfall the annual variability and daily variability using continuous and categorical statistics the mean annual rainfall is the monthly rainfall values averaged over the 30 years study period it gives an overview of the annual rainfall cycle in a given location the annual variability of the products was checked using the total annual rainfall the standardized precipitation index spi and trend analysis based on mann kendall test mann 1945 and sens slope estimator theil 1950 at 95 confidence interval the spi quantifies precipitation deficit at different time scales from 1 to 24 months precipitation amounts are cumulated for the selected time period and fitted to a normal distribution further details about spi are well documented by mckee et al mckee et al 1993 and by edwards and mckee edwards and mckee 1997 in this study the 12 months spi is computed to characterize hydrologically dry and wet years based on scale in table 3 wmo 2012 moreover four continuous statistics were used table 3 the pearson correlation coefficient the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the root mean square error rmse and the percentage of bias pbias they were applied to the mean annual rainfall total annual rainfall and daily rainfall time series the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to quantify the linear relationship between observed and rainfall estimates it varies from 1 to 1 a negative r corresponds to a negative relationship and a positive value denotes a positive correlation r i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where oi and si are respectively observed and simulated values at time i o and s are respectively the mean rain gauge and model values and n the sample size nse is used to assess how well the satellite based or gauge based products predict the observed station gauge time series it ranges from minus infinity to one with one indicating a perfect match between observed and estimated rainfall n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 rmse is a measure of how spread the predicted values are around the 1 1 line of best fit it varies between 0 and infinity r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 as for the pbias it indicates how the simulated values under or overestimate the observed ones p b i a s i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i a positive pbias indicates an overestimation while a negative value corresponds to underestimation with 0 being the optimal value to facilitate comparison with the observed time series the pearson correlation coefficient and rmse are presented on a taylor diagram alongside the standard deviation taylor diagram taylor 2001 is a graphical representation of r rmse and standard deviation basically designed for evaluating model performance against observation the x and y axes are standard deviation the observed is represented by an isoline of standard deviation and a dot on the x axis which corresponds to r 1 and rmse 0 models rmse are normalized divided by observed standard deviation and represented by isolines furthermore based on a contingency table two categorical metrics were also used to evaluate the rainfall detection ability of the selected products these are the probability of detection pod which represents the likelihood of satellite products to detect a rainfall event and the false alarm ratio far which describes the fraction of predicted rainfall event that did not actually happen sofiati and nurlatifah 2019 stanski et al 1989 as this assessment is being conducted for flood management purposes pod and far were computed at daily and dekadal 10 days scale to evaluate how effectively the satellite products can capture rainfall events in a short time period every month comprises three dekads day 1 to day 10 for the first dekad day 11 20 for the second dekad and day 21 to day 28 or 30 or 31 for the third dekad depending on the month and year moreover a generalized extreme value gev distribution was used to evaluate the performance of the remotely sensed rainfall products for representing extreme rainfall values and their return periods gev is a combination of three probability distribution types gumbel characterized by shape 0 frechet corresponding to shape 0 and weibull characterized by shape 0 jenkinson 1955 von mises 1936 it was applied to annual daily maxima of rainfall predicted by satellite products using the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle the return levels associated with return periods of 2 5 10 50 and 100 years were compared against those of observed time series 2 3 2 hydrologic modeling a hydrologic assessment was performed in addition to the grid to point evaluation using hbv light hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model seibert 2000 seibert and vis 2012 hbv light is a conceptual rainfall runoff model widely used for runoff modelling flood forecasting and climate change impact assessment cloke et al 2012 grillakis et al 2010 kebede et al 2014 koutsouris et al 2017 shiwakoti 2017 it has already been applied in various basins of benin with good results badou et al 2018 bormann and diekkrüger 2003 gado 2019 u charlene gaba 2015 the model is simple and requires only rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration as input data hbv comprises four components the snow routine the soil routine the response routine and the routing routine fig 2 only the last three components and their parameters described in table 4 were considered since snow routine is not meaningful for the study area in the soil routing actual water storage is used to compute groundwater recharge and actual evaporation while the response and routing routines use respectively three linear reservoir equations and a triangular weighting function to simulate runoff seibert and beven 2009 further details about the hbv model are provided by bergström 1992 seibert and beven 2009 seibert and vis 2012 the automatic genetic algorithm and powell gap optimisation tool seibert 2000 embedded in the model was used for calibration with the gap algorithm optimized parameters are generated and randomly recombined before being fine tuned using powell s quadratically convergent method seibert and vis 2012 calibration with hbv is basically manual and consists of varying parameter ranges with a try and error technique until a good model efficiency is achieved for the catchment thereafter that set of parameter can be applied to various input datasets e g for validation data quality control or scenario development since we are evaluating datasets performances in this study they should be compared on the same ground which implies that we must not run a dataset with the parameters derived from calibration performed with another dataset therefore to avoid a biased comparison the model was automatically calibrated for each satellite based product with 10 000 gap runs and using the default parameter ranges which were reported to be realistic especially for catchments in west africa poméon et al 2017 the model was calibrated on the period 1986 2000 and validated on 2002 2010 with a three years warm up period 1983 1985 since hbv light is a lumped model which needs areal precipitation as input daily average rainfall was computed using ordinary kriging method matheron 1963 for interpolation the kriging approach applied in this study consisted of computing a variogram with the corresponding characteristics nugget sill and range for each year separately the advantage of that approach is that it accounts for inter annual variability of the dataset as opposite to the common kriging application whereby a single variogram is used for the entire time series more details about the method are available in lawin 2007 lawin et al 2019b since the final goal of this study is to evaluate the capability of remotely sensed products to deal with missing in gauge data and because gauge data when they exist are preferable to remotely sensed ones we filled in the gaps of available rain gauges fig 1 with satellite based products and used the recomposed gauge satellite dataset as input for hydrologic modelling thus a total of 8 models were created 4 with satellite based products and 4 with gauge satellite combinations 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid to point evaluation this section presents the results of the various analyses performed with the grid to point assessment 3 1 1 annual cycle for the three selected rain gauges all the products fairly reproduced the annual rainfall cycle and its seasons fig 3 at tabligbo persiann presents higher rainfall values after the first peak and the second peak occurred one month earlier than the gauged as for tamsat it has the first peak occurring in may instead of june at atakpamé the peak is underestimated by tamsat and persiann and it occurs two months later with gpcc whereas chirps has one month delay of the peak as underlined by lawin et al lawin et al 2019b the annual cycle in the central part of mono basin where atakpamé gauge belongs is characterized by a transitory cycle which is not clearly bimodal neither strictly unimodal and none of the four products assessed in this study fairly represent that pattern along with the peak rainfall amount at sokodé the peak is underestimated by persiann and gpcc and for the latter the peak happens in september instead of august overall chirps reproduced best the annual cycles this is further supported by results shown in the taylor diagrams fig 4 as well as statistics of nse and pbias values in table 5 at tabligbo chirps has the highest nse value and the lowest bias it is followed by tamsat gpcc and persiann at atakpamé the best product after chirps is gpcc followed by tamsat and persiann which have almost same results in sokodé tamsat shows the second best nse results after chirps all the products show very high correlation with observed data r 0 9 for the three stations however persiann time series globally displayed the lowest nse highest bias and highest error except at sokodé where it has slightly outperformed gpcc 3 1 2 return period the return levels of daily maximum rainfall associated with 2 5 10 50 and 100 years return period are presented on fig 5 the return levels simulated by the products are overall underestimated compared to observed except for 50 and 100 years return period of gpcc at tabligbo tamsat predicted the lowest daily extreme values and highly underrated them therefore it cannot be commended for flood management purposes in order to reduce unforeseen risks the results of chirps and persiann also underestimated the return levels of extreme daily maximum precipitation and that made them not very suitable for flood monitoring activities the closest values to gauges data are noted with gpcc however the recurrence of the rarest events above 10 years return period must be regarded with caution because of the short length of the evaluation period 3 1 3 trend analysis of annual rainfall the z statistics and p value of mann kendall trend assessment and sen s slope values for gauge time series and the satellite based products are summarized in table 6 significant trends are indicated by bold p values the positive z statistics noted for observed time series at all three gauges indicates increasing trends which are however not significant at 95 confidence since p values are greater than 0 05 or alternatively z values are lower than 1 96 over the three stations tamsat time series exhibit significant increasing trends and the magnitude of increase as indicated by slope values are in average three time those of gauge data in the opposite the other products showed agreement with the observed trends except chirps at tabligbo where p value 0 05 at tabligbo persiann and gpcc stand out as the best products while at atakpamé persiann and chirps are the best two at sokodé chirps and persiann have the closest statistics to observed ones followed by gpcc that showed an insignificant increasing trend as gauge data but with lower slope 3 1 4 standardized precipitation index spi fig 6 presents the 12 months spi computed for observed time series and satellite products as well as their correlation coefficient at tabligbo fig 6a spi from all the four satellite products chirps persiann tamsat and gpcc have high correlation with the indexes from the observed time series gpcc has the highest correlation 0 81 followed by chirps 0 78 persiann 0 68 and tamsat 0 62 at atakpamé fig 6b chirps showed the best correlation and it is followed by tamsat gpcc and persiann respectively as for the station of sokodé in the northern part of the basin fig 6c gpcc has the lowest correlation r 0 35 and chirps the best correlation r 0 57 the satellite products showed average to low performance at detecting dry and wet years as well as the value of the spi at sokodé spi values from observed time series at tabligbo station indicate that years 1995 1996 1999 and 2010 were wet spi 1 all satellite products at tabligbo found 2010 wet as well in addition 1999 was detected by chirps persiann and gpcc however years 1995 and 1996 were found wet by none of the products the satellite time series predicted each two wet years over four except tamsat which detected only one at atakpamé spi from the station dataset indicates 1988 1999 2007 2008 and 2009 as wet years however no product detected 1988 and 2009 1999 was found by chirps persiann and tamsat 2007 was detected only by chirps and 2008 only by tamsat over the five actual wet years chirps and tamsat detected two each persiann one and gpcc none at sokodé out of the four wet years 1988 1991 2003 and 2005 from observed 2003 was equally detected by all the satellite products assessed in this study year 1991 was identified as wet by chirps and tamsat whereas 2003 and 2005 was detected by no product chirps and persiann correctly predicted two wet years over 4 while tamsat and gpcc found one each 3 1 5 performance at daily scale the statistics as presented in table 7 show poor performances at daily scale apart from gpcc at tabligbo which scored an nse of 0 59 all other products have their nse lower than 0 3 at tabligbo gpcc appears to be the closest to observed with the highest correlation coefficient 0 77 fig 7 and the smallest error at atakpamé and sokodé tamsat has the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency value and showed the best correlation coefficient 0 52 for the two gauges the significance of the correlations were tested at 95 confidence interval and they are all significant with p value 0 furthermore for all the three gauges gpcc has the closest standard deviation to observed and the lowest pbias statistics after chirps data which showed the poorest nse at daily scale a part from gpcc at tabligbo the outputs of all other products do not match observed ones based on the statistics and cannot be recommended for flood simulation at daily scale without further corrections such poor performances at daily scale were also found in burkina faso by dembélé and zwart 2016 3 1 6 performance at annual scale at tabligbo the statistics showed that chirps performs better than other products with the highest nse the lowest bias and r 0 77 it is followed by gpcc nse 0 49 and r 0 8 overall the pearson correlation between observation and the satellite products at tabligbo is good greater than 0 6 for the four products however tamsat and persiann displayed very low nse values table 8 at atakpamé once again chirps has the best statistics the highest nse 0 65 the highest correlation r 0 81 the lowest pbias 1 underestimation and the lowest rmse 148 gpcc comes second with nse 0 31 as for tamsat and persiann their nse values are very low 0 09 and 0 09 respectively the statistics at sokodé showed that none of the four products was able to fairly simulate rainfall pattern at that gauge table 8 fig 8 overall the range of error is relatively high at annual scale with rmse values above 100 mm year that is opposite to the findings of larbi et al 2018 and dembélé and zwart 2016 who reported good performance of satellite based products at annual scale respectively in ghana and burkina faso 3 1 7 rainfall detection performance the performance of satellite products to detect rainfall events was assessed at daily and dekadal 10 days scales tables 9 and 10 present the probability of detection pod and the false alarm ratio far of each product at daily and for the three gauge points the highest far were recorded by persiann and the lowest by chirps gpcc has the highest pod almost 1 which can be explained by the fact that gpcc uses gauge station as input in addition chirps presented the lowest pod values which make it less suitable for flood monitoring purposes at such a fine scale as daily all products performed very well at dekadal scale with 0 9 1 pod the detection of rainfall within a 10 days time span is almost 100 and the prediction false alarm ratios are low making the products more reliable for flood monitoring and predictions 3 2 spatial analysis and hydrologic modelling 3 2 1 spatial distribution mean annual rainfall from the four datasets range from 938 to 2008 mm the spatial distribution depicted by fig 9 shows similarities between gpcc and persiann with annual precipitation amount below 1500 m and the lowest amounts being recorded in the south near the outlet this is in line with previous studies amoussou 2010 koubodana et al 2020 which reported simular characteritics in the distribution of annual rainfall in the mono river basin and around 1000 mm year close to the outlet amoussou et al 2020 the north south gradient is explained by the orographic effect of high latitudes between 400 and 930 m in the north amoussou 2010 although chirps captures relatively well the distibution in the south it presents however higher values with up to 2000 mm year in the rest of the basin as for tamsat the distribution of rainfall is not properly captured and annual rainfall amounts seem to be overestimated all over the basin 3 2 2 hydrologic modelling the results of calibration and validation are depicted respectively by figs 10 and 11 based on nse values presented in table 11 the simulation with persiann showed the best agreement with observed discharge during both calibration and validation periods followed by gpcc and tamsat it was noticed that tamsat overestimated the peaks and that is in line with the overestimation earlier highlighted by the spatial map as for chirps it performed worst with negative nse values high base flow and very low peak flow this can be explained by the low pod reported for chirps at daily scale a low pod implies that a high number of rainfall events are not accounted for which in turn will lead to rainfall trends and amount not being well captured as for the high base flow noticed with chirps it may be related to the values of its false alarm ratio especially when the false rainfall events are simulated during the dry season overall these results confirm again that chirps is not an appropriate dataset for flood monitoring purposes in the mono river basin and also that a fine resolution data does not necessarily imply a higher performance furthermore by filling in the gaps of stations time series with satellite data we noticed that all the combinations of gauge satellite performed almost the same as if model efficiency does not depend on which product is used to fill in the gaps recalling the very poor performance of chirps in simulating the hydrograph and the good result from persiann in the first hand and having the combinations gauge chirps and gauge persiann performing almost identically on the other hand indicates that filling in the gaps does not guarantee improvement of the data quality and may not be necessary in the case of the mono basin when a strong interpolation method like kriging is used 4 conclusion precipitation data are essential for hydrological risks management especially for flood protection purposes in the context of global climate change the interest for satellite based rainfall datasets has grown over recent years because of their practicability in solving issues related to the lack of reliable consistent and long measured records however their performance can vary with location and seasons which makes it important to evaluate them at local scale in this study we assessed the performance of chirps persiann tamsat and gpcc using hydrologic modelling and grid to point analyses at three synoptic stations in the mono river basin the grid to point analyses conducted over the period 1983 2012 revealed that the four products performed well in reproducing the characteristics of annual cycles at tabligbo atakpamé and sokodé but the peaks at atakpamé were not well captured good results were also exhibited at dekadal scale for all the products across the three stations with low false alarm ratio and almost 100 rainfall detection probabilities overall the products performed poorly at daily and annual scales based on the grid to point evaluation it was noticed that the performance of the products vary with temporal scales based on nash sutcliff efficiency with the hydrologic modelling assessment the best performance was achieved by persiann followed by gpcc and tamsat chirps showed very poor results and is not appropriate for flood monitoring in the mono river basin furthermore despite the gaps in rain gauge data attempt to fill them may not be necessary in the case of the mono basin if an interpolation method like kriging is used further research works could address the correction of the satellite based rainfall products at local scale using gauge data or artificial neural network credit authorship contribution statement

8217,study region this study focused on the mono river basin in west africa study focus the lack of extensive and functional measurement networks for flood monitoring introduces satellite based

infrared precipitation with station data chirps precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann tropical applications of meteorology using satellite data and ground based observations tamsat the global precipitation climatology centre full daily data gpcc with grid to point and hydrologic modelling approaches at different time scales over the mono basin new hydrological insights for the region with the grid to point assessment results show poor performances at daily and annual scales while the seasonal cycles

alarm ratio far at dekadal scale based on nse values of hydrologic modelling best results were achieved by persiann followed by gpcc and tamsat but chirps performed worst with negative values by filling the gaps of gauge data with the satellite based products we noticed that filling the missing does not necessarily improve the quality of the data and that may not be needed in the case of the mono basin if interpolation methods like kriging are applied keywords flood mono river basin satellite based rainfall products 1 introduction precipitation datasets are important in climate risks management jones and boer 2004 lack of information on precipitation can jeopardize people s livelihood and security that is particularly true in the context of global warming and climate change whereby high variability and substantial changes are observed in rainfall patterns along with natural disasters like storm flood drought and wildfires which are expected to increase in magnitude and intensity during the next decades ipcc 2014 however in developing countries like those in sub saharan africa precipitation datasets are characterized by non existing records or large gaps in time series githungo et al 2016 in the transboundary basin of mono river shared by the republics of benin and togo flood events are recurrent and trigger enormous damages undp 2011 2010 which are expected to worsen in the future amoussou et al 2020 koubodana et al 2020 lamboni et al 2019 lawin et al 2019a however majority of rain gauges about 20 distributed within the basin do not have complete time series of at least 30 years and previous studies use different methods to manage missing data pearson correlation with neighbouring station koubodana et al 2020 spatial interpolation with ordinary kriging amoussou et al 2020 2014 lawin et al 2019a remotely sensed rainfall products represent a good alternative in dealing with non existing or incomplete records some of the advantages of such data are their relatively fine spatial resolution and consistency of their time series remotely sensed data can be retrieved from infrared sensors microwave sensors or based on weather radars hong et al 2018 a number of studies have been carried out in sub saharan africa at various spatial and time scales in order to evaluate the performance of satellite based rainfall product le coz and van de giesen 2020 the increase of such studies supports scientific research and disaster management in areas characterized by sparsely gauged rainfall stations network dinku 2019 many studies demonstrated good performances of remotely sensed rainfall products in the fields of hydrology climatology agriculture ecosystem management and basically for natural hazards management asadullah et al 2008 deblauwe et al 2016 dinku et al 2018 githungo et al 2016 poméon et al 2017 romilly and gebremichael 2011 sawunyama and hughes 2010 poméon et al poméon et al 2017 assessed ten satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets in six basins in west africa and concluded that cmorph crt persiann cdr tamsat chirps tmpa 3b42 rfe 2 0 gpcc and tmpa 3b42 rt provide satisfactory results whereas cmorph raw and cfsr performed poorly dembélé and zwart dembélé and zwart 2016 evaluated seven satellite based precipitation products arc 2 0 chirps persiann cdr rfe 2 0 tamsat trmm and tarcat over burkina faso at annual monthly decadal and daily scales these authors found out that all evaluated products except tarcat performed well at monthly and annual scale and showed poor results at daily scale larbi et al larbi et al 2018 evaluated the performance of chirps data at reproducing trend and extremes in the vea catchment in ghana and noticed the satellite based data has high seasonal agreement with station data ogbu et al ogbu et al 2020 analysed chirps persiann cdr and tamsat over nigeria and found that chirps is more in line with observations in all climatic zones while the performance of persiann and tamsat are season and location specific the results of these previous studies have shown the good performances of chirps persiann cdr and tamsat and gpcc at representing regional and local climate and their suitability for hydrological purposes in different regions in western africa moreover these products provide long time series datasets of at least 30 years to support long term analysis of the climate thus this study aims at assessing three satellite based chirps persiann cdr tamsat and one gauge based gpcc rainfall products in the mono river basin to support gaps handling in precipitation datasets and more specifically for flood management purposes therefore the ability of the selected products was assessed at daily dekadal seasonal and annual scales using continuous and categorical statistics 2 material and method 2 1 study area the mono river catchment is a transboundary catchment shared by two west african countries the republics of benin and togo fig 1 it covers an area of 23 592 56 km2 and is located between latitudes 6 36 n and 9 39 n and longitudes 0 62 e and 1 99 e this area is characterized by a subequatorial climate with a bimodal rainfall cycle two rainy seasons and two dry seasons in the southern part latitude inferior to 7 n and a tropical climate zone with unimodal rainfall season one rainy and one dry season in the central and northern parts of the basin latitude greater than 7 n amoussou 2010 lawin et al 2019b however between 7 n and 8 n rainfall regime is transitional the peak is recorded in july and is relatively maintained till september in a typical subequatorial area of the basin two peaks are recorded in june and october while the peak rainfall is reached in august in tropical areas average annual rainfall ranges from 1000 mm per year in the south to about 1200 mm per year in the north 2 2 data rainfall data from 28 rain gauges were collected inside and near the mono river catchment the catchment disposes of three 3 synoptic stations that provide complete rainfall time series and temperature over at least 30 years to allow a long term analysis these stations are located in tabligbo in the south atakpamé in the central part and sokodé in the northern part of the catchment further details about their location are provided in table 1 rainfall temperature and discharge data used in this study were collected from national meteorological services of togo meteo togo and benin direction de la meteorologie national the three synoptic stations presented in table 1 were used for the grid to point analysis due to the completeness of their time series four rainfall datasets were assessed in this study the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data version v2 0 chirps precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr tropical applications of meteorology using satellite data and ground based observations tamsat and the global precipitation climatology centre full daily data gpcc fddv1 the first three are satellite based whereas the latter is gauge based the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data version 2 0 funk et al 2014 chirps is a gridded rainfall time series developed by the u s geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros centre and the climate hazard group of university of california santa barbara ucsb for seasonal drought monitoring it merges in situ observations and other data input sources such as the monthly precipitation climatology chpclim the quasi global geostationary thermal infrared satellite observations from the climate prediction center cpc and from national climatic data center ncdc the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 and the atmospheric model rainfall fields from the noaa climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record hereafter referred to as persiann uses gridded infrared data from the gridsat b1 satellite and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv hourly precipitation data as input data which are further adjusted with the version 2 2 of the monthly product of the global precipitation climatology project gpcp 2 2 ashouri et al 2015 gehne et al 2016 tamsat was developed for africa by the university of reading based on thermal infrared imagery from the meteosat satellite maidment et al 2014 tarnavsky et al 2014 it also uses gauge observations and has a fine resolution of 0 0375 approximately 4 km the global precipitation climatology centre full data daily version 2018 ziese et al 2018 hereafter gpcc is a gauge based gridded precipitation dataset developed by the deutscher wetterdienst with data provided by national meteorological and hydrological services global and regional data collections as well as the global telecommunication system gts of the world meteorological organisation wmo it is based on more than 35 000 station gauges per month and uses the spheremap scheme for interpolation schneider et al 2018 the gpcc dataset have a relatively coarse spatial resolution of 1 the characteristics of the satellite and gauge products used in this study are shown in table 2 the four products were selected based on previous studies dembélé and zwart 2016 ogbu et al 2020 poméon et al 2017 that demonstrated satisfactory results over west africa furthermore gpcc which is typically not a satellite product is also of interest in this study because of its common use as reference precipitation dataset and because of its good performance in other studies adeyewa and nakamura 2003 poméon et al 2017 ziese et al 2018 to harmonize the time span of the various datasets and based on the available gauge data the period 1983 2012 was considered as study period the products were downloaded and extracted at station grid point and evaluated against gauge rainfall time series rainfall estimate from a satellite product at a given station point is the value of rainfall in the grid in which that station falls 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 grid to point evaluation in the grid to point approach satellite products were evaluated against observed time series by assessing the mean annual rainfall the annual variability and daily variability using continuous and categorical statistics the mean annual rainfall is the monthly rainfall values averaged over the 30 years study period it gives an overview of the annual rainfall cycle in a given location the annual variability of the products was checked using the total annual rainfall the standardized precipitation index spi and trend analysis based on mann kendall test mann 1945 and sens slope estimator theil 1950 at 95 confidence interval the spi quantifies precipitation deficit at different time scales from 1 to 24 months precipitation amounts are cumulated for the selected time period and fitted to a normal distribution further details about spi are well documented by mckee et al mckee et al 1993 and by edwards and mckee edwards and mckee 1997 in this study the 12 months spi is computed to characterize hydrologically dry and wet years based on scale in table 3 wmo 2012 moreover four continuous statistics were used table 3 the pearson correlation coefficient the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the root mean square error rmse and the percentage of bias pbias they were applied to the mean annual rainfall total annual rainfall and daily rainfall time series the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to quantify the linear relationship between observed and rainfall estimates it varies from 1 to 1 a negative r corresponds to a negative relationship and a positive value denotes a positive correlation r i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where oi and si are respectively observed and simulated values at time i o and s are respectively the mean rain gauge and model values and n the sample size nse is used to assess how well the satellite based or gauge based products predict the observed station gauge time series it ranges from minus infinity to one with one indicating a perfect match between observed and estimated rainfall n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 rmse is a measure of how spread the predicted values are around the 1 1 line of best fit it varies between 0 and infinity r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 as for the pbias it indicates how the simulated values under or overestimate the observed ones p b i a s i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i a positive pbias indicates an overestimation while a negative value corresponds to underestimation with 0 being the optimal value to facilitate comparison with the observed time series the pearson correlation coefficient and rmse are presented on a taylor diagram alongside the standard deviation taylor diagram taylor 2001 is a graphical representation of r rmse and standard deviation basically designed for evaluating model performance against observation the x and y axes are standard deviation the observed is represented by an isoline of standard deviation and a dot on the x axis which corresponds to r 1 and rmse 0 models rmse are normalized divided by observed standard deviation and represented by isolines furthermore based on a contingency table two categorical metrics were also used to evaluate the rainfall detection ability of the selected products these are the probability of detection pod which represents the likelihood of satellite products to detect a rainfall event and the false alarm ratio far which describes the fraction of predicted rainfall event that did not actually happen sofiati and nurlatifah 2019 stanski et al 1989 as this assessment is being conducted for flood management purposes pod and far were computed at daily and dekadal 10 days scale to evaluate how effectively the satellite products can capture rainfall events in a short time period every month comprises three dekads day 1 to day 10 for the first dekad day 11 20 for the second dekad and day 21 to day 28 or 30 or 31 for the third dekad depending on the month and year moreover a generalized extreme value gev distribution was used to evaluate the performance of the remotely sensed rainfall products for representing extreme rainfall values and their return periods gev is a combination of three probability distribution types gumbel characterized by shape 0 frechet corresponding to shape 0 and weibull characterized by shape 0 jenkinson 1955 von mises 1936 it was applied to annual daily maxima of rainfall predicted by satellite products using the generalized maximum likelihood estimation gmle the return levels associated with return periods of 2 5 10 50 and 100 years were compared against those of observed time series 2 3 2 hydrologic modeling a hydrologic assessment was performed in addition to the grid to point evaluation using hbv light hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model seibert 2000 seibert and vis 2012 hbv light is a conceptual rainfall runoff model widely used for runoff modelling flood forecasting and climate change impact assessment cloke et al 2012 grillakis et al 2010 kebede et al 2014 koutsouris et al 2017 shiwakoti 2017 it has already been applied in various basins of benin with good results badou et al 2018 bormann and diekkrüger 2003 gado 2019 u charlene gaba 2015 the model is simple and requires only rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration as input data hbv comprises four components the snow routine the soil routine the response routine and the routing routine fig 2 only the last three components and their parameters described in table 4 were considered since snow routine is not meaningful for the study area in the soil routing actual water storage is used to compute groundwater recharge and actual evaporation while the response and routing routines use respectively three linear reservoir equations and a triangular weighting function to simulate runoff seibert and beven 2009 further details about the hbv model are provided by bergström 1992 seibert and beven 2009 seibert and vis 2012 the automatic genetic algorithm and powell gap optimisation tool seibert 2000 embedded in the model was used for calibration with the gap algorithm optimized parameters are generated and randomly recombined before being fine tuned using powell s quadratically convergent method seibert and vis 2012 calibration with hbv is basically manual and consists of varying parameter ranges with a try and error technique until a good model efficiency is achieved for the catchment thereafter that set of parameter can be applied to various input datasets e g for validation data quality control or scenario development since we are evaluating datasets performances in this study they should be compared on the same ground which implies that we must not run a dataset with the parameters derived from calibration performed with another dataset therefore to avoid a biased comparison the model was automatically calibrated for each satellite based product with 10 000 gap runs and using the default parameter ranges which were reported to be realistic especially for catchments in west africa poméon et al 2017 the model was calibrated on the period 1986 2000 and validated on 2002 2010 with a three years warm up period 1983 1985 since hbv light is a lumped model which needs areal precipitation as input daily average rainfall was computed using ordinary kriging method matheron 1963 for interpolation the kriging approach applied in this study consisted of computing a variogram with the corresponding characteristics nugget sill and range for each year separately the advantage of that approach is that it accounts for inter annual variability of the dataset as opposite to the common kriging application whereby a single variogram is used for the entire time series more details about the method are available in lawin 2007 lawin et al 2019b since the final goal of this study is to evaluate the capability of remotely sensed products to deal with missing in gauge data and because gauge data when they exist are preferable to remotely sensed ones we filled in the gaps of available rain gauges fig 1 with satellite based products and used the recomposed gauge satellite dataset as input for hydrologic modelling thus a total of 8 models were created 4 with satellite based products and 4 with gauge satellite combinations 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid to point evaluation this section presents the results of the various analyses performed with the grid to point assessment 3 1 1 annual cycle for the three selected rain gauges all the products fairly reproduced the annual rainfall cycle and its seasons fig 3 at tabligbo persiann presents higher rainfall values after the first peak and the second peak occurred one month earlier than the gauged as for tamsat it has the first peak occurring in may instead of june at atakpamé the peak is underestimated by tamsat and persiann and it occurs two months later with gpcc whereas chirps has one month delay of the peak as underlined by lawin et al lawin et al 2019b the annual cycle in the central part of mono basin where atakpamé gauge belongs is characterized by a transitory cycle which is not clearly bimodal neither strictly unimodal and none of the four products assessed in this study fairly represent that pattern along with the peak rainfall amount at sokodé the peak is underestimated by persiann and gpcc and for the latter the peak happens in september instead of august overall chirps reproduced best the annual cycles this is further supported by results shown in the taylor diagrams fig 4 as well as statistics of nse and pbias values in table 5 at tabligbo chirps has the highest nse value and the lowest bias it is followed by tamsat gpcc and persiann at atakpamé the best product after chirps is gpcc followed by tamsat and persiann which have almost same results in sokodé tamsat shows the second best nse results after chirps all the products show very high correlation with observed data r 0 9 for the three stations however persiann time series globally displayed the lowest nse highest bias and highest error except at sokodé where it has slightly outperformed gpcc 3 1 2 return period the return levels of daily maximum rainfall associated with 2 5 10 50 and 100 years return period are presented on fig 5 the return levels simulated by the products are overall underestimated compared to observed except for 50 and 100 years return period of gpcc at tabligbo tamsat predicted the lowest daily extreme values and highly underrated them therefore it cannot be commended for flood management purposes in order to reduce unforeseen risks the results of chirps and persiann also underestimated the return levels of extreme daily maximum precipitation and that made them not very suitable for flood monitoring activities the closest values to gauges data are noted with gpcc however the recurrence of the rarest events above 10 years return period must be regarded with caution because of the short length of the evaluation period 3 1 3 trend analysis of annual rainfall the z statistics and p value of mann kendall trend assessment and sen s slope values for gauge time series and the satellite based products are summarized in table 6 significant trends are indicated by bold p values the positive z statistics noted for observed time series at all three gauges indicates increasing trends which are however not significant at 95 confidence since p values are greater than 0 05 or alternatively z values are lower than 1 96 over the three stations tamsat time series exhibit significant increasing trends and the magnitude of increase as indicated by slope values are in average three time those of gauge data in the opposite the other products showed agreement with the observed trends except chirps at tabligbo where p value 0 05 at tabligbo persiann and gpcc stand out as the best products while at atakpamé persiann and chirps are the best two at sokodé chirps and persiann have the closest statistics to observed ones followed by gpcc that showed an insignificant increasing trend as gauge data but with lower slope 3 1 4 standardized precipitation index spi fig 6 presents the 12 months spi computed for observed time series and satellite products as well as their correlation coefficient at tabligbo fig 6a spi from all the four satellite products chirps persiann tamsat and gpcc have high correlation with the indexes from the observed time series gpcc has the highest correlation 0 81 followed by chirps 0 78 persiann 0 68 and tamsat 0 62 at atakpamé fig 6b chirps showed the best correlation and it is followed by tamsat gpcc and persiann respectively as for the station of sokodé in the northern part of the basin fig 6c gpcc has the lowest correlation r 0 35 and chirps the best correlation r 0 57 the satellite products showed average to low performance at detecting dry and wet years as well as the value of the spi at sokodé spi values from observed time series at tabligbo station indicate that years 1995 1996 1999 and 2010 were wet spi 1 all satellite products at tabligbo found 2010 wet as well in addition 1999 was detected by chirps persiann and gpcc however years 1995 and 1996 were found wet by none of the products the satellite time series predicted each two wet years over four except tamsat which detected only one at atakpamé spi from the station dataset indicates 1988 1999 2007 2008 and 2009 as wet years however no product detected 1988 and 2009 1999 was found by chirps persiann and tamsat 2007 was detected only by chirps and 2008 only by tamsat over the five actual wet years chirps and tamsat detected two each persiann one and gpcc none at sokodé out of the four wet years 1988 1991 2003 and 2005 from observed 2003 was equally detected by all the satellite products assessed in this study year 1991 was identified as wet by chirps and tamsat whereas 2003 and 2005 was detected by no product chirps and persiann correctly predicted two wet years over 4 while tamsat and gpcc found one each 3 1 5 performance at daily scale the statistics as presented in table 7 show poor performances at daily scale apart from gpcc at tabligbo which scored an nse of 0 59 all other products have their nse lower than 0 3 at tabligbo gpcc appears to be the closest to observed with the highest correlation coefficient 0 77 fig 7 and the smallest error at atakpamé and sokodé tamsat has the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency value and showed the best correlation coefficient 0 52 for the two gauges the significance of the correlations were tested at 95 confidence interval and they are all significant with p value 0 furthermore for all the three gauges gpcc has the closest standard deviation to observed and the lowest pbias statistics after chirps data which showed the poorest nse at daily scale a part from gpcc at tabligbo the outputs of all other products do not match observed ones based on the statistics and cannot be recommended for flood simulation at daily scale without further corrections such poor performances at daily scale were also found in burkina faso by dembélé and zwart 2016 3 1 6 performance at annual scale at tabligbo the statistics showed that chirps performs better than other products with the highest nse the lowest bias and r 0 77 it is followed by gpcc nse 0 49 and r 0 8 overall the pearson correlation between observation and the satellite products at tabligbo is good greater than 0 6 for the four products however tamsat and persiann displayed very low nse values table 8 at atakpamé once again chirps has the best statistics the highest nse 0 65 the highest correlation r 0 81 the lowest pbias 1 underestimation and the lowest rmse 148 gpcc comes second with nse 0 31 as for tamsat and persiann their nse values are very low 0 09 and 0 09 respectively the statistics at sokodé showed that none of the four products was able to fairly simulate rainfall pattern at that gauge table 8 fig 8 overall the range of error is relatively high at annual scale with rmse values above 100 mm year that is opposite to the findings of larbi et al 2018 and dembélé and zwart 2016 who reported good performance of satellite based products at annual scale respectively in ghana and burkina faso 3 1 7 rainfall detection performance the performance of satellite products to detect rainfall events was assessed at daily and dekadal 10 days scales tables 9 and 10 present the probability of detection pod and the false alarm ratio far of each product at daily and for the three gauge points the highest far were recorded by persiann and the lowest by chirps gpcc has the highest pod almost 1 which can be explained by the fact that gpcc uses gauge station as input in addition chirps presented the lowest pod values which make it less suitable for flood monitoring purposes at such a fine scale as daily all products performed very well at dekadal scale with 0 9 1 pod the detection of rainfall within a 10 days time span is almost 100 and the prediction false alarm ratios are low making the products more reliable for flood monitoring and predictions 3 2 spatial analysis and hydrologic modelling 3 2 1 spatial distribution mean annual rainfall from the four datasets range from 938 to 2008 mm the spatial distribution depicted by fig 9 shows similarities between gpcc and persiann with annual precipitation amount below 1500 m and the lowest amounts being recorded in the south near the outlet this is in line with previous studies amoussou 2010 koubodana et al 2020 which reported simular characteritics in the distribution of annual rainfall in the mono river basin and around 1000 mm year close to the outlet amoussou et al 2020 the north south gradient is explained by the orographic effect of high latitudes between 400 and 930 m in the north amoussou 2010 although chirps captures relatively well the distibution in the south it presents however higher values with up to 2000 mm year in the rest of the basin as for tamsat the distribution of rainfall is not properly captured and annual rainfall amounts seem to be overestimated all over the basin 3 2 2 hydrologic modelling the results of calibration and validation are depicted respectively by figs 10 and 11 based on nse values presented in table 11 the simulation with persiann showed the best agreement with observed discharge during both calibration and validation periods followed by gpcc and tamsat it was noticed that tamsat overestimated the peaks and that is in line with the overestimation earlier highlighted by the spatial map as for chirps it performed worst with negative nse values high base flow and very low peak flow this can be explained by the low pod reported for chirps at daily scale a low pod implies that a high number of rainfall events are not accounted for which in turn will lead to rainfall trends and amount not being well captured as for the high base flow noticed with chirps it may be related to the values of its false alarm ratio especially when the false rainfall events are simulated during the dry season overall these results confirm again that chirps is not an appropriate dataset for flood monitoring purposes in the mono river basin and also that a fine resolution data does not necessarily imply a higher performance furthermore by filling in the gaps of stations time series with satellite data we noticed that all the combinations of gauge satellite performed almost the same as if model efficiency does not depend on which product is used to fill in the gaps recalling the very poor performance of chirps in simulating the hydrograph and the good result from persiann in the first hand and having the combinations gauge chirps and gauge persiann performing almost identically on the other hand indicates that filling in the gaps does not guarantee improvement of the data quality and may not be necessary in the case of the mono basin when a strong interpolation method like kriging is used 4 conclusion precipitation data are essential for hydrological risks management especially for flood protection purposes in the context of global climate change the interest for satellite based rainfall datasets has grown over recent years because of their practicability in solving issues related to the lack of reliable consistent and long measured records however their performance can vary with location and seasons which makes it important to evaluate them at local scale in this study we assessed the performance of chirps persiann tamsat and gpcc using hydrologic modelling and grid to point analyses at three synoptic stations in the mono river basin the grid to point analyses conducted over the period 1983 2012 revealed that the four products performed well in reproducing the characteristics of annual cycles at tabligbo atakpamé and sokodé but the peaks at atakpamé were not well captured good results were also exhibited at dekadal scale for all the products across the three stations with low false alarm ratio and almost 100 rainfall detection probabilities overall the products performed poorly at daily and annual scales based on the grid to point evaluation it was noticed that the performance of the products vary with temporal scales based on nash sutcliff efficiency with the hydrologic modelling assessment the best performance was achieved by persiann followed by gpcc and tamsat chirps showed very poor results and is not appropriate for flood monitoring in the mono river basin furthermore despite the gaps in rain gauge data attempt to fill them may not be necessary in the case of the mono basin if an interpolation method like kriging is used further research works could address the correction of the satellite based rainfall products at local scale using gauge data or artificial neural network credit authorship contribution statement

8218,study region this study was conducted in the typical agroforestry ecosystem named linpan settlements or simply linpan in the chengdu plain located in southwestern china study focus the aims of this study were 1 monitoring the seasonal variability in rainfall partitioning for tree plots in linpan comprised of seven evergreen and four deciduous tree species from april 2018 to april 2019 2 evaluating the effect of rainfall factors and linpan tree structure on throughfall tf stemflow sf and canopy interception i new hydrological insights for the region only a few studies have focused on the rainfall partitioning of trees in agroforestry ecosystems our results confirm that the mean tf sf and i values of linpan trees accounted for 57 4 14 3 and 28 3 of the total rainfall volume respectively evergreen trees showed a lower tf 56 51 than that of deciduous trees 59 16 but a slightly higher sf 14 28 and i 29 21 than those of deciduous trees 14 21 and 26 64 respectively the values of tf sf and i were very significantly associated with both gross precipitation gp and rainfall intensity however evergreen trees tf was only significantly associated with gp while evergreen trees sf was only correlated with rainfall intensity i values of evergreen trees and deciduous trees exhibited negative non linear correlations p 0 05 with rainfall intensity and gp respectively only sf and sf were significantly negatively correlated with tree structure dbh and tree height had opposite effects on sf both lai and tree height showed a negative relationship with sf of linpan trees these results have the potential to inform better regulation of runoff and maintaining a sustainable hydrological cycle of agroforestry ecosystem in the chengdu plain keywords linpan trees rainfall throughfall stemflow canopy interception 1 introduction linpan settlements henceforth linpan consist of farmers houses surrounded by many trees water and farmland and they form the elementary unit of the villages scattered throughout the chengdu plain fig 1 in 2014 there were more than 121 000 linpan spanning a total area of 54 185 37 ha in the chengdu plain and accommodating 77 1 of the total rural population chengdu institute of planning design 2014 owing to their high tree coverage ranging from 43 5 to 85 0 linpan are renowned for their beautiful and unique rural landscapes zong et al 2020 linpan include 310 plant species with 81 tree species liu et al 2019 trees of linpan provide numerous important ecosystem services for the rural areas of the chengdu plain such as moderation of the local microclimate liu et al 2019 carbon storage and sequestration liu et al 2018 the preservation of plant and animal diversity jiang et al 2016 and the improvement of air quality zhao et al 2019 thus linpan represent the typical agroforestry ecosystems of the rural areas of the chengdu plain in southwestern china trees specifically provide numerous important hydrological services for the environment jim and chen 2008 among them rainfall partitioning is a particularly important process because it directly influences infiltration erosion soil moisture distribution groundwater recharge and sub surface runoff keim and skaugset 2003 tsiko et al 2012 su et al 2016 more broadly rainfall partitioning indirectly impacts soil nutrient levels and the chemical deposition of insecticides and fungicides macinnis ng et al 2012 rainfall is generally partitioned into three key components 1 rainfall that reaches the ground by dripping from the canopy or falling directly through gaps in canopies i e throughfall 2 precipitation that channels down along trunks and stems i e stemflow and 3 rainfall that is retained on leaves and branches i e canopy interception from the three components during and after the rainfall event water evaporates from vegetation directly into the atmosphere i e interception losses brauman et al 2010 thus during each rainfall event each tree functions as a mini reservoir delaying runoff in both rural and urban zones xiao and mcpherson 2003 in recent decades the mechanism of rainfall partitioning has been explored across different types of natural and urban forests however rainfall partitioning is a complex process that is often difficult to precisely predict how precipitation is partitioned differs dramatically depending on numerous variables including tree structure e g leaf area index canopy density coverage leaf size and shape and branch angles jackson 2000 liu and chang 2018 yang et al 2019 and meteorological variables e g evaporation gross precipitation gp rainfall intensity rainfall duration drop size and wind inkiläinen et al 2013 van dijk et al 2015 huang et al 2017 zabret et al 2017 nytch et al 2019 it is difficult to quantify the individual variable affecting precipitation partitioning most studies have focused on just one variable sun et al 2013 ilek and kucza 2014 törnros and menzel 2014 or several related variables bahmani et al 2012 zabret et al 2018 and been conducted in forests tree stands urban forests and isolated trees véliz chávez et al 2014 many studies have noted the meteorological variables had a greater impact on rainfall partitioning than tree structure staelens et al 2008 for instance gp has been recognized as the most important meteorological variable affecting the whole process of rainfall partitioning followed by rainfall intensity chen et al 2013 marin et al 2000 gp was the driving force for stemflow occurrence levia et al 2015 when gp exceeded 1 8 mm a tropical rainforest in malaysia exhibited stemflow sinun et al 1992 when gp exceeded 3 0 mm stemflow was observed in the temperate broad leaved deciduous forest of china sun et al 2013 and when gp exceeded 5 18 mm larix forest in northern hebei of china exhibited stemflow zhang et al 2015 in addition the maximum 10 min rainfall intensity and the mean rainfall intensity were the dominant factors influenceing throughfall variability in a subtropical deciduous forest in eastern china during the leafed and leafless periods respectively zhang et al 2019 the spatial variability of throughfall during the small rainfalls was relatively large levia et al 2020 the maximum interception capacity was influenced by the shaking of branches and foliage caused by the wind during and after rain events horton 1919 calder and wright 1986 tree structure also has crucial impacts on rainfall partitioning a few studies have shown that the rainfall partitioning cannot be considered constant because the tree structure is not steady véliz chávez et al 2014 most of these studies have related rainfall partitioning to leaf area index lai values of canopies limousin et al 2008 bulcock and jewitt 2010 for example throughfall variability of a subtropical deciduous forest during the leafed period was slightly higher than that during the leafless period zhang et al 2019 however depending on other tree structure variables different trees with the same lai might have very different interception capacities and throughfall values canopy interception has been shown to be commensurate with decreased stem density and basal area shinohara et al 2015 the rainfall partitioning of shrubs was very sensitive to the changes in canopy coverage zhang et al 2018 levia et al 2015 and mckee and carlyle moses 2017 found that a bigger tree bole diameter a larger number of branches a greater wood surface area and fewer leaves were associated with greater stemflow crown depth and crown openness of tropical forest trees affected throughfall when the rainfall was less than 20 mm but crown length of tropic forest was the only significant predictor of throughfall when the rainfall exceeded 20 mm park and cameron 2008 however owing to the numerous measurable variables and forest types the relationship between tree structure and rainfall partitioning remains unclear since the dujiangyan irrigation project was built in 256 bce its five class canal system is an important support for linpan existence in the chengdu plain li and xu 2006 at the same time linpan vegetation through its water storage river runoff regulation and soil fixation effects has feed back effects on the water resource conservation of the irrigation system in the past 50 years the rainfall in chengdu plain has decreased by 32 mm every 10 years wang et al 2019 moreover seasonal precipitation here is severely uneven with more than 75 of the annual precipitation occurs from june to september each year wang et al 2019 thus the regulating effect of linpan vegetation on water resources of the chengdu plain is becoming more and more important although linpan constitute key agroforestry ecosystems in the chengdu plain and offer diverse ecological and social services no study has yet investigated the hydrological services provide by linpan trees hence a detailed assessment is needed to characterize and evaluate the interception loss of trees in these important ecosystems and to further explore the mechanisms of rainfall partitioning by linpan trees it was hypothesized that the three components of rainfall partitioning and their associated variables differ between evergreen and deciduous tree species this study had the following two main objectives 1 to examine the seasonal variability in rainfall partitioning for typical linpan plots comprised of seven evergreen tree species and four deciduous tree species 2 to elucidate the impact of rainfall factors e g gp and rainfall intensity and tree structure e g lai stand density diameter at breast height and tree height on rainfall partitioning of evergreen and deciduous trees in linpan 2 methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in sandaoyan town 30 52 14 n 103 54 49 e on the chengdu plain in sichuan province china 30 3 n 104 3 e fig 1a b which has more than 600 traditional linpan fig 2 a b about 79 2 of the rural population of sandaoyan town was then living in linpan a field survey of traditional linpan in sandaoyan town was conducted and the types and numbers of trees in each linpan were recorded thirty two tree species belonging to 30 genera and 23 botanical families were identified in these linpan eleven dominant tree species occurred most frequently table 1 thus from ten traditional linpan seventeen plots of pure stands fig 2c containing eleven tree species respectively and ranging in size from 16 4 m2 to 173 5 m2 were selected for data collection the chengdu plain is the region of china with the lowest direct solar radiation owing to its foggy and cloudy weather where the annual relative humidity is 83 0 li et al 2019 in this region precipitation abundance and intensity vary considerably on a seasonal basis the long term 1961 2017 mean annual precipitation depth here was 892 6 mm with more than 75 0 of total precipitation between june and september especially within the summer season 61 of total precipitation from june to august while the mean monthly rainfall from december to february was generally less than 50 0 mm xie and xie 2019 wu 2019 in addition the surrounding mountains low lying terrain temperature inversion and perennial rain of the chengdu plain predisposes the area to its typically foggy weather in autumn and winter wen and li 2019 the annual average temperature is 16 4 c and the average wind speed is 0 7 m s field studies of tree structure in the seventeen plots were conducted prior to the rainfall experiments within each plot all trees were counted and measured for each tree species there were more than 6 replications table 2 their diameter at breast height dbh tree height and crown width were recorded and corresponding means were calculated table 2 the lai of trees was measured with a plant canopy imager ci 110 cid bio science inc camas wa usa during four seasons the adjustable camera lens of the imager ci 110 captures wide angle canopy images and focuses for varying canopy heights down to 30 cm 150 viewing angle with a live updating high resolution fish eye digital image enabling an on site evaluation of solar beam transmission coefficients or gap fractions for lai analysis about 63 6 of dominant tree species were evergreen species while 36 4 were deciduous only one species metasequoia glyptostroboides was coniferous and it was also the tallest tree with an average height of 24 4 m the maximum average crown width of 7 0 m was observed for camptotheca acuminata 2 2 measurement of rainfall throughfall and stemflow rainfall partitioning data were collected from april 2018 to april 2019 to continuously monitor gp values a tipping bucket rain gauge onset rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa with an automatic data logger onset hobo event onset computer corp was installed horizontally at 10 m above horizontal ground beside the 17 plots unobstructed by other instruments the tipping bucket rain gauges had a resolution of 0 2 mm with a 15 2 cm diameter opening and a measuring range of up to 12 7 cm of rainfall per hour it can store 16 000 sets of data six throughfall collectors within every 10 m2 were evenly distributed across the plot areas fig 3 throughfall collectors consisted of a polyethylene funnel with a container under each funnel collectors had two different diameters 20 0 cm and 12 0 cm but the same height 21 5 cm the former was used in summer and the latter was used in other seasons for individual tree for each rainfall event throughfall depth tf mm was calculated following zhang et al 2016 1 t f i 1 n v t f i n f a here vtf is the throughfall volume l for each collector n is the number of throughfall collectors under each tree canopy and fa is the opening area m2 of the funnel used in the experiments three dbh classes of each tree species were classified as follows small trees class 1 0 15 1 cm medium trees class 2 15 2 30 4 cm and big trees class 3 30 5 cm according to the dbh classes two to four trees from each category were selected for estimating stemflow in each plot stemflow was captured using a halved rubber hose spirally wrapped around the tree trunk fig 3 each hose was routed to a 1 5 l

stemflow volume l of the i th dbh class mi is the number of trees in the i th dbh class and n is the number of dbh classes to avoid interference tf and sf must be measured as soon as possible after rainfall had stopped canopy interception depth i mm is generally expressed as gross precipitation depth not reaching the ground guevara escobar et al 2007 and is defined as follows 3 i p t f s f 2 3 statistical analysis firstly the contribution of tf sf and i to rainfall partitioning of linpan trees were calculated then spearman correlation analysis was undertaken to examine the relationships among the rainfall factors tree structure and rainfall partitioning of linpan trees in order to clarify the effects of rainfall factors and tree structure on rainfall partitioning linear and non linear regression models were used to estimate these relationships all statistical analyses were performed using spss 11 0 spss inc chicago il usa the results are expressed with 95 confidence intervals origin 8 0 originlab corp northampton ma usa was used to a render graphs and fit functions to the data 3 results 3 1 gp and lai of the tree plots during the study period the total annual rainfall was 880 3 mm in sandaoyan town about 60 3 of total gp between june and august based on records from the national observatory meteorological station thirteen rainfall events were sampled by our team three events in spring four events in summer three events in autumn and three events in winter fig 4 gp depth was 116 2 mm accounting for 13 2 of the annual rainfall including 17 8 mm in spring 69 4 mm in summer 8 6 mm in autumn and 10 4 mm in winter eight rainfall events within 24 h periods did not exceed 10 mm and the proportion of small rainfall events 61 5 was seemed to be high only one event exceeded 25 0 mm rainfall duration was also variable ranging between 2 9 h and 28 1 h with event scale intensities ranging from 0 1 3 6 mm h 1 according to the grading of rainfall intensity in the federal meteorological handbook no 1 ofcm 2005 eleven of the events were of low intensity and two were of moderate intensity table 3 summarizes the mean lai of each tree plot about 89 3 of lai values for evergreen tree plots exceeded 1 0 moreover the annual mean lai value of evergreen tree plots was higher 1 2 than that of deciduous tree plots 1 1 however in summer and autumn seasonal lai values of deciduous tree plots were obviously higher than those of evergreen tree plots one particular cinnamomum japonicum plot had the highest lai 1 4 both the largest 1 8 and the smallest 0 4 seasonal lai values were observed in camptotheca acuminata plots in summer and winter respectively citrus maxima plot showed the most stable lai values across seasons 3 2 throughfall the mean event tf ranged from 3 5 mm to 7 4 mm the tf percentage tf is the ratio of tf to gp which varied between 36 3 osmanthus fragrans plot and 74 2 c acuminata plot during the study period the mean tf of the 17 plots was 57 5 fig 5 a reveals that mean tf values increased with gp the highest seasonal tf was observed in summer while the highest tf occurred in winter fig 5b nevertheless the seasonal differences in tf were not statistically significant fig 5b table 4 shows that mean tf and tf varied among tree species the lowest tf and tf appeared in the o fragrans plot on the contrary c acuminata exhibited the highest tf and tf evergreen trees showed a lower mean tf 56 5 than that of deciduous trees 59 2 in summer autumn and winter both the seasonal mean tf and tf values of evergreen trees were lower than those of deciduous trees fig 6 furthermore 10 7 of tf collectors indicated tf values exceeding gp table 5 with corresponding percentages of 9 9 in spring 9 9 in summer 12 4 in autumn and 10 3 in winter detailed analysis showed the percentage of tf values over gp varied among tree species and this percentage was slightly higher for deciduous trees 11 0 than evergreen trees 10 4 tf values of neosinocalamus affinis most frequently 23 3 exceeded gp followed by c acuminata 18 9 the percentage of collectors that exceeded gp showed no relationship with gp or rainfall intensity however there were significant linear relationships of this percentage with lai for evergreen trees in winter 0 8 p 0 05 and for deciduous trees in spring 0 9 p 0 05 data not shown 3 3 stemflow table 4 shows that the mean event sf of tree plots ranged from 0 3 mm to 2 4 mm and the mean sf percentage sf was 14 3 moreover significant differences p 0 05 were observed in mean sf and sf among tree plots fig 5c shows that when gp was less than 6 mm sf remained at a low and stable proportion of gp no more than 10 however when gp exceeded 6 8 mm an obvious increasing in sf was observed seasonal differences in sf among plots were statistically significant p 0 05 fig 5b the lowest sf and sf values consistently occurred in winter in contrast the highest mean sf and sf were observed in summer and autumn respectively the mean sf of evergreen tree plots was slightly higher than that of deciduous tree plots in spring summer and autumn while the opposite pattern was observed in winter fig 6 four tree species including lindera megaphylla phoebe zhennan c camphora and c acuminata did not generate sf until gp exceeded 1 8 mm in addition sf of n affinis plots fluctuated least over the four seasons data no shown 3 4 canopy interception table 4 shows that the i percentage i of tree plots ranged from 16 5 c maxima to 49 1 c japonicum with a mean i of 28 27 both i and i exhibited unclear variation as gp increased fig 5d the curve of i values first peaked when gp reached 6 0 mm as shown in fig 5b the mean i differed among seasons however despite i being higher in winter and spring than that in other seasons the seasonal differences were not statistically significant the mean i was slightly higher for evergreen trees 29 2 than that for deciduous trees 26 6 table 4 detailed analysis fig 6 showed both i and i for deciduous trees were higher than those for evergreen trees in spring and autumn while the opposite pattern occurred in summer and winter deciduous trees showed the lowest i in winter additionally the i and i of m glyptostroboides plot were significantly higher p 0 05 than those of other deciduous trees this could be owing to its fascicled needle arrangement enabling water retention between needle bases 3 5 rainfall partitioning in relation to the characteristics of rainfall and tree structure spearman correlation analysis revealed that gp has the most potential impact on rainfall partitioning the tf sf and i values except for i values of evergreen trees were very significantly associated with gp table 6 moreover these values were also obviously correlated with rainfall intensity these relationships between tf sf and gp were presented using one dimensional linear regression equations fig 7 a b ours findings also confirmed that gp and rainfall intensity could partially affect tf sf and i evergreen trees tf was only significantly associated with gp while evergreen trees sf was only correlated with rainfall intensity although the corresponding r squared values were relatively low r2 0 3 i values of evergreen trees and deciduous trees showed negative non linear correlations p 0 05 with rainfall intensity and gp respectively fig 7c d in addition sf and sf were also related with tree structure sf values increased significantly with dbh fig 7e but decreased with tree height sf values of evergreen and deciduous trees were both significantly negatively correlated with lai and tree height fig 7f canopy width did not affect rainfall partitioning the linear regression analysis verified that there was no collinearity between dbh and tree height however collinearity existed between lai and tree height in addition no collinearity was found between gp and rainfall intensity though they were significantly related to values of sf tf and i 4 discussion 4 1 throughfall stemflow and canopy interception tf sf and i values relative to incident gp are highly variable among and within both tree species as well as ecoregions levia and frost 2003 in this study the mean event tf reached 58 2 of total precipitation while the mean sf and i were 14 3 and 28 3 respectively tf tends to induce matrix flow and plays an important role in transferring the input of chemical solutes from aboveground vegetative surfaces to the soil liang et al 2009 tf in evergreen broadleaved forests can range from 25 to 39 and from 70 to 90 in tropical and temperate forests respectively from 50 to 80 in subtropical woodlands and from 75 to 84 in savannas cowling and mills 2011 compared with these previous reports it was found that tf in this study from 36 3 74 2 varied substantially furthermore tf in this study was also characterized by high spatial variability about 10 57 of total collectors measurements of tfexceeded the respective gp although it is not an unusual phenomenon for some measured values of individual tf gauges to exceed the measured gp carlyle moses et al 2004 published study has not yet elucidated the spatial and temporal variability of tf beneath forests levia et al 2015 the high variability of tf in our study could be attributed to the mean rainfall event total 8 9 mm not exceeding 10 mm in this study and meaning that most of the recorded rainfall events were likely not large enough to saturate the canopy as indicated by brauman et al 2010 dripping water from a saturated canopy is both more predictable and comprises a more spatially uniform fraction of rainfall than tf under an unsaturated canopy moreover considering that variability occurred more frequently in autumn and winter it was speculated that tree canopy could intercept fog increasing water input below the canopy as indicated by bruijnzeel and hamilton 2000 fog interception can increase tf to 115 130 of gp the foggy days in autumn and winter november to february accounts for 60 of the foggy days in the whole year in the chengdu plain china meteorological administration additionally in this study evergreen trees had a lower tf compared to deciduous trees even in the growing period summer when deciduous trees are in full leaf this was in accordance with the results of barbier et al 2009 nevertheless the lowest tf of deciduous trees appearing in summer cannot be overlooked suggesting that the canopies of deciduous trees in linpan may grow fastest in summer sf is an important hydrological component because it represents a localized point source of water and ion fluxes down the tree trunk dunkerley 2014 although a few reports found that sf makes up 30 of gp sf comprised small proportion of the net precipitation generally less than 5 of gp shi et al 2010 levia et al 2011 carlyle moses et al 2014 moreover sf usually showed much wider variability than both tf and i levia et al 2011 in this study the mean event sf exceeded 14 as previously noted by holder 2004 and gabriel and jauze 2008 fog can also strongly influence sf inputs in tropical montane cloud forest of guatemala linpan trees could therefore receive a substantial amount of water input via direct deposition from fog droplets in addition sf was greater during the leafed period spring summer and autumn compared to the leafless period winter similarly staelens et al 2008 reported that the leafed sf was greater than the non leafed sf however because of the absence of foliage interception a few previous studies have indicated that the sf of deciduous tree species was greater under their leafless state relative to their leafed state herbst et al 2008 siegert and levia 2014 the difference may be owing to variation in their winter climate in the chengdu plain the gross winter rainfall accounts for less than 5 of the total annual precipitation with two to three times as much evapotranspiration of rainwater occurring in winter wu 2019 the dry woody surfaces of trees are another possible factors explaining the lowest sf values occurring in winter this may also explain why the sf of evergreen trees was lower than that of deciduous trees in winter as the dry evergreen canopy almost completely intercepted the scarce winter rainfall occurring in the chengdu plain generally average i ranges from 10 to 40 among different types of natural forests including those in tropical dry 25 arid semi arid 29 temperate 26 and cold temperate areas 20 30 toba and ohta 2005 tsiko et al 2012 návar 2017 zabret et al 2018 a similar range of average i values was observed in the present study moreover although linpan are considered agroforestry systems their i values differed from those of managed forest plots where rainfall interception was lower 10 dietz et al 2006 this pattern could be owing the growth patterns of trees in traditional linpan closely resembling those of unmanaged natural forests though the 11 linpan trees had differing characteristics and i values they also exhibited very similar trends in i under the same gp i was generally greater in summer autumn than in winter spring a similarly finding has also been reported for natural forests in germany mexico and the usa krämer and hölscher 2009 carlyle moses and gash 2011 coble and hart 2013 the seasonal i values were quite similar year round but winter exhibited the highest average i despite deciduous trees having shed their leaves by winter several studies have reported higher i values in winter than in other seasons herbst et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 it can be speculated that lower rainfall intensity and gp counterbalances the reduced storage capacity of deciduous canopies in winter in addition our results confirmed that the annual mean i was higher for evergreen trees than for deciduous trees the same phenomenon was reported by liu and wen 2003 and carlyle moses 2004 for 20 deciduous forests and coniferous forests in different bioregions of china and mexico 4 2 the relationship between rainfall partitioning rainfall factors and tree structure several studies have indicated that tf sf and i were positively and linearly related to gp carlyle moses 2004 levia et al 2011 levia and germer 2015 in our study a similar linear relationship between gp and both tf and sf was observed while the expected correlation between i and gp was better represented by a logarithmic function gp was also positively associated with tf however i decreased as rainfall amount increased this pattern was similar with those from an earlier study on i in boreal and temperate forests toba and ohta 2005 conflicting relationships between rainfall intensity and rainfall partitioning have been reported many studies have shown rainfall intensity usually has an unclear relationship with i tf and sf however our study found that rainfall intensity was significantly associated with tf sf and i as well as significantly correlated with i and sf for evergreen trees among these variables sf and its percentage were most positively affected by rainfall intensity this finding can be explained by rain drops being unstably stored in canopies when tree crowns are agitated by intense rainfall which could lead to a high proportion of intercepted rainwater splashing thereby increasing sf in addition the relationships between rainfall intensity and rainfall partitioning percentages can be represented by nonlinear functions previous studies have also pointed out that sf and i can exhibit nonlinear relations e g following power and logarithmic functions with rainfall intensity iida et al 2005 in this study several different relationships were determined to describe the dynamics of tree hydrological components based on tree structure measurements based on spearman s correlation coefficients both sf and sf were significantly related to various plot characteristics e g lai dbh and height because the crown overlap within dense stands may produce significant interference that contributes to sf and tf generation stand density is usually considered one of the key factors influencing rainfall partitioning levia et al 2011 however in our study stand density did not affect each component of rainfall partitioning in agreement with our findings llorens and gallart 2000 also concluded there was no relationship between stand density and rainfall redistribution instead the lai dbh and height values of tree plots were confirmed to be associated with sf drainage to a large extent in linpan ecosystems which also underscores the complexity of how tree structure affects sf and the difficulty of isolating individual factors even within species few studies have focused on the relationship between lai and sf our study observed a linear decrease in sf with increased lai this phenomenon agreed well with previous findings that the lower lai of beech saplings in a european forest increased sf levia et al 2015 tanaka et al 2017 also noted that the effect of lai on sf is not straightforward this discrepancy can be caused by high variation in plant morphology and architecture even under the same lai although some investigators have noted that the i value of forest canopies is frequently associated with lai levia et al 2011 no such relationship was observed among our study plots generally dbh and tree height are the measurements of tree structure that most accurately predict sf oyarzún et al 2011 hofhansl et al 2012 swaffer et al 2014 our study indicated that dbh largely acted as the most important variable of tree structure positively and significantly influenced sf thus big trees yielded more sf than did small trees in japan larger trees with greater dbh were also found to produce more sf than smaller trees park and hattori 2002 moreover the relationship between sf and dbh of a secondary forest in japan could be represented by exponential equations deguchi et al 2006 in this study sf and sf values of linpan trees also significantly decreased with tree height the result was consistent with the findings of dezhban et al 2020 who found that higher sf yields in the hyrcanian forest of iran were negatively associated with tree height thus the present results suggested that taller trees with a greater surface area likely had greater water storage capacity additionally in previous studies dbh showed a power relationship with tree height zheng et al 2018 in our study dbh was significantly related p 0 05 to both tree height and crown width 5 conclusion this research provides the first empirical confirmation that linpan trees play an important role in rainfall partitioning in the chengdu plain the three components of rainfall partitioning and the effects of linpan tree structure on rainfall partitioning were assessed notably there was wild variations in tf and very high sf values observed among tree plots rainfall factors especially gp were helpful in predicting canopy hydrological components but prediction varied among tree species and seasons regression analysis revealed the strong relationships of lai dbh and tree height with sf and sf for both evergreen and deciduous trees future research should examine the impact of other tree structure e g branches boles and bark texture and meteorological variables e g wind speed and fog on rainfall partitioning such work is expected to deepen the current understanding of linpan responses to rainfall partitioning and contribute to better regulating runoff and maintaining sustainable hydrological cycles in the

8218,study region this study was conducted in the typical agroforestry ecosystem named linpan settlements or simply linpan in the chengdu plain located in southwestern china study focus the aims of this study were 1 monitoring the seasonal variability in rainfall partitioning for tree plots in linpan comprised of seven evergreen and four deciduous tree species from april 2018 to april 2019 2 evaluating the effect of rainfall factors and linpan tree structure on throughfall tf stemflow sf and canopy interception i new hydrological insights for the region only a few studies have focused on the rainfall partitioning of trees in agroforestry ecosystems our results confirm that the mean tf sf and i values of linpan trees accounted for 57 4 14 3 and 28 3 of the total rainfall volume respectively evergreen trees showed a lower tf 56 51 than that of deciduous trees 59 16 but a slightly higher sf 14 28 and i 29 21 than those of deciduous trees 14 21 and 26 64 respectively the values of tf sf and i were very significantly associated with both gross precipitation gp and rainfall intensity however evergreen trees tf was only significantly associated with gp while evergreen trees sf was only correlated with rainfall intensity i values of evergreen trees and deciduous trees exhibited negative non linear correlations p 0 05 with rainfall intensity and gp respectively only sf and sf were significantly negatively correlated with tree structure dbh and tree height had opposite effects on sf both lai and tree height showed a negative relationship with sf of linpan trees these results have the potential to inform better regulation of runoff and maintaining a sustainable hydrological cycle of agroforestry ecosystem in the chengdu plain keywords linpan trees rainfall throughfall stemflow canopy interception 1 introduction linpan settlements henceforth linpan consist of farmers houses surrounded by many trees water and farmland and they form the elementary unit of the villages scattered throughout the chengdu plain fig 1 in 2014 there were more than 121 000 linpan spanning a total area of 54 185 37 ha in the chengdu plain and accommodating 77 1 of the total rural population chengdu institute of planning design 2014 owing to their high tree coverage ranging from 43 5 to 85 0 linpan are renowned for their beautiful and unique rural landscapes zong et al 2020 linpan include 310 plant species with 81 tree species liu et al 2019 trees of linpan provide numerous important ecosystem services for the rural areas of the chengdu plain such as moderation of the local microclimate liu et al 2019 carbon storage and sequestration liu et al 2018 the preservation of plant and animal diversity jiang et al 2016 and the improvement of air quality zhao et al 2019 thus linpan represent the typical agroforestry ecosystems of the rural areas of the chengdu plain in southwestern china trees specifically provide numerous important hydrological services for the environment jim and chen 2008 among them rainfall partitioning is a particularly important process because it directly influences infiltration erosion soil moisture distribution groundwater recharge and sub surface runoff keim and skaugset 2003 tsiko et al 2012 su et al 2016 more broadly rainfall partitioning indirectly impacts soil nutrient levels and the chemical deposition of insecticides and fungicides macinnis ng et al 2012 rainfall is generally partitioned into three key components 1 rainfall that reaches the ground by dripping from the canopy or falling directly through gaps in canopies i e throughfall 2 precipitation that channels down along trunks and stems i e stemflow and 3 rainfall that is retained on leaves and branches i e canopy interception from the three components during and after the rainfall event water evaporates from vegetation directly into the atmosphere i e interception losses brauman et al 2010 thus during each rainfall event each tree functions as a mini reservoir delaying runoff in both rural and urban zones xiao and mcpherson 2003 in recent decades the mechanism of rainfall partitioning has been explored across different types of natural and urban forests however rainfall partitioning is a complex process that is often difficult to precisely predict how precipitation is partitioned differs dramatically depending on numerous variables including tree structure e g leaf area index canopy density coverage leaf size and shape and branch angles jackson 2000 liu and chang 2018 yang et al 2019 and meteorological variables e g evaporation gross precipitation gp rainfall intensity rainfall duration drop size and wind inkiläinen et al 2013 van dijk et al 2015 huang et al 2017 zabret et al 2017 nytch et al 2019 it is difficult to quantify the individual variable affecting precipitation partitioning most studies have focused on just one variable sun et al 2013 ilek and kucza 2014 törnros and menzel 2014 or several related variables bahmani et al 2012 zabret et al 2018 and been conducted in forests tree stands urban forests and isolated trees véliz chávez et al 2014 many studies have noted the meteorological variables had a greater impact on rainfall partitioning than tree structure staelens et al 2008 for instance gp has been recognized as the most important meteorological variable affecting the whole process of rainfall partitioning followed by rainfall intensity chen et al 2013 marin et al 2000 gp was the driving force for stemflow occurrence levia et al 2015 when gp exceeded 1 8 mm a tropical rainforest in malaysia exhibited stemflow sinun et al 1992 when gp exceeded 3 0 mm stemflow was observed in the temperate broad leaved deciduous forest of china sun et al 2013 and when gp exceeded 5 18 mm larix forest in northern hebei of china exhibited stemflow zhang et al 2015 in addition the maximum 10 min rainfall intensity and the mean rainfall intensity were the dominant factors influenceing throughfall variability in a subtropical deciduous forest in eastern china during the leafed and leafless periods respectively zhang et al 2019 the spatial variability of throughfall during the small rainfalls was relatively large levia et al 2020 the maximum interception capacity was influenced by the shaking of branches and foliage caused by the wind during and after rain events horton 1919 calder and wright 1986 tree structure also has crucial impacts on rainfall partitioning a few studies have shown that the rainfall partitioning cannot be considered constant because the tree structure is not steady véliz chávez et al 2014 most of these studies have related rainfall partitioning to leaf area index lai values of canopies limousin et al 2008 bulcock and jewitt 2010 for example throughfall variability of a subtropical deciduous forest during the leafed period was slightly higher than that during the leafless period zhang et al 2019 however depending on other tree structure variables different trees with the same lai might have very different interception capacities and throughfall values canopy interception has been shown to be commensurate with decreased stem density and basal area shinohara et al 2015 the rainfall partitioning of shrubs was very sensitive to the changes in canopy coverage zhang et al 2018 levia et al 2015 and mckee and carlyle moses 2017 found that a bigger tree bole diameter a larger number of branches a greater wood surface area and fewer leaves were associated with greater stemflow crown depth and crown openness of tropical forest trees affected throughfall when the rainfall was less than 20 mm but crown length of tropic forest was the only significant predictor of throughfall when the rainfall exceeded 20 mm park and cameron 2008 however owing to the numerous measurable variables and forest types the relationship between tree structure and rainfall partitioning remains unclear since the dujiangyan irrigation project was built in 256 bce its five class canal system is an important support for linpan existence in the chengdu plain li and xu 2006 at the same time linpan vegetation through its water storage river runoff regulation and soil fixation effects has feed back effects on the water resource conservation of the irrigation system in the past 50 years the rainfall in chengdu plain has decreased by 32 mm every 10 years wang et al 2019 moreover seasonal precipitation here is severely uneven with more than 75 of the annual precipitation occurs from june to september each year wang et al 2019 thus the regulating effect of linpan vegetation on water resources of the chengdu plain is becoming more and more important although linpan constitute key agroforestry ecosystems in the chengdu plain and offer diverse ecological and social services no study has yet investigated the hydrological services provide by linpan trees hence a detailed assessment is needed to characterize and evaluate the interception loss of trees in these important ecosystems and to further explore the mechanisms of rainfall partitioning by linpan trees it was hypothesized that the three components of rainfall partitioning and their associated variables differ between evergreen and deciduous tree species this study had the following two main objectives 1 to examine the seasonal variability in rainfall partitioning for typical linpan plots comprised of seven evergreen tree species and four deciduous tree species 2 to elucidate the impact of rainfall factors e g gp and rainfall intensity and tree structure e g lai stand density diameter at breast height and tree height on rainfall partitioning of evergreen and deciduous trees in linpan 2 methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in sandaoyan town 30 52 14 n 103 54 49 e on the chengdu plain in sichuan province china 30 3 n 104 3 e fig 1a b which has more than 600 traditional linpan fig 2 a b about 79 2 of the rural population of sandaoyan town was then living in linpan a field survey of traditional linpan in sandaoyan town was conducted and the types and numbers of trees in each linpan were recorded thirty two tree species belonging to 30 genera and 23 botanical families were identified in these linpan eleven dominant tree species occurred most frequently table 1 thus from ten traditional linpan seventeen plots of pure stands fig 2c containing eleven tree species respectively and ranging in size from 16 4 m2 to 173 5 m2 were selected for data collection the chengdu plain is the region of china with the lowest direct solar radiation owing to its foggy and cloudy weather where the annual relative humidity is 83 0 li et al 2019 in this region precipitation abundance and intensity vary considerably on a seasonal basis the long term 1961 2017 mean annual precipitation depth here was 892 6 mm with more than 75 0 of total precipitation between june and september especially within the summer season 61 of total precipitation from june to august while the mean monthly rainfall from december to february was generally less than 50 0 mm xie and xie 2019 wu 2019 in addition the surrounding mountains low lying terrain temperature inversion and perennial rain of the chengdu plain predisposes the area to its typically foggy weather in autumn and winter wen and li 2019 the annual average temperature is 16 4 c and the average wind speed is 0 7 m s field studies of tree structure in the seventeen plots were conducted prior to the rainfall experiments within each plot all trees were counted and measured for each tree species there were more than 6 replications table 2 their diameter at breast height dbh tree height and crown width were recorded and corresponding means were calculated table 2 the lai of trees was measured with a plant canopy imager ci 110 cid bio science inc camas wa usa during four seasons the adjustable camera lens of the imager ci 110 captures wide angle canopy images and focuses for varying canopy heights down to 30 cm 150 viewing angle with a live updating high resolution fish eye digital image enabling an on site evaluation of solar beam transmission coefficients or gap fractions for lai analysis about 63 6 of dominant tree species were evergreen species while 36 4 were deciduous only one species metasequoia glyptostroboides was coniferous and it was also the tallest tree with an average height of 24 4 m the maximum average crown width of 7 0 m was observed for camptotheca acuminata 2 2 measurement of rainfall throughfall and stemflow rainfall partitioning data were collected from april 2018 to april 2019 to continuously monitor gp values a tipping bucket rain gauge onset rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa with an automatic data logger onset hobo event onset computer corp was installed horizontally at 10 m above horizontal ground beside the 17 plots unobstructed by other instruments the tipping bucket rain gauges had a resolution of 0 2 mm with a 15 2 cm diameter opening and a measuring range of up to 12 7 cm of rainfall per hour it can store 16 000 sets of data six throughfall collectors within every 10 m2 were evenly distributed across the plot areas fig 3 throughfall collectors consisted of a polyethylene funnel with a container under each funnel collectors had two different diameters 20 0 cm and 12 0 cm but the same height 21 5 cm the former was used in summer and the latter was used in other seasons for individual tree for each rainfall event throughfall depth tf mm was calculated following zhang et al 2016 1 t f i 1 n v t f i n f a here vtf is the throughfall volume l for each collector n is the number of throughfall collectors under each tree canopy and fa is the opening area m2 of the funnel used in the experiments three dbh classes of each tree species were classified as follows small trees class 1 0 15 1 cm medium trees class 2 15 2 30 4 cm and big trees class 3 30 5 cm according to the dbh classes two to four trees from each category were selected for estimating stemflow in each plot stemflow was captured using a halved rubber hose spirally wrapped around the tree trunk fig 3 each hose was routed to a 1 5 l

stemflow volume l of the i th dbh class mi is the number of trees in the i th dbh class and n is the number of dbh classes to avoid interference tf and sf must be measured as soon as possible after rainfall had stopped canopy interception depth i mm is generally expressed as gross precipitation depth not reaching the ground guevara escobar et al 2007 and is defined as follows 3 i p t f s f 2 3 statistical analysis firstly the contribution of tf sf and i to rainfall partitioning of linpan trees were calculated then spearman correlation analysis was undertaken to examine the relationships among the rainfall factors tree structure and rainfall partitioning of linpan trees in order to clarify the effects of rainfall factors and tree structure on rainfall partitioning linear and non linear regression models were used to estimate these relationships all statistical analyses were performed using spss 11 0 spss inc chicago il usa the results are expressed with 95 confidence intervals origin 8 0 originlab corp northampton ma usa was used to a render graphs and fit functions to the data 3 results 3 1 gp and lai of the tree plots during the study period the total annual rainfall was 880 3 mm in sandaoyan town about 60 3 of total gp between june and august based on records from the national observatory meteorological station thirteen rainfall events were sampled by our team three events in spring four events in summer three events in autumn and three events in winter fig 4 gp depth was 116 2 mm accounting for 13 2 of the annual rainfall including 17 8 mm in spring 69 4 mm in summer 8 6 mm in autumn and 10 4 mm in winter eight rainfall events within 24 h periods did not exceed 10 mm and the proportion of small rainfall events 61 5 was seemed to be high only one event exceeded 25 0 mm rainfall duration was also variable ranging between 2 9 h and 28 1 h with event scale intensities ranging from 0 1 3 6 mm h 1 according to the grading of rainfall intensity in the federal meteorological handbook no 1 ofcm 2005 eleven of the events were of low intensity and two were of moderate intensity table 3 summarizes the mean lai of each tree plot about 89 3 of lai values for evergreen tree plots exceeded 1 0 moreover the annual mean lai value of evergreen tree plots was higher 1 2 than that of deciduous tree plots 1 1 however in summer and autumn seasonal lai values of deciduous tree plots were obviously higher than those of evergreen tree plots one particular cinnamomum japonicum plot had the highest lai 1 4 both the largest 1 8 and the smallest 0 4 seasonal lai values were observed in camptotheca acuminata plots in summer and winter respectively citrus maxima plot showed the most stable lai values across seasons 3 2 throughfall the mean event tf ranged from 3 5 mm to 7 4 mm the tf percentage tf is the ratio of tf to gp which varied between 36 3 osmanthus fragrans plot and 74 2 c acuminata plot during the study period the mean tf of the 17 plots was 57 5 fig 5 a reveals that mean tf values increased with gp the highest seasonal tf was observed in summer while the highest tf occurred in winter fig 5b nevertheless the seasonal differences in tf were not statistically significant fig 5b table 4 shows that mean tf and tf varied among tree species the lowest tf and tf appeared in the o fragrans plot on the contrary c acuminata exhibited the highest tf and tf evergreen trees showed a lower mean tf 56 5 than that of deciduous trees 59 2 in summer autumn and winter both the seasonal mean tf and tf values of evergreen trees were lower than those of deciduous trees fig 6 furthermore 10 7 of tf collectors indicated tf values exceeding gp table 5 with corresponding percentages of 9 9 in spring 9 9 in summer 12 4 in autumn and 10 3 in winter detailed analysis showed the percentage of tf values over gp varied among tree species and this percentage was slightly higher for deciduous trees 11 0 than evergreen trees 10 4 tf values of neosinocalamus affinis most frequently 23 3 exceeded gp followed by c acuminata 18 9 the percentage of collectors that exceeded gp showed no relationship with gp or rainfall intensity however there were significant linear relationships of this percentage with lai for evergreen trees in winter 0 8 p 0 05 and for deciduous trees in spring 0 9 p 0 05 data not shown 3 3 stemflow table 4 shows that the mean event sf of tree plots ranged from 0 3 mm to 2 4 mm and the mean sf percentage sf was 14 3 moreover significant differences p 0 05 were observed in mean sf and sf among tree plots fig 5c shows that when gp was less than 6 mm sf remained at a low and stable proportion of gp no more than 10 however when gp exceeded 6 8 mm an obvious increasing in sf was observed seasonal differences in sf among plots were statistically significant p 0 05 fig 5b the lowest sf and sf values consistently occurred in winter in contrast the highest mean sf and sf were observed in summer and autumn respectively the mean sf of evergreen tree plots was slightly higher than that of deciduous tree plots in spring summer and autumn while the opposite pattern was observed in winter fig 6 four tree species including lindera megaphylla phoebe zhennan c camphora and c acuminata did not generate sf until gp exceeded 1 8 mm in addition sf of n affinis plots fluctuated least over the four seasons data no shown 3 4 canopy interception table 4 shows that the i percentage i of tree plots ranged from 16 5 c maxima to 49 1 c japonicum with a mean i of 28 27 both i and i exhibited unclear variation as gp increased fig 5d the curve of i values first peaked when gp reached 6 0 mm as shown in fig 5b the mean i differed among seasons however despite i being higher in winter and spring than that in other seasons the seasonal differences were not statistically significant the mean i was slightly higher for evergreen trees 29 2 than that for deciduous trees 26 6 table 4 detailed analysis fig 6 showed both i and i for deciduous trees were higher than those for evergreen trees in spring and autumn while the opposite pattern occurred in summer and winter deciduous trees showed the lowest i in winter additionally the i and i of m glyptostroboides plot were significantly higher p 0 05 than those of other deciduous trees this could be owing to its fascicled needle arrangement enabling water retention between needle bases 3 5 rainfall partitioning in relation to the characteristics of rainfall and tree structure spearman correlation analysis revealed that gp has the most potential impact on rainfall partitioning the tf sf and i values except for i values of evergreen trees were very significantly associated with gp table 6 moreover these values were also obviously correlated with rainfall intensity these relationships between tf sf and gp were presented using one dimensional linear regression equations fig 7 a b ours findings also confirmed that gp and rainfall intensity could partially affect tf sf and i evergreen trees tf was only significantly associated with gp while evergreen trees sf was only correlated with rainfall intensity although the corresponding r squared values were relatively low r2 0 3 i values of evergreen trees and deciduous trees showed negative non linear correlations p 0 05 with rainfall intensity and gp respectively fig 7c d in addition sf and sf were also related with tree structure sf values increased significantly with dbh fig 7e but decreased with tree height sf values of evergreen and deciduous trees were both significantly negatively correlated with lai and tree height fig 7f canopy width did not affect rainfall partitioning the linear regression analysis verified that there was no collinearity between dbh and tree height however collinearity existed between lai and tree height in addition no collinearity was found between gp and rainfall intensity though they were significantly related to values of sf tf and i 4 discussion 4 1 throughfall stemflow and canopy interception tf sf and i values relative to incident gp are highly variable among and within both tree species as well as ecoregions levia and frost 2003 in this study the mean event tf reached 58 2 of total precipitation while the mean sf and i were 14 3 and 28 3 respectively tf tends to induce matrix flow and plays an important role in transferring the input of chemical solutes from aboveground vegetative surfaces to the soil liang et al 2009 tf in evergreen broadleaved forests can range from 25 to 39 and from 70 to 90 in tropical and temperate forests respectively from 50 to 80 in subtropical woodlands and from 75 to 84 in savannas cowling and mills 2011 compared with these previous reports it was found that tf in this study from 36 3 74 2 varied substantially furthermore tf in this study was also characterized by high spatial variability about 10 57 of total collectors measurements of tfexceeded the respective gp although it is not an unusual phenomenon for some measured values of individual tf gauges to exceed the measured gp carlyle moses et al 2004 published study has not yet elucidated the spatial and temporal variability of tf beneath forests levia et al 2015 the high variability of tf in our study could be attributed to the mean rainfall event total 8 9 mm not exceeding 10 mm in this study and meaning that most of the recorded rainfall events were likely not large enough to saturate the canopy as indicated by brauman et al 2010 dripping water from a saturated canopy is both more predictable and comprises a more spatially uniform fraction of rainfall than tf under an unsaturated canopy moreover considering that variability occurred more frequently in autumn and winter it was speculated that tree canopy could intercept fog increasing water input below the canopy as indicated by bruijnzeel and hamilton 2000 fog interception can increase tf to 115 130 of gp the foggy days in autumn and winter november to february accounts for 60 of the foggy days in the whole year in the chengdu plain china meteorological administration additionally in this study evergreen trees had a lower tf compared to deciduous trees even in the growing period summer when deciduous trees are in full leaf this was in accordance with the results of barbier et al 2009 nevertheless the lowest tf of deciduous trees appearing in summer cannot be overlooked suggesting that the canopies of deciduous trees in linpan may grow fastest in summer sf is an important hydrological component because it represents a localized point source of water and ion fluxes down the tree trunk dunkerley 2014 although a few reports found that sf makes up 30 of gp sf comprised small proportion of the net precipitation generally less than 5 of gp shi et al 2010 levia et al 2011 carlyle moses et al 2014 moreover sf usually showed much wider variability than both tf and i levia et al 2011 in this study the mean event sf exceeded 14 as previously noted by holder 2004 and gabriel and jauze 2008 fog can also strongly influence sf inputs in tropical montane cloud forest of guatemala linpan trees could therefore receive a substantial amount of water input via direct deposition from fog droplets in addition sf was greater during the leafed period spring summer and autumn compared to the leafless period winter similarly staelens et al 2008 reported that the leafed sf was greater than the non leafed sf however because of the absence of foliage interception a few previous studies have indicated that the sf of deciduous tree species was greater under their leafless state relative to their leafed state herbst et al 2008 siegert and levia 2014 the difference may be owing to variation in their winter climate in the chengdu plain the gross winter rainfall accounts for less than 5 of the total annual precipitation with two to three times as much evapotranspiration of rainwater occurring in winter wu 2019 the dry woody surfaces of trees are another possible factors explaining the lowest sf values occurring in winter this may also explain why the sf of evergreen trees was lower than that of deciduous trees in winter as the dry evergreen canopy almost completely intercepted the scarce winter rainfall occurring in the chengdu plain generally average i ranges from 10 to 40 among different types of natural forests including those in tropical dry 25 arid semi arid 29 temperate 26 and cold temperate areas 20 30 toba and ohta 2005 tsiko et al 2012 návar 2017 zabret et al 2018 a similar range of average i values was observed in the present study moreover although linpan are considered agroforestry systems their i values differed from those of managed forest plots where rainfall interception was lower 10 dietz et al 2006 this pattern could be owing the growth patterns of trees in traditional linpan closely resembling those of unmanaged natural forests though the 11 linpan trees had differing characteristics and i values they also exhibited very similar trends in i under the same gp i was generally greater in summer autumn than in winter spring a similarly finding has also been reported for natural forests in germany mexico and the usa krämer and hölscher 2009 carlyle moses and gash 2011 coble and hart 2013 the seasonal i values were quite similar year round but winter exhibited the highest average i despite deciduous trees having shed their leaves by winter several studies have reported higher i values in winter than in other seasons herbst et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 it can be speculated that lower rainfall intensity and gp counterbalances the reduced storage capacity of deciduous canopies in winter in addition our results confirmed that the annual mean i was higher for evergreen trees than for deciduous trees the same phenomenon was reported by liu and wen 2003 and carlyle moses 2004 for 20 deciduous forests and coniferous forests in different bioregions of china and mexico 4 2 the relationship between rainfall partitioning rainfall factors and tree structure several studies have indicated that tf sf and i were positively and linearly related to gp carlyle moses 2004 levia et al 2011 levia and germer 2015 in our study a similar linear relationship between gp and both tf and sf was observed while the expected correlation between i and gp was better represented by a logarithmic function gp was also positively associated with tf however i decreased as rainfall amount increased this pattern was similar with those from an earlier study on i in boreal and temperate forests toba and ohta 2005 conflicting relationships between rainfall intensity and rainfall partitioning have been reported many studies have shown rainfall intensity usually has an unclear relationship with i tf and sf however our study found that rainfall intensity was significantly associated with tf sf and i as well as significantly correlated with i and sf for evergreen trees among these variables sf and its percentage were most positively affected by rainfall intensity this finding can be explained by rain drops being unstably stored in canopies when tree crowns are agitated by intense rainfall which could lead to a high proportion of intercepted rainwater splashing thereby increasing sf in addition the relationships between rainfall intensity and rainfall partitioning percentages can be represented by nonlinear functions previous studies have also pointed out that sf and i can exhibit nonlinear relations e g following power and logarithmic functions with rainfall intensity iida et al 2005 in this study several different relationships were determined to describe the dynamics of tree hydrological components based on tree structure measurements based on spearman s correlation coefficients both sf and sf were significantly related to various plot characteristics e g lai dbh and height because the crown overlap within dense stands may produce significant interference that contributes to sf and tf generation stand density is usually considered one of the key factors influencing rainfall partitioning levia et al 2011 however in our study stand density did not affect each component of rainfall partitioning in agreement with our findings llorens and gallart 2000 also concluded there was no relationship between stand density and rainfall redistribution instead the lai dbh and height values of tree plots were confirmed to be associated with sf drainage to a large extent in linpan ecosystems which also underscores the complexity of how tree structure affects sf and the difficulty of isolating individual factors even within species few studies have focused on the relationship between lai and sf our study observed a linear decrease in sf with increased lai this phenomenon agreed well with previous findings that the lower lai of beech saplings in a european forest increased sf levia et al 2015 tanaka et al 2017 also noted that the effect of lai on sf is not straightforward this discrepancy can be caused by high variation in plant morphology and architecture even under the same lai although some investigators have noted that the i value of forest canopies is frequently associated with lai levia et al 2011 no such relationship was observed among our study plots generally dbh and tree height are the measurements of tree structure that most accurately predict sf oyarzún et al 2011 hofhansl et al 2012 swaffer et al 2014 our study indicated that dbh largely acted as the most important variable of tree structure positively and significantly influenced sf thus big trees yielded more sf than did small trees in japan larger trees with greater dbh were also found to produce more sf than smaller trees park and hattori 2002 moreover the relationship between sf and dbh of a secondary forest in japan could be represented by exponential equations deguchi et al 2006 in this study sf and sf values of linpan trees also significantly decreased with tree height the result was consistent with the findings of dezhban et al 2020 who found that higher sf yields in the hyrcanian forest of iran were negatively associated with tree height thus the present results suggested that taller trees with a greater surface area likely had greater water storage capacity additionally in previous studies dbh showed a power relationship with tree height zheng et al 2018 in our study dbh was significantly related p 0 05 to both tree height and crown width 5 conclusion this research provides the first empirical confirmation that linpan trees play an important role in rainfall partitioning in the chengdu plain the three components of rainfall partitioning and the effects of linpan tree structure on rainfall partitioning were assessed notably there was wild variations in tf and very high sf values observed among tree plots rainfall factors especially gp were helpful in predicting canopy hydrological components but prediction varied among tree species and seasons regression analysis revealed the strong relationships of lai dbh and tree height with sf and sf for both evergreen and deciduous trees future research should examine the impact of other tree structure e g branches boles and bark texture and meteorological variables e g wind speed and fog on rainfall partitioning such work is expected to deepen the current understanding of linpan responses to rainfall partitioning and contribute to better regulating runoff and maintaining sustainable hydrological cycles in the

8219,study region a volcanic island jeju island south korea study focus to predict and prepare for a drought the variables that affect groundwater level variations are better understood through groundwater monitoring networks in this study we analyzed various observational data including precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater usage tidal levels and groundwater levels to investigate the effects of historic droughts on groundwater level in a volcanic island in 2017 by using principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis new hydrological insights for the region based on the results of these analyses we can select index wells that are vulnerable to droughts this is demonstrated by the decrease in total water input caused by the low amount of precipitation and the increased groundwater usage to compensate for this water shortage this study indicated that pca could be a powerful tool for summarizing large datasets to select index wells that are vulnerable to droughts which would significantly reduce the expense of monitoring programs in addition we investigated whether the observed variables changed with the temporal resolution of the monitoring when the temporal resolution changed from monthly to daily and hourly groundwater level data the main variables that affected the groundwater level variations at each temporal resolution were different therefore it is helpful to comprehensively develop a groundwater management plan using statistical approaches with proper temporal monitoring resolution during drought keywords groundwater level drought multivariate statistical method principal component analysis temporal groundwater monitoring 1 introduction droughts are caused by a lack of rainfall over a long period leading to shortages of water resources such as surface water and groundwater peters et al 2006 compared with surface water resources groundwater may be highly vulnerable to persistent droughts because groundwater recharge may take much longer to recover with the occurrence of drought bloomfield and marchant 2013 furthermore the impact degree of the drought on the aquifer varies temporally and spatially depending on various variables peters et al 2006 van lanen et al 2013 han et al 2018 drought prediction is difficult and many studies have focused on understanding groundwater level variation influenced by drought using different available methods peters et al 2006 hughes et al 2012 van lanen et al 2013 han et al 2018 lee et al 2018 groundwater level monitoring provides the most fundamental information on the effects of hydrologic stresses on groundwater systems and is important for effectively evaluating the quantity and quality of groundwater and understanding the hydrological processes seferli et al 2019 however groundwater movement is subject to temporal variations thus all hydraulic head measurements at each well should be conducted approximately at the same time and the potentiometric surface maps represent only that specific time winter et al 1998 for large amounts of groundwater level data multivariate statistics such as principal component analysis pca are useful for determining the hydrographs of groundwater level patterns and temporal resolution in a large dataset winter et al 2000 in addition the spatial distribution of the hydrograph could be created by determining the affected extent of various variables related to groundwater level fluctuations at each individual well currently hydrographs and graphical plots that show groundwater level fluctuations over time are useful for examining temporal variations in groundwater levels moon et al 2004 geyer et al 2008 perennial streams rarely exist on the surface because of the highly permeable basaltic rock on the volcanic islands peterson 1972 therefore groundwater depletion is a serious problem as water resources depend on the groundwater in these areas toulier et al 2019 shuler et al 2021 in fact the coastal areas of jeju island provide approximately 92 of the water supply from groundwater for various purposes including drinking domestic use agriculture and industry kim et al 2003a b furthermore groundwater use on jeju island has rapidly increased because of the increasing population surface water irrigation usage and economic development el kadi et al 2014 a historic drought that occurred in 2017 severely influenced the groundwater level on jeju island causing it to reach its lowest groundwater level since observations began in 2001 the average groundwater level on jeju island in 2017 was 31 2 m above mean sea level which was 3 5 m lower than that in 2016 the annual precipitation on jeju island during the study period in 2017 was only 1396 mm this accounts for only 64 6 of the typical average annual rainfall over the last 12 y 2162 mm y korea meteorological administration 2018 over the past decade there have been many studies related to variations in groundwater levels on jeju island won 1994 koh 1997 won et al 2005 kim et al 2006 choi and lee 2009 hagedorn et al 2011 however limited research has been conducted on groundwater level variations under drought conditions using statistical methods therefore it has been difficult to develop a regional groundwater management plan for jeju island under drought conditions additionally recent studies have focused primarily on the long term monitoring of groundwater level from global climate change but short term groundwater level estimation and forecasting are more efficient approaches to prepare for drought occurrences from a management perspective apaydin 2010 yan et al 2018 the main purpose of this study was to examine the variation patterns of the groundwater level caused by the historic drought in 2017 and detect groundwater wells with similar patterns by using pca which is a type of multivariate statistical analysis based on this analysis we can understand the spatial distribution of various types of hydrographs within a study area to accomplish this we first analyzed the hydrological variables that affected the groundwater level and extracted the index wells that were vulnerable to droughts by mapping the variables precipitation tidal level and man induced pumping of freshwater in coastal wells this might quantitatively explain the groundwater level variations in each well and emphasize the requirement for intensive management of these wells we also investigated the changes in the influences on the groundwater level variations with temporal monitoring resolution monthly daily and hourly thus we aimed to establish an effective temporal monitoring resolution for each variable clarifying the groundwater level variation under drought conditions lastly we examined the correlation between the monthly groundwater level and rainfall data and that between hourly groundwater level and tidal level data 2 study area and data processing 2 1 description of the study area the study area is the volcanic jeju island 126 1 127 0 e and 33 1 33 6 n which is located approximately 140 km from the southern tip of the korean peninsula fig 1 a the island has an area of approximately 1825 km2 and a nearly elliptical shape with a major axis that is 73 km long mt halla lies in the central area of the island rising 1950 m above sea level and the island slopes down relatively gently from its summit to the east and west 3 to 5 whereas the northern and southern sides slope steeply 5 to 10 fig 1b as shown in fig 1b jeju island is largely divided into four parts east west south and north and subdivided into 12 watersheds aeweol jeju jocheon seogwi andeok namwon gujwa sungsan pyoseon daejeong hankyeong and hanlim presently 133 monitoring wells have been established on the island and each monitoring well is equipped with an automatic data logger which measures the hourly values for groundwater level water temperature and electrical conductivity ec fig 1b and c lee and kwon 2016 geological characteristics are also important because they affect groundwater level fluctuations as shown in fig 2 a the stratigraphic units of the island can be categorized into basement rocks granite and welded tuff u formations unconsolidated sediments the seogwipo formation conglomeratic sandstone sandstone sandy mudstone and mudstone with abundant bio clastic shells and basaltic and trachytic lavas yoon 1997 the basement that underlies the island consists of cretaceous welded tuff and granite that is covered by unconsolidated formations u formations lee and kwon 2016 these u formations are not related to volcanic activity and consist of uncemented sand and clay components with a thickness of approximately 150 m koh 1997 the seogwipo formation which is a relatively impermeable sedimentary layer lies above these u formations this layer is mainly distributed in the western northern and southern regions and the distribution depth is different for each region won 1994 koh 1997 specifically the seogwipo formation generally exists at 41 m and 28 m below sea level in the western and northern regions respectively and 16 m above sea level in the southern region koh and yon 1991 fig 2b and c however the seogwipo formation is not well developed on the eastern jeju island therefore the highly permeable basaltic layer is directly exposed to seawater increasing its vulnerability to saline water intrusion koh and yon 1991 the seogwipo formation is an aquitard that prevents recharged rainwater from infiltrating below the layer hahn et al 1997 koh 1997 kim et al 2003a b won et al 2005 consequently the characteristics of groundwater occurrences on jeju island are largely controlled by the spatial distribution of the seogwipo formation hahn et al 1997 koh 1997 koh and yon 1991 won et al 2005 although groundwater wells on the jeju island mainly penetrate almost unconfined aquifers in the basaltic rock some wells exhibit the characteristics of a confined aquifer in the seogwipo formation koh et al 2006 the hydrogeological characteristics of groundwater systems on the jeju island cannot be easily understood because various basaltic and trachytic lavas act as channels owing to the prolonged volcanic activity shin and hwang 2020 the climate of jeju island is characterized by hot and humid summers and cool and dry winters due to the east asian monsoon won et al 2005 in summer the southeasterly monsoon from june to september transports moist air from the west pacific and the east china sea and causes abundant precipitation normally 2162 mm y over the island and the korean peninsula korea meteorological administration 2018 however during the study period in 2017 the annual precipitation was only 1396 mm which represents the lowest precipitation over 12 y in particular the local precipitation was 773 mm at jeju city station in the north the lowest since 1961 1334 mm at seogwipo station in the south 861 mm at gosan station in the west and 1918 mm at sungsan station in the east korea meteorological administration 2018 this precipitation discrepancy in these four regions was caused by the orographic effects of mt halla thus the annual precipitation in the southern and eastern areas seogwipo and sungsan were twice as large as those in the northern and western areas jeju city and gosan won et al 2005 2 2 data acquisition all groundwater facilities on the island are exclusively managed by the jeju special self governing province and the island has operated an independent groundwater monitoring network since 1991 lee et al 2016 groundwater data for 133 monitoring wells in operation are publicly available through a website www jejuwater go kr in this study we used groundwater level data from 116 monitoring wells among the 133 monitoring wells in 2017 the remaining 17 monitoring wells were not included in this study because of data loss from long term observations this study used water input runoff and evapotranspiration data from jeju island over 12 y which was released by the water policy bureau of jeju special self governing province precipitation data were acquired from the korea meteorological association kma of the main weather stations which are located in four different parts and river basins of the island jeju north seogwipo south gosan west and sungsan east fig 1b in addition groundwater usage data obtained from the jeju research institute and k water were used finally tidal level data were obtained from the korea hydrographic and oceanographic agency khoa four tidal level monitoring stations are located in the island at jeju north moseulpo southwest gosan west and sungsanpo east 3 statistical methods 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the estimated drought can be represented by the standardized precipitation index spi which is characterized by meteorological data for various time scales from 1 to 36 mon when using monthly input data mckee et al 1993 and 1995 to compute the spi historic rainfall data for independent rainfall events at each station were fitted to a gamma probability distribution function as follows 1 g x 1 β α τ α x α 1 e x β where α 0 is the shape parameter β 0 is a scale parameter x 0 is the amount of precipitation and g x is the probability of precipitation being equal to a value x mckee et al 1993 and 1995 the name of the indicator usually includes the accumulation period in this study the research period is one year therefore it is appropriate to use an indicator for 12 mon spi 12 according to the extent of drought in jeju island the spi 12 for jeju city northern regions and seogwipo southern regions were 2 12 extremely dry 1 45 moderately dry respectively korea meteorological administration 2018 hence most of jeju island experienced a drought in 2017 particularly the northern region which was under extreme drought causing the groundwater level to continuously decrease during the 12 mon period in 2017 3 2 principal component analysis pca this study utilized principal component analysis pca to investigate the variables that affect groundwater level fluctuations and classify the variation patterns of groundwater level data from 116 monitoring wells pca is a multivariate statistical procedure used to reduce the number of variables and reveal the existing patterns in a large dataset stetzenbach et al 1999 winter et al 2000 lee et al 2008 page et al 2012 pca quantifies the relationship between variables by computing the correlation matrix for the entire dataset winter et al 2000 the correlation matrix is decomposed into a score matrix and a loading matrix by calculating and scaling the eigenvectors and eigenvalues see fig 3 winter et al 2000 mutually independent axes that describe the dataset can be derived by using these two matrices meglen 1991 their results are plotted in a bivariate graph which uses the scores of the first two principal components as axes to identify the influencing variables of groundwater level variations this method is a more convenient approach for combining temporal and spatial dimensions in the analysis and can be used to identify the performance of wells to elucidate any temporal variations in the groundwater level winter et al 2000 gangopadhyay et al 2001 moon et al 2004 lewandowski et al 2009 page et al 2012 seferli et al 2019 the general form of the equation to compute scores for the first component created in principal component analysis is as follows winter et al 2000 2 c 1 b 11 x 1 b 12 x 2 b 1 p x p where c1 is the subject s score for principal component 1 pc 1 the first component extracted b11 b12 b1p are the regression coefficients or weights for the observed variables 1 2 p which are used to create pc 1 and xp1 x2 xp are the subject s scores with the observed variables 1 2 p component scores derived through these processes are helpful in interpreting the various temporal variations in groundwater level pattern for each principal component winter et al 2000 seferli et al 2019 component loadings are correlation coefficients between the groundwater level variables and each principal component of the monitoring well groundwater levels were classified into two groups according to the component loadings the component loading value is also useful for representing the variables of groundwater level variation through quantitative scores in each well winter et al 2000 page et al 2012 pca has been commonly used to extract the dominating variables and patterns from large water level datasets winter et al 2000 lewandowski et al 2009 ko et al 2010 page et al 2012 seferli et al 2019 winter et al 2000 studied the pattern in hydrographs and selected index wells using a pca on substantial water level data of four lake areas in the united states gangopadhyay et al 2001 analyzed the temporal variations and selected the wells representing the potentiometric head distribution on the chao phraya river in thailand bangkok moon et al 2004 classified groundwater hydrograph types and estimated the groundwater recharge ratio from the accumulated rainfall amount using pca from groundwater level data in south korea lewandowski et al 2009 applied pca to time series water level data to study the relationship between the temporal variation of water level and river stage of the floodplain for the lowland river spree in berlin germany page et al 2012 conducted pca for continuously measured time series data groundwater head electrical conductivity and temperature to identify indicator wells and derive indicator parameters for a study area in northwest switzerland recently seferli et al 2019 used pca to interpret the areal distribution of various types of groundwater level fluctuation patterns and to identify certain target wells for managing water abstraction within large groups of monitoring wells in the west thessaly basin greece thus pca could be considered as a powerful tool to interpret the water level pattern and select index wells from water level data through these previous studies however pca using water level measurements did not lead to any profound new insights into the factors that could be determined from the conventional analysis of groundwater hydrographs winter et al 2000 furthermore time series data are significantly different from ordinary independent data and when the main objective of pca is descriptive not inferential complications such as non independence do not seriously affect this objective jolliffe 2002 despite the limitations of pca this method analyzed the hydrographs as efficient objective and reproducible winter et al 2000 for pca analysis we created n by m n m groundwater level dataset matrices for the hourly daily and monthly groundwater levels on jeju island m is the number of monitoring observations and n is the number of measurements varies with the time resolution in this study we aimed to evaluate whether the variables influencing the observed groundwater level fluctuation changed with the different monitoring time resolutions hence the pca was conducted for three different time resolutions the hourly dataset comprising n 8760 water level data measurements daily dataset comprising n 365 data and the monthly dataset comprising n 12 data from m 116 wells the datasets had to be completed to avoid missing values because the pca procedure requires a full matrix of data meglen 1991 however if a few wells were not measured on a given day because of meteorological phenomena or machine malfunctions the missing data were obtained with a linear filter for short term outcomes we used the statistical package program jmp sas institute cary north carolina to identify the component scores and loadings that reflected the underlying correlation structure of the data recently dynamic variable analysis dfa which is an alternative to pca has become a useful tool for detecting common patterns in a set of time series data and determining the relationships between these observations and explanatory variables zuur et al 2003 the application of dfa has been suggested in the cases where the data of hydrological time series are not independent of each other zuur et al 2003 muñoz carpena et al 2005 kuo and chang 2010 trásy et al 2020 therefore dfa could be a useful analysis method to interpret the water level of wells in the same aquifers with mutually dependent characteristics the variation characteristics of the groundwater level reflect heterogeneous coastal aquifers depending on each region of jeju island thus it may not be appropriate to use dfa for the water level data for the entire jeju island such as in our study 3 3 correlation analysis of the time series early applications of statistical hydrology were restricted to surface water problems mccuen 2003 however the statistical domain of hydrology has broadened to encompass problems related to both surface water and groundwater resources machiwal and jha 2006 thus presently time series is a powerful tool for forecasting groundwater levels in wells rennolls et al 1980 graham and tankersley 1993 bierkens et al 2001 two types of correlations exist depending on whether the signals considered for the correlation are the same or different auto correlation and cross correlation auto correlation analysis is a type of correlation in which the given data series are usually correlated with a time shifted version of itself montgomery et al 2008 the usual estimate of the auto covariance function c k is as follows 3 c k γ ˆ k 1 t t 1 t k y t y y t k y k 0 1 2 k where γ k is the covariance between y t and y t k k is the lag time t is the length of the time series yt is a single event in time and y is the average of the events montgomery et al 2008 the auto correlation function r k is estimated using the sample auto correlation function as follows 4 r k ρ ˆ k c k c 0 k 0 1 2 k where ρ k is the auto correlation coefficient at lag k montgomery et al 2008 the auto correlation analysis calculates the linear dependency of variables over time intervals and the memory effect for example an event such as a storm or rainfall has a long term effect on the time series of each groundwater well and the auto correlation function r k shows a gently decreasing slope and nonzero value over a long time lag kim and lee 2017 in contrast cross correlation analysis has been used to estimate the degree to which two different time series input and output are correlated kim et al 2005 the cross covariance coefficient at lag k is given by 5 c x y 1 t t 1 t k x t x y t k y k 0 1 2 1 t t k 1 t y t y x t k x k 1 2 where x and y are the input and output time series respectively montgomery et al 2008 the definition of a cross correlation function r x y is as follows 6 r x y c x y c x x 0 c y y 0 k 0 1 2 where c x x and c y y are the individual covariances montgomery et al 2008 the cross correlation function r x y corresponds to the impulse response of the system if the input time series is random if r x y 0 for k 0 the input for example rainfall or tidal level influences the output for example groundwater level and if r x y 0 for k 0 the output influences the input delay was defined as the lag time the lag time with the maximum correlation value indicates how fast the event propagates to the output signal and the correlation value r ranges between 1 0 and 1 0 yaffee and mcgee 2000 in this study the cross correlation function was used to inspect the relationship between tidal and groundwater level fluctuations 4 results and discussion 4 1 general variation patterns of the groundwater level groundwater level variations on jeju island are influenced by various variables i e precipitation evapotranspiration tidal level and man induced pumping of freshwater in coastal wells and the extent to which they are affected varies regionally kim et al 2006 won et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2011 fig 4 a shows the water balance analysis of jeju island from 2006 to 2017 https water jeju go kr the average water balance analysis of jeju island revealed that the total amount of water input 3930 hm3 y 100 comprises evapotranspiration 1375 hm3 y 34 99 runoff 925 hm3 y 23 54 and groundwater recharge 1630 hm3 y 41 47 for 12 y from 2006 to 2017 to investigate the relationship of the groundwater recharge rate with the groundwater level it is important to examine the variations in water balance components the total water input to jeju island by precipitation recorded the lowest value of 2552 hm3 in 2017 which was far below the average value of 3930 hm3 in the last 12 y fig 4a although the total water input was lower than the typical volume owing to a severe drought in 2017 the amount of actual evapotranspiration was 1321 hm3 which is similar to the average volume of 1375 hm3 in the last 12 y fig 4a meanwhile the amount of runoff was 387 hm3 in 2017 which was the second lowest value after that in 2013 385 hm3 based on these data the recharge rate water input direct runoff evapotranspiration was 844 hm3 in 2017 which was the lowest value since 2006 therefore the decrease in the water input due to the decrease in precipitation caused a shortage of water resources on jeju island which is highly dependent on groundwater resources in general the precipitation on jeju island is concentrated in the summer monsoon june to august and summer rainfall comprises half of the total annual precipitation however in 2017 the precipitation during the same period summer was 552 5 mm fig 4b or 70 7 of the normal precipitation level 781 1 mm in addition the number of days with precipitation 0 1 mm in 2017 was 26 which was the third lowest since the first weather observations were recorded in 1973 korea meteorological administration 2018 to elucidate the variations in groundwater level with comprehensive information we conducted pca with three different time resolutions monthly daily and hourly two principal components were extracted for each time resolution which explained 84 monthly 79 daily and 72 hourly of the total variations the eigenvalues of the first principal component pc 1 and second principal component pc 2 were slightly different for each time resolution in terms of the variance of pc 1 and pc 2 the values were 1 54 and 30 respectively for the monthly groundwater level 2 51 and 28 respectively for the daily groundwater level and 3 50 and 23 respectively for the hourly groundwater level the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues as a percentage of pc 1 and pc 2 decreased from monthly to daily and from daily to hourly resolution and the variation in monthly data could be clarified by pc 1 and pc 2 the noise of the hourly data was reduced because the daily and monthly data were average values obtained from the hourly data as shown in fig 5 the hydrographs of the component scores for pcs 1 and 2 which are graphical representations of each variation in the data had different patterns except during heavy rainfall events in august and october fig 5a the score hydrograph for pc 1 decreased gradually implying that variables other than seasonal precipitation affected the groundwater level fluctuations in contrast the score hydrograph for pc 2 reflects seasonal precipitation fig 5b as the temporal resolution changed the variation patterns of the score hydrographs for pc 1 did not differ significantly fig 5a but the score hydrographs for pc 2 showed that the amplitude of the hourly groundwater level fluctuations was larger than those of the monthly and daily datasets fig 5b this result indicated that the observed variables at each time resolution might be different for pc 2 4 2 classification of groundwater level variations we divided the monitoring wells into two groups based on the loading values of pcs 1 and 2 to identify the main variables of the groundwater level variations in each group on one hand wells that had higher loadings on pc l 0 8 and lower loadings on pc 2 0 2 were designated as group i at the lower right side of the diagram fig 6 on the other hand wells that had higher loadings on pc 2 0 8 and lower loadings on pc l 0 2 at the upper left side of the diagram were designated as group ii to explore the variables that influenced the groundwater level in each group and the influence of these variables on the groundwater level under different temporal resolutions we selected six index wells the index wells were composed of two for each time resolution monthly daily and hourly with the highest loading value for pcs 1 and 2 after pca of the 116 monitoring wells table 1 the loading values quantify the extent to which each monitoring well contributes to the groundwater level variations therefore a well with a high loading value better represents groundwater level variations in this study the index wells in group i with the highest pc 1 loadings fig 5c from each time resolution were jr hg1 monthly and daily and jr eu1 hourly and those in group ii with the highest pc 2 loadings were jw pd monthly jd sd2 daily and jd sd1 hourly based on the spatial distributions of both loadings for pcs 1 and 2 at each monitoring well the values are visually shown on a map of jeju island including the volume of groundwater usage fig 7 group i is mainly located in the northern and western regions of jeju island pc 1 0 8 and pc 2 0 2 the groundwater level of the index wells colored circle surrounded by white dotted circles in this group showed low seasonality during the study period fig 5c shows the groundwater level variations of the index wells in group i jr hg1 monthly and daily and jr eu1 hourly with the highest pc 1 loadings at each time resolution and daily precipitation data at the nearby jeju weather station for 2017 the volume of groundwater usage on jeju island in 2017 was 243 hm3 an increase of 17 7 compared to 2016 and most of them were domestic 58 4 and agricultural 40 1 water the volume of domestic water consumption was the largest in the jeju watershed in the northern part of the island because the airport and accommodations were concentrated there the volume of agricultural water consumption was the largest in the aewol watershed in the northern part of the island in addition the monthly groundwater consumption in 2017 increased in the summer which might be due to the increase in tourists during the peak season fig 8 a in fact from 2006 to 2017 the correlation between the amount of precipitation in jeju weather station and the amount of groundwater usage of jeju si in the northern region showed a negative relationship correlation coefficient r 0 56 this inverse variation between precipitation and the amount of groundwater usage was also observed between 2012 and 2013 figs 4a and 8b when the precipitation in 2012 was 2831 mm the volume of groundwater usage was 141 hm3 but when precipitation decreased in 2013 the volume of groundwater usage increased sharply to 202 hm3 1531 mm therefore an increase in the amount of groundwater usage could depress the groundwater level and lead to the intensification of droughts alley et al 1999 galloway and riley 1999 faunt et al 2009 and 2015 wada et al 2010 russo and lall 2017 moreover from 2006 to 2017 the correlation between the amount of groundwater usage of jeju si and groundwater level in jr hg 1 which is one of the index wells in group i and located in the northern region showed a negative relationship r 0 561 this phenomenon was particularly evident in the northern and western parts of the island because the precipitation was relatively low in the northern and western parts of the island 861 mm at gosan station and 773 mm at jeju station than in the southern and eastern parts 1334 mm at seogwipo station and 1918 mm at sungsan station moreover in the northern part the amount of groundwater usage in the jeju and aewol watersheds accounted for 61 of the total groundwater consumption in 2017 because of the high consumption of domestic water by concentrated tourism facilities around the airport and the population in the northern part of the island in the western part of this island the consumption of agricultural water in 2017 was more than twice that of domestic water which would have reduced the groundwater level based on these results pc 1 the first major variable which demonstrated a decline in groundwater level in 2017 is related to the decreased total water input caused by the low amount of precipitation and the increased amount of groundwater usage to compensate for these water shortages fig 7e group ii was mainly located in the eastern and southern parts of jeju island fig 7 pc 1 0 8 and pc 2 0 2 fig 5d shows the groundwater level variation at index wells in group ii jw pd monthly jd sd2 daily and jd sd1 hourly and daily precipitation data for 2017 from the sungsan weather station which is located in the eastern part the groundwater levels of the index wells in group ii fig 5d showed seasonal variations and the amplitude of the hourly groundwater levels was larger than that of group i fig 5c this variation was similar to the hydrograph score trend for pc 2 fig 5b on jeju island geologically the seogwipo formation low permeability layer is not well developed in the eastern region and the highly permeable basaltic layer is directly exposed to seawater therefore the tide directly influences fluctuations in the groundwater level choi et al 1991 to examine whether rainfall and tide actually affect the groundwater level variation in group ii wells correlation analysis was performed on rainfall tide and groundwater levels in the eastern region the rainfall and tide data used in the analysis were obtained from the sungsan station located in the eastern part of jeju island figs 4b 5d and 9a groundwater level data were used for the jd hd 1 2 3 and 4 wells hereafter hd 1 2 3 and 4 located in the handong district fig 7f a seawater intrusion monitoring well with a high pc 2 loading value for hourly data fig 9 b the distance from the coast line to inland gradually increased to 0 9 km 2 5 km 5 2 km and 8 8 km from the coast line to jd hd 1 2 3 and 4 respectively kim et al 2006 according to the auto correlation function the hourly rainfall rapidly reached a null value fig 9c indicating the uncorrelated nature of hourly rainfall because rainfall events occur episodically for each event in contrast the auto correlation function for the tidal level showed two sinusoidal patterns on each day implying that the tidal level had a strong inter relationship with a constant period fig 9c for the groundwater levels at hd 1 2 3 and 4 the auto correlation functions revealed two different characteristics first the auto correlation functions of hd 1 and hd 2 exhibited repeated sinusoidal behaviors on each day which were similar to those for the tidal level second the auto correlation functions of hd 3 and hd 4 decreased slowly and linearly this result implied that the tidal and groundwater levels at hd 1 and hd 2 had a strong linear inter relationship and were subjected to a periodically changing source but the groundwater level at hd 3 and hd 4 had longer memory effects according to the cross correlation results when using the monthly rainfall as the input and the groundwater level as the output in 2017 the maximum cross correlation coefficients of the groundwater level at hd 1 2 3 and 4 were 0 754 0 750 0 516 and 0 247 respectively this result indicated that the eastern coastal region of jeju island was considerably affected by rainfall and this influence decreased with increasing distance from the coastline to land according to the cross correlation results when using the hourly tidal level as the input and the groundwater level as the output from july 1 31 2017 fig 9d the maximum cross correlation coefficient of the groundwater level at hd 1 was 0 90 attained after 1 h while the maximum value at hd 2 was 0 73 obtained after 2 h the water levels at hd 3 had the highest cross correlation of 0 23 obtained after 30 h while the maximum value at hd 4 was 0 04 attained after 6 h these observations indicated that the lag time increased and the cross coefficients decreased as the distance from the coastline to land increased which was due to differences in the tidal effect thus the groundwater levels at monitoring wells 1 and 2 which were relatively close to the coast were more sensitive to precipitation and tidal fluctuations while the groundwater levels at monitoring wells 3 and 4 were less affected in the eastern region of jeju island as the weather stations on jeju island are mainly located on the coastal shoreline there is a limit to the actual precipitation calculation around the inland groundwater wells therefore the low correlation coefficient between the groundwater level of inland wells hd 3 and 4 and the rainfall data is uncertain and requires further discussion contrary to the eastern regions some wells in the southern regions fig 7 with slightly high pc 2 loadings were not influenced by the tidal level because the low permeability seogwipo formation is located above sea level unlike other regions on jeju island however some slight seasonal variations in precipitation were observed therefore pc 2 the second variable which clarified the variations in groundwater level in 2017 was possibly related to a combination of precipitation and tidal effects in southern and eastern jeju island this finding that the recharge rate is affected by rainfall in the southern and eastern regions of jeju island is consistent with that from a previous study hagedorn et al 2011 the tidal effect on the eastern region of jeju island is also consistent with a previous study choi et al 1991 similarly various variables could affect the groundwater level and significant time and cost would be required to investigate each variable however pca can efficiently analyze large amounts of data and this tool can be used to rapidly and easily identify variables that affect groundwater levels 4 3 observed variables with the change in the monitoring time resolution when the temporal monitoring resolution changed from monthly to hourly the hourly data reflected more sensitive noise owing to fluctuations than the monthly data therefore the loading values of pcs 1 and 2 were scattered with various layouts fig 6 group ii which had a high pc 2 loading value was related to precipitation and tidal level herein we examined the change in the influencing variables of the groundwater level according to different time resolutions as shown in fig 6 the hourly groundwater level data for group ii were scattered in a location similar to the monthly precipitation data instead of the hourly data accumulated precipitation over a certain period might have affected the groundwater level more strongly than hourly rainfall as previously mentioned which is consistent with the fact that droughts progress slowly therefore the monitoring resolution can be lowered when analyzing the correlation between precipitation and groundwater to clearly confirm the correlation with macroscopic behavior in contrast the tidal level data were scattered in almost the same position as the hourly groundwater level data which indicated that the correlation between tides and groundwater was high in the hourly data thus the main observed variables that affected the groundwater level variations changed depending on the time resolution to date even though there are many individual studies using hourly daily and monthly groundwater level data winter et al 2000 gangopadhyay et al 2001 moon et al 2004 lewandowski et al 2009 page et al 2012 seferli et al 2019 few studies have investigated whether the observed variable that influences the groundwater level changes depending on the monitoring time resolution using the same water level data generally the higher the resolution of the data that affects the groundwater level the more accurate the monitoring of the groundwater level however the results of this study showed that this relationship might not be applicable depending on the specific data in contrast we examined the locations in which the variables that affected the groundwater level variations changed spatially according to the temporal resolution of monitoring in fig 7 the distributions of the pc loading values were similar regardless of the temporal resolution of the monitoring changes group i which had high pc 1 loading values in the northern and western regions and group ii which had high pc 2 loading values in the eastern and southern regions could be clearly distinguished locally except for some monitoring wells e g jd hm 1 was probably affected by the tidal level as a topographic cause however the loading values at some monitoring wells changed depending on the monitoring time resolution as the data resolution changed from monthly to hourly the largest changes in the pc 1 loading value occurred at jd sy 1 a decrease of 0 2278 and jd hm1 an increase of 0 2023 increase while those in pc 2 occurred at jw gy 1 a decrease of 0 2658 and jd hh an increase of 0 1770 additionally monitoring wells with large differences 0 15 in loading values as the resolution changes are indicated by dotted circles in fig 7 these monitoring wells were mainly distributed along the coast these results indicated that the monitoring wells along the coast were affected by more complex variables in terms of groundwater level variations than those located farther inland the monitoring wells whose pc 2 values changed significantly were affected by tides in such wells the groundwater level should be predicted by considering the effects of tides in addition to precipitation 5 conclusions we investigated the effects of a drought that occurred in 2017 on 116 monitoring wells operated by the jeju special self governing province through pca and correlation analysis from the pca results the pc scores were used to analyze temporal variations in groundwater level through the hydrograph pattern moreover the spatial distribution of pc loading values provided information for selecting index wells that were vulnerable to droughts the correlation analysis also showed a time difference in the response between the groundwater variations and influencing variables the main reason for the decline in groundwater level in 2017 was the reduced total water input caused by the low amount of precipitation and the increased amount of groundwater usage to compensate for these water shortages this tendency was more prominent in the northern part because of population expansion and tourist growth and in the western part because of agricultural demands the secondary influencing variables of the groundwater level variations in 2017 were related to seasonal precipitation and tidal effects groundwater level variations in the southern and eastern parts of jeju island reflected the seasonal variations however the tidal effects were slightly different in these regions in the eastern region the seogwipo formation low permeability layer is not well developed and the highly permeable basaltic layer is directly exposed to seawater thus the tidal level strongly influenced the groundwater level furthermore the southern regions are not influenced by tides because the low permeability seogwipo formation lies above sea level the scattering of the pc loading values showed that when the time resolution of the groundwater level data changed from monthly to daily and hourly the correlation with precipitation decreased while it increased with the tidal effect this result indicated that the main variables that influenced the groundwater level variations at each time resolution were different generally the higher the data resolution that affected the groundwater level the more accurate the groundwater level monitoring however the results of this study showed that this relationship might not be applicable depending on specific data such as precipitation the analysis results showed that the monthly rainfall was more closely correlated with the groundwater level than the hourly rainfall accumulated rainfall over a certain period had a higher effect on the groundwater level than the hourly rainfall and the drought in 2017 was caused by a long term decline in rainfall thus the monitoring resolution could be lowered to clearly identify the macroscopic behavior in the correlation between precipitation and groundwater additionally we examined the locations where the variables that affected the groundwater level variations changed spatially according to the monitoring time resolution monitoring wells with large loading values 0 15 were mainly distributed along the coast this result indicated that these monitoring wells along the coast were affected by more complex variables in terms of groundwater level variations than those located farther inland therefore this study demonstrated that pca could be used to efficiently summarize large groundwater level datasets in particular we identified the variables that affected the groundwater level through the indicators expressed in quantitative scores extracted the index wells that were vulnerable to droughts and emphasized the requirement for the intensive management of these wells therefore it is helpful to comprehensively develop the groundwater management plan and understand the hydrological processes of the entire jeju island during drought periods however this study has a limitation in that it is based on a one year dataset therefore it is necessary to confirm these conclusions by analyzing data corresponding to other years in future studies author statement h jung was responsible for the implementation of the reference collection processing and writing of the manuscript k ha d

8219,study region a volcanic island jeju island south korea study focus to predict and prepare for a drought the variables that affect groundwater level variations are better understood through groundwater monitoring networks in this study we analyzed various observational data including precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater usage tidal levels and groundwater levels to investigate the effects of historic droughts on groundwater level in a volcanic island in 2017 by using principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis new hydrological insights for the region based on the results of these analyses we can select index wells that are vulnerable to droughts this is demonstrated by the decrease in total water input caused by the low amount of precipitation and the increased groundwater usage to compensate for this water shortage this study indicated that pca could be a powerful tool for summarizing large datasets to select index wells that are vulnerable to droughts which would significantly reduce the expense of monitoring programs in addition we investigated whether the observed variables changed with the temporal resolution of the monitoring when the temporal resolution changed from monthly to daily and hourly groundwater level data the main variables that affected the groundwater level variations at each temporal resolution were different therefore it is helpful to comprehensively develop a groundwater management plan using statistical approaches with proper temporal monitoring resolution during drought keywords groundwater level drought multivariate statistical method principal component analysis temporal groundwater monitoring 1 introduction droughts are caused by a lack of rainfall over a long period leading to shortages of water resources such as surface water and groundwater peters et al 2006 compared with surface water resources groundwater may be highly vulnerable to persistent droughts because groundwater recharge may take much longer to recover with the occurrence of drought bloomfield and marchant 2013 furthermore the impact degree of the drought on the aquifer varies temporally and spatially depending on various variables peters et al 2006 van lanen et al 2013 han et al 2018 drought prediction is difficult and many studies have focused on understanding groundwater level variation influenced by drought using different available methods peters et al 2006 hughes et al 2012 van lanen et al 2013 han et al 2018 lee et al 2018 groundwater level monitoring provides the most fundamental information on the effects of hydrologic stresses on groundwater systems and is important for effectively evaluating the quantity and quality of groundwater and understanding the hydrological processes seferli et al 2019 however groundwater movement is subject to temporal variations thus all hydraulic head measurements at each well should be conducted approximately at the same time and the potentiometric surface maps represent only that specific time winter et al 1998 for large amounts of groundwater level data multivariate statistics such as principal component analysis pca are useful for determining the hydrographs of groundwater level patterns and temporal resolution in a large dataset winter et al 2000 in addition the spatial distribution of the hydrograph could be created by determining the affected extent of various variables related to groundwater level fluctuations at each individual well currently hydrographs and graphical plots that show groundwater level fluctuations over time are useful for examining temporal variations in groundwater levels moon et al 2004 geyer et al 2008 perennial streams rarely exist on the surface because of the highly permeable basaltic rock on the volcanic islands peterson 1972 therefore groundwater depletion is a serious problem as water resources depend on the groundwater in these areas toulier et al 2019 shuler et al 2021 in fact the coastal areas of jeju island provide approximately 92 of the water supply from groundwater for various purposes including drinking domestic use agriculture and industry kim et al 2003a b furthermore groundwater use on jeju island has rapidly increased because of the increasing population surface water irrigation usage and economic development el kadi et al 2014 a historic drought that occurred in 2017 severely influenced the groundwater level on jeju island causing it to reach its lowest groundwater level since observations began in 2001 the average groundwater level on jeju island in 2017 was 31 2 m above mean sea level which was 3 5 m lower than that in 2016 the annual precipitation on jeju island during the study period in 2017 was only 1396 mm this accounts for only 64 6 of the typical average annual rainfall over the last 12 y 2162 mm y korea meteorological administration 2018 over the past decade there have been many studies related to variations in groundwater levels on jeju island won 1994 koh 1997 won et al 2005 kim et al 2006 choi and lee 2009 hagedorn et al 2011 however limited research has been conducted on groundwater level variations under drought conditions using statistical methods therefore it has been difficult to develop a regional groundwater management plan for jeju island under drought conditions additionally recent studies have focused primarily on the long term monitoring of groundwater level from global climate change but short term groundwater level estimation and forecasting are more efficient approaches to prepare for drought occurrences from a management perspective apaydin 2010 yan et al 2018 the main purpose of this study was to examine the variation patterns of the groundwater level caused by the historic drought in 2017 and detect groundwater wells with similar patterns by using pca which is a type of multivariate statistical analysis based on this analysis we can understand the spatial distribution of various types of hydrographs within a study area to accomplish this we first analyzed the hydrological variables that affected the groundwater level and extracted the index wells that were vulnerable to droughts by mapping the variables precipitation tidal level and man induced pumping of freshwater in coastal wells this might quantitatively explain the groundwater level variations in each well and emphasize the requirement for intensive management of these wells we also investigated the changes in the influences on the groundwater level variations with temporal monitoring resolution monthly daily and hourly thus we aimed to establish an effective temporal monitoring resolution for each variable clarifying the groundwater level variation under drought conditions lastly we examined the correlation between the monthly groundwater level and rainfall data and that between hourly groundwater level and tidal level data 2 study area and data processing 2 1 description of the study area the study area is the volcanic jeju island 126 1 127 0 e and 33 1 33 6 n which is located approximately 140 km from the southern tip of the korean peninsula fig 1 a the island has an area of approximately 1825 km2 and a nearly elliptical shape with a major axis that is 73 km long mt halla lies in the central area of the island rising 1950 m above sea level and the island slopes down relatively gently from its summit to the east and west 3 to 5 whereas the northern and southern sides slope steeply 5 to 10 fig 1b as shown in fig 1b jeju island is largely divided into four parts east west south and north and subdivided into 12 watersheds aeweol jeju jocheon seogwi andeok namwon gujwa sungsan pyoseon daejeong hankyeong and hanlim presently 133 monitoring wells have been established on the island and each monitoring well is equipped with an automatic data logger which measures the hourly values for groundwater level water temperature and electrical conductivity ec fig 1b and c lee and kwon 2016 geological characteristics are also important because they affect groundwater level fluctuations as shown in fig 2 a the stratigraphic units of the island can be categorized into basement rocks granite and welded tuff u formations unconsolidated sediments the seogwipo formation conglomeratic sandstone sandstone sandy mudstone and mudstone with abundant bio clastic shells and basaltic and trachytic lavas yoon 1997 the basement that underlies the island consists of cretaceous welded tuff and granite that is covered by unconsolidated formations u formations lee and kwon 2016 these u formations are not related to volcanic activity and consist of uncemented sand and clay components with a thickness of approximately 150 m koh 1997 the seogwipo formation which is a relatively impermeable sedimentary layer lies above these u formations this layer is mainly distributed in the western northern and southern regions and the distribution depth is different for each region won 1994 koh 1997 specifically the seogwipo formation generally exists at 41 m and 28 m below sea level in the western and northern regions respectively and 16 m above sea level in the southern region koh and yon 1991 fig 2b and c however the seogwipo formation is not well developed on the eastern jeju island therefore the highly permeable basaltic layer is directly exposed to seawater increasing its vulnerability to saline water intrusion koh and yon 1991 the seogwipo formation is an aquitard that prevents recharged rainwater from infiltrating below the layer hahn et al 1997 koh 1997 kim et al 2003a b won et al 2005 consequently the characteristics of groundwater occurrences on jeju island are largely controlled by the spatial distribution of the seogwipo formation hahn et al 1997 koh 1997 koh and yon 1991 won et al 2005 although groundwater wells on the jeju island mainly penetrate almost unconfined aquifers in the basaltic rock some wells exhibit the characteristics of a confined aquifer in the seogwipo formation koh et al 2006 the hydrogeological characteristics of groundwater systems on the jeju island cannot be easily understood because various basaltic and trachytic lavas act as channels owing to the prolonged volcanic activity shin and hwang 2020 the climate of jeju island is characterized by hot and humid summers and cool and dry winters due to the east asian monsoon won et al 2005 in summer the southeasterly monsoon from june to september transports moist air from the west pacific and the east china sea and causes abundant precipitation normally 2162 mm y over the island and the korean peninsula korea meteorological administration 2018 however during the study period in 2017 the annual precipitation was only 1396 mm which represents the lowest precipitation over 12 y in particular the local precipitation was 773 mm at jeju city station in the north the lowest since 1961 1334 mm at seogwipo station in the south 861 mm at gosan station in the west and 1918 mm at sungsan station in the east korea meteorological administration 2018 this precipitation discrepancy in these four regions was caused by the orographic effects of mt halla thus the annual precipitation in the southern and eastern areas seogwipo and sungsan were twice as large as those in the northern and western areas jeju city and gosan won et al 2005 2 2 data acquisition all groundwater facilities on the island are exclusively managed by the jeju special self governing province and the island has operated an independent groundwater monitoring network since 1991 lee et al 2016 groundwater data for 133 monitoring wells in operation are publicly available through a website www jejuwater go kr in this study we used groundwater level data from 116 monitoring wells among the 133 monitoring wells in 2017 the remaining 17 monitoring wells were not included in this study because of data loss from long term observations this study used water input runoff and evapotranspiration data from jeju island over 12 y which was released by the water policy bureau of jeju special self governing province precipitation data were acquired from the korea meteorological association kma of the main weather stations which are located in four different parts and river basins of the island jeju north seogwipo south gosan west and sungsan east fig 1b in addition groundwater usage data obtained from the jeju research institute and k water were used finally tidal level data were obtained from the korea hydrographic and oceanographic agency khoa four tidal level monitoring stations are located in the island at jeju north moseulpo southwest gosan west and sungsanpo east 3 statistical methods 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the estimated drought can be represented by the standardized precipitation index spi which is characterized by meteorological data for various time scales from 1 to 36 mon when using monthly input data mckee et al 1993 and 1995 to compute the spi historic rainfall data for independent rainfall events at each station were fitted to a gamma probability distribution function as follows 1 g x 1 β α τ α x α 1 e x β where α 0 is the shape parameter β 0 is a scale parameter x 0 is the amount of precipitation and g x is the probability of precipitation being equal to a value x mckee et al 1993 and 1995 the name of the indicator usually includes the accumulation period in this study the research period is one year therefore it is appropriate to use an indicator for 12 mon spi 12 according to the extent of drought in jeju island the spi 12 for jeju city northern regions and seogwipo southern regions were 2 12 extremely dry 1 45 moderately dry respectively korea meteorological administration 2018 hence most of jeju island experienced a drought in 2017 particularly the northern region which was under extreme drought causing the groundwater level to continuously decrease during the 12 mon period in 2017 3 2 principal component analysis pca this study utilized principal component analysis pca to investigate the variables that affect groundwater level fluctuations and classify the variation patterns of groundwater level data from 116 monitoring wells pca is a multivariate statistical procedure used to reduce the number of variables and reveal the existing patterns in a large dataset stetzenbach et al 1999 winter et al 2000 lee et al 2008 page et al 2012 pca quantifies the relationship between variables by computing the correlation matrix for the entire dataset winter et al 2000 the correlation matrix is decomposed into a score matrix and a loading matrix by calculating and scaling the eigenvectors and eigenvalues see fig 3 winter et al 2000 mutually independent axes that describe the dataset can be derived by using these two matrices meglen 1991 their results are plotted in a bivariate graph which uses the scores of the first two principal components as axes to identify the influencing variables of groundwater level variations this method is a more convenient approach for combining temporal and spatial dimensions in the analysis and can be used to identify the performance of wells to elucidate any temporal variations in the groundwater level winter et al 2000 gangopadhyay et al 2001 moon et al 2004 lewandowski et al 2009 page et al 2012 seferli et al 2019 the general form of the equation to compute scores for the first component created in principal component analysis is as follows winter et al 2000 2 c 1 b 11 x 1 b 12 x 2 b 1 p x p where c1 is the subject s score for principal component 1 pc 1 the first component extracted b11 b12 b1p are the regression coefficients or weights for the observed variables 1 2 p which are used to create pc 1 and xp1 x2 xp are the subject s scores with the observed variables 1 2 p component scores derived through these processes are helpful in interpreting the various temporal variations in groundwater level pattern for each principal component winter et al 2000 seferli et al 2019 component loadings are correlation coefficients between the groundwater level variables and each principal component of the monitoring well groundwater levels were classified into two groups according to the component loadings the component loading value is also useful for representing the variables of groundwater level variation through quantitative scores in each well winter et al 2000 page et al 2012 pca has been commonly used to extract the dominating variables and patterns from large water level datasets winter et al 2000 lewandowski et al 2009 ko et al 2010 page et al 2012 seferli et al 2019 winter et al 2000 studied the pattern in hydrographs and selected index wells using a pca on substantial water level data of four lake areas in the united states gangopadhyay et al 2001 analyzed the temporal variations and selected the wells representing the potentiometric head distribution on the chao phraya river in thailand bangkok moon et al 2004 classified groundwater hydrograph types and estimated the groundwater recharge ratio from the accumulated rainfall amount using pca from groundwater level data in south korea lewandowski et al 2009 applied pca to time series water level data to study the relationship between the temporal variation of water level and river stage of the floodplain for the lowland river spree in berlin germany page et al 2012 conducted pca for continuously measured time series data groundwater head electrical conductivity and temperature to identify indicator wells and derive indicator parameters for a study area in northwest switzerland recently seferli et al 2019 used pca to interpret the areal distribution of various types of groundwater level fluctuation patterns and to identify certain target wells for managing water abstraction within large groups of monitoring wells in the west thessaly basin greece thus pca could be considered as a powerful tool to interpret the water level pattern and select index wells from water level data through these previous studies however pca using water level measurements did not lead to any profound new insights into the factors that could be determined from the conventional analysis of groundwater hydrographs winter et al 2000 furthermore time series data are significantly different from ordinary independent data and when the main objective of pca is descriptive not inferential complications such as non independence do not seriously affect this objective jolliffe 2002 despite the limitations of pca this method analyzed the hydrographs as efficient objective and reproducible winter et al 2000 for pca analysis we created n by m n m groundwater level dataset matrices for the hourly daily and monthly groundwater levels on jeju island m is the number of monitoring observations and n is the number of measurements varies with the time resolution in this study we aimed to evaluate whether the variables influencing the observed groundwater level fluctuation changed with the different monitoring time resolutions hence the pca was conducted for three different time resolutions the hourly dataset comprising n 8760 water level data measurements daily dataset comprising n 365 data and the monthly dataset comprising n 12 data from m 116 wells the datasets had to be completed to avoid missing values because the pca procedure requires a full matrix of data meglen 1991 however if a few wells were not measured on a given day because of meteorological phenomena or machine malfunctions the missing data were obtained with a linear filter for short term outcomes we used the statistical package program jmp sas institute cary north carolina to identify the component scores and loadings that reflected the underlying correlation structure of the data recently dynamic variable analysis dfa which is an alternative to pca has become a useful tool for detecting common patterns in a set of time series data and determining the relationships between these observations and explanatory variables zuur et al 2003 the application of dfa has been suggested in the cases where the data of hydrological time series are not independent of each other zuur et al 2003 muñoz carpena et al 2005 kuo and chang 2010 trásy et al 2020 therefore dfa could be a useful analysis method to interpret the water level of wells in the same aquifers with mutually dependent characteristics the variation characteristics of the groundwater level reflect heterogeneous coastal aquifers depending on each region of jeju island thus it may not be appropriate to use dfa for the water level data for the entire jeju island such as in our study 3 3 correlation analysis of the time series early applications of statistical hydrology were restricted to surface water problems mccuen 2003 however the statistical domain of hydrology has broadened to encompass problems related to both surface water and groundwater resources machiwal and jha 2006 thus presently time series is a powerful tool for forecasting groundwater levels in wells rennolls et al 1980 graham and tankersley 1993 bierkens et al 2001 two types of correlations exist depending on whether the signals considered for the correlation are the same or different auto correlation and cross correlation auto correlation analysis is a type of correlation in which the given data series are usually correlated with a time shifted version of itself montgomery et al 2008 the usual estimate of the auto covariance function c k is as follows 3 c k γ ˆ k 1 t t 1 t k y t y y t k y k 0 1 2 k where γ k is the covariance between y t and y t k k is the lag time t is the length of the time series yt is a single event in time and y is the average of the events montgomery et al 2008 the auto correlation function r k is estimated using the sample auto correlation function as follows 4 r k ρ ˆ k c k c 0 k 0 1 2 k where ρ k is the auto correlation coefficient at lag k montgomery et al 2008 the auto correlation analysis calculates the linear dependency of variables over time intervals and the memory effect for example an event such as a storm or rainfall has a long term effect on the time series of each groundwater well and the auto correlation function r k shows a gently decreasing slope and nonzero value over a long time lag kim and lee 2017 in contrast cross correlation analysis has been used to estimate the degree to which two different time series input and output are correlated kim et al 2005 the cross covariance coefficient at lag k is given by 5 c x y 1 t t 1 t k x t x y t k y k 0 1 2 1 t t k 1 t y t y x t k x k 1 2 where x and y are the input and output time series respectively montgomery et al 2008 the definition of a cross correlation function r x y is as follows 6 r x y c x y c x x 0 c y y 0 k 0 1 2 where c x x and c y y are the individual covariances montgomery et al 2008 the cross correlation function r x y corresponds to the impulse response of the system if the input time series is random if r x y 0 for k 0 the input for example rainfall or tidal level influences the output for example groundwater level and if r x y 0 for k 0 the output influences the input delay was defined as the lag time the lag time with the maximum correlation value indicates how fast the event propagates to the output signal and the correlation value r ranges between 1 0 and 1 0 yaffee and mcgee 2000 in this study the cross correlation function was used to inspect the relationship between tidal and groundwater level fluctuations 4 results and discussion 4 1 general variation patterns of the groundwater level groundwater level variations on jeju island are influenced by various variables i e precipitation evapotranspiration tidal level and man induced pumping of freshwater in coastal wells and the extent to which they are affected varies regionally kim et al 2006 won et al 2005 hagedorn et al 2011 fig 4 a shows the water balance analysis of jeju island from 2006 to 2017 https water jeju go kr the average water balance analysis of jeju island revealed that the total amount of water input 3930 hm3 y 100 comprises evapotranspiration 1375 hm3 y 34 99 runoff 925 hm3 y 23 54 and groundwater recharge 1630 hm3 y 41 47 for 12 y from 2006 to 2017 to investigate the relationship of the groundwater recharge rate with the groundwater level it is important to examine the variations in water balance components the total water input to jeju island by precipitation recorded the lowest value of 2552 hm3 in 2017 which was far below the average value of 3930 hm3 in the last 12 y fig 4a although the total water input was lower than the typical volume owing to a severe drought in 2017 the amount of actual evapotranspiration was 1321 hm3 which is similar to the average volume of 1375 hm3 in the last 12 y fig 4a meanwhile the amount of runoff was 387 hm3 in 2017 which was the second lowest value after that in 2013 385 hm3 based on these data the recharge rate water input direct runoff evapotranspiration was 844 hm3 in 2017 which was the lowest value since 2006 therefore the decrease in the water input due to the decrease in precipitation caused a shortage of water resources on jeju island which is highly dependent on groundwater resources in general the precipitation on jeju island is concentrated in the summer monsoon june to august and summer rainfall comprises half of the total annual precipitation however in 2017 the precipitation during the same period summer was 552 5 mm fig 4b or 70 7 of the normal precipitation level 781 1 mm in addition the number of days with precipitation 0 1 mm in 2017 was 26 which was the third lowest since the first weather observations were recorded in 1973 korea meteorological administration 2018 to elucidate the variations in groundwater level with comprehensive information we conducted pca with three different time resolutions monthly daily and hourly two principal components were extracted for each time resolution which explained 84 monthly 79 daily and 72 hourly of the total variations the eigenvalues of the first principal component pc 1 and second principal component pc 2 were slightly different for each time resolution in terms of the variance of pc 1 and pc 2 the values were 1 54 and 30 respectively for the monthly groundwater level 2 51 and 28 respectively for the daily groundwater level and 3 50 and 23 respectively for the hourly groundwater level the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues as a percentage of pc 1 and pc 2 decreased from monthly to daily and from daily to hourly resolution and the variation in monthly data could be clarified by pc 1 and pc 2 the noise of the hourly data was reduced because the daily and monthly data were average values obtained from the hourly data as shown in fig 5 the hydrographs of the component scores for pcs 1 and 2 which are graphical representations of each variation in the data had different patterns except during heavy rainfall events in august and october fig 5a the score hydrograph for pc 1 decreased gradually implying that variables other than seasonal precipitation affected the groundwater level fluctuations in contrast the score hydrograph for pc 2 reflects seasonal precipitation fig 5b as the temporal resolution changed the variation patterns of the score hydrographs for pc 1 did not differ significantly fig 5a but the score hydrographs for pc 2 showed that the amplitude of the hourly groundwater level fluctuations was larger than those of the monthly and daily datasets fig 5b this result indicated that the observed variables at each time resolution might be different for pc 2 4 2 classification of groundwater level variations we divided the monitoring wells into two groups based on the loading values of pcs 1 and 2 to identify the main variables of the groundwater level variations in each group on one hand wells that had higher loadings on pc l 0 8 and lower loadings on pc 2 0 2 were designated as group i at the lower right side of the diagram fig 6 on the other hand wells that had higher loadings on pc 2 0 8 and lower loadings on pc l 0 2 at the upper left side of the diagram were designated as group ii to explore the variables that influenced the groundwater level in each group and the influence of these variables on the groundwater level under different temporal resolutions we selected six index wells the index wells were composed of two for each time resolution monthly daily and hourly with the highest loading value for pcs 1 and 2 after pca of the 116 monitoring wells table 1 the loading values quantify the extent to which each monitoring well contributes to the groundwater level variations therefore a well with a high loading value better represents groundwater level variations in this study the index wells in group i with the highest pc 1 loadings fig 5c from each time resolution were jr hg1 monthly and daily and jr eu1 hourly and those in group ii with the highest pc 2 loadings were jw pd monthly jd sd2 daily and jd sd1 hourly based on the spatial distributions of both loadings for pcs 1 and 2 at each monitoring well the values are visually shown on a map of jeju island including the volume of groundwater usage fig 7 group i is mainly located in the northern and western regions of jeju island pc 1 0 8 and pc 2 0 2 the groundwater level of the index wells colored circle surrounded by white dotted circles in this group showed low seasonality during the study period fig 5c shows the groundwater level variations of the index wells in group i jr hg1 monthly and daily and jr eu1 hourly with the highest pc 1 loadings at each time resolution and daily precipitation data at the nearby jeju weather station for 2017 the volume of groundwater usage on jeju island in 2017 was 243 hm3 an increase of 17 7 compared to 2016 and most of them were domestic 58 4 and agricultural 40 1 water the volume of domestic water consumption was the largest in the jeju watershed in the northern part of the island because the airport and accommodations were concentrated there the volume of agricultural water consumption was the largest in the aewol watershed in the northern part of the island in addition the monthly groundwater consumption in 2017 increased in the summer which might be due to the increase in tourists during the peak season fig 8 a in fact from 2006 to 2017 the correlation between the amount of precipitation in jeju weather station and the amount of groundwater usage of jeju si in the northern region showed a negative relationship correlation coefficient r 0 56 this inverse variation between precipitation and the amount of groundwater usage was also observed between 2012 and 2013 figs 4a and 8b when the precipitation in 2012 was 2831 mm the volume of groundwater usage was 141 hm3 but when precipitation decreased in 2013 the volume of groundwater usage increased sharply to 202 hm3 1531 mm therefore an increase in the amount of groundwater usage could depress the groundwater level and lead to the intensification of droughts alley et al 1999 galloway and riley 1999 faunt et al 2009 and 2015 wada et al 2010 russo and lall 2017 moreover from 2006 to 2017 the correlation between the amount of groundwater usage of jeju si and groundwater level in jr hg 1 which is one of the index wells in group i and located in the northern region showed a negative relationship r 0 561 this phenomenon was particularly evident in the northern and western parts of the island because the precipitation was relatively low in the northern and western parts of the island 861 mm at gosan station and 773 mm at jeju station than in the southern and eastern parts 1334 mm at seogwipo station and 1918 mm at sungsan station moreover in the northern part the amount of groundwater usage in the jeju and aewol watersheds accounted for 61 of the total groundwater consumption in 2017 because of the high consumption of domestic water by concentrated tourism facilities around the airport and the population in the northern part of the island in the western part of this island the consumption of agricultural water in 2017 was more than twice that of domestic water which would have reduced the groundwater level based on these results pc 1 the first major variable which demonstrated a decline in groundwater level in 2017 is related to the decreased total water input caused by the low amount of precipitation and the increased amount of groundwater usage to compensate for these water shortages fig 7e group ii was mainly located in the eastern and southern parts of jeju island fig 7 pc 1 0 8 and pc 2 0 2 fig 5d shows the groundwater level variation at index wells in group ii jw pd monthly jd sd2 daily and jd sd1 hourly and daily precipitation data for 2017 from the sungsan weather station which is located in the eastern part the groundwater levels of the index wells in group ii fig 5d showed seasonal variations and the amplitude of the hourly groundwater levels was larger than that of group i fig 5c this variation was similar to the hydrograph score trend for pc 2 fig 5b on jeju island geologically the seogwipo formation low permeability layer is not well developed in the eastern region and the highly permeable basaltic layer is directly exposed to seawater therefore the tide directly influences fluctuations in the groundwater level choi et al 1991 to examine whether rainfall and tide actually affect the groundwater level variation in group ii wells correlation analysis was performed on rainfall tide and groundwater levels in the eastern region the rainfall and tide data used in the analysis were obtained from the sungsan station located in the eastern part of jeju island figs 4b 5d and 9a groundwater level data were used for the jd hd 1 2 3 and 4 wells hereafter hd 1 2 3 and 4 located in the handong district fig 7f a seawater intrusion monitoring well with a high pc 2 loading value for hourly data fig 9 b the distance from the coast line to inland gradually increased to 0 9 km 2 5 km 5 2 km and 8 8 km from the coast line to jd hd 1 2 3 and 4 respectively kim et al 2006 according to the auto correlation function the hourly rainfall rapidly reached a null value fig 9c indicating the uncorrelated nature of hourly rainfall because rainfall events occur episodically for each event in contrast the auto correlation function for the tidal level showed two sinusoidal patterns on each day implying that the tidal level had a strong inter relationship with a constant period fig 9c for the groundwater levels at hd 1 2 3 and 4 the auto correlation functions revealed two different characteristics first the auto correlation functions of hd 1 and hd 2 exhibited repeated sinusoidal behaviors on each day which were similar to those for the tidal level second the auto correlation functions of hd 3 and hd 4 decreased slowly and linearly this result implied that the tidal and groundwater levels at hd 1 and hd 2 had a strong linear inter relationship and were subjected to a periodically changing source but the groundwater level at hd 3 and hd 4 had longer memory effects according to the cross correlation results when using the monthly rainfall as the input and the groundwater level as the output in 2017 the maximum cross correlation coefficients of the groundwater level at hd 1 2 3 and 4 were 0 754 0 750 0 516 and 0 247 respectively this result indicated that the eastern coastal region of jeju island was considerably affected by rainfall and this influence decreased with increasing distance from the coastline to land according to the cross correlation results when using the hourly tidal level as the input and the groundwater level as the output from july 1 31 2017 fig 9d the maximum cross correlation coefficient of the groundwater level at hd 1 was 0 90 attained after 1 h while the maximum value at hd 2 was 0 73 obtained after 2 h the water levels at hd 3 had the highest cross correlation of 0 23 obtained after 30 h while the maximum value at hd 4 was 0 04 attained after 6 h these observations indicated that the lag time increased and the cross coefficients decreased as the distance from the coastline to land increased which was due to differences in the tidal effect thus the groundwater levels at monitoring wells 1 and 2 which were relatively close to the coast were more sensitive to precipitation and tidal fluctuations while the groundwater levels at monitoring wells 3 and 4 were less affected in the eastern region of jeju island as the weather stations on jeju island are mainly located on the coastal shoreline there is a limit to the actual precipitation calculation around the inland groundwater wells therefore the low correlation coefficient between the groundwater level of inland wells hd 3 and 4 and the rainfall data is uncertain and requires further discussion contrary to the eastern regions some wells in the southern regions fig 7 with slightly high pc 2 loadings were not influenced by the tidal level because the low permeability seogwipo formation is located above sea level unlike other regions on jeju island however some slight seasonal variations in precipitation were observed therefore pc 2 the second variable which clarified the variations in groundwater level in 2017 was possibly related to a combination of precipitation and tidal effects in southern and eastern jeju island this finding that the recharge rate is affected by rainfall in the southern and eastern regions of jeju island is consistent with that from a previous study hagedorn et al 2011 the tidal effect on the eastern region of jeju island is also consistent with a previous study choi et al 1991 similarly various variables could affect the groundwater level and significant time and cost would be required to investigate each variable however pca can efficiently analyze large amounts of data and this tool can be used to rapidly and easily identify variables that affect groundwater levels 4 3 observed variables with the change in the monitoring time resolution when the temporal monitoring resolution changed from monthly to hourly the hourly data reflected more sensitive noise owing to fluctuations than the monthly data therefore the loading values of pcs 1 and 2 were scattered with various layouts fig 6 group ii which had a high pc 2 loading value was related to precipitation and tidal level herein we examined the change in the influencing variables of the groundwater level according to different time resolutions as shown in fig 6 the hourly groundwater level data for group ii were scattered in a location similar to the monthly precipitation data instead of the hourly data accumulated precipitation over a certain period might have affected the groundwater level more strongly than hourly rainfall as previously mentioned which is consistent with the fact that droughts progress slowly therefore the monitoring resolution can be lowered when analyzing the correlation between precipitation and groundwater to clearly confirm the correlation with macroscopic behavior in contrast the tidal level data were scattered in almost the same position as the hourly groundwater level data which indicated that the correlation between tides and groundwater was high in the hourly data thus the main observed variables that affected the groundwater level variations changed depending on the time resolution to date even though there are many individual studies using hourly daily and monthly groundwater level data winter et al 2000 gangopadhyay et al 2001 moon et al 2004 lewandowski et al 2009 page et al 2012 seferli et al 2019 few studies have investigated whether the observed variable that influences the groundwater level changes depending on the monitoring time resolution using the same water level data generally the higher the resolution of the data that affects the groundwater level the more accurate the monitoring of the groundwater level however the results of this study showed that this relationship might not be applicable depending on the specific data in contrast we examined the locations in which the variables that affected the groundwater level variations changed spatially according to the temporal resolution of monitoring in fig 7 the distributions of the pc loading values were similar regardless of the temporal resolution of the monitoring changes group i which had high pc 1 loading values in the northern and western regions and group ii which had high pc 2 loading values in the eastern and southern regions could be clearly distinguished locally except for some monitoring wells e g jd hm 1 was probably affected by the tidal level as a topographic cause however the loading values at some monitoring wells changed depending on the monitoring time resolution as the data resolution changed from monthly to hourly the largest changes in the pc 1 loading value occurred at jd sy 1 a decrease of 0 2278 and jd hm1 an increase of 0 2023 increase while those in pc 2 occurred at jw gy 1 a decrease of 0 2658 and jd hh an increase of 0 1770 additionally monitoring wells with large differences 0 15 in loading values as the resolution changes are indicated by dotted circles in fig 7 these monitoring wells were mainly distributed along the coast these results indicated that the monitoring wells along the coast were affected by more complex variables in terms of groundwater level variations than those located farther inland the monitoring wells whose pc 2 values changed significantly were affected by tides in such wells the groundwater level should be predicted by considering the effects of tides in addition to precipitation 5 conclusions we investigated the effects of a drought that occurred in 2017 on 116 monitoring wells operated by the jeju special self governing province through pca and correlation analysis from the pca results the pc scores were used to analyze temporal variations in groundwater level through the hydrograph pattern moreover the spatial distribution of pc loading values provided information for selecting index wells that were vulnerable to droughts the correlation analysis also showed a time difference in the response between the groundwater variations and influencing variables the main reason for the decline in groundwater level in 2017 was the reduced total water input caused by the low amount of precipitation and the increased amount of groundwater usage to compensate for these water shortages this tendency was more prominent in the northern part because of population expansion and tourist growth and in the western part because of agricultural demands the secondary influencing variables of the groundwater level variations in 2017 were related to seasonal precipitation and tidal effects groundwater level variations in the southern and eastern parts of jeju island reflected the seasonal variations however the tidal effects were slightly different in these regions in the eastern region the seogwipo formation low permeability layer is not well developed and the highly permeable basaltic layer is directly exposed to seawater thus the tidal level strongly influenced the groundwater level furthermore the southern regions are not influenced by tides because the low permeability seogwipo formation lies above sea level the scattering of the pc loading values showed that when the time resolution of the groundwater level data changed from monthly to daily and hourly the correlation with precipitation decreased while it increased with the tidal effect this result indicated that the main variables that influenced the groundwater level variations at each time resolution were different generally the higher the data resolution that affected the groundwater level the more accurate the groundwater level monitoring however the results of this study showed that this relationship might not be applicable depending on specific data such as precipitation the analysis results showed that the monthly rainfall was more closely correlated with the groundwater level than the hourly rainfall accumulated rainfall over a certain period had a higher effect on the groundwater level than the hourly rainfall and the drought in 2017 was caused by a long term decline in rainfall thus the monitoring resolution could be lowered to clearly identify the macroscopic behavior in the correlation between precipitation and groundwater additionally we examined the locations where the variables that affected the groundwater level variations changed spatially according to the monitoring time resolution monitoring wells with large loading values 0 15 were mainly distributed along the coast this result indicated that these monitoring wells along the coast were affected by more complex variables in terms of groundwater level variations than those located farther inland therefore this study demonstrated that pca could be used to efficiently summarize large groundwater level datasets in particular we identified the variables that affected the groundwater level through the indicators expressed in quantitative scores extracted the index wells that were vulnerable to droughts and emphasized the requirement for the intensive management of these wells therefore it is helpful to comprehensively develop the groundwater management plan and understand the hydrological processes of the entire jeju island during drought periods however this study has a limitation in that it is based on a one year dataset therefore it is necessary to confirm these conclusions by analyzing data corresponding to other years in future studies author statement h jung was responsible for the implementation of the reference collection processing and writing of the manuscript k ha d
