18080,biofouling is the undesired deposition and growth of microorganisms on surfaces forming biofilms the definition is subjective and operational not every biofilm causes biofouling only if a given a subjective threshold of interference is exceeded biofilms cause technical or medical problems these range from the formation of slime layers on ship hulls or in pipelines which increase friction resistance to separation membranes on which biofilms increase hydraulic resistance to heat exchangers where they interfere with heat transport to contamination of treated water by eroded biofilm cells which may comprise hygienically relevant microorganisms and most dangerous to biofilms on implants and catheters which can cause persistent infections the largest fraction of anti fouling research usually in short term experiments is focused on prevention or limiting primary microbial adhesion intuitively this appears only logical but turns out mostly hopeless this is because in technical systems with open access for microorganisms all surfaces are colonized sooner or later which explains the very limited success of that research as a result the use of biocides remains the major tool to fight persistent biofilms however this is costly in terms of biocides it stresses working materials causes off time and environmental damage and it usually leaves large parts of biofilms in place ready for regrowth in order to really solve biofouling problems it is necessary to learn how to live with biofilms and mitigate their detrimental effects this requires rather an integrated strategy than aiming to invent one shot solutions in this context it helps to understand the biofilm way of life as a natural phenomenon biofilms are the oldest most successful and most widely distributed form of life on earth existing even in extreme environments and being highly resilient microorganisms in biofilms live in a self produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps which allows them to develop emerging properties such as enhanced nutrient acquisition synergistic microconsortia enhanced tolerance to biocides and antibiotics intense intercellular communication and cooperation transiently immobilized biofilm organisms turn their matrix into an external digestion system by retaining complexed exoenzymes in the matrix biofilms grow even on traces of any biodegradable material therefore an effective anti fouling strategy comprises to keep the system low in nutrients good housekeeping employing low fouling easy to clean surfaces monitoring of biofilm development allowing for early intervention and acknowledging that cleaning can be more important than trying to kill biofilms because cleaning does not cut the nutrient supply of survivors and dead biomass serves as an additional carbon source for cannibalizing survivors supporting rapid after growth an integrated concept is presented as the result of a long journey of the author through biofouling problems graphical abstract image 1 stockholm syndrome psychological response wherein a captive begins to identify closely with his or her captors as well as with their agenda and demands keywords biofouling biofilms anti fouling holistic approach 1 how it started after my ph d at the max planck institute for immunobiology in freiburg germany i was hired in april 1978 at the institute for sanitary engineering water quality and solid waste management of the university of stuttgart in the department of chemistry my project was about the microbial contamination of pure and ultrapure water upon treatment with ion exchangers flemming 1987 the problem was termed biofouling and caused considerable problems microbial contamination turned out to be the cause for occasional hygienic objections in drinking and brewing water water for pharmaceutical use and for failures of electronic microchips who had to be rinsed with ultrapure water during the process of printing electrical circuits bacteria lead to shortcuts and painful loss of finished chips as the cells would act as conductive particles due to their water content this limited the use of ion exchangers for production of ultrapure water as an alternative to much costlier distillation flemming 1987 in hindsight it was obvious to look at the surfaces as sources for the contaminations but at that time late 70 ies early 80 ies scientific approaches concentrated rather on the water phase sure enough it turned out that ion exchanger resin beds hosted nests of microbial colonies on ion resin surfaces and it could be demonstrated that they were recalcitrant against disinfection led to microbial regrowth and recurring contamination of the treated water flemming 1981 1987 great hope was put on the effect of the bacteriostatic effect of traces of silver ions as provided e g by silver coated resins to my bigdisappointment silver coating did not help to solve the problem after few weeks silver tolerant populations emerged flemming 1982 but the silver resin beads generated by loading the cation exchanger with silver ions and reducing the silver by ascorbic acid and looked very beautiful i took my children to the lab and they were mystified by silver making but later excessive consumption of silver salt without valid justification was harshly critizised another alternative to distillation was the employment of reverse osmosis technology but membrane technology also experienced biofouling its achilles heel flemming et al 1997 biofouling was defined as development of a biofilm consisting of microorganisms and their products characklis and cooksey 1983 i e the unwanted deposition and growth of microorganisms on surfaces thus biofouling is an effect of biofilm presence and growth clearly a biofilm problem it was just one of four types of fouling the others were mineral fouling scaling organic fouling and particle fouling epstein 1981 and usually more than one of them was involved in fouling cases microbial biofouling is observed in a very wide spectrum of technical and medical fields and causes very diverse problems table 1 provides an idea of the dimensions 2 the costs of biofouling the funding for my research was triggered by the costly damage caused by biofouling however although being a common phenomenon in many different fields see table 1 there is very little quantitative data about the overall costs admittedly it is difficult to assess the global biofouling related costs because they are caused by a number of various factors from interference with process performance decrease of product quality and quantity to material damage by microbial attack which even can include minerals organic polymers flemming 2010 or metals microbially influenced corrosion mic little and lee 2014 preventive overdosing of biocides and cleaners and finally most expensive interruptions of production processes and shortened life time of plant components due to extended cleaning an additional matter of expense is caused by the treatment of wastewater contaminated by anti fouling chemicals biofilms cause monumental costs in the health system considering that about 80 of human bacterial infections are biofilm associated r√∂mling and balsobre 2012 but looking at the economically healthy anti fouling industry which offers everything from anti fouling surfaces and materials biocides cleaners and consulting services illuminates the economical dimension this market is worth billions of dollars annually worldwide biofouling generates a safe and continous business because biofilms cannot be erased once and forever three examples may illustrate the economic dimensions of biofouling i membrane biofouling the costs of biofouling have been estimated in the membrane treatment system at water factory 21 orange county to 30 of the operating costs at that time about 750 000 per year ridgway and flemming 1996 this rate has not much changed since flemming 2011 the estimate considered not only on the costs for membrane cleaning itself and labour costs but also down time during cleaning pre treatment costs including biocides and other additives an increased energy demand due to higher transmembrane and feed brine hydrodynamic resistance and shortened lifetime of the membranes reportedly to avoid excessive cleaning biofouled membrane systems are frequently operated outside the manufacturer s warrantee condition of less than 15 increase of the normalized pressure drop increase over the total installation between cleanings vrouwenvelder et al 2011 interestingly it is the eps which contribute to the hydrodynamic effects not the cells embedded in the biofilm they generate the bulk of the hydrodynamic resistance vrouwenvelder et al 2016 derlon et al 2016 this indicates that killing the cells alone will not help sanitizing membrane fouling biofilms in a case study the author was involved in treatment of seawater for injection into oilfields for replacement of the oil was performed by nanofiltration membranes the client reported due to biofouling membrane life is reduced from three to one year so over the life of the plant the cost of membrane replacement will be increased by a factor of 3 if it is taken into account that each membrane costs 2500 and each plant has around 700 membranes one can easily calculate a yearly investment cost of 1 75 million instead of 0 58 million that means an extra cost of 1 17 million a year just for membrane replacement but this can easily increase significantly if man hours involved in replacements filters and piping replacement cost fees paid to the client for downtimes loss of water quality and further factors are taken into account such cost assessments even if crude reflect how complex and essentially arbitrary any numbers are but they show one thing for certain that they are high further but rarely acknowledged biofouling related costs arise from interrupted water production missing contractual requirements ii paper production in paper production biofouling can cause substantial problems in production and paper quality flemming et al 2013 b losses are arise from of a number of complex scenarios including direct damage by biofouling holes breaks malodor and microbial contamination the cost of controlling biofouling biocides dispersants cleaners etc downtime during slime related cleaning and eventually the loss of product quantity and or quality it has been estimated that us 1 2 5 per tonne of produced paper are spent on antimicrobials biodispersants and cleaning chemicals during production nalco unpublished contaminated raw materials and additives contribute to biofouling damage paper is made primarily from cellulose fibers but it also contains various amounts of a variety of additives eg calcium carbonate or titanium dioxide microbial contamination can lead to graying of mineral pigment slurries and to the formation of malodorous metabolites that cannot be sanitized this has been observed in tanks in railroad wagons after extended stay and can amount according to the volume of the tank to losses of several us 10 000 per tank of ca 100 m3 deficient products or batches of microbially deteriorated additives such as starch or pigments can account for losses in the range of several us 10 000 per batch the costs for preserving mineral pigments against microbial contamination range between us 2 3 per tonne the practical experience of the authors flemming et al 2013 b has shown that microbial spoilage and degradation of dispersants can lead to viscosity changes which may result in the plugging of jet coaters or scratches in the coating when coating agglomerates become trapped on the coating blade microbial spoilage and degradation of binders can have a negative impact on product quality although paper makers understand the economic benefits associated with deposit control they tend to overlook spoilage of additives and fibers because it is often difficult to detect directly ignoring these processes can be costly and environmentally risky and can present a direct safety hazard for example when explosive gases such as h2 or methane or toxic ones such as h2s are generated by microbial activity and have led reportedly to accidents flemming et al 2013 b the biggest cost factors associated with slime formation in paper production are downtime and cleaning costs much of the cost is the result of breakdowns caused by lumps of slime dropping onto the moving screen on which the water is separated from the pulp and causing holes see above a single breaktown can cost between us 2 000 and 10 000 depending on the size of the plant the process and the quality of the paper such events can considerably reduce the operational efficiency of the plant if they occur once or more times daily although not all breaks are caused by biofouling but 1 2 out of 5 cases are probably related to microbial biomass it is obvious that the overall costs from biofouling tend to be underestimated massively iii heat exchangers in heat exchangers the decrease of efficacy of heat transfer is the first aspect of biofouling related costs and contributes to the fouling factor characklis et al 1990 melo and flemming 2010 m√ºller steinhagen et al 2011 biofouling very conservatively assumed accounts for about 20 of overall fouling in energy generation in order to match the fouling factor preventive extended dimensioning of heat exchanger plants is a common practice thus biofouling directly increases the capital costs of e g a power plant murthy and venkatesan 2009 in power plants around the world thousands of tons of chlorine and other biocides as well as cleaners are spent each day to combat biofilms which amounts to high values in terms of biocide and wastewater treatment costs cloete 2003 again down time for cleaning causing loss of production and labour costs adds on a large share of costs furthermore it should be considered that the efficacy of biocides can be significantly compromised by abiotic material such as clay particles in biofilms pereira et al 2000 treatment of wastewater contaminated with antifouling additives represents an emerging cost factor as the release of biocides is increasingly restricted and will require more effort for elimination a problem which comes further into focus in europe after new eu guidelines which limit the biocide content in effluents come into action flemming and greenhalgh 2009 pereira and ankjaergaard 2009 cheyne 2010 what clearly makes more sense is putting more effort in prevention of biofouling by advanced strategies 3 trapped in biofilms it was more than obvious biofouling is a biofilm problem and solutions would require in depth knowledge about biofilms on this journey i developed a deep appreciation fascination and admiration of this form of microbial life a process metaphorically comparable to the stockholm syndrome in august 1986 i attended the 3rd international symposium on microbial ecology isme in ljubliana that was a true awakening mesmerized i listened to the presentations of charismatic researchers such as kevin marshall bill costerton bill characklis david white and others about biofilms i saw gill geesey and mark van loosdrecht mounting their posters on the extracellular polymeric substances eps and activated sludge i sat in lectures with goose bumps on the skin on my spine because i was so excited getting such an incredibly rich field of research spread out right under my eyes costerton claimed that the vast majority of microorganisms on earth actually lives in biofilms costerton et al 1987 what a field of research this conference changed my life suddenly the dimension of biofilms unfolded to me as the general way in which microorganisms organized their life decades later my friend stefan wuertz and i noticed that no data at all existed supporting costerton s claim nevertheless it was cited hundreds of times including in my own papers we challenged that claim and could eventually confirm his intuition although not his 99 flemming and wuertz 2019 but by that time almost no one in germany was interested in biofilms except peter wilderer rubio and wilderer 1987 and martin exner who approached it from a hygienic perspective exner et al 1982 biofouling on ion exchangers was just one of the manifestations in the huge realm of biofilms and i got a glimpse of a bigger picture a very much bigger picture when i returned to my lab from this conference i told my group that biofilms is what will be our future field of research which it has remained ever since one of the keys to understanding the biofilm mode of life is the role of eps they are the house of biofilm cells in which they unfold their unique properties flemming and wingender 2010 as highly hydrated biopolymers such as polysaccharides proteins lipids nucleic acids etc they provide the mechanical stability which keeps biofilm cells in close proximity to each other for extended periods of time and allow synergistic interactions e g the formation of microconsortia structurally stabilized by the matrix however eps are still considered as the dark matter of biofilms flemming 2016 and much of their properties and dynamics remain to be explored seviour et al 2018 extracellular enzymes are retained in the matrix by complexation turning biofilms into external digestion systems which enables them to even degrade solids they are the key players in the global self cleaning system of the planet different physiological interactions lead to steep gradients in ph value oxygen concentration redox potential etc which provides habitat heterogeneity and supports biodiversity within only few micrometres of distance furthermore life in biofilms supports nutrient acquisition by sorption of nutrients from the environment and for intercellular communication in close proximity last not least a biofilm represents a huge genetic archive accessible for horizontal gene transfer thus biofilms are habitats of conditions markedly different from those of the ambient environment and drive microbial cells to effect functions not possible alone or outside biofilms corning 2002 such phenomena are termed as emergent properties as they cannot be predicted from the behaviour of single cells flemming et al 2016 this is why the matrix was metaphorically termed the perfect slime flemming 2016 it is clear now that all global biogeochemical processes are driven by biofilms flemming and wuertz 2019 in fact most of the active microorganisms on earth live in biofilms driving biogeochemical processes environmental self purification and production of pristine groundwater at global dimensions interestingly they connect processes in the deep subsurface with those on the on earth surface flemming and wuertz 2019 biofilms shape their habitats by interacting with it be it by dissolving or precipitation of minerals by changing ph value redox potential oxygen concentration of salinity and they effectively shape their habitats the emerging properties of biofilms elevate them into the class of collective forms of life such as forests coral reefs or bee hives flemming et al 2016 fig 1 schematically presents some of the properties emerging from living in biofilms one particular emergent property of biofilms should be pointed out which metaphorically was described as the biofilm as a fortress flemming et al 2016 this metaphor characterizes the remarkable resilience of biofilms to antimicrobials of chemical physical and biological kinds the terms employed in this context are resistance and tolerance referring to an enhanced ability of an organism to survive exposure to compounds that are lethal to susceptible organisms resistance denotes a genetic heritable characteristic that is acquired either by mutation or by gene exchange and that remains even when biofilm cells are dispersed olsen 2015 by contrast the term tolerance is used to denote a characteristic that is specific to biofilms which is lost upon dispersal to free living bacterial cells e g tolerance to silver ions k√∂nigs et al 2015 thuptimdang et al 2015 brauner et al 2016 tolerance in biofilms can be a product both of the properties of the biofilm matrix of the slow growth that can occur in biofilms or retarding inactivation of antimicrobials or the presence of particles vieira et al 1995 intuitively it seems plausible that the eps matrix represents a diffusion barrier however antimicrobials which do not interact with eps molecules have been shown to diffuse through biofilms as easily as through water oubekka et al 2012 which is simple to understand considering that the biofilm matrix consists of 95 99 of water flemming and wingender 2010 the diffusion barrier alone is not nearly effective enough to account for the reduced susceptibility of biofilms to antibiotics it would only slow down the transport of the antibiotics and reaching the cells would be just a matter of extended diffusion time antimicrobial substances diffusing through the biofilm can react with eps components of the matrix by binding or by enzymatic degradation which substantially quenches the antimicrobial activity of these compounds billings et al 2015 this is known as reaction diffusion inhibition stewart et al 2016 the reaction component can involve chelation by complex formation and enzymatic degradation or even sacrificial reaction of eps for example with oxidizing disinfectants oubekka et al 2012 this results in sublethal antibiotic concentrations and survival of cells in the depth of the biofilm with an increased risk of development of genetically based resistance biofilms contain substantial numbers of cells in stationary phase which are less susceptible to the many antimicrobials that rely on the metabolism of bacterial cell for their activities amato et al 2014 indeed for biofilm cells in stationary phase at least 1 of bacterial cells become tolerant to antibiotics maisonneuve et al 2014 over time a greater number of cells in the biofilm enter the stationary phase slow growth rate and dormancy playing dead have long been recognized as a means of survival for bacteria in biofilms exposed to antimicrobials as a stress response to biocides antibiotics physical or chemical stressors microorganisms can enter a state of dormancy in which they do not grow on media usually employed to their detection oliver 2005 this behavior has been termed viable but non culturable vbnc and is related to the phenomenon of persisters l h kim et al 2018 fig 2 depicts hypothetical mechanisms of biofilm resilience flemming et al 2016 4 measures against biofouling practically all fields suffering from biofouling have developed their own approaches to handle the problem while there is not much lateral exchange and learning about the strategies or adoption of each others concepts antifouling strategies in food beverage pharmaceutical and microelectronics industries or ships cole 1998 verran and jones 2000 wirtanen and salo 2003 hellio et al 2009 are considerably more sophisticated than e g those of power generation autombile or paint production biofilm formation begins with primary adhesion of microorganisms to interfaces for solid surfaces the fascinating process of surface sensing and the effect of adhesion to the cell and its physiology recently has been investigated in depth attachment to surfaces deforms the cells activates mechano sensitive channels and triggers surface programmed growth carniello et al 2018 berne et al 2018 ren et al 2018 by far the largest body of literature is dedicated to prevention or mitigation of primary adhesion table 2 lists a few of them pointing out their limitations all of them have the general problem that the gap between proof of principle and industrial application very rarely has been bridged nor the aspect of costs this is one of the reasons why so very few of them have made it into practical antifouling application but there are more general limitations of these approaches one is the usually short experimental period many studies are carried out in 96 well plates and maximally for 96 h often with pure or very artificially mixed cultures rarely representative for environments as existing in the real world furthermore the deposition of abiotic material also contributes to overall fouling but is very rarely taken into consideration this is the case e g in drinking and wastewater systems in technical water systems or in the marine environment here a plethora of mixed species is ready to colonize surfaces instead of pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli the organisms most frequently employed in studies with the papers usually concluding with the word promising these single or mixed populations behave differently and they respond to any treatment by selection for competent specialists long term stability and efficacy of anti fouling approaches is also a crucial aspect of successful anti fouling and rarely considered in the studies as listed in table 2 nevertheless the list reflects creativity and inspiring diversity of approaches particularly interesting are those which are adopted from nature bixler and bushan 2012 e g by jewelweed impatiens carpensis or red seaweed delisea pulchra however only the lotus effect as observed in nelumbo nucifera barthlott and nienhuis 1977 has made it out of the laboratory to broader technical applications but not submerged in water because it works on hydrophobicity and requires both water and gas phase 4 1 detection of biofouling a crucial point in any anti fouling strategy is the timely detection of biofouling most systems are inaccessible for surface inspection commonly biofouling is diagnosed when process or product parameters indicate problems which cannot be easily attributed to normal physical technical or chemical reasons flemming 2002 2011 equally common practice is to take water samples at points of use of the water or from products and determine the number of planktonic bacteria preferably employing cultivation methods the results are usually misleading and leads to piles of data without sense reason is that the number of cells in water does not give any information about location or extent of the fouled area as the release of biofilm cells to water is random with peaks caused by detached patches and irregular erosion of single cells however if water samples are taken systematically along a water system they allow to localize hot spots which then can be addressed directly in a practical example of microbial contamination of water samples were taken upstream until the entry point into the system in this case elevated counts were found up to the ion exchanger while further upstream the numbers were significantly lower this allowed to identify the ion exchanger as the source of contamination which then had to be cleaned taking samples from accessible surfaces preferably from defined areas is always a good idea such samples can be analysed in the laboratory determination of the content of protein polysaccharides dna atp and microbial cells allows further characterization of the fouling layer and the amount of biomass compiled by manalo and nishijima 2018 however although i dedicated substantial parts of my research to eps e g flemming and wingender 2010 flemming 2016 it still frustrates me how little practically useful information such data provided and that no useful strategies to combat or foster biofilms could be developed using the present information on eps it is important not to rely on numbers acquired by cultivation methods and counting colony forming units cfu because less than 1 of all bacteria actually present in the sample can be cultivated particularly those in the depth of biofilms however the non growing cells are part of the overall biomass and can contribute to water contamination and to physical effects of biofilms e g hydrodynamic resistance therefore it is a good idea to determine the total microbial cell numbers tc e g by fluorescence microscopy interestingly the comparison between cfu and tc gives information about the nutrient status of a system in oligotrophic waters such as drinking or purified water the ratio cfu tc is below 1 1 000 if the ratio is higher it indicates the presence of nutrients such information can be very important in order to understand the occurrence of elevated cell numbers and to search for possible nutrient sources this is facilitated by the increasing employment of flow cytometry in drinking water prest et al 2016 if membrane modules are irreversibly fouled an autopsy can reveal biofouling good care is advised when opening a fouled module it is possible that not only bacteria but also fungi may be involved fig 3 spreading of spores has been observed contaminating two entire microbiological laboratories and representing a health hazard and as it happened to us it made us very unpopular because the spores contaminated most microbal cultures in those laboratories since then we did membrane autopsies under controlled safe conditions 4 2 sanitation of biofouling killing is not cleaning once biofouling has been recognized the common response is called disinfection however even if the microorganisms are killed cleaning is much more important i e removing the biomass because fouling of membranes or heat exchangers not is not caused by the physiological activity of the cells but by the biomass killing is not cleaning as remaining and subsequent cells grow on expense of the biomass flemming 2002 cleaning requires to overcome biofilm adhesion and cohesion k√∂rstgens et al 2001 fabbri and stoodley 2016 the forces which are responsible are provided by the eps molecules and weak in nature they comprise hydrogen bonding weak ionic interactions hydrophobic and van der waals interactions and entanglement wloka et al 2004 flemming and wingender 2010 surface active substances mainly address hydrophobic and van der waals interactions complexing agents act on ionic bonds hydrogen bonds can be addressed by so called chaotropic agents such as ureay tetramethyl urea and others which interfere with the shell of water molecules surrounding the biomolecules mayer et al 1999 the contribution of entanglement to matrix stability can be weakened by either oxidizing agents or enzymes shortening the length of the polymer chains in food industries enzyme applications have been studied in detail lequette et al 2010 cordeiro and werner 2011 cordeiro et al 2011 the second requirement for successful cleaning is to remove the weakened matrix by shear forces usually by removing it using increasing fluid velocity or applying pressurized air water flows jets hydraulic cleaning is the most commonly used physical method water is flushed through the system in forward or backward direction to remove the accumulated and weakened biomass and other foulants in membrane systems forward flushing can cause further biofouling problems as the biomass accumulated in the lead membrane is pushed to the ones downstream where they may lead to clogging and to further biofilm formation due to this reason some plants perform a backwash by reversing the module thereby reducing the chance of spreading the biomass to all the adjacent membrane modules pneumatic cleaning refers to the use of air or gas mixed with water for flushing air water flushing a series of experiments shows promising results on pilot scale for the use of air water flushing wibisono et al 2015 bucs et al 2018 employment of co2 dissolved in excess in water has proven to restore initial hydraulic resistance as well as visible reduction in biofouling ngene et al 2010 biological dispersal has been addressed for biofilm removal it is very clear that the biofilm matrix is not a prison to its inhabitants biofilm dispersal is regulated by processes equally complex as bacterial adhesion enzymes are the means to leave the matrix mcdougald et al 2012 petrova and sauer 2016 however none of these enzymes disperse entire biofilms they just generate holes in the matrix big enough some community members to escape neither single enzymes nor their mixtures are capable to address the huge variety of eps molecules brisou 1995 and disperse biofilms completely therefore all kinds of mixtures are used particularly in paper flemming et al 2013 b and food industries sim√µes et al 2010 however enzyme application inevitably leads to selective pressure over time favouring organisms producing eps varieties insensitive to the enzymes what also limits their efficacy is the fact that the enzymes themselves are rapidly degraded by extracellular proteases the use of signalling molecules quorum sensing qs for biofilm dispersion has been suggested and is still intensively investigated davies 2011 barraud et al 2009 brackman and coenye 2015 siddiqui et al 2015 lee et al 2018 katebian et al 2016 oh et al 2018 again these molecules are relatively specific biodegradable exert selection pressure in favour to non responsive members of mixed biofilm populations and of doubtful success on a long term application and required quantities also pose problems long term success in practice has not been reported yet vrouwenvelder pers comm in practice cleaning of biofilms from surfaces appears more an art than a science dominated by trial and error rather than based by the scarce systematic research mayer et al 1999 k√∂rstgens et al 2001 this is surprising considering that cleaning is such a crucial component of anti fouling measures 4 3 how to live with biofilms a holistic approach as mentioned before most microorganisms on earth actually live in biofilms and belong to the oldest and most successful form of life on this planet they have been exposed to every possible stress during billions of years since they exist and are thriving from that point of view it appears obvious that there is no silver bullet to eliminate them rather it is worthwhile to learn how to live with biofilms therefore in all anti fouling efforts it must be kept in mind that biofilms have developed versatile and multiple defence strategies against a multitude of stresses including those e g by toxic metals irradiation antibiotics and host immune systems over billions of years thus an easy and lasting victory over biofouling cannot be expected only an extension of the period of time in which biofilms do not cause problems a good metaphor is that teeth cannot be cleaned once and forever intuitively biofouling is considered a kind of a disease of the system and countermeasures mirror a medical paradigm kill the pathogen and the system will recover the method of choice is to apply biocides in order to obtain a disinfection this remains the most frequently taken road and supports a healthy biocide industry flemming 2011 if repeated on a regular basis over time damage of the system occurs e g by chemically stressing separation membranes or promoting corrosion as a consequence anti fouling success is time dependent and not permanent the temporal requirements range from hours to days e g for removable catheters food beverage and pharmaceutical industry to months and years e g desalination plants membrane systems steam condensers ship hulls or environmental sensors this makes it difficult to extrapolate from short term experimental results to long term efficacy biofilms develop on all surfaces provided sufficient humidity and nutrients are present hovever not all technical systems suffer from biofouling many live with the biofilms and without problems biofouling is strictly operationally defined it occurs when the effect of biofilm exceeds an arbitrary threshold of interference in membrane systems or heat exchangers more than 15 20 loss in efficacy exceed this threshold the situation is depicted in fig 4 any measures which allow to lower the level of biofilm effects below the threshold of interference will help to live with biofilms on that background it is very important to perform module autopsies of systems which do not suffer from biofouling in order to size the tolerable extent of biofilm growth below the threshold of interference this illustrates that biofouling cannot be prevented with single shot approaches but rather by holistic strategies one way is to design systems more tolerant to biofouling this is implicitly adopted in preventive oversizing e g membrane or heat exchanger systems an elegant way to overcome the hydraulic resistance of biofilms on filtration membranes which is essentially caused by compression of the eps molecules dreszer et al 2013 derlon et al 2014 is application of very low pressure e g in gravity driven membrane filtration pronk et al 2019 this version of living with biofilms does not only suffer much less from biofouling but also provides flux stabilisation and improved permeate quality 4 3 1 biofouling potential a first step is the determination of the biofouling potential in order to recognize biofouling risk in water treatment systems the quality of the feed water is a crucial factor manalo and nishijima 2018 elaborated this for ro systems to characterize the fouling potential the most important parameters are the total dissolved solid tds contents and the organic load in terms of total organic carbon toc the biodegradable proportion of toc will support the growth of biomass manufacturers suggest pretreatment of feed water when toc exceeds 3 mg l dow 2010 humic components are not readily biodegradable but support slow growth of microorganisms contributing to biofouling on a long term they absorb uv radiation therefore determination of uv254 nm is suggested for assessment the fouling potential sim et al 2018 for detection of the microbial load determination of tc is recommended rather than enumeration of cfu the silt density index sdi was found to be of only limited use as a predictor of the biofouling potential because it is too sensitive to other factors such as ph value membrane characteristics and turbidity of water good feed water quality for membrane desalination is defined by membrane manufacturers as water with a turbidity lower than one nephelometric turbidity unit ntu silt density index sdi 3 oil and grease 1 mg l if these requirements are not met the water requires pretreatment bucs et al 2018 usually by filtration 4 3 2 good housekeeping and nutrient limitation achieving and maintaining low bacterial numbers in the water phase and a clean system is part of a good housekeeping regime this includes particularly the quantification and elimination of nutrients as microorganisms are particles which can multiply on the expense of anything which is biodegradable this belongs to the biofouling potential therefore nutrient limitation is a useful tool for mitigating biofouling problems nutrients are not only provided by the water phase but can also leach from polymeric materials e g biodegradable plasticizers anti statics and other additives they also can origin from sealing and fitting components material selection is one of the key points in maintaining low biofouling in drinking water systems or household installations flemming et al 2013 a in some cases disinfection has contributed to biofouling by partially oxidizing humic substances and make them biodegradable lechevallier 1999 in biofouled systems the same processes happen as in a biofilter biofilms convert nutrients into metabolites and biomass biofouling can be considered a biofilter in the wrong place a biofilter in the right place i e ahead of the system would remove organic carbon and thus limiting biofilm growth behind the biofilter this has first been demonstrated by griebe and flemming 1998 and was successfully applied in membrane and cooling systems e g meesters et al 2003 gule et al 2016 moreira et al 2016 manalo and nishijima 2018 and expanded by phosphate vrouwenvelder et al 2010 bucs et al 2014 kim et al 2014 and nitrogen limitation hwang et al 2010 ahead of membrane systems a comprehensive approach is the application of the water safety plan wsp principles who 2010 the big advantage is that this embraces the entire system including all raw materials installations and processes the procedure appears laborious but is well established and very successful 4 3 3 low adhesion antifouling easy to clean surfaces the surface energy of the substratum is one of the most relevant physico chemical parameters influencing settlement and adhesion strength of fouling lejars et al 2012 antifouling strategies employing coatings which cannot prevent but delay biofilm formation bucs et al 2018 giessler et al 2006 such coatings fall into three main categories lejars et al 2012 swain 2017 i chemically active coatings which act on marine organisms by inhibiting or limiting their settlement using chemically active compounds releasing them in a controlled way usually as self polishing copolymer coatings based on aceylic or methacrylic copolymers or releasing biocides ii nontoxic coatings which inhibit the settlement of organisms or enhance the release of settled organisms without involving chemical reactions iii engineered microtopographical surfaces which are particularly sensitive to abiotic fouling and mechanical stress a comprehensive overview of the most common silicone containing and fluorine based fouling release coatings is provided by lejars et al 2012 in medical environments hydrogel silicones have been successfully employed peppas et al 2000 in every case ageing of coatings can represent a significant problem s√°nchez et al 2009 these coatings however have some limitations as already mentioned in table 2 they are particularly susceptible to fouling during stagnation periods some of them cast doubts over their long term durability adhesion to support and stability towards water and the impact of the surrounding environment such as ph value ionic strength and temperature lejars et al 2012 as biofilms tend to develop to much lesser thickness than e g macrofouling layers composed of larvae barnacles or diatoms they require higher shear stress which limits their application to rapidly flowing systems and cannot be washed off completely as already reported by characklis in 1990 a lesser considered aspect in design of water system is access to cleaning friendly surfaces at least with accessible control points which can be monitored this would make it much easier for curative cleaning and to prevent biofilms to develop into biofouling 4 3 4 surface monitoring biofouling occurs on surfaces therefore surfaces are the best target for early warning as well as for verification of cleaning success and anti biofilm strategies monitoring of biofilms and other deposits on surfaces is an attractive means for timely recognition of fouling layer development cleaning efficacy and success of anti fouling strategies from the beginning of anti fouling research so called coupons were employed mostly in side stream devices in which test surfaces were exposed to conditions as similar as possible to the main system e g rotational reactors van der wende et al 1989 or the robbins device implemented in the system ruseska et al 1982 the ideal monitoring device will provide fast and accurate information about site extent thickness nature biotic abiotic and kinetics of fouling layer development and does so in real time non destructively on line and cost effective flemming 2003 obviously this is a goal hard to meet the ideal monitoring technique allows for real time non destructive fast and accurate on line information about fouling layer buildup at a representative site which allows for distinguishing biofilms from abiotic foulants and suitable to extrapolation to larger parts of the system flemming 2003 jahnknecht and melo 2003 an interesting device has been suggested by pereira et al 2008 based on the response of biofilms and abiotic layers to nanovibrations developed in order to monitor heat exchanger fouling as well as food and beverage industries pereira and melo 2009 this device is now applied in practice on passive metals e g titanium or stainless steel probes have been developed which measure the electrochemical response to biofilm development commercially available devices e g bi0george licina et al 1999 or biox and alvim bruijs et al 2001 pavanello et al 2011 cristiani and perboni 2014 the probes are typically installed into a piping system heat exchanger water box cooling tower or side stream via a threaded connection however the interpretation of the signal requires considerable experience an optical sensor optiquad strathmann et al 2013 has been developed which employs the light reflectance of biofilms growing on the tip surface of optical fibers analysis of backscattered light allows to distinguish between biomass proteins and activity autofluorescence of nadh atp and abiotic material backscattered light at 800 nm after proof of principle sadly this device also falls into the category of dream devices although it works on line in line automatically and in real time but it is still waiting for resources to develop it into practical application an interesting approach is the canary cell sim et al 2015 2018 it was originally developed as a colloidal fouling monitor but it turned out that it is also capable of in situ in real time and non destructively monitoring biofilm growth employing ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr by periodic dosing of silica this technique can locate biofilms on the membrane surface based on the transmission and reflection of an ultrasonic wave travelling through a particular medium e g biofilm and reveals its specific characteristics the best progress into wider practical application so far has been achieved in membrane biofouling with side stream membrane fouling simulators vrouwenvelder et al 2006 j s kim et al 2018 subramani and hoek 2008 in practice it is usually the first module in which biofouling begins bucs et al 2018 similar to biological filters where most of the biological activity and thus microbial growth occurs just in the first sections of the filter they can be considered as representative for the first module this helps to avoid shutting down the process due to irreversible fouling bucs et al 2018 manalo and nishijima 2018 kerdi et al 2018 presented perforated spacers as creative solutions to avoid membrane biofouling the importance of monitoring systems cannot be emphasized strong enough monitoring allows for timely observation of biofilm development provide early warning and helps to keep biofilms below the threshold of interference in an economically feasible way this concept should be much more considered by fouling stricken industries the main components of a holistic anti fouling concept are shown in fig 5 5 conclusions it is possible to live with biofilms and all non fouling systems do so already because they are not sterile but the effects of their biofilms are still below the threshold of interference but most of them do not know how far below this threshold they are operating therefore it would be extremely interesting to investigate non fouled systems and determine the level of tolerable biofilms in the end however the organism always wins this was the essence of advice i received from kevin marshall my late mentor from the university of new south wales the key in anti fouling strategies is only to extend the time until the organism wins to achieve this solutions require a shift of paradigms away from killing towards coexistence with biofilms and away from the so much desired and published one shot solutions towards long term concepts it is strongly recommended to turn to integrated solutions building blocks for assembling such solutions are already at hand as illustrated in fig 5 this is where further research should be dedicated in particular for longer term sustainable solutions furthermore it would help to adopt procedures as standardized in water safety plans who 2010 and implement the above mentioned building blocks the benefit would be much more success in anti fouling and much less environmental damage by biocides disinfectants and other components which we do not want to further pollute our waters declaration of competing

18080,biofouling is the undesired deposition and growth of microorganisms on surfaces forming biofilms the definition is subjective and operational not every biofilm causes biofouling only if a given a subjective threshold of interference is exceeded biofilms cause technical or medical problems these range from the formation of slime layers on ship hulls or in pipelines which increase friction resistance to separation membranes on which biofilms increase hydraulic resistance to heat exchangers where they interfere with heat transport to contamination of treated water by eroded biofilm cells which may comprise hygienically relevant microorganisms and most dangerous to biofilms on implants and catheters which can cause persistent infections the largest fraction of anti fouling research usually in short term experiments is focused on prevention or limiting primary microbial adhesion intuitively this appears only logical but turns out mostly hopeless this is because in technical systems with open access for microorganisms all surfaces are colonized sooner or later which explains the very limited success of that research as a result the use of biocides remains the major tool to fight persistent biofilms however this is costly in terms of biocides it stresses working materials causes off time and environmental damage and it usually leaves large parts of biofilms in place ready for regrowth in order to really solve biofouling problems it is necessary to learn how to live with biofilms and mitigate their detrimental effects this requires rather an integrated strategy than aiming to invent one shot solutions in this context it helps to understand the biofilm way of life as a natural phenomenon biofilms are the oldest most successful and most widely distributed form of life on earth existing even in extreme environments and being highly resilient microorganisms in biofilms live in a self produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps which allows them to develop emerging properties such as enhanced nutrient acquisition synergistic microconsortia enhanced tolerance to biocides and antibiotics intense intercellular communication and cooperation transiently immobilized biofilm organisms turn their matrix into an external digestion system by retaining complexed exoenzymes in the matrix biofilms grow even on traces of any biodegradable material therefore an effective anti fouling strategy comprises to keep the system low in nutrients good housekeeping employing low fouling easy to clean surfaces monitoring of biofilm development allowing for early intervention and acknowledging that cleaning can be more important than trying to kill biofilms because cleaning does not cut the nutrient supply of survivors and dead biomass serves as an additional carbon source for cannibalizing survivors supporting rapid after growth an integrated concept is presented as the result of a long journey of the author through biofouling problems graphical abstract image 1 stockholm syndrome psychological response wherein a captive begins to identify closely with his or her captors as well as with their agenda and demands keywords biofouling biofilms anti fouling holistic approach 1 how it started after my ph d at the max planck institute for immunobiology in freiburg germany i was hired in april 1978 at the institute for sanitary engineering water quality and solid waste management of the university of stuttgart in the department of chemistry my project was about the microbial contamination of pure and ultrapure water upon treatment with ion exchangers flemming 1987 the problem was termed biofouling and caused considerable problems microbial contamination turned out to be the cause for occasional hygienic objections in drinking and brewing water water for pharmaceutical use and for failures of electronic microchips who had to be rinsed with ultrapure water during the process of printing electrical circuits bacteria lead to shortcuts and painful loss of finished chips as the cells would act as conductive particles due to their water content this limited the use of ion exchangers for production of ultrapure water as an alternative to much costlier distillation flemming 1987 in hindsight it was obvious to look at the surfaces as sources for the contaminations but at that time late 70 ies early 80 ies scientific approaches concentrated rather on the water phase sure enough it turned out that ion exchanger resin beds hosted nests of microbial colonies on ion resin surfaces and it could be demonstrated that they were recalcitrant against disinfection led to microbial regrowth and recurring contamination of the treated water flemming 1981 1987 great hope was put on the effect of the bacteriostatic effect of traces of silver ions as provided e g by silver coated resins to my bigdisappointment silver coating did not help to solve the problem after few weeks silver tolerant populations emerged flemming 1982 but the silver resin beads generated by loading the cation exchanger with silver ions and reducing the silver by ascorbic acid and looked very beautiful i took my children to the lab and they were mystified by silver making but later excessive consumption of silver salt without valid justification was harshly critizised another alternative to distillation was the employment of reverse osmosis technology but membrane technology also experienced biofouling its achilles heel flemming et al 1997 biofouling was defined as development of a biofilm consisting of microorganisms and their products characklis and cooksey 1983 i e the unwanted deposition and growth of microorganisms on surfaces thus biofouling is an effect of biofilm presence and growth clearly a biofilm problem it was just one of four types of fouling the others were mineral fouling scaling organic fouling and particle fouling epstein 1981 and usually more than one of them was involved in fouling cases microbial biofouling is observed in a very wide spectrum of technical and medical fields and causes very diverse problems table 1 provides an idea of the dimensions 2 the costs of biofouling the funding for my research was triggered by the costly damage caused by biofouling however although being a common phenomenon in many different fields see table 1 there is very little quantitative data about the overall costs admittedly it is difficult to assess the global biofouling related costs because they are caused by a number of various factors from interference with process performance decrease of product quality and quantity to material damage by microbial attack which even can include minerals organic polymers flemming 2010 or metals microbially influenced corrosion mic little and lee 2014 preventive overdosing of biocides and cleaners and finally most expensive interruptions of production processes and shortened life time of plant components due to extended cleaning an additional matter of expense is caused by the treatment of wastewater contaminated by anti fouling chemicals biofilms cause monumental costs in the health system considering that about 80 of human bacterial infections are biofilm associated r√∂mling and balsobre 2012 but looking at the economically healthy anti fouling industry which offers everything from anti fouling surfaces and materials biocides cleaners and consulting services illuminates the economical dimension this market is worth billions of dollars annually worldwide biofouling generates a safe and continous business because biofilms cannot be erased once and forever three examples may illustrate the economic dimensions of biofouling i membrane biofouling the costs of biofouling have been estimated in the membrane treatment system at water factory 21 orange county to 30 of the operating costs at that time about 750 000 per year ridgway and flemming 1996 this rate has not much changed since flemming 2011 the estimate considered not only on the costs for membrane cleaning itself and labour costs but also down time during cleaning pre treatment costs including biocides and other additives an increased energy demand due to higher transmembrane and feed brine hydrodynamic resistance and shortened lifetime of the membranes reportedly to avoid excessive cleaning biofouled membrane systems are frequently operated outside the manufacturer s warrantee condition of less than 15 increase of the normalized pressure drop increase over the total installation between cleanings vrouwenvelder et al 2011 interestingly it is the eps which contribute to the hydrodynamic effects not the cells embedded in the biofilm they generate the bulk of the hydrodynamic resistance vrouwenvelder et al 2016 derlon et al 2016 this indicates that killing the cells alone will not help sanitizing membrane fouling biofilms in a case study the author was involved in treatment of seawater for injection into oilfields for replacement of the oil was performed by nanofiltration membranes the client reported due to biofouling membrane life is reduced from three to one year so over the life of the plant the cost of membrane replacement will be increased by a factor of 3 if it is taken into account that each membrane costs 2500 and each plant has around 700 membranes one can easily calculate a yearly investment cost of 1 75 million instead of 0 58 million that means an extra cost of 1 17 million a year just for membrane replacement but this can easily increase significantly if man hours involved in replacements filters and piping replacement cost fees paid to the client for downtimes loss of water quality and further factors are taken into account such cost assessments even if crude reflect how complex and essentially arbitrary any numbers are but they show one thing for certain that they are high further but rarely acknowledged biofouling related costs arise from interrupted water production missing contractual requirements ii paper production in paper production biofouling can cause substantial problems in production and paper quality flemming et al 2013 b losses are arise from of a number of complex scenarios including direct damage by biofouling holes breaks malodor and microbial contamination the cost of controlling biofouling biocides dispersants cleaners etc downtime during slime related cleaning and eventually the loss of product quantity and or quality it has been estimated that us 1 2 5 per tonne of produced paper are spent on antimicrobials biodispersants and cleaning chemicals during production nalco unpublished contaminated raw materials and additives contribute to biofouling damage paper is made primarily from cellulose fibers but it also contains various amounts of a variety of additives eg calcium carbonate or titanium dioxide microbial contamination can lead to graying of mineral pigment slurries and to the formation of malodorous metabolites that cannot be sanitized this has been observed in tanks in railroad wagons after extended stay and can amount according to the volume of the tank to losses of several us 10 000 per tank of ca 100 m3 deficient products or batches of microbially deteriorated additives such as starch or pigments can account for losses in the range of several us 10 000 per batch the costs for preserving mineral pigments against microbial contamination range between us 2 3 per tonne the practical experience of the authors flemming et al 2013 b has shown that microbial spoilage and degradation of dispersants can lead to viscosity changes which may result in the plugging of jet coaters or scratches in the coating when coating agglomerates become trapped on the coating blade microbial spoilage and degradation of binders can have a negative impact on product quality although paper makers understand the economic benefits associated with deposit control they tend to overlook spoilage of additives and fibers because it is often difficult to detect directly ignoring these processes can be costly and environmentally risky and can present a direct safety hazard for example when explosive gases such as h2 or methane or toxic ones such as h2s are generated by microbial activity and have led reportedly to accidents flemming et al 2013 b the biggest cost factors associated with slime formation in paper production are downtime and cleaning costs much of the cost is the result of breakdowns caused by lumps of slime dropping onto the moving screen on which the water is separated from the pulp and causing holes see above a single breaktown can cost between us 2 000 and 10 000 depending on the size of the plant the process and the quality of the paper such events can considerably reduce the operational efficiency of the plant if they occur once or more times daily although not all breaks are caused by biofouling but 1 2 out of 5 cases are probably related to microbial biomass it is obvious that the overall costs from biofouling tend to be underestimated massively iii heat exchangers in heat exchangers the decrease of efficacy of heat transfer is the first aspect of biofouling related costs and contributes to the fouling factor characklis et al 1990 melo and flemming 2010 m√ºller steinhagen et al 2011 biofouling very conservatively assumed accounts for about 20 of overall fouling in energy generation in order to match the fouling factor preventive extended dimensioning of heat exchanger plants is a common practice thus biofouling directly increases the capital costs of e g a power plant murthy and venkatesan 2009 in power plants around the world thousands of tons of chlorine and other biocides as well as cleaners are spent each day to combat biofilms which amounts to high values in terms of biocide and wastewater treatment costs cloete 2003 again down time for cleaning causing loss of production and labour costs adds on a large share of costs furthermore it should be considered that the efficacy of biocides can be significantly compromised by abiotic material such as clay particles in biofilms pereira et al 2000 treatment of wastewater contaminated with antifouling additives represents an emerging cost factor as the release of biocides is increasingly restricted and will require more effort for elimination a problem which comes further into focus in europe after new eu guidelines which limit the biocide content in effluents come into action flemming and greenhalgh 2009 pereira and ankjaergaard 2009 cheyne 2010 what clearly makes more sense is putting more effort in prevention of biofouling by advanced strategies 3 trapped in biofilms it was more than obvious biofouling is a biofilm problem and solutions would require in depth knowledge about biofilms on this journey i developed a deep appreciation fascination and admiration of this form of microbial life a process metaphorically comparable to the stockholm syndrome in august 1986 i attended the 3rd international symposium on microbial ecology isme in ljubliana that was a true awakening mesmerized i listened to the presentations of charismatic researchers such as kevin marshall bill costerton bill characklis david white and others about biofilms i saw gill geesey and mark van loosdrecht mounting their posters on the extracellular polymeric substances eps and activated sludge i sat in lectures with goose bumps on the skin on my spine because i was so excited getting such an incredibly rich field of research spread out right under my eyes costerton claimed that the vast majority of microorganisms on earth actually lives in biofilms costerton et al 1987 what a field of research this conference changed my life suddenly the dimension of biofilms unfolded to me as the general way in which microorganisms organized their life decades later my friend stefan wuertz and i noticed that no data at all existed supporting costerton s claim nevertheless it was cited hundreds of times including in my own papers we challenged that claim and could eventually confirm his intuition although not his 99 flemming and wuertz 2019 but by that time almost no one in germany was interested in biofilms except peter wilderer rubio and wilderer 1987 and martin exner who approached it from a hygienic perspective exner et al 1982 biofouling on ion exchangers was just one of the manifestations in the huge realm of biofilms and i got a glimpse of a bigger picture a very much bigger picture when i returned to my lab from this conference i told my group that biofilms is what will be our future field of research which it has remained ever since one of the keys to understanding the biofilm mode of life is the role of eps they are the house of biofilm cells in which they unfold their unique properties flemming and wingender 2010 as highly hydrated biopolymers such as polysaccharides proteins lipids nucleic acids etc they provide the mechanical stability which keeps biofilm cells in close proximity to each other for extended periods of time and allow synergistic interactions e g the formation of microconsortia structurally stabilized by the matrix however eps are still considered as the dark matter of biofilms flemming 2016 and much of their properties and dynamics remain to be explored seviour et al 2018 extracellular enzymes are retained in the matrix by complexation turning biofilms into external digestion systems which enables them to even degrade solids they are the key players in the global self cleaning system of the planet different physiological interactions lead to steep gradients in ph value oxygen concentration redox potential etc which provides habitat heterogeneity and supports biodiversity within only few micrometres of distance furthermore life in biofilms supports nutrient acquisition by sorption of nutrients from the environment and for intercellular communication in close proximity last not least a biofilm represents a huge genetic archive accessible for horizontal gene transfer thus biofilms are habitats of conditions markedly different from those of the ambient environment and drive microbial cells to effect functions not possible alone or outside biofilms corning 2002 such phenomena are termed as emergent properties as they cannot be predicted from the behaviour of single cells flemming et al 2016 this is why the matrix was metaphorically termed the perfect slime flemming 2016 it is clear now that all global biogeochemical processes are driven by biofilms flemming and wuertz 2019 in fact most of the active microorganisms on earth live in biofilms driving biogeochemical processes environmental self purification and production of pristine groundwater at global dimensions interestingly they connect processes in the deep subsurface with those on the on earth surface flemming and wuertz 2019 biofilms shape their habitats by interacting with it be it by dissolving or precipitation of minerals by changing ph value redox potential oxygen concentration of salinity and they effectively shape their habitats the emerging properties of biofilms elevate them into the class of collective forms of life such as forests coral reefs or bee hives flemming et al 2016 fig 1 schematically presents some of the properties emerging from living in biofilms one particular emergent property of biofilms should be pointed out which metaphorically was described as the biofilm as a fortress flemming et al 2016 this metaphor characterizes the remarkable resilience of biofilms to antimicrobials of chemical physical and biological kinds the terms employed in this context are resistance and tolerance referring to an enhanced ability of an organism to survive exposure to compounds that are lethal to susceptible organisms resistance denotes a genetic heritable characteristic that is acquired either by mutation or by gene exchange and that remains even when biofilm cells are dispersed olsen 2015 by contrast the term tolerance is used to denote a characteristic that is specific to biofilms which is lost upon dispersal to free living bacterial cells e g tolerance to silver ions k√∂nigs et al 2015 thuptimdang et al 2015 brauner et al 2016 tolerance in biofilms can be a product both of the properties of the biofilm matrix of the slow growth that can occur in biofilms or retarding inactivation of antimicrobials or the presence of particles vieira et al 1995 intuitively it seems plausible that the eps matrix represents a diffusion barrier however antimicrobials which do not interact with eps molecules have been shown to diffuse through biofilms as easily as through water oubekka et al 2012 which is simple to understand considering that the biofilm matrix consists of 95 99 of water flemming and wingender 2010 the diffusion barrier alone is not nearly effective enough to account for the reduced susceptibility of biofilms to antibiotics it would only slow down the transport of the antibiotics and reaching the cells would be just a matter of extended diffusion time antimicrobial substances diffusing through the biofilm can react with eps components of the matrix by binding or by enzymatic degradation which substantially quenches the antimicrobial activity of these compounds billings et al 2015 this is known as reaction diffusion inhibition stewart et al 2016 the reaction component can involve chelation by complex formation and enzymatic degradation or even sacrificial reaction of eps for example with oxidizing disinfectants oubekka et al 2012 this results in sublethal antibiotic concentrations and survival of cells in the depth of the biofilm with an increased risk of development of genetically based resistance biofilms contain substantial numbers of cells in stationary phase which are less susceptible to the many antimicrobials that rely on the metabolism of bacterial cell for their activities amato et al 2014 indeed for biofilm cells in stationary phase at least 1 of bacterial cells become tolerant to antibiotics maisonneuve et al 2014 over time a greater number of cells in the biofilm enter the stationary phase slow growth rate and dormancy playing dead have long been recognized as a means of survival for bacteria in biofilms exposed to antimicrobials as a stress response to biocides antibiotics physical or chemical stressors microorganisms can enter a state of dormancy in which they do not grow on media usually employed to their detection oliver 2005 this behavior has been termed viable but non culturable vbnc and is related to the phenomenon of persisters l h kim et al 2018 fig 2 depicts hypothetical mechanisms of biofilm resilience flemming et al 2016 4 measures against biofouling practically all fields suffering from biofouling have developed their own approaches to handle the problem while there is not much lateral exchange and learning about the strategies or adoption of each others concepts antifouling strategies in food beverage pharmaceutical and microelectronics industries or ships cole 1998 verran and jones 2000 wirtanen and salo 2003 hellio et al 2009 are considerably more sophisticated than e g those of power generation autombile or paint production biofilm formation begins with primary adhesion of microorganisms to interfaces for solid surfaces the fascinating process of surface sensing and the effect of adhesion to the cell and its physiology recently has been investigated in depth attachment to surfaces deforms the cells activates mechano sensitive channels and triggers surface programmed growth carniello et al 2018 berne et al 2018 ren et al 2018 by far the largest body of literature is dedicated to prevention or mitigation of primary adhesion table 2 lists a few of them pointing out their limitations all of them have the general problem that the gap between proof of principle and industrial application very rarely has been bridged nor the aspect of costs this is one of the reasons why so very few of them have made it into practical antifouling application but there are more general limitations of these approaches one is the usually short experimental period many studies are carried out in 96 well plates and maximally for 96 h often with pure or very artificially mixed cultures rarely representative for environments as existing in the real world furthermore the deposition of abiotic material also contributes to overall fouling but is very rarely taken into consideration this is the case e g in drinking and wastewater systems in technical water systems or in the marine environment here a plethora of mixed species is ready to colonize surfaces instead of pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli the organisms most frequently employed in studies with the papers usually concluding with the word promising these single or mixed populations behave differently and they respond to any treatment by selection for competent specialists long term stability and efficacy of anti fouling approaches is also a crucial aspect of successful anti fouling and rarely considered in the studies as listed in table 2 nevertheless the list reflects creativity and inspiring diversity of approaches particularly interesting are those which are adopted from nature bixler and bushan 2012 e g by jewelweed impatiens carpensis or red seaweed delisea pulchra however only the lotus effect as observed in nelumbo nucifera barthlott and nienhuis 1977 has made it out of the laboratory to broader technical applications but not submerged in water because it works on hydrophobicity and requires both water and gas phase 4 1 detection of biofouling a crucial point in any anti fouling strategy is the timely detection of biofouling most systems are inaccessible for surface inspection commonly biofouling is diagnosed when process or product parameters indicate problems which cannot be easily attributed to normal physical technical or chemical reasons flemming 2002 2011 equally common practice is to take water samples at points of use of the water or from products and determine the number of planktonic bacteria preferably employing cultivation methods the results are usually misleading and leads to piles of data without sense reason is that the number of cells in water does not give any information about location or extent of the fouled area as the release of biofilm cells to water is random with peaks caused by detached patches and irregular erosion of single cells however if water samples are taken systematically along a water system they allow to localize hot spots which then can be addressed directly in a practical example of microbial contamination of water samples were taken upstream until the entry point into the system in this case elevated counts were found up to the ion exchanger while further upstream the numbers were significantly lower this allowed to identify the ion exchanger as the source of contamination which then had to be cleaned taking samples from accessible surfaces preferably from defined areas is always a good idea such samples can be analysed in the laboratory determination of the content of protein polysaccharides dna atp and microbial cells allows further characterization of the fouling layer and the amount of biomass compiled by manalo and nishijima 2018 however although i dedicated substantial parts of my research to eps e g flemming and wingender 2010 flemming 2016 it still frustrates me how little practically useful information such data provided and that no useful strategies to combat or foster biofilms could be developed using the present information on eps it is important not to rely on numbers acquired by cultivation methods and counting colony forming units cfu because less than 1 of all bacteria actually present in the sample can be cultivated particularly those in the depth of biofilms however the non growing cells are part of the overall biomass and can contribute to water contamination and to physical effects of biofilms e g hydrodynamic resistance therefore it is a good idea to determine the total microbial cell numbers tc e g by fluorescence microscopy interestingly the comparison between cfu and tc gives information about the nutrient status of a system in oligotrophic waters such as drinking or purified water the ratio cfu tc is below 1 1 000 if the ratio is higher it indicates the presence of nutrients such information can be very important in order to understand the occurrence of elevated cell numbers and to search for possible nutrient sources this is facilitated by the increasing employment of flow cytometry in drinking water prest et al 2016 if membrane modules are irreversibly fouled an autopsy can reveal biofouling good care is advised when opening a fouled module it is possible that not only bacteria but also fungi may be involved fig 3 spreading of spores has been observed contaminating two entire microbiological laboratories and representing a health hazard and as it happened to us it made us very unpopular because the spores contaminated most microbal cultures in those laboratories since then we did membrane autopsies under controlled safe conditions 4 2 sanitation of biofouling killing is not cleaning once biofouling has been recognized the common response is called disinfection however even if the microorganisms are killed cleaning is much more important i e removing the biomass because fouling of membranes or heat exchangers not is not caused by the physiological activity of the cells but by the biomass killing is not cleaning as remaining and subsequent cells grow on expense of the biomass flemming 2002 cleaning requires to overcome biofilm adhesion and cohesion k√∂rstgens et al 2001 fabbri and stoodley 2016 the forces which are responsible are provided by the eps molecules and weak in nature they comprise hydrogen bonding weak ionic interactions hydrophobic and van der waals interactions and entanglement wloka et al 2004 flemming and wingender 2010 surface active substances mainly address hydrophobic and van der waals interactions complexing agents act on ionic bonds hydrogen bonds can be addressed by so called chaotropic agents such as ureay tetramethyl urea and others which interfere with the shell of water molecules surrounding the biomolecules mayer et al 1999 the contribution of entanglement to matrix stability can be weakened by either oxidizing agents or enzymes shortening the length of the polymer chains in food industries enzyme applications have been studied in detail lequette et al 2010 cordeiro and werner 2011 cordeiro et al 2011 the second requirement for successful cleaning is to remove the weakened matrix by shear forces usually by removing it using increasing fluid velocity or applying pressurized air water flows jets hydraulic cleaning is the most commonly used physical method water is flushed through the system in forward or backward direction to remove the accumulated and weakened biomass and other foulants in membrane systems forward flushing can cause further biofouling problems as the biomass accumulated in the lead membrane is pushed to the ones downstream where they may lead to clogging and to further biofilm formation due to this reason some plants perform a backwash by reversing the module thereby reducing the chance of spreading the biomass to all the adjacent membrane modules pneumatic cleaning refers to the use of air or gas mixed with water for flushing air water flushing a series of experiments shows promising results on pilot scale for the use of air water flushing wibisono et al 2015 bucs et al 2018 employment of co2 dissolved in excess in water has proven to restore initial hydraulic resistance as well as visible reduction in biofouling ngene et al 2010 biological dispersal has been addressed for biofilm removal it is very clear that the biofilm matrix is not a prison to its inhabitants biofilm dispersal is regulated by processes equally complex as bacterial adhesion enzymes are the means to leave the matrix mcdougald et al 2012 petrova and sauer 2016 however none of these enzymes disperse entire biofilms they just generate holes in the matrix big enough some community members to escape neither single enzymes nor their mixtures are capable to address the huge variety of eps molecules brisou 1995 and disperse biofilms completely therefore all kinds of mixtures are used particularly in paper flemming et al 2013 b and food industries sim√µes et al 2010 however enzyme application inevitably leads to selective pressure over time favouring organisms producing eps varieties insensitive to the enzymes what also limits their efficacy is the fact that the enzymes themselves are rapidly degraded by extracellular proteases the use of signalling molecules quorum sensing qs for biofilm dispersion has been suggested and is still intensively investigated davies 2011 barraud et al 2009 brackman and coenye 2015 siddiqui et al 2015 lee et al 2018 katebian et al 2016 oh et al 2018 again these molecules are relatively specific biodegradable exert selection pressure in favour to non responsive members of mixed biofilm populations and of doubtful success on a long term application and required quantities also pose problems long term success in practice has not been reported yet vrouwenvelder pers comm in practice cleaning of biofilms from surfaces appears more an art than a science dominated by trial and error rather than based by the scarce systematic research mayer et al 1999 k√∂rstgens et al 2001 this is surprising considering that cleaning is such a crucial component of anti fouling measures 4 3 how to live with biofilms a holistic approach as mentioned before most microorganisms on earth actually live in biofilms and belong to the oldest and most successful form of life on this planet they have been exposed to every possible stress during billions of years since they exist and are thriving from that point of view it appears obvious that there is no silver bullet to eliminate them rather it is worthwhile to learn how to live with biofilms therefore in all anti fouling efforts it must be kept in mind that biofilms have developed versatile and multiple defence strategies against a multitude of stresses including those e g by toxic metals irradiation antibiotics and host immune systems over billions of years thus an easy and lasting victory over biofouling cannot be expected only an extension of the period of time in which biofilms do not cause problems a good metaphor is that teeth cannot be cleaned once and forever intuitively biofouling is considered a kind of a disease of the system and countermeasures mirror a medical paradigm kill the pathogen and the system will recover the method of choice is to apply biocides in order to obtain a disinfection this remains the most frequently taken road and supports a healthy biocide industry flemming 2011 if repeated on a regular basis over time damage of the system occurs e g by chemically stressing separation membranes or promoting corrosion as a consequence anti fouling success is time dependent and not permanent the temporal requirements range from hours to days e g for removable catheters food beverage and pharmaceutical industry to months and years e g desalination plants membrane systems steam condensers ship hulls or environmental sensors this makes it difficult to extrapolate from short term experimental results to long term efficacy biofilms develop on all surfaces provided sufficient humidity and nutrients are present hovever not all technical systems suffer from biofouling many live with the biofilms and without problems biofouling is strictly operationally defined it occurs when the effect of biofilm exceeds an arbitrary threshold of interference in membrane systems or heat exchangers more than 15 20 loss in efficacy exceed this threshold the situation is depicted in fig 4 any measures which allow to lower the level of biofilm effects below the threshold of interference will help to live with biofilms on that background it is very important to perform module autopsies of systems which do not suffer from biofouling in order to size the tolerable extent of biofilm growth below the threshold of interference this illustrates that biofouling cannot be prevented with single shot approaches but rather by holistic strategies one way is to design systems more tolerant to biofouling this is implicitly adopted in preventive oversizing e g membrane or heat exchanger systems an elegant way to overcome the hydraulic resistance of biofilms on filtration membranes which is essentially caused by compression of the eps molecules dreszer et al 2013 derlon et al 2014 is application of very low pressure e g in gravity driven membrane filtration pronk et al 2019 this version of living with biofilms does not only suffer much less from biofouling but also provides flux stabilisation and improved permeate quality 4 3 1 biofouling potential a first step is the determination of the biofouling potential in order to recognize biofouling risk in water treatment systems the quality of the feed water is a crucial factor manalo and nishijima 2018 elaborated this for ro systems to characterize the fouling potential the most important parameters are the total dissolved solid tds contents and the organic load in terms of total organic carbon toc the biodegradable proportion of toc will support the growth of biomass manufacturers suggest pretreatment of feed water when toc exceeds 3 mg l dow 2010 humic components are not readily biodegradable but support slow growth of microorganisms contributing to biofouling on a long term they absorb uv radiation therefore determination of uv254 nm is suggested for assessment the fouling potential sim et al 2018 for detection of the microbial load determination of tc is recommended rather than enumeration of cfu the silt density index sdi was found to be of only limited use as a predictor of the biofouling potential because it is too sensitive to other factors such as ph value membrane characteristics and turbidity of water good feed water quality for membrane desalination is defined by membrane manufacturers as water with a turbidity lower than one nephelometric turbidity unit ntu silt density index sdi 3 oil and grease 1 mg l if these requirements are not met the water requires pretreatment bucs et al 2018 usually by filtration 4 3 2 good housekeeping and nutrient limitation achieving and maintaining low bacterial numbers in the water phase and a clean system is part of a good housekeeping regime this includes particularly the quantification and elimination of nutrients as microorganisms are particles which can multiply on the expense of anything which is biodegradable this belongs to the biofouling potential therefore nutrient limitation is a useful tool for mitigating biofouling problems nutrients are not only provided by the water phase but can also leach from polymeric materials e g biodegradable plasticizers anti statics and other additives they also can origin from sealing and fitting components material selection is one of the key points in maintaining low biofouling in drinking water systems or household installations flemming et al 2013 a in some cases disinfection has contributed to biofouling by partially oxidizing humic substances and make them biodegradable lechevallier 1999 in biofouled systems the same processes happen as in a biofilter biofilms convert nutrients into metabolites and biomass biofouling can be considered a biofilter in the wrong place a biofilter in the right place i e ahead of the system would remove organic carbon and thus limiting biofilm growth behind the biofilter this has first been demonstrated by griebe and flemming 1998 and was successfully applied in membrane and cooling systems e g meesters et al 2003 gule et al 2016 moreira et al 2016 manalo and nishijima 2018 and expanded by phosphate vrouwenvelder et al 2010 bucs et al 2014 kim et al 2014 and nitrogen limitation hwang et al 2010 ahead of membrane systems a comprehensive approach is the application of the water safety plan wsp principles who 2010 the big advantage is that this embraces the entire system including all raw materials installations and processes the procedure appears laborious but is well established and very successful 4 3 3 low adhesion antifouling easy to clean surfaces the surface energy of the substratum is one of the most relevant physico chemical parameters influencing settlement and adhesion strength of fouling lejars et al 2012 antifouling strategies employing coatings which cannot prevent but delay biofilm formation bucs et al 2018 giessler et al 2006 such coatings fall into three main categories lejars et al 2012 swain 2017 i chemically active coatings which act on marine organisms by inhibiting or limiting their settlement using chemically active compounds releasing them in a controlled way usually as self polishing copolymer coatings based on aceylic or methacrylic copolymers or releasing biocides ii nontoxic coatings which inhibit the settlement of organisms or enhance the release of settled organisms without involving chemical reactions iii engineered microtopographical surfaces which are particularly sensitive to abiotic fouling and mechanical stress a comprehensive overview of the most common silicone containing and fluorine based fouling release coatings is provided by lejars et al 2012 in medical environments hydrogel silicones have been successfully employed peppas et al 2000 in every case ageing of coatings can represent a significant problem s√°nchez et al 2009 these coatings however have some limitations as already mentioned in table 2 they are particularly susceptible to fouling during stagnation periods some of them cast doubts over their long term durability adhesion to support and stability towards water and the impact of the surrounding environment such as ph value ionic strength and temperature lejars et al 2012 as biofilms tend to develop to much lesser thickness than e g macrofouling layers composed of larvae barnacles or diatoms they require higher shear stress which limits their application to rapidly flowing systems and cannot be washed off completely as already reported by characklis in 1990 a lesser considered aspect in design of water system is access to cleaning friendly surfaces at least with accessible control points which can be monitored this would make it much easier for curative cleaning and to prevent biofilms to develop into biofouling 4 3 4 surface monitoring biofouling occurs on surfaces therefore surfaces are the best target for early warning as well as for verification of cleaning success and anti biofilm strategies monitoring of biofilms and other deposits on surfaces is an attractive means for timely recognition of fouling layer development cleaning efficacy and success of anti fouling strategies from the beginning of anti fouling research so called coupons were employed mostly in side stream devices in which test surfaces were exposed to conditions as similar as possible to the main system e g rotational reactors van der wende et al 1989 or the robbins device implemented in the system ruseska et al 1982 the ideal monitoring device will provide fast and accurate information about site extent thickness nature biotic abiotic and kinetics of fouling layer development and does so in real time non destructively on line and cost effective flemming 2003 obviously this is a goal hard to meet the ideal monitoring technique allows for real time non destructive fast and accurate on line information about fouling layer buildup at a representative site which allows for distinguishing biofilms from abiotic foulants and suitable to extrapolation to larger parts of the system flemming 2003 jahnknecht and melo 2003 an interesting device has been suggested by pereira et al 2008 based on the response of biofilms and abiotic layers to nanovibrations developed in order to monitor heat exchanger fouling as well as food and beverage industries pereira and melo 2009 this device is now applied in practice on passive metals e g titanium or stainless steel probes have been developed which measure the electrochemical response to biofilm development commercially available devices e g bi0george licina et al 1999 or biox and alvim bruijs et al 2001 pavanello et al 2011 cristiani and perboni 2014 the probes are typically installed into a piping system heat exchanger water box cooling tower or side stream via a threaded connection however the interpretation of the signal requires considerable experience an optical sensor optiquad strathmann et al 2013 has been developed which employs the light reflectance of biofilms growing on the tip surface of optical fibers analysis of backscattered light allows to distinguish between biomass proteins and activity autofluorescence of nadh atp and abiotic material backscattered light at 800 nm after proof of principle sadly this device also falls into the category of dream devices although it works on line in line automatically and in real time but it is still waiting for resources to develop it into practical application an interesting approach is the canary cell sim et al 2015 2018 it was originally developed as a colloidal fouling monitor but it turned out that it is also capable of in situ in real time and non destructively monitoring biofilm growth employing ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr by periodic dosing of silica this technique can locate biofilms on the membrane surface based on the transmission and reflection of an ultrasonic wave travelling through a particular medium e g biofilm and reveals its specific characteristics the best progress into wider practical application so far has been achieved in membrane biofouling with side stream membrane fouling simulators vrouwenvelder et al 2006 j s kim et al 2018 subramani and hoek 2008 in practice it is usually the first module in which biofouling begins bucs et al 2018 similar to biological filters where most of the biological activity and thus microbial growth occurs just in the first sections of the filter they can be considered as representative for the first module this helps to avoid shutting down the process due to irreversible fouling bucs et al 2018 manalo and nishijima 2018 kerdi et al 2018 presented perforated spacers as creative solutions to avoid membrane biofouling the importance of monitoring systems cannot be emphasized strong enough monitoring allows for timely observation of biofilm development provide early warning and helps to keep biofilms below the threshold of interference in an economically feasible way this concept should be much more considered by fouling stricken industries the main components of a holistic anti fouling concept are shown in fig 5 5 conclusions it is possible to live with biofilms and all non fouling systems do so already because they are not sterile but the effects of their biofilms are still below the threshold of interference but most of them do not know how far below this threshold they are operating therefore it would be extremely interesting to investigate non fouled systems and determine the level of tolerable biofilms in the end however the organism always wins this was the essence of advice i received from kevin marshall my late mentor from the university of new south wales the key in anti fouling strategies is only to extend the time until the organism wins to achieve this solutions require a shift of paradigms away from killing towards coexistence with biofilms and away from the so much desired and published one shot solutions towards long term concepts it is strongly recommended to turn to integrated solutions building blocks for assembling such solutions are already at hand as illustrated in fig 5 this is where further research should be dedicated in particular for longer term sustainable solutions furthermore it would help to adopt procedures as standardized in water safety plans who 2010 and implement the above mentioned building blocks the benefit would be much more success in anti fouling and much less environmental damage by biocides disinfectants and other components which we do not want to further pollute our waters declaration of competing

18081,this study provided an overview of established and emerging nanomaterial nm enabled processes and devices for water disinfection for both centralized and decentralized systems in addition to a discussion of major disinfection mechanisms data on disinfection performance shortest contact time for complete disinfection and energy efficiency electrical energy per order eeo were collected enabling assessments firstly for disinfection processes and then for disinfection devices the nm enabled electro based disinfection process gained the highest disinfection efficiency with the lowest energy consumption compared with physical based peroxy based and photo based disinfection processes owing to the unique disinfection mechanism and the direct mean of translating energy input to microbes among the established disinfection devices e g the stirred the plug flow and the flow through reactor the flow through reactor with mesh membrane or 3 dimensional porous electrodes showed the highest disinfection performance and energy efficiency attributed to its highest mass transfer efficiency additionally we also summarized recent knowledge about current and potential nms separation and recovery methods as well as electrode strengthening and optimization strategies magnetic separation and robust immobilization anchoring and coating are feasible strategies to prompt the practical application of nm enabled disinfection devices magnetic separation effectively solved the problem for the separation of evenly distributed particle sized nms from microbial solution and robust immobilization increased the stability of nm modified electrodes and prevented these electrodes from degradation by hydraulic detachment and or electrochemical dissolution furthermore the study of computational fluid dynamics cfd was capable of simulating nm enabled devices which showed great potential for system optimization and reactor expansion in this overview we stressed the need to concern not only the treatment performance and energy efficiency of nm enabled disinfection processes and devices but also the overall feasibility of system construction and operation for practical application graphical abstract image 1 keywords water disinfection contact time electrical energy per order eeo mass transfer flow through system 1 introduction water is a basic human need during water utilization disinfection is an essential process to protect people from pathogenic infections and has been broadly applied for more than 100 years rutala and weber 2016 shannon et al 2008 however conventional water disinfection methods e g chlorination and uv radiation suffer from obvious drawbacks such as harmful disinfection byproducts dbps formation and pathogen regrowth guo et al 2015 li and mitch 2018 sedlak and von gunten 2011 alternative methods such as membrane filtration and ozonation also suffer from low throughput and intensive energy consumption al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 miklos et al 2018 additionally these current disinfection methods are commonly feasible for centralized systems whereas they are not easily applicable in developing areas where sanitation facilities and power supplies are not available liu et al 2019b thus there is an urgent need for a highly efficient reliable low energy consuming and easily applicable disinfection method for both centralized and decentralized systems nanomaterials nms such as silver nanoparticles carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide nanoparticles with unique biological electronic and or catalytic properties provide a viable and effective option for water disinfection alvarez et al 2018 mauter et al 2018 qu et al 2013b these nms involve new cell inactivation mechanisms such as free radical generation and cell structure decomposition which are capable of achieving microbial disinfection with low dbps formation and without pathogen regrowth li et al 2008 qu et al 2013a zhang et al 2019a the suitability of the nm enabled disinfection technology has also been recognized for decentralized application attributed to the flexible reactor design the low energy consumption and the great performance at small scales hodges et al 2018 lee et al 2010b to develop the high performance nm enabled disinfection system one not only needs to exploit unique disinfection processes enabled by anti microbial nms but also design novel nm enabled disinfection devices to improve the treatment efficiency and lifetime from this aspect there are three prerequisite factors need to be deliberated 1 rational developments of nm enabled disinfection processes based on novel antimicrobial mechanisms 2 feasible designs of nm enabled disinfection devices and 3 suitable strategies to recover nms and or improve the stability of nms various novel nm enabled disinfection processes have already achieved high treatment performance especially those involving photo catalytic and electrochemistry martinez huitle and brillas 2008 pelaez et al 2012 additionally an increasing number of new nm enabled disinfection processes i e physical photoelectro photothermal and electroporation based processes are continuously being reported by various researchers hayden et al 2010 ivanova et al 2013 kotnik et al 2015 loeb et al 2016 the huge amount of different studies and proposed processes pose an enormous challenge for a critical assessment of nm enabled disinfection processes thus it is essential to enable the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes based on their disinfection performance operational costs and the general feasibility i e resource use and eco toxicity caused by nms release however the study for such a comprehensive comparison of various nm enabled disinfection processes is still limited considering nms are not dissolved in the solution during disinfection processes commonly nm enabled disinfection devices are heterogeneous reactors instead of homogeneous reactors alvarez et al 2018 hodges et al 2018 due to the small particle size of nms microbial disinfection commonly happens near nms surface with the distance from several nanometers to micrometers huo et al 2018a liu et al 2014b thus the treatment efficiency of the nm enabled disinfection device is significantly impacted by the microbial mass transfer efficiency from the bulk solution to the nms surface it is therefore critical to design feasible disinfection devices to promote treatment efficiency however despite the large volume of publications dedicated to achieving disinfection with novel nms in a batch reactor at lab scale implementation in practical applications using feasible devices has been limited zhang et al 2019a to address this issue researchers made efforts to develop feasible nm enabled disinfection device for practical application and design various types of reactors such as the stirred the plug flow and the flow through reactor based on different disinfection processes gu et al 2019 loeb et al 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however due to the different experimental setup in different studies it is hard to make comprehensive assessments of those reported devices concerning the disinfection efficiency and energy consumption and thus studies for such assessments is severely limited after clarifying the necessity of assessments for both nm enabled disinfection processes and devices before practical application another huge challenge is the lack of feasible strategies for separation and recovery the applied nms or strengthening the insufficient stability of nanostructure due to the small particle size nms may release to effluents during the treatment process leading to considerable eco toxicity as well as a lowered disinfection performance and device lifetime dale et al 2015 lead et al 2018 sun et al 2016 although there are several strategies including magnetic recovery and facial coating have been proven effective for recovering or protecting nms these studies are limited and only applicable case by case huo et al 2019b yang et al 2016 thus it is critical to developing general and feasible strategies to recycle and or protect nms according to types of nm enabled disinfection processes and or devices such strategies can be general guidance for the future design of nm enabled disinfection systems whereas the related studies are severely limited with this in mind we overviewed the established and emerging nm enabled processes and devices for water disinfection as well as the current and potential nms separation recovery methods and electrode strengthening optimization strategies we first enabled critical assessments for different disinfection processes and devices based on the disinfection performance the shortest contact time required for complete disinfection and the operation cost the amount of electrical energy needed to decrease by one order of magnitude of the microbial concentration eeo from a technical standpoint we also provided recommendations for disinfection systems development and operation from a practical standpoint by reviewing the emerging nms recovery and electrode strengthening strategies 2 nm enabled innovative processes for water disinfection an overview of different established and emerging nm enabled disinfection processes was given in fig 1 categorized into physical based peroxy based photo based and electro based nm enabled disinfection processes however it is noteworthy that this classification scheme should not be viewed as strict since several processes involve different disinfection mechanisms and thus could be assigned to various categories in the following sections the current status of nm enabled disinfection processes was reviewed major mechanisms for microbial inactivation were illustrated and constraints of different processes were briefly discussed furthermore at the end of this part comprehensive assessments of various disinfection processes were made based on the treatment efficiency and energy consumption a more critical overview and perspective on system design and nms recovery and strengthening were discussed separately in sections 3 and 4 2 1 nm enabled physical based disinfection process the nm enabled physical based disinfection process commonly achieves microbial inactivation relying on the physical contact of antimicrobial nms to microbes e g bacteria and viruses kang et al 2007 lee et al 2008 loo et al 2013 antimicrobial nms directly interact with the microbes enabling microbial inactivation by interrupting transmembrane electron transfer disrupting penetrating the microbial envelope membranes for bacteria and capsids for viruses or oxidizing microbial components such as protein and dna rna loo et al 2015 lyon and alvarez 2008 xiu et al 2012 additionally some of these nms also generate secondary products e g dissolved heavy metal ions and reactive oxygen species ros that cause microbial damage without any other input e g chemical photo or electric input cheng et al 2014 li et al 2010 because of this specific disinfection mechanism of physical contact and no demand for other input this type of disinfection process was classified as the physical based disinfection process the latest antimicrobial nms involving in the physical based nm enabled disinfection process mainly fall into two general categories carbon based and metal based antimicrobial nms 2 1 1 carbon based antimicrobial nms carbon based antimicrobial nms involving in the physical based disinfection process include carbon nanotubes cnts graphene and mxene and their antibacterial activities are mainly attributed to their unique sharp structures tips or edges alimohammadi et al 2018 kang et al 2007 other carbon based nms such as fullerenes c60 and g c3n4 showing strong antimicrobial activity attributed to the photochemical properties are not classified into the physical based disinfection process and will be discussed in the section of nm enabled photo based disinfection process li et al 2016 lyon and alvarez 2008 cnts can be either single walled swnts a single pipe with a diameter from 1 to 5 nm or multi walled mwnts a nested tubes structure with lengths from 100 nm to 100 Œºm vecitis et al 2010 several studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of swnts and mwnts toward bacteria brady est√© vez et al 2010a b swnts will firstly contact microbes resulting in membrane perturbation and the release of intracellular contents another disinfection mechanism of swnt is cellular oxidative stress due to the contact between swnts and cytoplasm and the cellular oxidative stress tends to be impacted by the electronic structure of swnt i e swnts with a higher percentage of metallic showing higher toxicity vecitis et al 2010 as for mwnts one major disinfection mechanism was confirmed to be the membrane stress which is caused by the direct mwnt microbe contact brady est√© vez et al 2010a b kang et al 2008 additionally the structure of mwnt can also contribute to microbial removal the removal of bacteria by swcnts mwcnts filters was confirmed to microbial inactivation by the top layer of swcnts followed by depth filtration by the mwcnts layer brady est√© vez et al 2010a b furthermore the adsorption of microbes bacteria and viruses onto cnts attributed to the hydrophobicity is another crucial factor influencing cnts antimicrobial properties rahaman et al 2012 cnts can be immobilized on the membrane as a filter and enables microbial removal by adsorption which extends the application potential for the cnt based disinfection process smith and rodrigues 2015 the graphene including graphene graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo the one atom thick two dimensional 2d carbon layer and the mxene a family of two dimensional materials consisted of transition metal carbides and nitrides show the similar antibacterial mechanisms to those of cnts castro neto et al 2009 naguib et al 2014 perreault et al 2015 the sharp edges of graphene go rgo and mxene 10 nm are capable of piercing the cell membrane which damages membrane structure and triggers the oxidation stress of the cell alimohammadi et al 2018 rasool et al 2016 2017 additionally the smaller sheet sizes of graphene go and rgo can further increase the antimicrobial activity of the material perreault et al 2015 it is noteworthy that researchers mainly focus on the disinfection performance of mxene toward bacteria whereas the study of virus disinfection using mxene is severely limited thus the research for virus disinfection using mxene should be further exploited in the future 2 1 2 metal based antimicrobial nms silver nanoparticles agnps are the most commonly used metal based antimicrobial nms and have broad applications in water disinfection gunawan et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 to date several mechanisms have been proposed for the antimicrobial property of agnps 1 adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell surface altering the membrane properties for bacteria 2 agnps penetrating inside microbes resulting in dna rna and or protein damage for both bacteria and viruses and 3 agnps serving as a vehicle to deliver released ag more effectively to the cellular cytoplasm for bacteria rai et al 2009 xiu et al 2012 agnps are also introduced to other disinfection processes such as photo and electro based disinfection to enable high performance microbial inactivation with synergistic mechanisms which will be discussed in the following section systematically ma et al 2016a tan et al 2018 wen et al 2017 additionally copper based nms are also applied in water disinfection widely the released copper ions cu2 shows obvious toxicity towards both bacteria and viruses which enables highly efficient disinfection aarestrup and hasman 2004 yu sen et al 1998 furthermore the copper based nms can also be introduced into the photo and the electro based disinfection processes and achieve disinfection with synergistic mechanisms which will be discussed in the following section systematically fisher et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi or iron nanoparticles fenps showed strong redox activity attributed to its special zero valence fe0 and has been investigated as a new tool for the treatment of contaminated water and soil crane and scott 2012 attributed to the strong reducing conditions at the nzvi surface and oxidative damage from intracellular ros produced from fenton s chemistry nzvi enables decomposition of microbial envelope membranes for bacteria and capsids for viruses as well as protein and dna rna in microbes both bacteria and viruses cheng et al 2014 hu et al 2019 li et al 2010 both carbon based and metal based antimicrobial nms have shown their potential for water disinfection at the laboratory scale considering the disinfection mechanism of direct contact usually these antimicrobial nms are completely mixed with the microbes in a batch reactor to achieve disinfection thus the full scale application is limited due to the lack of feasible strategies for nms separation and recovery although some studies reported the immobilization of nms on electrodes to prompt the potential value for practical application at industrial scale the inevitable nms release and or the relatively low disinfection efficiency still pose a great challenge loo et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 thus the rational electrode strengthening strategy is critical for exploring the potential value for the real world application of the nm immobilization process and will be discussed in the following section systematically membrane immobilization is another common strategy for achieving physical based disinfection and has shown the potential for practical application chen et al 2019 rahaman et al 2012 furthermore the solubility of carbon based nms in water is also a critical concern due to the unique hydrophobic feature cnts tend to aggregate severely when exists in water glomstad et al 2018 thus the functional process for modifying the hydrophobic property of carbon based nms is critically important and can be a criterion for developing the carbon based nm enabled disinfection process and improving the disinfection efficiency 2 2 nm enabled peroxy based disinfection process the peroxy based disinfection process is commonly based on the mechanism that some weak oxidants i e fe2 fe3 and persulfates can be activated under certain conditions in the present of h2o2 or metal oxides catalyst to generate highly reactive radicals for water disinfection hodges et al 2018 miklos et al 2018 the fenton and the persulfates processes are two typical peroxy based disinfection processes that have been well studied for water disinfection traditionally the fenton approach involves activation of h2o2 to generate oh through catalytic reaction with the dissolved fe2 fe3 redox pair however the application of conventional fenton process is hindered by 1 the acid condition required for oh production 2 the accumulation of iron sludge after neutralization due to the high dosage of iron salts and 3 speed limitation step of the slow fe3 to fe2 reduction kinetics hodges et al 2018 yang et al 2013 heterogeneous fenton processes which frequently rely on nanoscale transition metal catalysts have thus been developed to overcome these limitations for example mos2 nanosheets were found to serve as the co catalyst and facilitate efficient fe3 to fe2 reduction by the exposed mo4 active sites which significantly enhanced the oh production liu et al 2018 the mos2 nanosheets can prompt the high performance fenton disinfection by mixed with the microbial solution completely or immobilization on the electrode surface liu et al 2018 iron oxide nanoparticles mixed with silica nanoparticles or carbon based nanomaterials cnts and graphene enabled highly efficient fenton process in neutral ph conditions when nms were mixed in the solution or immobilized on electrodes the high disinfection efficiency is attributed to the efficient electron transfer on the incorporation of carbonaceous materials nieto juarez et al 2010 ruales lonfat et al 2015 attributed to the higher oh production efficiency the nm enabled fenton process can achieve high performance disinfection with less dosage of iron salts input which results in no significant iron sludge formation during the treatment process persulfates are considered inexpensive and relatively stable oxidants for the generation of sulfate radicals so4 ahn et al 2013 assisted by the transition metal oxides with high redox activity such as co3o4 cuo and fe3o4 persulfates can be activated effectively for so4 generation and enables a high disinfection performance when nms are mixed in the solution or immobilized on electrodes chen et al 2008 lei et al 2015 yan et al 2011 although nms prompt the disinfection performance of fenton and persulfates based disinfection processes and meanwhile expand application conditions such as broader ph ranges the inevitable externally supplied chemicals call into question the suitability of this technique for practical application h2o2 is a necessary chemical input 10 mg l 1 during the fenton process which sets obstacles for practical application due to the limitation of storage transport and continual dosing ruales lonfat et al 2016 additionally as an oxidizing agent h2o2 may contribute to biotoxicity due to its oxidation property which impacts the safety of portable drinking or disturbs the ecosystem of the discharged water salla et al 2016 for persulfates added nanoscale transition metal oxides such as co3o4 and cuo may cause the release of heavy metals such as co2 or cu2 which are hazardous to the environment whereas the study to recycle and reuse of these nanoscale catalysts is still limited to overcome these obstacles some studies reported in situ h2o2 generation strategies by electrochemical methods to offer practical advantages by eliminating the need for externally supplied chemicals yang et al 2019 however the study for a comprehensive assessment of operational parameters to fully analyze its cost benefit is still limited 2 3 nm enabled photo based disinfection process some nms can be activated by light irradiation and show unique properties such as charges production using nanoscale photocatalysts and or photoelectrocatalysts and temperature increment using nanoscale photothermal catalysts which offers new opportunities for water disinfection jung et al 2018 paracchino et al 2011 twilton et al 2017 to date several photo based nm enabled disinfection processes including photocatalysis photoelectro and photothermal based disinfection processes have been developed to achieve high performance microbial inactivation these photo based nanoscale catalysts and photo based nm enabled disinfection processes will be reviewed in the following section systematically 2 3 1 nm enabled photocatalysis based disinfection process in a typical photocatalysis disinfection process wide bandgap semiconductor nanoparticles are photoexcited by light irradiation uv light and or visible light to separate charges and form a conduction band electron e cb and valence band hole h vb hodges et al 2018 these activated semiconductors react with o2 in water to generate a series of powerful ros including h o2 ho2 oh 1o2 and h2o2 for water disinfection zhang et al 2019a p25 tio2 a commercial powder of anatase rutile mixed phase nanoparticles is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts and has been explored for photocatalytic water disinfection over decades attributed to the high surface area and enhanced charge separation by the anatase rutile phase boundary heterojunctions p25 has relatively strong photocatalytic activity hurum et al 2003 matsunaga et al 1985 zhang et al 1998 however the practical application of p25 for microbial disinfection is hindered by 1 the wide bandgap of tio2 3 2 and 3 0 ev for anatase and rutile restricting the light source in uv range that accounts for 4 of solar energy 2 particle aggregation and 3 photocatalyst separation from the treated water to promote the practical application of the photocatalysis disinfection process research has extensively focused on developing new materials or devices for more efficient microbial inactivation and nms recovery firstly researchers improved the antimicrobial activity of tio2 under uv irradiation through the metallic co catalysts e g pt pd and au modification chen et al 2010 sakthivel et al 2004 the junctions between tio2 and these metallic co catalysts serve as effective electron sinks and facilitate charge transfer across the resulting schottky barrier for improving the photocatalytic activity chen et al 2010 secondly the development of visible light photocatalysis is also a feasible strategy to prompt the practical application of photocatalysis disinfection attributed to narrow bandgaps which enabling e cb h vb pair formation with lower energy light catalyzes such as bismuth based biox bivo4 tungsten based bi2wo6 silver based agbr and carbon based g c3n4 cationic amino c60 nms can be activated by the visible light cao et al 2012 hu et al 2010 lee et al 2010a yu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 however due to irregular choices of visible light sources it is difficult to enable a comprehensive assessment to analyze the real impact of these developments additionally the application of visible light photocatalysis is further limited by the low ros generation efficiency when using lamp excitation and the large area footprint needed for solar harvesting when using solar irradiation most studies of the photocatalysis disinfection process only reported the feasibility of the antimicrobial activity for nm enabled catalyzes at the laboratory scale whereas the practical application was limited due to the lack of feasible strategies for nms separation and recovery strategies of catalyzes immobilization on bulk components e g electrode and magnetic separation have been explored but their practical feasibility remains questionable due to the relatively low mass transfer efficiency and or the low recovery rate he et al 2019 lee et al 2010a 2 3 2 nm enabled photoelectro based disinfection process typically a photoelectro based disinfection process is based on a semiconductor liquid junction firstly the minority charges e cb and h vb are generated by light irradiation on the semiconductor then these charges are driven into the solution by the electric field at the junction and further produces ros for microbial disinfection adhikari et al 2018 paracchino et al 2011 the nanoscale transition metal oxides including cu2o zno and tio2 have been confirmed feasible for photoelectro based disinfection with relatively low applied voltage 2 0 v vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe and high disinfection efficiency kang et al 2010 liu et al 2017b pablos et al 2017 different from catalysts in photocatalysis based process commonly dispersed evenly in microbial solution catalysts in photoelectro based process are usually fabricated or immobilized on the planar electrode which significantly alleviates the problems of nms separation and recovery although the photoelectro based disinfection shows great potential for the practical application problems of its low energy conversion efficiency and the low mass transfer rate of panel electrodes require more attention the rational and feasible nm enabled disinfection device such as the flow through device with membranes or porous electrodes will improve the mass transfer and will be reviewed systematically in section 3 2 3 3 nm enabled photothermal disinfection process with the solar irradiation nanoscale photothermal materials can convert solar energy to thermal heating and increase the localized temperature near the nms surface effectively huang et al 2006 lal et al 2008 the increased localized heating achieves high performance disinfection toward both bacteria and viruses without substantially raising the bulk temperature of the water the temperature of the bulk solution only increases for several degrees loeb et al 2017 2019 several nanoscale photothermal materials including carbon based materials carbon black cnts and graphene metal au nanoparticles and metal compound ti2o3 nanoparticles and prussian blue nanocages have been confirmed feasible for effective light capture and localized heating generation lal et al 2008 wang 2018 au nanorod carbon black composite materials were firstly applied to achieve photothermal disinfection by completely mixed in the microbial solution and the immobilization approach anchoring the materials on the surface of commercial films and membranes further achieved high performance disinfection and extended the application potential loeb et al 2017 2019 however the feasibility for real world application of nm enabled photothermal disinfection is still questionable due to the high material fabrication cost the large area footprint required for light harvesting and the low mass transfer efficiency for microbes to nms surface the rational strategy for device designing shows the potential to improve mass transfer efficiency and will be reviewed systematically in section 3 additionally the disinfection performance of thermo resistant microbes may also become a concern for the practical application 2 4 nm enabled electro based disinfection process when applied with the external electric potential some nms enable ros generation and or local electric fields enhancement attributed to their unique electrochemical catalytic properties and or physical high conductivity and sharp structure properties ghasemian et al 2017 huo et al 2016 vecitis et al 2011 the local electric field enhancement relies on the lightning rod effect which occurs when a metallic rod is inserted into a region of a uniform electric field rojas chapana et al 2004 the electric field strength near the tip of the metallic rod can be enhanced with a degree with a positive correlation to the aspect ratio of the metallic rod rojas chapana et al 2004 based on these unique mechanisms the electro based disinfection processes are categorized into electrochemical and non electrochemical processes and have been confirmed feasible for high performance water disinfection 2 4 1 nm enabled electrochemical disinfection process the electrochemical disinfection process offers a direct and effective way for the energy transfer to microbes in water hodges et al 2018 electrochemical oxidation toward microbes is the dominant disinfection mechanism which can occur directly through charge transfer at the electrode surface i e direct oxidation as well as indirectly through reactions with electrochemically generated oxidants i e indirect oxidation liu et al 2019a vecitis et al 2011 yang and hoffmann 2016 the direct oxidation disinfection is postulated a two step process 1 deposition or adsorption of the microbes onto electrodes and 2 oxidation of the microbes by electrons transfer which interrupts transmembrane electron transfer and triggers cellular oxidative stress vecitis et al 2011 during the direct oxidation disinfection process the microbe electrode contact is the speed limited step whereas the conventional panel electrode cannot offer a sufficient surface area for highly efficient microbe deposition thus nm modified flow through electrodes e g ag nanowires modified membrane and cnts membrane have been studied to improve treatment rates chen et al 2019 rahaman et al 2012 however problems of forming harmful cl2 dbps in complex water matrices as well as high fabrication cost and membrane fouling requires more attention in an indirect oxidation disinfection process specific nm modified electrodes including boron doped diamond bdd sno2 pbo2 ruo2 and sub stoichiometric and doped tio2 electrodes are used as anode materials to in situ generate highly reactive ros such as oh and cl for water disinfection jeong et al 2009 kerwick et al 2005 moreno andr√©s et al 2018 one major challenge however is to transfer the generated radicals into the bulk water solution to react with target microbes additionally the application of the indirect electrochemical oxidation is also limited by the high electrode production cost as well as the intensive energy consumption and the formation of harmful dbps due to reactions between the generated cl2 and organic matters in the real wastewater hodges et al 2018 furthermore electrochemical oxidation only occurs at anode surfaces while the potential for cathodic reactions is mostly unused 2 4 2 nm enabled electroporation disinfection process electroporation a physical process relying on a strong electric field to damage microbial envelope membranes for bacteria and capsids for viruses offers new opportunities for water disinfection and can be a promising substitute to reduce the chemical demand of conventional water disinfection methods kotnik et al 2015 liu et al 2014a attributed to the phenomenon that nanowires such as ag cuo and zno nanowires can enhance the local electric field significantly 107 v m 1 with low voltages as low as 1 v a nanowire assisted electroporation disinfection technology has been confirmed feasible for effective water disinfection huo et al 2017 schoen et al 2010 tian et al 2017 benefited from the physical disinfection mechanism the nanowire assisted electroporation disinfection process shows high microbial inactivation efficiency and broad spectrum effective to all pathogens including bacteria model bacteria and real wastewater and viruses ms2 without any chemical consumption huo et al 2017 liu et al 2014a additionally no microbe regrow during the storage process afterward huo et al 2016 furthermore attributed to the low operation voltage 1 v no cl2 is generated which ensures the low formation potential of harmful dbps however the electrode degradation including both hydraulic detachment and electrochemical dissolution reduces the electrode lifetime and releases hazardous materials such as heavy metals to the effluent which poses a great obstacle for the practical application huo et al 2019a liu et al 2014a 2 5 assessment and comparison of nm enabled disinfection processes after a brief overview of established nm enabled disinfection processes it is important to enabling assessments and comparisons between different disinfection processes based on 1 the disinfection performance 2 and the energy consumption to set up general guidelines for the future research the shortest contact time or hydraulic retention time hrt needed for achieving complete disinfection i e no live microbes in effluent can be used for the evaluation of disinfection capability and upper limitation liu et al 2013 2014a martinez huitle and brillas 2008 miao et al 2019 it is noteworthy that to analyze the treatment efficiency of disinfection processes in laboratories easily researchers often apply cultivable model microbes such as escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis to represent bacteria and ms2 to represent viruses to investigate the treatment capacity researchers commonly disperse these model microbes in water with relatively high concentrations 107 to 109 colony forming units ml 1 or plaque forming unit ml 1 cfu or pfu ml 1 as the tested microbial solution and test the shortest contact time for complete disinfection because the kinetics of microbial inactivation assessed by nms can often be described as the pseudo first order model the contact time needed for each microbial log removal is similar if the initial concentration varies from 107 to 109 cfu or pfu ml 1 theoretically the contact time for removing 109 microbes is 1 9 7 100 28 higher than the contact time for removing 107 microbes thus although the difference of microbial concentration may contribute to the variability of the overviewed contact time for each disinfection process it s unlikely to induce significant differences between different disinfection processes with different disinfection mechanisms to further investigate the impact of microbial types bacteria and viruses to the disinfection efficiency we analyzed the contact time needed for viruses inactivation separately and compared it with the contact time for the overall microbial bacteria plus viruses inactivation contact times needed for viruses inactivation did not introduce a significant variability to each nm enabled disinfection technology fig s1 it is possible that for each disinfection technology bacteria and viruses share similar inactivation mechanisms for example disinfection processes using metal based antimicrobial nms such as agnps release harmful ions which may damage the microbial protein and dna rna structure and the ros depended nm enabled disinfection processes generate ros to damage the microbial protein and dna rna structure for disinfection although bacteria and viruses have different microbial structures their cell structures are very simple and share similar basic and essential substances for living such as protein and dna rna thus for each nm enabled disinfection process the disinfection efficiency of viruses may not show a significant difference compared with the overall microbial disinfection efficiency fig s1 and the comparison of disinfection efficiency between different processes is reasonable and feasible the impact of different types of model microbial strains to the distinction efficiency was also investigated e coli is the most commonly used model bacterium in researches of nm enabled disinfection some other bacteria strains such as enterococcus faecalis salmonella enterica and bacillus subtilis are also tested huo et al 2018c liu et al 2013 2014a the major difference between these model bacteria is their membrane structure some of them are gram positive while others are gram negative strains gram positive bacteria have a thicker layer of peptidoglycan than gram negative bacteria which leads to a higher resistance to disinfection liu et al 2014a however different bacteria strains will not introduce significant data variability according to the reported research and thus will not impact the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes for viruses disinfection the bacteriophage ms2 is the most commonly used model virus and the bacteriophage f2 is also applied in some studies cheng et al 2014 attributed to the similar structure of ms2 and f2 the type of viruses did not introduce significant data variability and will not impact the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes to enable the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes the data variability introduced by different water quality parameters was also investigated many researchers have investigated the impact of water quality on the nm enabled disinfection efficiency using the synthetic water sample water quality parameters were controlled within a reasonable range ph from 6 to 8 temperature around 15 c and ionic strength from 10 to 100 mm to simulate the water quality of drinking water and or wastewater watts et al observed that the ros depended microbial disinfection processes were not affected significantly by changing ph watts et al 1995 additionally impacts of ph and ionic strength were confirmed to be non significant for electro based disinfection processes huo et al 2018b rahaman et al 2012 while some results were obtained that changing water quality parameters may impact the disinfection efficiency those impacts are less significant than the impact introduced by different disinfection mechanisms zhang et al 2019a thus the impact of different water quality parameters such as ph temperature and ionic strength is not significant and will not affect the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes for the impact of organic matters in the water due to the lack of standardized experimental protocol for simulating organic matters in real water wastewater conditions we did not include studies involving the impact of organic matters for comparison between different disinfection processes instead we have discussed the impact of organic matters on the disinfection efficiency separately and systematically in section 4 except for the physical based and part of the peroxy based disinfection processes reported nm enabled disinfection processes commonly require electrical energy input during the treatment process which often represents a major fraction of energy consumption and operation cost because the kinetics of microbial inactivation assessed by nms can often be described as the pseudo first order model the electrical energy consumption scaled with the volume and treatment goals described as the electrical energy per order eeo can be calculated and applied for the assessment of energy consumption bolton et al 1996 eeo represents the amount of electrical energy needed to decrease by one order of magnitude of the microbial concentration and the calculation method of eeo for different disinfection processes is illustrated in table s1 sholtes and linden 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2 5 1 assessment and comparison of nm enabled disinfection processes based on contact time the shortest contact time required for the complete disinfection for different nm enabled disinfection processes from literature data were summarized in fig 2 as box plots and sorted by the median value reported contact times of each nm enabled disinfection process varied for several orders of magnitudes such data variability is likely due to different nms and types of reactors applied in each kind of disinfection process furthermore the complex water matrix may also impact the ros generation efficiency which affected the disinfection performance and aggravated the data variability additionally the difference in type and concentration of treated microbes also induced the data variability however the variability introduced by microbial types and water qualities is not significant for each nm enabled disinfection process and will not impact the assessment between different disinfection processes due to the different disinfection mechanisms significant differences between different disinfection processes can be observed from the literature study based on the median value of contact time nm enabled disinfection processes can be classified into three groups processes with median contact time 100 min physical based group 1 contact time between 20 and 100 min photocatalysis photoelectro peroxy photothermal and indirect electrochemical based group 2 and contact time 10 min direct electrochemical and electroporation based group 3 the significant differences in contact time for each group are partly caused by the different disinfection mechanisms in group 1 the relatively long contact time 107 min required for complete disinfection indicated low disinfection efficiency of the physical based disinfection process the physical based disinfection highly relies on the microbe nms direct contact as well as the reaction between microbes and nms afterward which required a specific period for sufficient cytotoxicity these two steps lead to relatively low disinfection efficiency and long contact time for complete disinfection kang et al 2007 vecitis et al 2010 nms applied in the physical based disinfection process can be both mixed completely in the microbial solution or immobilized on electrodes or membranes it is noteworthy that attributed to the feasible design of disinfection device e g flow through reactor the treatment efficiency of the physical based disinfection process can be improved significantly and the shortest contact time for complete disinfection can be as low as 1 min loo et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 thus the impact of device design including electrode or membrane immobilization is also important and will be discussed systematically in section 3 disinfection processes in group 2 commonly rely on ros production or intensive heating near nms surface to achieve microbial inactivation attributed to the relatively intensive reaction of ros or surface heating toward microbes the disinfection processes in group 2 gained higher disinfection efficiencies than those in group 1 fig 2 in group 2 the indirect electrochemical based disinfection process showed the highest disinfection efficiency with the contact time of 15 min followed by photothermal peroxy photocatalysis and photocatalysis based processes with the contact time of 25 41 66 and 78 min respectively the difference in disinfection efficiency among various processes is likely due to the ros or local heating generation efficiency owing to the direct means of translating energy input to microbes the indirect electrochemical based disinfection process gained the highest ros generation efficiency in group 2 leading to a high disinfection performance hodges et al 2018 while the photo based disinfection process showed a relatively low ros generation efficiency due to its unique light activation mechanism which resulted in a lowered disinfection performance bessegato et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a the disinfection processes in group 3 i e direct electrochemical and electroporation based disinfection showed the highest disinfection efficiency with the significantly lowered contact time 1 5 and 0 1 min compared with other nm enabled disinfection processes attributed to unique disinfection mechanisms electron transfer or membrane damage caused by the strong electric field microbes will be inactivated immediately after contacting the electrode or entering the area with the sufficient electric field which resulted in a high disinfection efficiency huo et al 2016 vecitis et al 2011 additionally with the help of the feasible design of disinfection devices e g flow through reactor the microbes will transfer from the bulk solution to the electrode surface effectively this also leads to a significantly improved disinfection efficiency compared with those of physical based group 1 and ros surface heating based disinfection processes group 2 liu et al 2019a radjenovic and sedlak 2015 2 5 2 comparison of nm enabled disinfection processes based on eeo the eeo value for different nm enabled disinfection processes from literature data was summarized in fig 3 as box plots and sorted by the median value it should be noted that except for the additional energy demand for chemicals or catalysts only electric energy consumption is reflected within eeo thus the physical based and some peroxy based disinfection processes showed no eeo value as shown in fig 3 eeo values of photo based disinfection processes including photocatalysis photoelectro and photothermal based processes are higher than those of electro based disinfection processes including electrochemical both direct and indirect and electroporation based disinfection processes because the light activation either uv or visible light is the prerequisite definition of photo based disinfection the photo based disinfection showed a low energy efficiency and higher energy consumption than those of electro based disinfection processes additionally due to a large number of developed photocatalysts and the inconsistent choice of lamps especially for visible excitation sources in different studies the reported eeo value for photocatalysis based disinfection varied for several orders of magnitudes in fact most photocatalytic studies report only novel catalysts enabling disinfection at the laboratory scale using the stirred reactor which has not made a significant improvement of disinfection performance and energy efficiency electro based disinfection processes including electrochemical both direct and indirect and electroporation based disinfection processes offer the direct means of translating energy input to microbes and thus lead to higher energy efficiencies with lowered eeo values attributed to the unique disinfection mechanisms relying on electron transfer or membrane damage by a strong electric field the direct electrochemical and electroporation based disinfection showed an even lowered eeo 0 002 and 0 00005 kw h m 3 order 1 compared with the indirect electrochemical based disinfection 4 3 kw h m 3 order 1 whose disinfection mechanism is ros dependent additionally eeo values of direct electrochemical and electroporation based disinfection processes were also significantly lower than that of the conventional energy efficient disinfection methods such as low pressure uv disinfection technology 0 005 kw h m 3 order 1 e coli for 3 log inactivation li et al 2017 sholtes and linden 2019 such low energy consumption increases the potential value for decentralized water treatments in regions without developed infrastructures 3 nm enabled innovative devices for water disinfection an overview of established devices applied in nm enabled disinfection was shown in fig 4 categorized into 1 stirred reactor 2 plug flow reactor and 3 flow through reactor in this section the structure of each nm enabled disinfection device was reviewed the applicable disinfection processes for each type of device were summarized and the advantages and limitations of different devices were briefly discussed furthermore at the end of this part comprehensive assessments of various nm enabled disinfection devices were made based on the disinfection performance and energy efficiency 3 1 stirred reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection the stirred reactor can be classified into two groups based on the operation mode of nms 1 complete mixing stirred reactor with particle sized mns complete mixed with microbes and 2 electrode stirred reactor with nanostructures immobilized or grown on panel electrodes fig 4 the complete mixing stirred reactor is feasible for physical based peroxy based photocatalysis based and photothermal based disinfection attributed to the feature that evenly distributed particle sized nms ensures the microbe nms contact and light transmission efficiency the complete mixing stirred reactor has become the predominant choice for photocatalysis based disinfection table 1 gollavelli et al 2013 loeb et al 2017 ma et al 2016b xia et al 2017 however the complete mixing stirred reactor has been criticized for having limited potential value to the practical application the most commonly applied nms recovery method in complete mixing stirred reactor membrane recovery is not feasible for the large scale treatment due to the low recovery rate and the severe particle aggregation in fact most studies only focus on the antimicrobial nms rather than the reactor optimization methods to improve the disinfection efficiency and are mostly implemented at the laboratory scale different from the complete mixing stirred reactor where nms and microbes are evenly distributed in the electrode stirred reactor only microbes are mixed in the reactor while nanostructures are immobilized on a panel electrode which solves the problem for nms separation attributed to its easily applicable feature the electrode stirred reactor is feasible for most of the nm enabled disinfection processes and is one of the widest applied types of the reactor table 1 however due to the required space between two electrodes for stirring microbial solution using paddles or rotors a relatively long distance for microbes approaching electrodes is required commonly 5 cm which hinders the disinfection efficiency and enlarges the area footprint for device construction baghriche et al 2015 xie et al 2018 additionally the mass transfer rate for both complete mixing stirred reactor and electrode stirred reactor is relatively low with the coefficient 10 6 m s 1 leading to a lowered disinfection efficiency and an increased eeo value anglada et al 2010 3 2 plug flow reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection the plug flow reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection commonly includes two nms modified panel electrodes and the microbial solution can flow through continuously between these electrodes fig 4 microbial inactivation occurs directly through microbe electrode contact charge transfer or the strong electric field at the electrode surface as well as indirectly through ros reactions thus the plug flow reactor is feasible for most of the nm enabled disinfection processes and has been selected as the predominant choice for achieving indirect electrochemical based disinfection table 1 the distance between two electrodes in the plug flow reactor is relatively short 5 10 mm which guarantees a higher mass transfer efficiency 10 5 m s 1 than that of stirred reactor 10 6 m s 1 and leads to a better disinfection performance anglada et al 2010 cano et al 2016 feng et al 2004 pablos et al 2017 furthermore the suitability of the plug flow reactor for the practical application has also been recognized attributed to its feasibility for long term operation without maintenance and potential for automated control by adjusting operation conditions according to water qualities however the short distance between electrodes leads to a huge demand for electrode material for device construction which results in high electrode fabrication costs additionally the upper limit of mass transfer in the plug flow reactor further hinders the high performance disinfection for the practical application 3 3 flow through reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection considering that nm enabled disinfection processes are mostly heterogeneous processes the design of reactors with sufficient treatment rates is an impending challenge in the face of mass transfer limitations simple stirred and plug flow reactors do not provide sufficient microbe nms contact area thus flow through devices with membrane or porous electrodes fig 4 have been studied to improve treatment rates involving mesh based electrode or membrane including ti mesh and cnt membrane as well as 3 dimensional 3d porous electrode including carbon based and metal foam based porous materials gu et al 2019 guo et al 2016 liu et al 2019a in the nm enabled flow through disinfection device microbial solution flow perpendicular to and through the membrane or porous electrodes with a superior mass transfer rate 10 4 m s 1 compared with those of stirred and plug flow reactor which overcomes mass transfer limitations anglada et al 2010 the flow through electrode with micro channels 5 500 Œºm acting as micro reactors are widely applied in physical photo and electro based disinfection processes table 1 huo et al 2016 wang et al 2018 mesh electrodes and some carbon based membrane electrodes e g carbon cloth with thin thicknesses 5 mm show great potential for the photoelectro based disinfection and have achieved a significantly improved ros generation efficiency compared with those of stirred and plug flow reactors gu et al 2019 gu reported a rational strategy using flow through photoanodes zno nanorod modified carbon cloth for effection ros generation during the photoelectrocatalytic process the ros generation performance was evaluated using degradation kinetics of specific organic matters compared to traditional planar photoanodes flow through photoanodes exhibited 4 times for rhodamine b and 3 times for bisphenol a higher degradation kinetics indicating a significantly improved ros generation efficiency gu et al 2019 as for 3d porous electrodes their highly porous networks offer a large surface area with numerous active sites increasing the opportunity for microbes to approach the electrode surface and react with nms which improves the disinfection performance vecitis et al 2011 owing to the high disinfection efficiency and the high throughput the 3d porous electrodes applied in flow through disinfection devices have been confirmed feasible for the physical based and electro based disinfection processes table 1 and showed great potential for practical application however problems of electrode degradation due to hydraulic erosion as well as electrode clogging caused by microbes or other substances in real water requires more attention 3 4 assessment and comparison of nm enabled disinfection devices to set up critical guidance for device selection and construction for future study it is important to enabling assessments for different nm enabled disinfection devices the shortest contact time required for complete disinfection and the eeo value of each nm enabled disinfection technology were summarized and categorized based on the type of device i e stirred reactor plug flow reactor and flow through reactor as shown in fig 5 the reviewed disinfection technologies were separated into three groups which interestingly are consistent with the type of device the flow through reactor gained the shortest contact time for complete disinfection median value of 0 1 min indicating the highest disinfection efficiency fig 6 while the plug flow reactor and the stirred reactor showed longer contact times of 13 and 62 min respectively fig 6 confirming a lowered disinfection efficiency additionally the flow through reactor showed the lowest eeo value 0 002 kw h m 3 order 1 indicating the highest energy efficiency while the plug flow and the stirred reactor showed higher eeo values of 76 and 1123 kw h m 3 order 1 indicating the intensive energy consumption fig 7 attributed to the highest mass transfer rate for microbes approaching the electrode surface the flow through reactor showed the highest disinfection efficiency contact time of 0 1 min with the lowest energy consumption eeo value of 0 002 kw h m 3 order 1 it is noteworthy that the flow through reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection gained a comparable or even better disinfection performance and energy efficiency compared with the conventional low pressure uv technology a conventional fast and energy efficient disinfection technology with contact time 1 min and eeo value 0 005 kw h m 3 order 1 e coli for 3 log inactivation li et al 2017 sholtes and linden 2019 thus flow through devices showed great potential for practical application in fact except for some photo based processes which are not suitable for the flow through device due to the light blocking by 3d bulk electrodes the flow through device might be the ideal option for water disinfection based on the performance and energy consumption 4 challenges and prospects significant obstacles must be overcome before bench scale nm enabled disinfection technologies can be applied to practical application for water treatment most of these challenges originate from unique properties of antimicrobial nms that bring difficulties to treatment process design including the problem of low disinfection efficiency and energy intensiveness as well as the challenge for nms separation recovery and electrode strengthening optimization hodges et al 2018 qu et al 2013b the problem of nm modified electrodes degradation may reduce the lifetime of electrodes and releases hazardous materials to the effluent thus electrode strengthening strategies including anchoring and coating is a promising approach to improve the insufficiency stability of nm modified electrodes to solve these challenges on the one hand the assessment of nm enabled disinfection technology is necessary for offering guidance of process selection and device design based on disinfection performance and energy efficiency on the other hand the rapid developing materials science for the development of purpose based antimicrobial nms and water treatment engineering for the design of practical reactors offer new opportunities for nms separation recovery and electrode strengthening optimization the major challenge for the practical application of nm enabled disinfection is different according to the operation mode of nms i e suspended nms in complete mixing stirred reactor and fixed nms in electrode stirred plug flow and flow through reactor for the practical application of complete mixing stirred reactors where particle sized nms were evenly distributed in reactors nms separation is the most critical problem membrane separation is the most commonly applied nms method in complete mixing stirred systems whereas faced with the challenges of relatively low separation rate and severe particle aggregation considering that the membrane cannot separate all the nms some nms will be retained in the water and release to the ecosystem inevitably to solve this problem the magnetic separation strategy has been explored he et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 typically the magnetic nms for water disinfection is a core shell structure with a functional shell decorated with antimicrobial nms i e physical and peroxy photo based nms enabling disinfection fig 8 a and a magnetic core structure i e fe2o3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles enabling separation within a magnetic field fig 8b gonavelli et al 2013 mangayayam et al 2017 xia et al 2018 although the magnetic separation strategy has been confirmed effective fig 8c but its practical feasibility remains questionable to generate a sufficient and controllable magnetic field usually an electromagnetic induction device instead of a magnet is needed which leads to more electric demand additionally the potential release of nms to the treated effluent is another concern due to the incomplete separation he et al 2019 as for devices using fixed nms such as electrode stirred plug flow and flow through reactor one major challenge for the practical application is the problem of the degradation of nm modified electrodes which reduces the electrode lifetime and releases hazardous materials to the effluent the commonly used nms immobilization method is based on the physical junctions between nms and electrodes and is not likely suitable for practical application due to its insufficient stability additionally nms commonly have high aspect ratios or fragile structures making them easy to detach from the electrode especially when water carrying microbes flows through with a high velocity one promising approach to improve the insufficiency stability of nm modified electrodes is applying robust immobilization strategies including anchoring and coating fig 8d anchoring methods have been confirmed feasible to strength the nm modified electrode in water disinfection including the application of molecular linkers to connect nms and electrodes as well as anchor materials to fill junctions between nms and electrodes fig 8e lee et al 2010a moncayo lasso et al 2008 as for coating methods a nanoscale thin film is commonly applied to protect nm modified electrodes either encapsulating the whole nanostructure or only covering nms surface while maintaining the morphology fig 8d and e huo et al 2019b yang and hoffmann 2016 yang et al 2016 considering that the electrode degradation caused by chemical corrosion mostly occurs at the solution electrode interface the thin film covering all the electrode surface is capable of reducing the electrochemical corrosion and improving the electrode stability effectively additionally the membrane is also an effective process for nms immobilization with the feasible deposit process nms can be immobilized on the membrane surface tightly which enabling long term disinfection brady est√© vez et al 2010a b rahaman et al 2012 vecitis et al 2011 another major challenge for the practical application of fixed nms devices is the mass transfer limitation although flow through systems enable the fast mass transfer fig 8f most studies report only achievements of microbial disinfection using different novel materials fig 8g which have not enabled the optimization method of the flow through system for the special aim of microbial disinfection liu et al 2017a luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b little information is available on understanding the impact of pore structure and size effects of flow through electrodes on disinfection which is critical for the design and the utilization of flow through systems the study of computational fluid dynamics cfd a finite element simulation method is one promising approach to optimize the flow through system by describing electrode properties and fluid conditions fig 8h zhou et al 2018 furthermore cfd simulation is capable of simulating the larger scale reactor by clarifying the device boundary treatment rate and operation load which has great potential value for translating the laboratory scale disinfection process to water treatment practices fig 8h gu et al 2019 in addition to developing nms separation and recovery strategies as well as strengthening nm modified electrodes and optimizing disinfection systems another critical issue from the practical standpoint is the lowered disinfection performance under real water wastewater conditions which is commonly neglected natural organic matter nom from surface water and dissolved organic matter dom from wastewater commonly exist in considerable quantities mg l 1 hu et al 2016 for the ros depended nm enabled disinfection process the disinfection efficiency decreases due to the ros scavenging effect by organic matters brame et al 2015 rincon reported that during the tio2 photocatalysis disinfection process compared to the contact time of 75 min for complete disinfection without organic matter the contact time for complete disinfection increased to 90 min due to the presence of dihydroxybenzene 2 mmol l 1 rincon and pulgarin 2004 furthermore maghsoodi investigated the inhibition effect of different dom fractions toward ros generation performance during photocatalysis reaction and found that the colloidal fraction 5 mg c l 1 in the dom showed the strongest inhibition effect with the decreasing of photodegradation rates by approximately 75 maghsoodi et al 2019 for the physical based and direct oxidation disinfection process the disinfection efficiency decreases may be impacted by the organic matter due to the competitive adsorption onto nms surfaces brame et al 2014 2015 in rahaman s work only 1 52 virus log removal rate was achieved in the presence of 1 mg l 1 of alginate using the cnt filter while without organic matters complete disinfection was achieved 7 2 log removal rahaman et al 2012 although the impact of water quality parameters is investigated at the lab scale the lack of standardized experimental protocol for simulating real water wastewater conditions especially for organic matters sets challenges for quantitative assessments of the disinfection performance chen et al 2011 huo et al 2018b rahaman et al 2012 5 conclusions we have provided an overview of nm enabled innovative processes and devices for water disinfection as well as the established and emerging nms separation recovery methods and electrode strengthening optimization strategies the critical assessment for different disinfection

developing nm enabled disinfection systems additionally the summarized emerging nms separation and electrode strengthening strategies offer opportunities to water treatment practices the key points from our review are as follows 1 the nm enabled electro based disinfection processes i e electrochemical based and electroporation based disinfection gained the highest disinfection performance with the lowest energy consumption compared with physical based peroxy based and photo based disinfection processes on the one hand the high ros generation efficiency indirect electrochemical based process

disinfection performance on the other hand the electro based disinfection process offered the direct means of translating energy input to microbes and guaranteed the highest energy efficiency 2 the flow through reactor with mesh membrane or 3d porous electrode showed the highest disinfection performance and energy efficiency compared with the stirred and the plug flow reactor attributed to its highest mass transfer rate according to the requirement of light irritation the mesh membrane and the 3d porous electrode became the predominant choice for system design of photoelectro based and electro based disinfection processes respectively the flow through reactor achieved a comparable or even better disinfection performance and energy efficiency compared with uv disinfection furthermore

18081,this study provided an overview of established and emerging nanomaterial nm enabled processes and devices for water disinfection for both centralized and decentralized systems in addition to a discussion of major disinfection mechanisms data on disinfection performance shortest contact time for complete disinfection and energy efficiency electrical energy per order eeo were collected enabling assessments firstly for disinfection processes and then for disinfection devices the nm enabled electro based disinfection process gained the highest disinfection efficiency with the lowest energy consumption compared with physical based peroxy based and photo based disinfection processes owing to the unique disinfection mechanism and the direct mean of translating energy input to microbes among the established disinfection devices e g the stirred the plug flow and the flow through reactor the flow through reactor with mesh membrane or 3 dimensional porous electrodes showed the highest disinfection performance and energy efficiency attributed to its highest mass transfer efficiency additionally we also summarized recent knowledge about current and potential nms separation and recovery methods as well as electrode strengthening and optimization strategies magnetic separation and robust immobilization anchoring and coating are feasible strategies to prompt the practical application of nm enabled disinfection devices magnetic separation effectively solved the problem for the separation of evenly distributed particle sized nms from microbial solution and robust immobilization increased the stability of nm modified electrodes and prevented these electrodes from degradation by hydraulic detachment and or electrochemical dissolution furthermore the study of computational fluid dynamics cfd was capable of simulating nm enabled devices which showed great potential for system optimization and reactor expansion in this overview we stressed the need to concern not only the treatment performance and energy efficiency of nm enabled disinfection processes and devices but also the overall feasibility of system construction and operation for practical application graphical abstract image 1 keywords water disinfection contact time electrical energy per order eeo mass transfer flow through system 1 introduction water is a basic human need during water utilization disinfection is an essential process to protect people from pathogenic infections and has been broadly applied for more than 100 years rutala and weber 2016 shannon et al 2008 however conventional water disinfection methods e g chlorination and uv radiation suffer from obvious drawbacks such as harmful disinfection byproducts dbps formation and pathogen regrowth guo et al 2015 li and mitch 2018 sedlak and von gunten 2011 alternative methods such as membrane filtration and ozonation also suffer from low throughput and intensive energy consumption al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 miklos et al 2018 additionally these current disinfection methods are commonly feasible for centralized systems whereas they are not easily applicable in developing areas where sanitation facilities and power supplies are not available liu et al 2019b thus there is an urgent need for a highly efficient reliable low energy consuming and easily applicable disinfection method for both centralized and decentralized systems nanomaterials nms such as silver nanoparticles carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide nanoparticles with unique biological electronic and or catalytic properties provide a viable and effective option for water disinfection alvarez et al 2018 mauter et al 2018 qu et al 2013b these nms involve new cell inactivation mechanisms such as free radical generation and cell structure decomposition which are capable of achieving microbial disinfection with low dbps formation and without pathogen regrowth li et al 2008 qu et al 2013a zhang et al 2019a the suitability of the nm enabled disinfection technology has also been recognized for decentralized application attributed to the flexible reactor design the low energy consumption and the great performance at small scales hodges et al 2018 lee et al 2010b to develop the high performance nm enabled disinfection system one not only needs to exploit unique disinfection processes enabled by anti microbial nms but also design novel nm enabled disinfection devices to improve the treatment efficiency and lifetime from this aspect there are three prerequisite factors need to be deliberated 1 rational developments of nm enabled disinfection processes based on novel antimicrobial mechanisms 2 feasible designs of nm enabled disinfection devices and 3 suitable strategies to recover nms and or improve the stability of nms various novel nm enabled disinfection processes have already achieved high treatment performance especially those involving photo catalytic and electrochemistry martinez huitle and brillas 2008 pelaez et al 2012 additionally an increasing number of new nm enabled disinfection processes i e physical photoelectro photothermal and electroporation based processes are continuously being reported by various researchers hayden et al 2010 ivanova et al 2013 kotnik et al 2015 loeb et al 2016 the huge amount of different studies and proposed processes pose an enormous challenge for a critical assessment of nm enabled disinfection processes thus it is essential to enable the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes based on their disinfection performance operational costs and the general feasibility i e resource use and eco toxicity caused by nms release however the study for such a comprehensive comparison of various nm enabled disinfection processes is still limited considering nms are not dissolved in the solution during disinfection processes commonly nm enabled disinfection devices are heterogeneous reactors instead of homogeneous reactors alvarez et al 2018 hodges et al 2018 due to the small particle size of nms microbial disinfection commonly happens near nms surface with the distance from several nanometers to micrometers huo et al 2018a liu et al 2014b thus the treatment efficiency of the nm enabled disinfection device is significantly impacted by the microbial mass transfer efficiency from the bulk solution to the nms surface it is therefore critical to design feasible disinfection devices to promote treatment efficiency however despite the large volume of publications dedicated to achieving disinfection with novel nms in a batch reactor at lab scale implementation in practical applications using feasible devices has been limited zhang et al 2019a to address this issue researchers made efforts to develop feasible nm enabled disinfection device for practical application and design various types of reactors such as the stirred the plug flow and the flow through reactor based on different disinfection processes gu et al 2019 loeb et al 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 however due to the different experimental setup in different studies it is hard to make comprehensive assessments of those reported devices concerning the disinfection efficiency and energy consumption and thus studies for such assessments is severely limited after clarifying the necessity of assessments for both nm enabled disinfection processes and devices before practical application another huge challenge is the lack of feasible strategies for separation and recovery the applied nms or strengthening the insufficient stability of nanostructure due to the small particle size nms may release to effluents during the treatment process leading to considerable eco toxicity as well as a lowered disinfection performance and device lifetime dale et al 2015 lead et al 2018 sun et al 2016 although there are several strategies including magnetic recovery and facial coating have been proven effective for recovering or protecting nms these studies are limited and only applicable case by case huo et al 2019b yang et al 2016 thus it is critical to developing general and feasible strategies to recycle and or protect nms according to types of nm enabled disinfection processes and or devices such strategies can be general guidance for the future design of nm enabled disinfection systems whereas the related studies are severely limited with this in mind we overviewed the established and emerging nm enabled processes and devices for water disinfection as well as the current and potential nms separation recovery methods and electrode strengthening optimization strategies we first enabled critical assessments for different disinfection processes and devices based on the disinfection performance the shortest contact time required for complete disinfection and the operation cost the amount of electrical energy needed to decrease by one order of magnitude of the microbial concentration eeo from a technical standpoint we also provided recommendations for disinfection systems development and operation from a practical standpoint by reviewing the emerging nms recovery and electrode strengthening strategies 2 nm enabled innovative processes for water disinfection an overview of different established and emerging nm enabled disinfection processes was given in fig 1 categorized into physical based peroxy based photo based and electro based nm enabled disinfection processes however it is noteworthy that this classification scheme should not be viewed as strict since several processes involve different disinfection mechanisms and thus could be assigned to various categories in the following sections the current status of nm enabled disinfection processes was reviewed major mechanisms for microbial inactivation were illustrated and constraints of different processes were briefly discussed furthermore at the end of this part comprehensive assessments of various disinfection processes were made based on the treatment efficiency and energy consumption a more critical overview and perspective on system design and nms recovery and strengthening were discussed separately in sections 3 and 4 2 1 nm enabled physical based disinfection process the nm enabled physical based disinfection process commonly achieves microbial inactivation relying on the physical contact of antimicrobial nms to microbes e g bacteria and viruses kang et al 2007 lee et al 2008 loo et al 2013 antimicrobial nms directly interact with the microbes enabling microbial inactivation by interrupting transmembrane electron transfer disrupting penetrating the microbial envelope membranes for bacteria and capsids for viruses or oxidizing microbial components such as protein and dna rna loo et al 2015 lyon and alvarez 2008 xiu et al 2012 additionally some of these nms also generate secondary products e g dissolved heavy metal ions and reactive oxygen species ros that cause microbial damage without any other input e g chemical photo or electric input cheng et al 2014 li et al 2010 because of this specific disinfection mechanism of physical contact and no demand for other input this type of disinfection process was classified as the physical based disinfection process the latest antimicrobial nms involving in the physical based nm enabled disinfection process mainly fall into two general categories carbon based and metal based antimicrobial nms 2 1 1 carbon based antimicrobial nms carbon based antimicrobial nms involving in the physical based disinfection process include carbon nanotubes cnts graphene and mxene and their antibacterial activities are mainly attributed to their unique sharp structures tips or edges alimohammadi et al 2018 kang et al 2007 other carbon based nms such as fullerenes c60 and g c3n4 showing strong antimicrobial activity attributed to the photochemical properties are not classified into the physical based disinfection process and will be discussed in the section of nm enabled photo based disinfection process li et al 2016 lyon and alvarez 2008 cnts can be either single walled swnts a single pipe with a diameter from 1 to 5 nm or multi walled mwnts a nested tubes structure with lengths from 100 nm to 100 Œºm vecitis et al 2010 several studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of swnts and mwnts toward bacteria brady est√© vez et al 2010a b swnts will firstly contact microbes resulting in membrane perturbation and the release of intracellular contents another disinfection mechanism of swnt is cellular oxidative stress due to the contact between swnts and cytoplasm and the cellular oxidative stress tends to be impacted by the electronic structure of swnt i e swnts with a higher percentage of metallic showing higher toxicity vecitis et al 2010 as for mwnts one major disinfection mechanism was confirmed to be the membrane stress which is caused by the direct mwnt microbe contact brady est√© vez et al 2010a b kang et al 2008 additionally the structure of mwnt can also contribute to microbial removal the removal of bacteria by swcnts mwcnts filters was confirmed to microbial inactivation by the top layer of swcnts followed by depth filtration by the mwcnts layer brady est√© vez et al 2010a b furthermore the adsorption of microbes bacteria and viruses onto cnts attributed to the hydrophobicity is another crucial factor influencing cnts antimicrobial properties rahaman et al 2012 cnts can be immobilized on the membrane as a filter and enables microbial removal by adsorption which extends the application potential for the cnt based disinfection process smith and rodrigues 2015 the graphene including graphene graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo the one atom thick two dimensional 2d carbon layer and the mxene a family of two dimensional materials consisted of transition metal carbides and nitrides show the similar antibacterial mechanisms to those of cnts castro neto et al 2009 naguib et al 2014 perreault et al 2015 the sharp edges of graphene go rgo and mxene 10 nm are capable of piercing the cell membrane which damages membrane structure and triggers the oxidation stress of the cell alimohammadi et al 2018 rasool et al 2016 2017 additionally the smaller sheet sizes of graphene go and rgo can further increase the antimicrobial activity of the material perreault et al 2015 it is noteworthy that researchers mainly focus on the disinfection performance of mxene toward bacteria whereas the study of virus disinfection using mxene is severely limited thus the research for virus disinfection using mxene should be further exploited in the future 2 1 2 metal based antimicrobial nms silver nanoparticles agnps are the most commonly used metal based antimicrobial nms and have broad applications in water disinfection gunawan et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 to date several mechanisms have been proposed for the antimicrobial property of agnps 1 adhesion of nanoparticles to the cell surface altering the membrane properties for bacteria 2 agnps penetrating inside microbes resulting in dna rna and or protein damage for both bacteria and viruses and 3 agnps serving as a vehicle to deliver released ag more effectively to the cellular cytoplasm for bacteria rai et al 2009 xiu et al 2012 agnps are also introduced to other disinfection processes such as photo and electro based disinfection to enable high performance microbial inactivation with synergistic mechanisms which will be discussed in the following section systematically ma et al 2016a tan et al 2018 wen et al 2017 additionally copper based nms are also applied in water disinfection widely the released copper ions cu2 shows obvious toxicity towards both bacteria and viruses which enables highly efficient disinfection aarestrup and hasman 2004 yu sen et al 1998 furthermore the copper based nms can also be introduced into the photo and the electro based disinfection processes and achieve disinfection with synergistic mechanisms which will be discussed in the following section systematically fisher et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi or iron nanoparticles fenps showed strong redox activity attributed to its special zero valence fe0 and has been investigated as a new tool for the treatment of contaminated water and soil crane and scott 2012 attributed to the strong reducing conditions at the nzvi surface and oxidative damage from intracellular ros produced from fenton s chemistry nzvi enables decomposition of microbial envelope membranes for bacteria and capsids for viruses as well as protein and dna rna in microbes both bacteria and viruses cheng et al 2014 hu et al 2019 li et al 2010 both carbon based and metal based antimicrobial nms have shown their potential for water disinfection at the laboratory scale considering the disinfection mechanism of direct contact usually these antimicrobial nms are completely mixed with the microbes in a batch reactor to achieve disinfection thus the full scale application is limited due to the lack of feasible strategies for nms separation and recovery although some studies reported the immobilization of nms on electrodes to prompt the potential value for practical application at industrial scale the inevitable nms release and or the relatively low disinfection efficiency still pose a great challenge loo et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 thus the rational electrode strengthening strategy is critical for exploring the potential value for the real world application of the nm immobilization process and will be discussed in the following section systematically membrane immobilization is another common strategy for achieving physical based disinfection and has shown the potential for practical application chen et al 2019 rahaman et al 2012 furthermore the solubility of carbon based nms in water is also a critical concern due to the unique hydrophobic feature cnts tend to aggregate severely when exists in water glomstad et al 2018 thus the functional process for modifying the hydrophobic property of carbon based nms is critically important and can be a criterion for developing the carbon based nm enabled disinfection process and improving the disinfection efficiency 2 2 nm enabled peroxy based disinfection process the peroxy based disinfection process is commonly based on the mechanism that some weak oxidants i e fe2 fe3 and persulfates can be activated under certain conditions in the present of h2o2 or metal oxides catalyst to generate highly reactive radicals for water disinfection hodges et al 2018 miklos et al 2018 the fenton and the persulfates processes are two typical peroxy based disinfection processes that have been well studied for water disinfection traditionally the fenton approach involves activation of h2o2 to generate oh through catalytic reaction with the dissolved fe2 fe3 redox pair however the application of conventional fenton process is hindered by 1 the acid condition required for oh production 2 the accumulation of iron sludge after neutralization due to the high dosage of iron salts and 3 speed limitation step of the slow fe3 to fe2 reduction kinetics hodges et al 2018 yang et al 2013 heterogeneous fenton processes which frequently rely on nanoscale transition metal catalysts have thus been developed to overcome these limitations for example mos2 nanosheets were found to serve as the co catalyst and facilitate efficient fe3 to fe2 reduction by the exposed mo4 active sites which significantly enhanced the oh production liu et al 2018 the mos2 nanosheets can prompt the high performance fenton disinfection by mixed with the microbial solution completely or immobilization on the electrode surface liu et al 2018 iron oxide nanoparticles mixed with silica nanoparticles or carbon based nanomaterials cnts and graphene enabled highly efficient fenton process in neutral ph conditions when nms were mixed in the solution or immobilized on electrodes the high disinfection efficiency is attributed to the efficient electron transfer on the incorporation of carbonaceous materials nieto juarez et al 2010 ruales lonfat et al 2015 attributed to the higher oh production efficiency the nm enabled fenton process can achieve high performance disinfection with less dosage of iron salts input which results in no significant iron sludge formation during the treatment process persulfates are considered inexpensive and relatively stable oxidants for the generation of sulfate radicals so4 ahn et al 2013 assisted by the transition metal oxides with high redox activity such as co3o4 cuo and fe3o4 persulfates can be activated effectively for so4 generation and enables a high disinfection performance when nms are mixed in the solution or immobilized on electrodes chen et al 2008 lei et al 2015 yan et al 2011 although nms prompt the disinfection performance of fenton and persulfates based disinfection processes and meanwhile expand application conditions such as broader ph ranges the inevitable externally supplied chemicals call into question the suitability of this technique for practical application h2o2 is a necessary chemical input 10 mg l 1 during the fenton process which sets obstacles for practical application due to the limitation of storage transport and continual dosing ruales lonfat et al 2016 additionally as an oxidizing agent h2o2 may contribute to biotoxicity due to its oxidation property which impacts the safety of portable drinking or disturbs the ecosystem of the discharged water salla et al 2016 for persulfates added nanoscale transition metal oxides such as co3o4 and cuo may cause the release of heavy metals such as co2 or cu2 which are hazardous to the environment whereas the study to recycle and reuse of these nanoscale catalysts is still limited to overcome these obstacles some studies reported in situ h2o2 generation strategies by electrochemical methods to offer practical advantages by eliminating the need for externally supplied chemicals yang et al 2019 however the study for a comprehensive assessment of operational parameters to fully analyze its cost benefit is still limited 2 3 nm enabled photo based disinfection process some nms can be activated by light irradiation and show unique properties such as charges production using nanoscale photocatalysts and or photoelectrocatalysts and temperature increment using nanoscale photothermal catalysts which offers new opportunities for water disinfection jung et al 2018 paracchino et al 2011 twilton et al 2017 to date several photo based nm enabled disinfection processes including photocatalysis photoelectro and photothermal based disinfection processes have been developed to achieve high performance microbial inactivation these photo based nanoscale catalysts and photo based nm enabled disinfection processes will be reviewed in the following section systematically 2 3 1 nm enabled photocatalysis based disinfection process in a typical photocatalysis disinfection process wide bandgap semiconductor nanoparticles are photoexcited by light irradiation uv light and or visible light to separate charges and form a conduction band electron e cb and valence band hole h vb hodges et al 2018 these activated semiconductors react with o2 in water to generate a series of powerful ros including h o2 ho2 oh 1o2 and h2o2 for water disinfection zhang et al 2019a p25 tio2 a commercial powder of anatase rutile mixed phase nanoparticles is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts and has been explored for photocatalytic water disinfection over decades attributed to the high surface area and enhanced charge separation by the anatase rutile phase boundary heterojunctions p25 has relatively strong photocatalytic activity hurum et al 2003 matsunaga et al 1985 zhang et al 1998 however the practical application of p25 for microbial disinfection is hindered by 1 the wide bandgap of tio2 3 2 and 3 0 ev for anatase and rutile restricting the light source in uv range that accounts for 4 of solar energy 2 particle aggregation and 3 photocatalyst separation from the treated water to promote the practical application of the photocatalysis disinfection process research has extensively focused on developing new materials or devices for more efficient microbial inactivation and nms recovery firstly researchers improved the antimicrobial activity of tio2 under uv irradiation through the metallic co catalysts e g pt pd and au modification chen et al 2010 sakthivel et al 2004 the junctions between tio2 and these metallic co catalysts serve as effective electron sinks and facilitate charge transfer across the resulting schottky barrier for improving the photocatalytic activity chen et al 2010 secondly the development of visible light photocatalysis is also a feasible strategy to prompt the practical application of photocatalysis disinfection attributed to narrow bandgaps which enabling e cb h vb pair formation with lower energy light catalyzes such as bismuth based biox bivo4 tungsten based bi2wo6 silver based agbr and carbon based g c3n4 cationic amino c60 nms can be activated by the visible light cao et al 2012 hu et al 2010 lee et al 2010a yu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 however due to irregular choices of visible light sources it is difficult to enable a comprehensive assessment to analyze the real impact of these developments additionally the application of visible light photocatalysis is further limited by the low ros generation efficiency when using lamp excitation and the large area footprint needed for solar harvesting when using solar irradiation most studies of the photocatalysis disinfection process only reported the feasibility of the antimicrobial activity for nm enabled catalyzes at the laboratory scale whereas the practical application was limited due to the lack of feasible strategies for nms separation and recovery strategies of catalyzes immobilization on bulk components e g electrode and magnetic separation have been explored but their practical feasibility remains questionable due to the relatively low mass transfer efficiency and or the low recovery rate he et al 2019 lee et al 2010a 2 3 2 nm enabled photoelectro based disinfection process typically a photoelectro based disinfection process is based on a semiconductor liquid junction firstly the minority charges e cb and h vb are generated by light irradiation on the semiconductor then these charges are driven into the solution by the electric field at the junction and further produces ros for microbial disinfection adhikari et al 2018 paracchino et al 2011 the nanoscale transition metal oxides including cu2o zno and tio2 have been confirmed feasible for photoelectro based disinfection with relatively low applied voltage 2 0 v vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe and high disinfection efficiency kang et al 2010 liu et al 2017b pablos et al 2017 different from catalysts in photocatalysis based process commonly dispersed evenly in microbial solution catalysts in photoelectro based process are usually fabricated or immobilized on the planar electrode which significantly alleviates the problems of nms separation and recovery although the photoelectro based disinfection shows great potential for the practical application problems of its low energy conversion efficiency and the low mass transfer rate of panel electrodes require more attention the rational and feasible nm enabled disinfection device such as the flow through device with membranes or porous electrodes will improve the mass transfer and will be reviewed systematically in section 3 2 3 3 nm enabled photothermal disinfection process with the solar irradiation nanoscale photothermal materials can convert solar energy to thermal heating and increase the localized temperature near the nms surface effectively huang et al 2006 lal et al 2008 the increased localized heating achieves high performance disinfection toward both bacteria and viruses without substantially raising the bulk temperature of the water the temperature of the bulk solution only increases for several degrees loeb et al 2017 2019 several nanoscale photothermal materials including carbon based materials carbon black cnts and graphene metal au nanoparticles and metal compound ti2o3 nanoparticles and prussian blue nanocages have been confirmed feasible for effective light capture and localized heating generation lal et al 2008 wang 2018 au nanorod carbon black composite materials were firstly applied to achieve photothermal disinfection by completely mixed in the microbial solution and the immobilization approach anchoring the materials on the surface of commercial films and membranes further achieved high performance disinfection and extended the application potential loeb et al 2017 2019 however the feasibility for real world application of nm enabled photothermal disinfection is still questionable due to the high material fabrication cost the large area footprint required for light harvesting and the low mass transfer efficiency for microbes to nms surface the rational strategy for device designing shows the potential to improve mass transfer efficiency and will be reviewed systematically in section 3 additionally the disinfection performance of thermo resistant microbes may also become a concern for the practical application 2 4 nm enabled electro based disinfection process when applied with the external electric potential some nms enable ros generation and or local electric fields enhancement attributed to their unique electrochemical catalytic properties and or physical high conductivity and sharp structure properties ghasemian et al 2017 huo et al 2016 vecitis et al 2011 the local electric field enhancement relies on the lightning rod effect which occurs when a metallic rod is inserted into a region of a uniform electric field rojas chapana et al 2004 the electric field strength near the tip of the metallic rod can be enhanced with a degree with a positive correlation to the aspect ratio of the metallic rod rojas chapana et al 2004 based on these unique mechanisms the electro based disinfection processes are categorized into electrochemical and non electrochemical processes and have been confirmed feasible for high performance water disinfection 2 4 1 nm enabled electrochemical disinfection process the electrochemical disinfection process offers a direct and effective way for the energy transfer to microbes in water hodges et al 2018 electrochemical oxidation toward microbes is the dominant disinfection mechanism which can occur directly through charge transfer at the electrode surface i e direct oxidation as well as indirectly through reactions with electrochemically generated oxidants i e indirect oxidation liu et al 2019a vecitis et al 2011 yang and hoffmann 2016 the direct oxidation disinfection is postulated a two step process 1 deposition or adsorption of the microbes onto electrodes and 2 oxidation of the microbes by electrons transfer which interrupts transmembrane electron transfer and triggers cellular oxidative stress vecitis et al 2011 during the direct oxidation disinfection process the microbe electrode contact is the speed limited step whereas the conventional panel electrode cannot offer a sufficient surface area for highly efficient microbe deposition thus nm modified flow through electrodes e g ag nanowires modified membrane and cnts membrane have been studied to improve treatment rates chen et al 2019 rahaman et al 2012 however problems of forming harmful cl2 dbps in complex water matrices as well as high fabrication cost and membrane fouling requires more attention in an indirect oxidation disinfection process specific nm modified electrodes including boron doped diamond bdd sno2 pbo2 ruo2 and sub stoichiometric and doped tio2 electrodes are used as anode materials to in situ generate highly reactive ros such as oh and cl for water disinfection jeong et al 2009 kerwick et al 2005 moreno andr√©s et al 2018 one major challenge however is to transfer the generated radicals into the bulk water solution to react with target microbes additionally the application of the indirect electrochemical oxidation is also limited by the high electrode production cost as well as the intensive energy consumption and the formation of harmful dbps due to reactions between the generated cl2 and organic matters in the real wastewater hodges et al 2018 furthermore electrochemical oxidation only occurs at anode surfaces while the potential for cathodic reactions is mostly unused 2 4 2 nm enabled electroporation disinfection process electroporation a physical process relying on a strong electric field to damage microbial envelope membranes for bacteria and capsids for viruses offers new opportunities for water disinfection and can be a promising substitute to reduce the chemical demand of conventional water disinfection methods kotnik et al 2015 liu et al 2014a attributed to the phenomenon that nanowires such as ag cuo and zno nanowires can enhance the local electric field significantly 107 v m 1 with low voltages as low as 1 v a nanowire assisted electroporation disinfection technology has been confirmed feasible for effective water disinfection huo et al 2017 schoen et al 2010 tian et al 2017 benefited from the physical disinfection mechanism the nanowire assisted electroporation disinfection process shows high microbial inactivation efficiency and broad spectrum effective to all pathogens including bacteria model bacteria and real wastewater and viruses ms2 without any chemical consumption huo et al 2017 liu et al 2014a additionally no microbe regrow during the storage process afterward huo et al 2016 furthermore attributed to the low operation voltage 1 v no cl2 is generated which ensures the low formation potential of harmful dbps however the electrode degradation including both hydraulic detachment and electrochemical dissolution reduces the electrode lifetime and releases hazardous materials such as heavy metals to the effluent which poses a great obstacle for the practical application huo et al 2019a liu et al 2014a 2 5 assessment and comparison of nm enabled disinfection processes after a brief overview of established nm enabled disinfection processes it is important to enabling assessments and comparisons between different disinfection processes based on 1 the disinfection performance 2 and the energy consumption to set up general guidelines for the future research the shortest contact time or hydraulic retention time hrt needed for achieving complete disinfection i e no live microbes in effluent can be used for the evaluation of disinfection capability and upper limitation liu et al 2013 2014a martinez huitle and brillas 2008 miao et al 2019 it is noteworthy that to analyze the treatment efficiency of disinfection processes in laboratories easily researchers often apply cultivable model microbes such as escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis to represent bacteria and ms2 to represent viruses to investigate the treatment capacity researchers commonly disperse these model microbes in water with relatively high concentrations 107 to 109 colony forming units ml 1 or plaque forming unit ml 1 cfu or pfu ml 1 as the tested microbial solution and test the shortest contact time for complete disinfection because the kinetics of microbial inactivation assessed by nms can often be described as the pseudo first order model the contact time needed for each microbial log removal is similar if the initial concentration varies from 107 to 109 cfu or pfu ml 1 theoretically the contact time for removing 109 microbes is 1 9 7 100 28 higher than the contact time for removing 107 microbes thus although the difference of microbial concentration may contribute to the variability of the overviewed contact time for each disinfection process it s unlikely to induce significant differences between different disinfection processes with different disinfection mechanisms to further investigate the impact of microbial types bacteria and viruses to the disinfection efficiency we analyzed the contact time needed for viruses inactivation separately and compared it with the contact time for the overall microbial bacteria plus viruses inactivation contact times needed for viruses inactivation did not introduce a significant variability to each nm enabled disinfection technology fig s1 it is possible that for each disinfection technology bacteria and viruses share similar inactivation mechanisms for example disinfection processes using metal based antimicrobial nms such as agnps release harmful ions which may damage the microbial protein and dna rna structure and the ros depended nm enabled disinfection processes generate ros to damage the microbial protein and dna rna structure for disinfection although bacteria and viruses have different microbial structures their cell structures are very simple and share similar basic and essential substances for living such as protein and dna rna thus for each nm enabled disinfection process the disinfection efficiency of viruses may not show a significant difference compared with the overall microbial disinfection efficiency fig s1 and the comparison of disinfection efficiency between different processes is reasonable and feasible the impact of different types of model microbial strains to the distinction efficiency was also investigated e coli is the most commonly used model bacterium in researches of nm enabled disinfection some other bacteria strains such as enterococcus faecalis salmonella enterica and bacillus subtilis are also tested huo et al 2018c liu et al 2013 2014a the major difference between these model bacteria is their membrane structure some of them are gram positive while others are gram negative strains gram positive bacteria have a thicker layer of peptidoglycan than gram negative bacteria which leads to a higher resistance to disinfection liu et al 2014a however different bacteria strains will not introduce significant data variability according to the reported research and thus will not impact the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes for viruses disinfection the bacteriophage ms2 is the most commonly used model virus and the bacteriophage f2 is also applied in some studies cheng et al 2014 attributed to the similar structure of ms2 and f2 the type of viruses did not introduce significant data variability and will not impact the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes to enable the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes the data variability introduced by different water quality parameters was also investigated many researchers have investigated the impact of water quality on the nm enabled disinfection efficiency using the synthetic water sample water quality parameters were controlled within a reasonable range ph from 6 to 8 temperature around 15 c and ionic strength from 10 to 100 mm to simulate the water quality of drinking water and or wastewater watts et al observed that the ros depended microbial disinfection processes were not affected significantly by changing ph watts et al 1995 additionally impacts of ph and ionic strength were confirmed to be non significant for electro based disinfection processes huo et al 2018b rahaman et al 2012 while some results were obtained that changing water quality parameters may impact the disinfection efficiency those impacts are less significant than the impact introduced by different disinfection mechanisms zhang et al 2019a thus the impact of different water quality parameters such as ph temperature and ionic strength is not significant and will not affect the comparison between different nm enabled disinfection processes for the impact of organic matters in the water due to the lack of standardized experimental protocol for simulating organic matters in real water wastewater conditions we did not include studies involving the impact of organic matters for comparison between different disinfection processes instead we have discussed the impact of organic matters on the disinfection efficiency separately and systematically in section 4 except for the physical based and part of the peroxy based disinfection processes reported nm enabled disinfection processes commonly require electrical energy input during the treatment process which often represents a major fraction of energy consumption and operation cost because the kinetics of microbial inactivation assessed by nms can often be described as the pseudo first order model the electrical energy consumption scaled with the volume and treatment goals described as the electrical energy per order eeo can be calculated and applied for the assessment of energy consumption bolton et al 1996 eeo represents the amount of electrical energy needed to decrease by one order of magnitude of the microbial concentration and the calculation method of eeo for different disinfection processes is illustrated in table s1 sholtes and linden 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2 5 1 assessment and comparison of nm enabled disinfection processes based on contact time the shortest contact time required for the complete disinfection for different nm enabled disinfection processes from literature data were summarized in fig 2 as box plots and sorted by the median value reported contact times of each nm enabled disinfection process varied for several orders of magnitudes such data variability is likely due to different nms and types of reactors applied in each kind of disinfection process furthermore the complex water matrix may also impact the ros generation efficiency which affected the disinfection performance and aggravated the data variability additionally the difference in type and concentration of treated microbes also induced the data variability however the variability introduced by microbial types and water qualities is not significant for each nm enabled disinfection process and will not impact the assessment between different disinfection processes due to the different disinfection mechanisms significant differences between different disinfection processes can be observed from the literature study based on the median value of contact time nm enabled disinfection processes can be classified into three groups processes with median contact time 100 min physical based group 1 contact time between 20 and 100 min photocatalysis photoelectro peroxy photothermal and indirect electrochemical based group 2 and contact time 10 min direct electrochemical and electroporation based group 3 the significant differences in contact time for each group are partly caused by the different disinfection mechanisms in group 1 the relatively long contact time 107 min required for complete disinfection indicated low disinfection efficiency of the physical based disinfection process the physical based disinfection highly relies on the microbe nms direct contact as well as the reaction between microbes and nms afterward which required a specific period for sufficient cytotoxicity these two steps lead to relatively low disinfection efficiency and long contact time for complete disinfection kang et al 2007 vecitis et al 2010 nms applied in the physical based disinfection process can be both mixed completely in the microbial solution or immobilized on electrodes or membranes it is noteworthy that attributed to the feasible design of disinfection device e g flow through reactor the treatment efficiency of the physical based disinfection process can be improved significantly and the shortest contact time for complete disinfection can be as low as 1 min loo et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 thus the impact of device design including electrode or membrane immobilization is also important and will be discussed systematically in section 3 disinfection processes in group 2 commonly rely on ros production or intensive heating near nms surface to achieve microbial inactivation attributed to the relatively intensive reaction of ros or surface heating toward microbes the disinfection processes in group 2 gained higher disinfection efficiencies than those in group 1 fig 2 in group 2 the indirect electrochemical based disinfection process showed the highest disinfection efficiency with the contact time of 15 min followed by photothermal peroxy photocatalysis and photocatalysis based processes with the contact time of 25 41 66 and 78 min respectively the difference in disinfection efficiency among various processes is likely due to the ros or local heating generation efficiency owing to the direct means of translating energy input to microbes the indirect electrochemical based disinfection process gained the highest ros generation efficiency in group 2 leading to a high disinfection performance hodges et al 2018 while the photo based disinfection process showed a relatively low ros generation efficiency due to its unique light activation mechanism which resulted in a lowered disinfection performance bessegato et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a the disinfection processes in group 3 i e direct electrochemical and electroporation based disinfection showed the highest disinfection efficiency with the significantly lowered contact time 1 5 and 0 1 min compared with other nm enabled disinfection processes attributed to unique disinfection mechanisms electron transfer or membrane damage caused by the strong electric field microbes will be inactivated immediately after contacting the electrode or entering the area with the sufficient electric field which resulted in a high disinfection efficiency huo et al 2016 vecitis et al 2011 additionally with the help of the feasible design of disinfection devices e g flow through reactor the microbes will transfer from the bulk solution to the electrode surface effectively this also leads to a significantly improved disinfection efficiency compared with those of physical based group 1 and ros surface heating based disinfection processes group 2 liu et al 2019a radjenovic and sedlak 2015 2 5 2 comparison of nm enabled disinfection processes based on eeo the eeo value for different nm enabled disinfection processes from literature data was summarized in fig 3 as box plots and sorted by the median value it should be noted that except for the additional energy demand for chemicals or catalysts only electric energy consumption is reflected within eeo thus the physical based and some peroxy based disinfection processes showed no eeo value as shown in fig 3 eeo values of photo based disinfection processes including photocatalysis photoelectro and photothermal based processes are higher than those of electro based disinfection processes including electrochemical both direct and indirect and electroporation based disinfection processes because the light activation either uv or visible light is the prerequisite definition of photo based disinfection the photo based disinfection showed a low energy efficiency and higher energy consumption than those of electro based disinfection processes additionally due to a large number of developed photocatalysts and the inconsistent choice of lamps especially for visible excitation sources in different studies the reported eeo value for photocatalysis based disinfection varied for several orders of magnitudes in fact most photocatalytic studies report only novel catalysts enabling disinfection at the laboratory scale using the stirred reactor which has not made a significant improvement of disinfection performance and energy efficiency electro based disinfection processes including electrochemical both direct and indirect and electroporation based disinfection processes offer the direct means of translating energy input to microbes and thus lead to higher energy efficiencies with lowered eeo values attributed to the unique disinfection mechanisms relying on electron transfer or membrane damage by a strong electric field the direct electrochemical and electroporation based disinfection showed an even lowered eeo 0 002 and 0 00005 kw h m 3 order 1 compared with the indirect electrochemical based disinfection 4 3 kw h m 3 order 1 whose disinfection mechanism is ros dependent additionally eeo values of direct electrochemical and electroporation based disinfection processes were also significantly lower than that of the conventional energy efficient disinfection methods such as low pressure uv disinfection technology 0 005 kw h m 3 order 1 e coli for 3 log inactivation li et al 2017 sholtes and linden 2019 such low energy consumption increases the potential value for decentralized water treatments in regions without developed infrastructures 3 nm enabled innovative devices for water disinfection an overview of established devices applied in nm enabled disinfection was shown in fig 4 categorized into 1 stirred reactor 2 plug flow reactor and 3 flow through reactor in this section the structure of each nm enabled disinfection device was reviewed the applicable disinfection processes for each type of device were summarized and the advantages and limitations of different devices were briefly discussed furthermore at the end of this part comprehensive assessments of various nm enabled disinfection devices were made based on the disinfection performance and energy efficiency 3 1 stirred reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection the stirred reactor can be classified into two groups based on the operation mode of nms 1 complete mixing stirred reactor with particle sized mns complete mixed with microbes and 2 electrode stirred reactor with nanostructures immobilized or grown on panel electrodes fig 4 the complete mixing stirred reactor is feasible for physical based peroxy based photocatalysis based and photothermal based disinfection attributed to the feature that evenly distributed particle sized nms ensures the microbe nms contact and light transmission efficiency the complete mixing stirred reactor has become the predominant choice for photocatalysis based disinfection table 1 gollavelli et al 2013 loeb et al 2017 ma et al 2016b xia et al 2017 however the complete mixing stirred reactor has been criticized for having limited potential value to the practical application the most commonly applied nms recovery method in complete mixing stirred reactor membrane recovery is not feasible for the large scale treatment due to the low recovery rate and the severe particle aggregation in fact most studies only focus on the antimicrobial nms rather than the reactor optimization methods to improve the disinfection efficiency and are mostly implemented at the laboratory scale different from the complete mixing stirred reactor where nms and microbes are evenly distributed in the electrode stirred reactor only microbes are mixed in the reactor while nanostructures are immobilized on a panel electrode which solves the problem for nms separation attributed to its easily applicable feature the electrode stirred reactor is feasible for most of the nm enabled disinfection processes and is one of the widest applied types of the reactor table 1 however due to the required space between two electrodes for stirring microbial solution using paddles or rotors a relatively long distance for microbes approaching electrodes is required commonly 5 cm which hinders the disinfection efficiency and enlarges the area footprint for device construction baghriche et al 2015 xie et al 2018 additionally the mass transfer rate for both complete mixing stirred reactor and electrode stirred reactor is relatively low with the coefficient 10 6 m s 1 leading to a lowered disinfection efficiency and an increased eeo value anglada et al 2010 3 2 plug flow reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection the plug flow reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection commonly includes two nms modified panel electrodes and the microbial solution can flow through continuously between these electrodes fig 4 microbial inactivation occurs directly through microbe electrode contact charge transfer or the strong electric field at the electrode surface as well as indirectly through ros reactions thus the plug flow reactor is feasible for most of the nm enabled disinfection processes and has been selected as the predominant choice for achieving indirect electrochemical based disinfection table 1 the distance between two electrodes in the plug flow reactor is relatively short 5 10 mm which guarantees a higher mass transfer efficiency 10 5 m s 1 than that of stirred reactor 10 6 m s 1 and leads to a better disinfection performance anglada et al 2010 cano et al 2016 feng et al 2004 pablos et al 2017 furthermore the suitability of the plug flow reactor for the practical application has also been recognized attributed to its feasibility for long term operation without maintenance and potential for automated control by adjusting operation conditions according to water qualities however the short distance between electrodes leads to a huge demand for electrode material for device construction which results in high electrode fabrication costs additionally the upper limit of mass transfer in the plug flow reactor further hinders the high performance disinfection for the practical application 3 3 flow through reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection considering that nm enabled disinfection processes are mostly heterogeneous processes the design of reactors with sufficient treatment rates is an impending challenge in the face of mass transfer limitations simple stirred and plug flow reactors do not provide sufficient microbe nms contact area thus flow through devices with membrane or porous electrodes fig 4 have been studied to improve treatment rates involving mesh based electrode or membrane including ti mesh and cnt membrane as well as 3 dimensional 3d porous electrode including carbon based and metal foam based porous materials gu et al 2019 guo et al 2016 liu et al 2019a in the nm enabled flow through disinfection device microbial solution flow perpendicular to and through the membrane or porous electrodes with a superior mass transfer rate 10 4 m s 1 compared with those of stirred and plug flow reactor which overcomes mass transfer limitations anglada et al 2010 the flow through electrode with micro channels 5 500 Œºm acting as micro reactors are widely applied in physical photo and electro based disinfection processes table 1 huo et al 2016 wang et al 2018 mesh electrodes and some carbon based membrane electrodes e g carbon cloth with thin thicknesses 5 mm show great potential for the photoelectro based disinfection and have achieved a significantly improved ros generation efficiency compared with those of stirred and plug flow reactors gu et al 2019 gu reported a rational strategy using flow through photoanodes zno nanorod modified carbon cloth for effection ros generation during the photoelectrocatalytic process the ros generation performance was evaluated using degradation kinetics of specific organic matters compared to traditional planar photoanodes flow through photoanodes exhibited 4 times for rhodamine b and 3 times for bisphenol a higher degradation kinetics indicating a significantly improved ros generation efficiency gu et al 2019 as for 3d porous electrodes their highly porous networks offer a large surface area with numerous active sites increasing the opportunity for microbes to approach the electrode surface and react with nms which improves the disinfection performance vecitis et al 2011 owing to the high disinfection efficiency and the high throughput the 3d porous electrodes applied in flow through disinfection devices have been confirmed feasible for the physical based and electro based disinfection processes table 1 and showed great potential for practical application however problems of electrode degradation due to hydraulic erosion as well as electrode clogging caused by microbes or other substances in real water requires more attention 3 4 assessment and comparison of nm enabled disinfection devices to set up critical guidance for device selection and construction for future study it is important to enabling assessments for different nm enabled disinfection devices the shortest contact time required for complete disinfection and the eeo value of each nm enabled disinfection technology were summarized and categorized based on the type of device i e stirred reactor plug flow reactor and flow through reactor as shown in fig 5 the reviewed disinfection technologies were separated into three groups which interestingly are consistent with the type of device the flow through reactor gained the shortest contact time for complete disinfection median value of 0 1 min indicating the highest disinfection efficiency fig 6 while the plug flow reactor and the stirred reactor showed longer contact times of 13 and 62 min respectively fig 6 confirming a lowered disinfection efficiency additionally the flow through reactor showed the lowest eeo value 0 002 kw h m 3 order 1 indicating the highest energy efficiency while the plug flow and the stirred reactor showed higher eeo values of 76 and 1123 kw h m 3 order 1 indicating the intensive energy consumption fig 7 attributed to the highest mass transfer rate for microbes approaching the electrode surface the flow through reactor showed the highest disinfection efficiency contact time of 0 1 min with the lowest energy consumption eeo value of 0 002 kw h m 3 order 1 it is noteworthy that the flow through reactor applied in nm enabled disinfection gained a comparable or even better disinfection performance and energy efficiency compared with the conventional low pressure uv technology a conventional fast and energy efficient disinfection technology with contact time 1 min and eeo value 0 005 kw h m 3 order 1 e coli for 3 log inactivation li et al 2017 sholtes and linden 2019 thus flow through devices showed great potential for practical application in fact except for some photo based processes which are not suitable for the flow through device due to the light blocking by 3d bulk electrodes the flow through device might be the ideal option for water disinfection based on the performance and energy consumption 4 challenges and prospects significant obstacles must be overcome before bench scale nm enabled disinfection technologies can be applied to practical application for water treatment most of these challenges originate from unique properties of antimicrobial nms that bring difficulties to treatment process design including the problem of low disinfection efficiency and energy intensiveness as well as the challenge for nms separation recovery and electrode strengthening optimization hodges et al 2018 qu et al 2013b the problem of nm modified electrodes degradation may reduce the lifetime of electrodes and releases hazardous materials to the effluent thus electrode strengthening strategies including anchoring and coating is a promising approach to improve the insufficiency stability of nm modified electrodes to solve these challenges on the one hand the assessment of nm enabled disinfection technology is necessary for offering guidance of process selection and device design based on disinfection performance and energy efficiency on the other hand the rapid developing materials science for the development of purpose based antimicrobial nms and water treatment engineering for the design of practical reactors offer new opportunities for nms separation recovery and electrode strengthening optimization the major challenge for the practical application of nm enabled disinfection is different according to the operation mode of nms i e suspended nms in complete mixing stirred reactor and fixed nms in electrode stirred plug flow and flow through reactor for the practical application of complete mixing stirred reactors where particle sized nms were evenly distributed in reactors nms separation is the most critical problem membrane separation is the most commonly applied nms method in complete mixing stirred systems whereas faced with the challenges of relatively low separation rate and severe particle aggregation considering that the membrane cannot separate all the nms some nms will be retained in the water and release to the ecosystem inevitably to solve this problem the magnetic separation strategy has been explored he et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 typically the magnetic nms for water disinfection is a core shell structure with a functional shell decorated with antimicrobial nms i e physical and peroxy photo based nms enabling disinfection fig 8 a and a magnetic core structure i e fe2o3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles enabling separation within a magnetic field fig 8b gonavelli et al 2013 mangayayam et al 2017 xia et al 2018 although the magnetic separation strategy has been confirmed effective fig 8c but its practical feasibility remains questionable to generate a sufficient and controllable magnetic field usually an electromagnetic induction device instead of a magnet is needed which leads to more electric demand additionally the potential release of nms to the treated effluent is another concern due to the incomplete separation he et al 2019 as for devices using fixed nms such as electrode stirred plug flow and flow through reactor one major challenge for the practical application is the problem of the degradation of nm modified electrodes which reduces the electrode lifetime and releases hazardous materials to the effluent the commonly used nms immobilization method is based on the physical junctions between nms and electrodes and is not likely suitable for practical application due to its insufficient stability additionally nms commonly have high aspect ratios or fragile structures making them easy to detach from the electrode especially when water carrying microbes flows through with a high velocity one promising approach to improve the insufficiency stability of nm modified electrodes is applying robust immobilization strategies including anchoring and coating fig 8d anchoring methods have been confirmed feasible to strength the nm modified electrode in water disinfection including the application of molecular linkers to connect nms and electrodes as well as anchor materials to fill junctions between nms and electrodes fig 8e lee et al 2010a moncayo lasso et al 2008 as for coating methods a nanoscale thin film is commonly applied to protect nm modified electrodes either encapsulating the whole nanostructure or only covering nms surface while maintaining the morphology fig 8d and e huo et al 2019b yang and hoffmann 2016 yang et al 2016 considering that the electrode degradation caused by chemical corrosion mostly occurs at the solution electrode interface the thin film covering all the electrode surface is capable of reducing the electrochemical corrosion and improving the electrode stability effectively additionally the membrane is also an effective process for nms immobilization with the feasible deposit process nms can be immobilized on the membrane surface tightly which enabling long term disinfection brady est√© vez et al 2010a b rahaman et al 2012 vecitis et al 2011 another major challenge for the practical application of fixed nms devices is the mass transfer limitation although flow through systems enable the fast mass transfer fig 8f most studies report only achievements of microbial disinfection using different novel materials fig 8g which have not enabled the optimization method of the flow through system for the special aim of microbial disinfection liu et al 2017a luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b little information is available on understanding the impact of pore structure and size effects of flow through electrodes on disinfection which is critical for the design and the utilization of flow through systems the study of computational fluid dynamics cfd a finite element simulation method is one promising approach to optimize the flow through system by describing electrode properties and fluid conditions fig 8h zhou et al 2018 furthermore cfd simulation is capable of simulating the larger scale reactor by clarifying the device boundary treatment rate and operation load which has great potential value for translating the laboratory scale disinfection process to water treatment practices fig 8h gu et al 2019 in addition to developing nms separation and recovery strategies as well as strengthening nm modified electrodes and optimizing disinfection systems another critical issue from the practical standpoint is the lowered disinfection performance under real water wastewater conditions which is commonly neglected natural organic matter nom from surface water and dissolved organic matter dom from wastewater commonly exist in considerable quantities mg l 1 hu et al 2016 for the ros depended nm enabled disinfection process the disinfection efficiency decreases due to the ros scavenging effect by organic matters brame et al 2015 rincon reported that during the tio2 photocatalysis disinfection process compared to the contact time of 75 min for complete disinfection without organic matter the contact time for complete disinfection increased to 90 min due to the presence of dihydroxybenzene 2 mmol l 1 rincon and pulgarin 2004 furthermore maghsoodi investigated the inhibition effect of different dom fractions toward ros generation performance during photocatalysis reaction and found that the colloidal fraction 5 mg c l 1 in the dom showed the strongest inhibition effect with the decreasing of photodegradation rates by approximately 75 maghsoodi et al 2019 for the physical based and direct oxidation disinfection process the disinfection efficiency decreases may be impacted by the organic matter due to the competitive adsorption onto nms surfaces brame et al 2014 2015 in rahaman s work only 1 52 virus log removal rate was achieved in the presence of 1 mg l 1 of alginate using the cnt filter while without organic matters complete disinfection was achieved 7 2 log removal rahaman et al 2012 although the impact of water quality parameters is investigated at the lab scale the lack of standardized experimental protocol for simulating real water wastewater conditions especially for organic matters sets challenges for quantitative assessments of the disinfection performance chen et al 2011 huo et al 2018b rahaman et al 2012 5 conclusions we have provided an overview of nm enabled innovative processes and devices for water disinfection as well as the established and emerging nms separation recovery methods and electrode strengthening optimization strategies the critical assessment for different disinfection processes and devices based on the disinfection performance the shortest contact time required for complete disinfection and the operation cost eeo provides general guidance for the future research of developing nm enabled disinfection systems additionally the summarized emerging nms separation and electrode strengthening strategies offer opportunities to water treatment practices the key points from our review are as follows 1 the nm enabled electro based disinfection processes i e electrochemical based and electroporation based disinfection gained the highest disinfection performance with the lowest energy consumption compared with physical based peroxy based and photo based disinfection processes on the one hand the high ros generation efficiency indirect electrochemical based process or unique disinfection mechanisms electron transfer for electrochemical based process and membrane damage by the strong electric field for the electroporation based process ensured the great disinfection performance on the other hand the electro based disinfection process offered the direct means of translating energy input to microbes and guaranteed the highest energy efficiency 2 the flow through reactor with mesh membrane or 3d porous electrode showed the highest disinfection performance and energy efficiency compared with the stirred and the plug flow reactor attributed to its highest mass transfer rate according to the requirement of light irritation the mesh membrane and the 3d porous electrode became the predominant choice for system design of photoelectro based and electro based disinfection processes respectively the flow through reactor achieved a comparable or even better disinfection performance and energy efficiency compared with uv disinfection furthermore the small area footprint required for device construction extended the potential value of the flow through reactor for municipal scale water treatment 3 magnetic separation and robust immobilization anchoring and coating are feasible strategies to prompt the practical application of nm enabled disinfection devices with suspended nms complete mixing stirred reactor and fixed nms electrode stirred plug flow and flow through reactor respectively magnetic separation effectively solved the problem for the separation of the evenly distributed particle sized nms from water solution robust immobilization increased the stability of nm modified electrodes and prevent these electrodes from degradation hydraulic detachment and or electrochemical dissolution additionally the cfd study was capable of simulating nm enabled devices which showed great potential for system optimization and reactor expansion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18082,nebivolol neb is widely used for the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure and has become an ubiquitous emerging organic pollutant it has been shown to undergo direct photolysis but the role of dom in its degradation kinetics and mechanism is not well understood in this study we studied the photochemical behavior of neb in the presence of seawater dom sw dom and freshwater dom srnom under simulated sunlight irradiation sw dom had a promotion effect on neb photodegradation whereas srnom retarded its photolytic transformation after eliminating the influence of light screening we found that the indirect photodegradation rate of neb in the presence of srnom was lower than that in the presence of sw dom results show that the indirect photodegradation pathway occurred by reaction with triplet excited dom 3dom the second order rate constants for 3sw dom and 3srnom reaction with neb are 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 and 3 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively the electron donating capacity of srnom is higher than that of sw dom indicating that srnom may contain more activated phenolic moieties srnom may thus have higher antioxidant activity leading a higher inhibitory effect on neb photodegradation a total of six degradation products were identified in the absence and presence of dom by hplc esi ms ms the substitution of f by oh groups and further oxidation a oh group in the lateral chain to a ketone and cleavage of n c bond by the attack of 3dom are here proposed as the main degradation pathways graphical abstract image 1 keywords excited triplet state dissolved organic matter photodegradation nebivolol degradation products mechanisms 1 introduction Œ≤ blockers are Œ≤ adrenergic receptor antagonist drugs and are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and arrhythmias angina and myocardial infarction chen et al 2019 alder et al 2010 maszkowska et al 2014 they are widely consumed drugs all over the world it was reported that the annual consumption of Œ≤ blockers is 100 250 tons in germany maszkowska et al 2014 in 2015 usage of Œ≤ blocker metoprolol in china already reached 64 tons xu et al 2019 due to their large use Œ≤ blockers are commonly detected worldwide in wastewater river seawater and even in groundwater at ng l 1 to Œºg l 1 levels xu et al 2019 for example concentrations of Œ≤ blockers in rivers range from 3 ng l 1 up to 2 2 Œºg l 1 in europe and north america alder et al 2010 metoprolol and propranolol were detected in the narragansett bay in the usa with concentrations up to 313 and 15 ng l 1 respectively cantwell et al 2016 previous studies reported that Œ≤ blockers may have harmful effects on aquatic organisms e g fish invertebrates and green algae maszkowska et al 2014 for example Œ≤ blockers exposures can induce lysosomal damage and change the activity of glutathione s transferase in marine bivalves khan et al 2018 moreover Œ≤ blockers also belong to endocrine disruptive compounds which can affect testosterone levels in male organisms khan et al 2018 nebivolol is a third generation Œ≤ blocker and has the highest Œ≤1 blocking activity among Œ≤ blockers m√ºnzel et al 2009 it was reported that the Œ≤1 receptor affinity of nebivolol is 321 times higher than that of propranolol and carvedilol amiri 2016 nebivolol has been listed as one of the top sold prescription pharmaceuticals in the usa brown 2015 due to the widespread use of nebivolol and its potential toxicity to aquatic organisms it is of great significance to understand its transformation behavior in the aquatic environment previous study reported that only 38 of nebivolol can be removed through conventional biological wastewater treatment salma et al 2017 with most of this drug being discharged into natural water photochemical degradation has been proved to be an important elimination pathway of recalcitrant organic pollutants in sunlit surface waters klimm et al 2019 bao and niu 2015 the photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by water components such as dissolved organic matter dom no3 no2 cl br and fe iii vione et al 2014 li et al 2016 previous studies have shown that dom plays an important role in the photodegradation of organic pollutants filipe et al 2017 zeng and arnold 2013 absorption of light by dom in aquatic environments produces reactive intermediates such as triplet state excited organic matter 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh the reactive intermediates are able to react with organic pollutants santoke and cooper 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 however dom can also contribute to retard photodegradation of organic pollutants by shielding of sunlight quenching of excited states of target pollutants and scavenging of reactive species wenk et al 2011 yong et al 2013 to date most understanding of the effects of dom on photodegradation of organic pollutants have been gained from studies of freshwater dom with less attention to dom from seawater chin and guerard 2012 felcyn et al 2012 the dom source has been shown to affect its chemical composition and reactivity and thus may also affect the fate of organic pollutants guerard et al 2009 in recent studies dom from seawater was also found to play important roles in photosensitized degradation of organic pollutants wang et al 2018 2019 considering that many pollutants can enter the marine environment through river inputs wastewater discharge and marine aquaculture activities the impact of seawater dom on the photochemical fate of organic pollutants deserves attention currently little knowledge of the environmental photochemical behavior of nebivolol is available only one study reported on the photolytic degradation of nebivolol under three different uv treatment procedures uv c at 254 nm uv b at 312 nm and uv a at 365 nm in pure water and wastewater salma et al 2017 however there is no information about the photodegradation kinetics and mechanism of nebivolol in the presence of dom under simulated solar irradiation it is also unknown whether the photodegradation mechanism and pathway of nebivolol in dom solutions and pure water are similar the purpose of this study was to understand the photochemical degradation of nebivolol in different natural organic matter solutions simulated sunlight photodegradation experiments were performed for nebivolol in the presence of seawater dom and freshwater dom respectively scavenging experiments were conducted to explore the roles of reactive intermediates 3dom 1o2 and oh in photosensitized degradation the main photoproducts

compositions of the molecular ions and their fragments were determined and the exact masses were calculated with the help of compound discoverer 2 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct photolysis kinetics the direct photolysis of neb followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics r 0 98 p 0 05 with no remarkable concentration decrease in dark controls fig 1 the observed pseudo first order photolytic rate constants k obs cumulative light absorption quantum yields œÜ and half lives of neb in the ph rang of natural water ph 6 9 under simulated sunlight irradiation are summarized in table s2 k obs values of neb remained practically unchanged by varying the solution ph from 6 to 8 while the corresponding average value was slightly increased by adjusting solution ph to 9 this is due to a slightly larger cumulative light absorption of neb at ph 9 the œÜ values of neb were determined to be 0 021 0 026 in the ph range from 6 to 9 salma et al also reported that the value of œÜ for neb was 0 02 ph 7 during uv b 280 360 nm treatment salma et al 2017 which is comparable to this study 3 2 photodegradation of neb in the presence of dom as shown in fig 2 the average k obs values for neb in the solutions with the freshwater dom srnom and seawater dom sw dom were determined to be 0 44 0 03 h 1 and 0 68 0 02 h 1 respectively our results demonstrate that photodegradation of neb is promoted in the presence of sw dom compared to neb photodegradation in pure water while srnom inhibits its photodegradation this is different from our previous studies that is both seawater dom and freshwater dom were found to have a significant promotion effect on the photodegradation of sunscreen 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone wang et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to clarify the effects of these dom varieties derived from different sources on the photodegradation of neb the absorption of srnom and sw dom overlap with that of neb at 290 405 nm indicating that light screening effects of dom should be considered the total light screening coefficients f were calculated to be 0 61 and 0 92 for srnom and sw dom respectively therefore the respective direct photolysis rate constants of neb in the dom solutions were corrected by multiplying the direct photolysis rate constant of neb in pure water by the f values then indirect photodegradation rate constants in the presence of dom were calculated to be 0 08 h 1 for srnom and 0 14 h 1 for sw dom our results indicate that compared with srnom sw dom was a more effective photosensitizer for neb photodegradation to understand the role of sw dom in the photodegradation of neb scavenging experiments were performed with chemical probes as can be seen from fig 2 in the presence of sw dom addition of dabco had no obvious effects on the photodegradation of neb implying that 1o2 and oh play a minor role in neb photodegradation addition of ipa did not retard photodegradation of neb which further indicated that oh plays a negligible role in neb photodegradation however addition of sa significantly inhibited the photodegradation suggesting that 3dom may be the main reactive intermediate for indirect photodegradation of neb in the presence of dom additionally the neb photodegradation experiments were also carried out in the absence and presence of sw dom in n2 atmosphere it is known that the ground state 3o2 is a quencher of excited triplet states the photodegradation of neb was significantly enhanced in the n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment indicating that the direct photolysis involved the triplet state neb however the n2 atmosphere can further enhance neb photodegradation in the presence of sw dom suggesting that 3dom plays the dominant role in the photodegradation of neb although Œ≤ blockers share similar parent structures the effects of dom on photodegradation of different Œ≤ blockers vary for example in the presence of dom the photodegradation of the Œ≤ blocker atenolol was significantly enhanced with oh being a responsible species zeng et al 2012 unlike the case of neb the possible reasons for the different behaviors of Œ≤ blockers photodegradation in the presence of dom include the effects of steady state concentrations of reactive intermediates second order rate constants between reactive intermediates and Œ≤ blockers light screening by dom and excited states quenching we measured 3dom steady state concentrations 3dom ss in dom solutions using tmp fig s3 3dom ss for the sw dom 1 06 10 14 m is 5 7 times lower than that for the srnom 6 04 10 14 m suggesting that the more efficient promotion effects of sw dom on neb photodegradation were not due to the 3dom ss 3dom ss is associated with the rates of light absorption of dom and quantum yields of the 3dom zhou et al 2018 the rates of light absorption for srnom and sw dom were calculated to be 2 00 10 9 and 2 76 10 10 e cm 3 s 1 srnom has higher rates of light absorption than sw dom due to its higher absorbance meanwhile we also determined the œÜ 3dom and f tmp of 3dom œÜ 3dom values for srnom and sw dom are 1 51 10 2 and 1 92 10 2 respectively we found that dom source does not have a significant effect on œÜ 3dom values marchisio et al 2015 also reported that the differences in quantum yield of reactive intermediates were relatively small when taking into account the potentially huge environmental variability the f tmp values for srnom and sw dom are 90 2 and 110 5 m 1 respectively therefore the low rate of light absorption of sw dom results in its low 3dom ss it is assumed that the reaction with 3dom is responsible for the indirect photodegradation of neb in the presence of dom then the second order rate constants for neb reaction with 3dom can be obtained by calculating the ratio of the indirect photodegradation rate constants of dom to the 3dom ss of each dom our results show that the second order rate constants for the reaction of 3srnom and 3sw dom with neb are 3 7 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the high second order rate constants may be important for explaining the promotion effect of sw dom on the photodegradation of neb it should be noted that the 3dom measured by tmp is assumed to be the same as 3dom that reacts with neb however in fact the 3dom reacts with tmp may be different from the 3dom reaction with neb in future research it is necessary to further accurately determine the 3dom that react with tmp and pollutants respectively to further elucidate the degradation mechanisms in the presence of dom the photodegradation products will be discussed later additionally the phenolic moieties of dom may act as antioxidants and inhibit the triplet induced transformation of organic pollutants such as n n dimethylaniline and sulfonamides leresche et al 2016 previous studies reported that the edc of dom were positively correlated with their phenol contents aeschbacher et al 2011 lv et al 2018 therefore we measured the edc values of srnom and sw dom with the mediated electrochemical oxidation method fig 3 the edc values were determined to be 3 3 10 6 mole mg c for srnom and 2 1 10 7 mole mg c for sw dom the edc of srnom measured in this study is similar to that reported by walpen et al 2016 previous studies reported that the values of e2 e3 and f tmp of dom show inverse relationships to edc of dom zhou et al 2017 mckay et al 2016 from the absorption spectra of the dom the values of e2 e3 for srnom and sw dom were computed to be 4 76 and 7 15 respectively therefore our results show that srnom may contain higher electron donating moieties compared to sw dom implying that srnom may have a higher inhibitory effect on the transformation of neb by reducing the transformation intermediates back to the parent compound 3 3 identification of photodegradation products the main degradation products generated under simulated sunlight irradiation were identified to determine the reaction mechanisms in the absence and presence of dom in this work a total of 6 degradation products dp1 dp6 were identified by accurate analysis of the ms fig s4 and ms2 fig 4 spectra and comparison with the fragmentation pathways of the parent compound table 1 shows data related to the exact experimental and theoretical masses of protonated ions relative mass errors the retention time rt and the proposed empirical formula together with the proposed structures three degradation products in pure water arose at rt 4 02 1 45 and 4 55 min that corresponded to dp1 dp2 and dp3 products with m h ions at m z 404 1868 402 1909 and 402 1714 respectively ms and ms2 spectra of dp1 dp3 in the presence of dom are shown in fig s5 and fig s6 as can be seen from fig 4 three product ions at m z 151 0555 123 0607 and 109 0452 were both observed in the ms2 spectra of dp1 and neb the characteristic fragment ions m z at 149 0600 121 0650 107 0494 and 95 0496 in the spectrum of dp1 indicated the substitution of f with oh therefore the dp1 was possibly formed by substitution of one of the f atoms with an oh group the m z 151 0555 fragment ion that was present in both neb and dp1 was absent in the spectrum of dp2 moreover substitution of a f with an oh group in the m z 177 0712 fragment in the spectrum of neb brought forth the m z 175 0750 fragment ion in the fragmentation pattern of dp2 indicating a substitution of both f atoms by oh groups in the structure of dp2 the dp1 and dp2 have also been identified as products of neb photolytic degradation during the uv treatment salma et al 2017 the cited authors also observed a defluorination product with molecular ion at m z 386 1959 salma et al 2017 however that product was not detected in our study which may be due to differences in the light sources used in the photochemical experiments additionally we observed the formation of a new degradation product dp3 with molecular ion at m z 402 1714 in pure water the presence of the ions at m z 151 0555 149 0600 123 0607 and 224 1083 confirmed the substitution of a f atom by an oh group in the neb molecule we propose dp3 to be formed by oxidation a hydroxyl group to a ketone in the lateral chain of dp1 the degradation products formed in the presence of srnom and sw dom were also identified our results show that three more degradation products dp4 dp6 were observed in both of srnom and sw dom solutions the signals appearing at retention times of 2 12 and 5 98 min were identified as the molecular ions m h at m z 212 108 and 195 1015 and labeled as intermediate product dp4 and dp5 respectively the presence of the ions at m z 151 0555 123 0607 109 0452 103 0546 and 95 0496 in dp4 mass spectrum and of the ions at m z 149 0600 and 95 0496 in dp5 mass spectrum confirmed the formation of dp4 and dp5 from the cleavage of the c n bond of dp1 the degradation product dp6 was identified as molecular ion m h at m z 210 1125 appearing at a retention time of 0 82 min the presence of the ions at m z 175 0750 149 0600 121 0650 and 107 0494 and the absence of the fragments at m z 177 0712 165 0712 151 0555 123 0607 and 109 0452 indicated the substitution of a f atom by a oh group therefore the formation of dp6 may be due to the cleavage of the c n bond of dp2 and at the same time it might then give rise to the degradation product dp5 3 4 photosensitive mechanism of dom in neb photodegradation the different degradation products were identified in pure water and dom solutions indicating that there are two different degradation pathways in these matrixes although srnom inhibits the photodegradation of neb its degradation products are consistent with those in the presence of sw dom indicating that both dom types can induce the indirect photodegradation of neb via similar pathways involving 3dom a schematic for the hypothesized pathways of the photodegradation of neb is given in the fig 5 for the degradation of neb in pure water dp1 and dp2 are possibly formed by hydroxyl groups substitution of one or two fluorine atoms the degradation product dp3 would further be formed by oxidizing a hydroxyl group in the lateral chain of dp1 to a ketone which was also observed in the electrochemical oxidation of neb er et al 2016 in the dom solutions the three new degradation products dp4 dp6 might be formed by reaction of 3dom with the secondary amines of dp1 and dp2 the nonbonding electron of nitrogen in the secondary amines would be transferred to 3dom leading to the formation of a n radical cation and then the transfer of Œ± h would give rise to carbon radical intermediates the subsequent deprotonation would result in the formation of an intermediate with nc bond followed by the cleavage of the double bond to yield the degradation products dp4 dp6 a similar electron transfer mechanism was also verified for the reaction of 3dom with other amine compounds such as mexiletine propranolol and diphenhydramine makunina et al 2015 chen et al 2012 our results show that in the presence of dom especially seawater dom the direct photolysis products of neb may be further degraded it indicates that dom should be considered when assessing the photochemical fate of neb in the aquatic environment 4 conclusion the results obtained in this study suggest that neb could undergo photochemical degradation in the absence and presence of dom under simulated sunlight irradiation k obs values of neb in pure water were close to each other at the natural water ph range ph 6 0 9 0 sw dom was found to enhance the photodegradation processes the high reactivity of 3sw dom with neb was primarily responsible for the increased photodegradation rates of neb however srnom could inhibit the photochemical transformation of neb because the contribution of the indirect photodegradation of neb by 3srnom was lower than the light screening effects of srnom and its quenching effect on the radical intermediates of neb three new degradation products were identified in dom solutions compared to pure water electron transfer is likely involved into the degradation mechanism of neb in the presence of dom these results highlight the importance of studying

18082,nebivolol neb is widely used for the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure and has become an ubiquitous emerging organic pollutant it has been shown to undergo direct photolysis but the role of dom in its degradation kinetics and mechanism is not well understood in this study we studied the photochemical behavior of neb in the presence of seawater dom sw dom and freshwater dom srnom under simulated sunlight irradiation sw dom had a promotion effect on neb photodegradation whereas srnom retarded its photolytic transformation after eliminating the influence of light screening we found that the indirect photodegradation rate of neb in the presence of srnom was lower than that in the presence of sw dom results show that the indirect photodegradation pathway occurred by reaction with triplet excited dom 3dom the second order rate constants for 3sw dom and 3srnom reaction with neb are 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 and 3 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively the electron donating capacity of srnom is higher than that of sw dom indicating that srnom may contain more activated phenolic moieties srnom may thus have higher antioxidant activity leading a higher inhibitory effect on neb photodegradation a total of six degradation products were identified in the absence and presence of dom by hplc esi ms ms the substitution of f by oh groups and further oxidation a oh group in the lateral chain to a ketone and cleavage of n c bond by the attack of 3dom are here proposed as the main degradation pathways graphical abstract image 1 keywords excited triplet state dissolved organic

previous studies reported that Œ≤ blockers may have harmful effects on aquatic organisms e g fish invertebrates and green algae maszkowska et al 2014 for example Œ≤ blockers exposures can induce lysosomal damage and change the activity of glutathione s transferase in marine bivalves khan et al 2018 moreover Œ≤ blockers also belong to endocrine disruptive compounds which can affect

2015 due to the widespread use of nebivolol and its potential toxicity to aquatic organisms it is of great significance to understand its transformation behavior in the aquatic environment previous study reported that only 38 of nebivolol can be removed through conventional biological wastewater treatment salma et al 2017 with most of this drug being discharged into natural water photochemical degradation has been proved to be an important elimination pathway of recalcitrant organic pollutants in sunlit surface waters klimm et al 2019 bao and niu 2015 the photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by water components such as dissolved organic matter dom no3 no2 cl br and fe iii vione et al 2014 li et al 2016 previous studies have shown that dom plays an important role in the photodegradation of organic pollutants filipe et al 2017 zeng and arnold 2013 absorption of light by dom in aquatic environments produces reactive intermediates such as triplet state excited organic matter 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh the reactive intermediates are able to react with organic pollutants santoke and cooper 2017 mcneill and canonica 2016 however dom can also contribute to retard photodegradation of organic pollutants by shielding of sunlight quenching of excited states of target pollutants and scavenging of reactive species wenk et al 2011 yong et al 2013 to date most understanding of the effects of dom on photodegradation of organic pollutants have been gained from studies of freshwater dom with less attention to dom from seawater chin and guerard 2012 felcyn et al 2012 the dom source has been shown to affect its chemical composition and reactivity and thus may also affect the fate of organic pollutants guerard et al 2009 in recent studies dom from seawater was also found to play important roles in photosensitized degradation of organic pollutants wang et al 2018 2019 considering that many pollutants can enter the marine environment through river inputs wastewater discharge and marine aquaculture activities the impact of seawater dom on the photochemical fate of organic pollutants deserves attention currently little knowledge of the environmental photochemical behavior of nebivolol is available only one study reported on the photolytic degradation of nebivolol under three different uv treatment procedures uv c at 254 nm uv b at 312 nm and uv a at 365 nm in pure water and wastewater salma et al 2017 however there is no information about the photodegradation kinetics and mechanism of nebivolol in the presence of dom under simulated solar irradiation it is also unknown whether the photodegradation mechanism and pathway of nebivolol in dom solutions and pure water are similar the purpose of this study was to understand the photochemical degradation of nebivolol in different natural organic matter solutions simulated sunlight photodegradation experiments were performed for nebivolol in the presence of seawater dom and freshwater dom respectively scavenging experiments were conducted to explore the roles of reactive intermediates 3dom 1o2 and oh in photosensitized degradation the main photoproducts

ruthenium iridium working electrode we a pt counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid abts was used as the electron transfer mediator between the electron donating moieties in dom and the we the electrochemical cell was first filled with 130 150 ml of buffer solution 0 1 m kcl 0 1 m phosphate ph 7 the we was equilibrated to

compositions of the molecular ions and their fragments were determined and the exact masses were calculated with the help of compound discoverer 2 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct photolysis kinetics the direct photolysis of neb followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics r 0 98 p 0 05 with no remarkable concentration decrease in dark controls fig 1 the observed pseudo first order photolytic rate constants k obs cumulative light absorption quantum yields œÜ and half lives of neb in the ph rang of natural water ph 6 9 under simulated sunlight irradiation are summarized in table s2 k obs values of neb remained practically unchanged by varying the solution ph from 6 to 8 while the corresponding average value was slightly increased by adjusting solution ph to 9 this is due to a slightly larger cumulative light absorption of neb at ph 9 the œÜ values of neb were determined to be 0 021 0 026 in the ph range from 6 to 9 salma et al also reported that the value of œÜ for neb was 0 02 ph 7 during uv b 280 360 nm treatment salma et al 2017 which is comparable to this study 3 2 photodegradation of neb in the presence of dom as shown in fig 2 the average k obs values for neb in the solutions with the freshwater dom srnom and seawater dom sw dom were determined to be 0 44 0 03 h 1 and 0 68 0 02 h 1 respectively our results demonstrate that photodegradation of neb is promoted in the presence of sw dom compared to neb photodegradation in pure water while srnom inhibits its photodegradation this is different from our previous studies that is both seawater dom and freshwater dom were found to have a significant promotion effect on the photodegradation of sunscreen 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone wang et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to clarify the effects of these dom varieties derived from different sources on the photodegradation of neb the absorption of srnom and sw dom overlap with that of neb at 290 405 nm indicating that light screening effects of dom should be considered the total light screening coefficients f were calculated to be 0 61 and 0 92 for srnom and sw dom respectively therefore the respective direct photolysis rate constants of neb in the dom solutions were corrected by multiplying the direct photolysis rate constant of neb in pure water by the f values then indirect photodegradation rate constants in the presence of dom were calculated to be 0 08 h 1 for srnom and 0 14 h 1 for sw dom our results indicate that compared with srnom sw dom was a more effective photosensitizer for neb photodegradation to understand the role of sw dom in the photodegradation of neb scavenging experiments were performed with chemical probes as can be seen from fig 2 in the presence of sw dom addition of dabco had no obvious effects on the photodegradation of neb implying that 1o2 and oh play a minor role in neb photodegradation addition of ipa did not retard photodegradation of neb which further indicated that oh plays a negligible role in neb photodegradation however addition of sa significantly inhibited the photodegradation suggesting that 3dom may be the main reactive intermediate for indirect photodegradation of neb in the presence of dom additionally the neb photodegradation experiments were also carried out in the absence and presence of sw dom in n2 atmosphere it is known that the ground state 3o2 is a quencher of excited triplet states the photodegradation of neb was significantly enhanced in the n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment indicating that the direct photolysis involved the triplet state neb however the n2 atmosphere can further enhance neb photodegradation in the presence of sw dom suggesting that 3dom plays the dominant role in the photodegradation of neb although Œ≤ blockers share similar parent structures the effects of dom on photodegradation of different Œ≤ blockers vary for example in the presence of dom the photodegradation of the Œ≤ blocker atenolol was significantly enhanced with oh being a responsible species zeng et al 2012 unlike the case of neb the possible reasons for the different behaviors of Œ≤ blockers photodegradation in the presence of dom include the effects of steady state concentrations of reactive intermediates second order rate constants between reactive intermediates and Œ≤ blockers light screening by dom and excited states quenching we measured 3dom steady state concentrations 3dom ss in dom solutions using tmp fig s3 3dom ss for the sw dom 1 06 10 14 m is 5 7 times lower than that for the srnom 6 04 10 14 m suggesting that the more efficient promotion effects of sw dom on neb photodegradation were not due to the 3dom ss 3dom ss is associated with the rates of light absorption of dom and quantum yields of the 3dom zhou et al 2018 the rates of light absorption for srnom and sw dom were calculated to be 2 00 10 9 and 2 76 10 10 e cm 3 s 1 srnom has higher rates of light absorption than sw dom due to its higher absorbance meanwhile we also determined the œÜ 3dom and f tmp of 3dom œÜ 3dom values for srnom and sw dom are 1 51 10 2 and 1 92 10 2 respectively we found that dom source does not have a significant effect on œÜ 3dom values marchisio et al 2015 also reported that the differences in quantum yield of reactive intermediates were relatively small when taking into account the potentially huge environmental variability the f tmp values for srnom and sw dom are 90 2 and 110 5 m 1 respectively therefore the low rate of light absorption of sw dom results in its low 3dom ss it is assumed that the reaction with 3dom is responsible for the indirect photodegradation of neb in the presence of dom then the second order rate constants for neb reaction with 3dom can be obtained by calculating the ratio of the indirect photodegradation rate constants of dom to the 3dom ss of each dom our results show that the second order rate constants for the reaction of 3srnom and 3sw dom with neb are 3 7 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the high second order rate constants may be important for explaining the promotion effect of sw dom on the photodegradation of neb it should be noted that the 3dom measured by tmp is assumed to be the same as 3dom that reacts with neb however in fact the 3dom reacts with tmp may be different from the 3dom reaction with neb in future research it is necessary to further accurately determine the 3dom that react with tmp and pollutants respectively to further elucidate the degradation mechanisms in the presence of dom the photodegradation products will be discussed later additionally the phenolic moieties of dom may act as antioxidants and inhibit the triplet induced transformation of organic pollutants such as n n dimethylaniline and sulfonamides leresche et al 2016 previous studies reported that the edc of dom were positively correlated with their phenol contents aeschbacher et al 2011 lv et al 2018 therefore we measured the edc values of srnom and sw dom with the mediated electrochemical oxidation method fig 3 the edc values were determined to be 3 3 10 6 mole mg c for srnom and 2 1 10 7 mole mg c for sw dom the edc of srnom measured in this study is similar to that reported by walpen et al 2016 previous studies reported that the values of e2 e3 and f tmp of dom show inverse relationships to edc of dom zhou et al 2017 mckay et al 2016 from the absorption spectra of the dom the values of e2 e3 for srnom and sw dom were computed to be 4 76 and 7 15 respectively therefore our results show that srnom may contain higher electron donating moieties compared to sw dom implying that srnom may have a higher inhibitory effect on the transformation of neb by reducing the transformation intermediates back to the parent compound 3 3 identification of photodegradation products the main degradation products generated under simulated sunlight irradiation were identified to determine the reaction mechanisms in the absence and presence of dom in this work a total of 6 degradation products dp1 dp6 were identified by accurate analysis of the ms fig s4 and ms2 fig 4 spectra and comparison with the fragmentation pathways of the parent compound table 1 shows data related to the exact experimental and theoretical masses of protonated ions relative mass errors the retention time rt and the proposed empirical formula together with the proposed structures three degradation products in pure water arose at rt 4 02 1 45 and 4 55 min that corresponded to dp1 dp2 and dp3 products with m h ions at m z 404 1868 402 1909 and 402 1714 respectively ms and ms2 spectra of dp1 dp3 in the presence of dom are shown in fig s5 and fig s6 as can be seen from fig 4 three product ions at m z 151 0555 123 0607 and 109 0452 were both observed in the ms2 spectra of dp1 and neb the characteristic fragment ions m z at 149 0600 121 0650 107 0494 and 95 0496 in the spectrum of dp1 indicated the substitution of f with oh therefore the dp1 was possibly formed by substitution of one of the f atoms with an oh group the m z 151 0555 fragment ion that was present in both neb and dp1 was absent in the spectrum of dp2 moreover substitution of a f with an oh group in the m z 177 0712 fragment in the spectrum of neb brought forth the m z 175 0750 fragment ion in the fragmentation pattern of dp2 indicating a substitution of both f atoms by oh groups in the structure of dp2 the dp1 and dp2 have also been identified as products of neb photolytic degradation during the uv treatment salma et al 2017 the cited authors also observed a defluorination product with molecular ion at m z 386 1959 salma et al 2017 however that product was not detected in our study which may be due to differences in the light sources used in the photochemical experiments additionally we observed the formation of a new degradation product dp3 with molecular ion at m z 402 1714 in pure water the presence of the ions at m z 151 0555 149 0600 123 0607 and 224 1083 confirmed the substitution of a f atom by an oh group in the neb molecule we propose dp3 to be formed by oxidation a hydroxyl group to a ketone in the lateral chain of dp1 the degradation products formed in the presence of srnom and sw dom were also identified our results show that three more degradation products dp4 dp6 were observed in both of srnom and sw dom solutions the signals appearing at retention times of 2 12 and 5 98 min were identified as the molecular ions m h at m z 212 108 and 195 1015 and labeled as intermediate product dp4 and dp5 respectively the presence of the ions at m z 151 0555 123 0607 109 0452 103 0546 and 95 0496 in dp4 mass spectrum and of the ions at m z 149 0600 and 95 0496 in dp5 mass spectrum confirmed the formation of dp4 and dp5 from the cleavage of the c n bond of dp1 the degradation product dp6 was identified as molecular ion m h at m z 210 1125 appearing at a retention time of 0 82 min the presence of the ions at m z 175 0750 149 0600 121 0650 and 107 0494 and the absence of the fragments at m z 177 0712 165 0712 151 0555 123 0607 and 109 0452 indicated the substitution of a f atom by a oh group therefore the formation of dp6 may be due to the cleavage of the c n bond of dp2 and at the same time it might then give rise to the degradation product dp5 3 4 photosensitive mechanism of dom in neb photodegradation the different degradation products were identified in pure water and dom solutions indicating that there are two different degradation pathways in these matrixes although srnom inhibits the photodegradation of neb its degradation products are consistent with those in the presence of sw dom indicating that both dom types can induce the indirect photodegradation of neb via similar pathways involving 3dom a schematic for the hypothesized pathways of the photodegradation of neb is given in the fig 5 for the degradation of neb in pure water dp1 and dp2 are possibly formed by hydroxyl groups substitution of one or two fluorine atoms the degradation product dp3 would further be formed by oxidizing a hydroxyl group in the lateral chain of dp1 to a ketone which was also observed in the electrochemical oxidation of neb er et al 2016 in the dom solutions the three new degradation products dp4 dp6 might be formed by reaction of 3dom with the secondary amines of dp1 and dp2 the nonbonding electron of nitrogen in the secondary amines would be transferred to 3dom leading to the formation of a n radical cation and then the transfer of Œ± h would give rise to carbon radical intermediates the subsequent deprotonation would result in the formation of an intermediate with nc bond followed by the cleavage of the double bond to yield the degradation products dp4 dp6 a similar electron transfer mechanism was also verified for the reaction of 3dom with other amine compounds such as mexiletine propranolol and diphenhydramine makunina et al 2015 chen et al 2012 our results show that in the presence of dom especially seawater dom the direct photolysis products of neb may be further degraded it indicates that dom should be considered when assessing the photochemical fate of neb in the aquatic environment 4 conclusion the results obtained in this study suggest that neb could undergo photochemical degradation in the absence and presence of dom under simulated sunlight irradiation k obs values of neb in pure water were close to each other at the natural water ph range ph 6 0 9 0 sw dom was found to enhance the photodegradation processes the high reactivity of 3sw dom with neb was primarily responsible for the increased photodegradation rates of neb however srnom could inhibit the photochemical transformation of neb because the contribution of the indirect photodegradation of neb by 3srnom was lower than the light screening effects of srnom and its quenching effect on the radical intermediates of neb three new degradation products were identified in dom solutions compared to pure water electron transfer is likely involved into the degradation mechanism of neb in the presence of dom these results highlight the importance of studying

18083,the conventional biological nutrients removal process is challenged by insufficient organic carbon in influent to cross such an organic dependent barrier a pilot scale electrolysis integrated anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process was developed for enhanced removal of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from low carbon nitrogen c n municipal wastewater average removal efficiencies of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the electrolysis aao reached to 77 24 and 95 08 respectively showing increases of 13 88 and 21 87 as compared to the control reactor spatial variations of n and p showed that nh4 n removal rate was promoted in aerobic zone of electrolysis aao the intensified tn elimination which was mostly reflected by abatement of no3 n with the concomitant slight accumulation of nh4 n and no2 n mainly occurred in anoxic2 compartment as the electrons supplied by electrolysis furthermore minor p contents were measured and remained almost unchanged along the reaction units indicating that chemical precipitation should be the dominant mechanism of p removal in electrolysis aao from the metagenomic based taxonomy phylum actinobacteria was dramatically inhibited and phylum proteobacteria dominated the electrolysis aao particularly nitrifying bacteria and multifarious autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched meanwhile a significant evolution of heterotrophic denitrifiers was found in electrolysis aao compared to control which was mostly reflected by the inhibition of genus candidatus microthrix batch tests further confirmed that autotrophic denitrifiers using h2 and fe2 as essential electron sinks were mainly responsible for the electrolysis induced denitrification differential metabolic capacities were revealed from the perspectives of functional enzymes and genes and network analysis allowed insight of microbial taxa functional genes associations and shed light on stronger relevance between autotrophic denitrifiers and denitrification associated genes in the electrolysis aao system graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrolysis modified aao process low c n municipal wastewater advanced n and p removal metagenomics 1 introduction with the rapid economic development and the significant improvement in living standards around the world considerable amounts of domestic and industrial wastes containing excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p are discharged into municipal wastewater which can cause eutrophication in receiving waters and bring potential risks to environmental and human health shen et al 2019 tian et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 hence increasingly strict discharge standards for municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps were proposed wang et al 2015 in china total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations in influent of municipal wwtps ranged from 19 to 51 mg l and 1 8 5 9 mg l respectively sun et al 2016 the most immediate challenge for advanced nutrients removal is the lack of organic carbon ding et al 2018 which is the electron donor as well as energy source for traditional biological denitrification and phosphorus removal given that most municipal wastewater in china especially in south regions is characterized by low carbon nitrogen ratio c n it is necessary to supply external organic carbon source such as methanol glycerine or sugar zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 which may cause extra costs and potential residuals and therefore limits the sustainable operation of wwtps dasgupta et al 2017 as the most widespread biological nutrients removal configuration the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process can achieve simultaneous removal of organics n and p over the past decades various improvement avenues aimed at efficient exploitation of limited carbon source were developed for aao process to achieve advanced nutrients removal from low c n wastewater among them employing denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr in aao process has been confirmed its feasibility and attracts many attentions due to its capability of simultaneous removal of n and p with less carbon source to realize this enhancement a common approach is integrating aao and a biofilm system zhang et al 2016 in which efficient nitrification is implemented in the later unit and denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos are enriched in aao by increasing anoxic aerobic ratio zhang et al 2013 although excellent performance can be accomplished an additional treatment unit is sure to add the construction cost and land occupation another optimization technology is establishing nitrite based pathways in aao system such as partial nitrification denitrification jiang et al 2019 and partial nitrification anammox xiao et al 2016 which reduce more than 40 carbon demand however a drawback of this route is the difficulty of achieving stable nitrite accumulation which complicates its operation and control more recently nutrients removal using biological metabolism assisted by electrolysis has become one of the most attractive selections among various alternatives for treatment of low c n wastewater in such a system generally p is removed through electro coagulation motivated by electro dissolution of sacrificial anodes iron or aluminum considering the human health risks of aluminum salts kimura et al 2013 iron anode provides much more advantages the complete electrolysis process using iron as anode material can be described by the following reaction irdemez et al 2006 1 cathode 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 2 anode 4fe 4fe2 8e the h2 produced on cathode is a thermodynamically favorable electron sink for autotrophic denitrification and shows high denitrification rates sahu et al 2009 vasiliadou et al 2006a this hydrogenotrophic denitrification process has gained the most attention due to its capacity to break the organic dependent barrier furthermore h2 is regarded as the cleanest electron donor for denitrification since the low biomass yield and no undesirable substrate or derivative are generated during the reaction epsztein et al 2016 recent evidence has demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic denitrifying genera represented by hydrogenophaga thauera paracoccus etc could be effectively enriched in an electrolysis integrated constructed wetland treating synthetic wastewater without organic carbon proving the critical role of h2 driven denitrification gao et al 2017 in this novel system with the exception of h2 ferrous ion fe2 generated from anodizing of sacrificial iron anode can also act as electron donor for autotrophic denitrification however the redox differential between electron acceptor and donor is actually low 230 mv di capua et al 2019 resulting in a lower reaction rate nevertheless according to the previous study denitrifiers showed positive correlation with fe oxidizing bacteria feob and fe reducing bacteria ferb in an electrolysis constructed wetland indicating the autotrophic denitrification based on fe cycle may also indeed be responsible for nitrate removal in electrolysis augmented bio system zhang et al 2018 although considerable amounts of works have been conducted most of the hitherto reported studies focused on developing a separate bio electrochemical system for advanced treatment of wwtps effluents gao et al 2018 xu et al 2017 attempt of integrating electrolysis and basic biological process for treating low c n municipal wastewater is still lacked in our prior study electrolysis device was equipped in a modified aao reactor to intensify the nutrients removal from municipal sewage the performance of this retrofitted process under different current supplies was discussed gong et al 2018 it first verified the feasibility of applying electrolysis integrated aao process to achieve advanced nutrients removal without additional procedure however the microbial community composition metabolic mechanisms and enhancement characteristics are still unclear metagenomic analysis is an accurate and culture independent molecular method based on sequencing of total dna in environmental samples it has been applied in many research areas to reveal complex microbial communities and identify known and novel functional genes or enzymes daraei et al 2019 yazdanbakhsh et al 2019 in this study a pilot scale parallel experiment was performed and the mechanisms of this electrolysis driven enhancement were thoroughly investigated by using metagenomics the aims of this work were to i evaluate the performance of modified aao coupling electrolysis electrolysis aao during the long term operation ii reveal the metabolic mechanisms and characteristics from the perspectives of microbial community structure metabolic pathways and functional genes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus two

the lack of organic carbon for denitrification limits a further removal of tn by contrast despite there was a similar nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent of r1 the no3 n concentration deeply decreased from 11 04 mg l to 6 79 mg l during the first 13 days of operation and then remained stable in the following period with concentration of 6 88 0 50 mg l indicating the electrolysis aao system could be constructed rapidly the average tn removal rate of r1 was 77 24 showing an increase of 13 88 as compared to control reactor r0 as for tp removal efficiency a sharp raising occurred in r1 once the operation starting after only 4 days average tp removal rate reached to 95 08 and effluent tp concentration was 0 19 0 04 mg l achieving an apparent enhancement in comparison to r0 average tp removal rate was 73 21 given that the enhanced po4 3 p elimination in electrolysis retrofitted system is due mainly to chemical precipitation process with participation of metal cation gao et al 2018 the iron ions produced by electro dissolution of anode might explain this intensified p removal overall the electrolysis aao could improve the removal efficiencies of n mostly in the form of no3 n and p rapidly and exhibited a stability during the long term operation furthermore the mlss concentration in r1 was higher than that in r0 over time fig s3a the retained fe in solid phase which might be caused by oxidizing of dissolved fe ii could explain this gap meanwhile little difference of mlvss was found between these reactors fig s3b suggesting the similar biomass contents it is possible to speculate that heterotrophic proliferation motivated by organic matters in influent was the decisive factor for biomass concentration 3 2 spatial distribution of n and p fig 3 presents the variations of n and p along reaction chambers it can be discerned that nh4 n removal mainly occurred in oxic1 chambers where the calculated average specific ammonia removal rates were 4 91 and 5 96 mg nh4 n g vss h for r0 and r1 respectively considering that do was controlled at a same level in these reactors this result proved that electrolysis aao has a positive effect on nitrification rate even though the nh4 n outflow contents of the compared systems were not different meanwhile tn removal in r1 exhibited an evident enhancement compared to r0 and the differences were mainly derived from anaerobic zone and anoxic2 zone different no3 n contents in returned sludge could explain the tn gap occurred in anaerobic tanks while the tn decrease detected in anoxic2 compartment of r1 should be attributed to electrolysis intervention focusing on anoxic2 chambers negligible variations of nh4 n and no3 n 0 1 mg l were observed in r0 and the weak no2 n reduction average 0 2 mg l was the main process this was mainly caused by the scarce organic carbon in this unit in contrast although slight nh4 n and no2 n accumulations were found in anoxic2 compartment of r1 the no3 n average 3 54 mg l was significantly removed allowing a severe decline of tn concentration therefore the electrolysis induced n removal enhancement was mostly reflected by nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction was presumed to be the limiting step of further n removal besides accumulation of nh4 n which is generated from dissimilatory reduction of nitrate has been extensively observed in other bio electrochemical systems huang et al 2013 tong et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 in our study similar phenomenon was found in electrolysis unit the corresponding microbial mechanisms would be revealed by metagenomics subsequently with regard to p distribution the p contents in r0 exhibited a continuously decreasing trend along reaction route unlike this trend however it remained almost unchanged and always maintained at low concentrations 0 2 mg l in r1 the iron compounds in sludge recycling might engender this instantaneous and considerable removal of aqueous p in r1 in depth investigations with respect to fe p products and the potential of p recovery are warranted we focus here on the microbial community evolutions and n metabolic mechanisms 3 3 microbial community structure and functions after searching against ncbi nr database a total of 29 398 298 r0 and 28 120 062 r1 reads were categorized to putative taxonomic groups among which 98 99 r0 and 98 98 r1 were bacteria followed by archaea r0 0 58 r1 0 59 eukaryota r0 0 28 r1 0 28 and norank r0 0 15 r1 0 16 microbial communities at phylum and class levels are shown in fig 4 a and b the dominant phyla in r0 were actinobacteria 40 59 followed by proteobacteria 25 10 chloroflexi 14 23 and bacteroidetes 8 93 while a notable shift of the most dominant phylum from actinobacteria to proteobacteria was detected in r1 implying that growth of actinobacteria could be inhibited and enrichment of proteobacteria could be facilitated by coupling electrolysis device taxonomic comparison down to class level suggested that the two classes belonged to phylum actinobacteria named actinobacteria and acidimicrobiia declined by 6 37 and 9 99 in r1 respectively according to previous reports actinobacteria and acidimicrobiia usually acted as bridge to maintain floc stability and dimension wilen et al 2008 in this study the sludge flocs collected from r1 was more compact and a remarkable size reduction was observed compared with r0 fig s4 the different macrostructure was expected to result from the remarkable reduction in abundance of the aforementioned two classes moreover the four subdivisions of proteobacteria alpha beta gamma and delta were all promoted in r1 which showed increases of 1 14 6 86 3 04 and 1 57 respectively lots of evidences have proven that numerous bacteria responsible for n removal are affiliated with the four subclasses of proteobacteria shu et al 2016 thus the excellent n removal performance in r1 could be attributable to this microbial evolution in addition based on the fact that previously identified autotrophic denitrifiers are randomly distributed within the four subdivisions of proteobacteria it was speculated that diverse autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched as the supply of alternative electron donors concerning the successions of microbial consortium at genus level as shown in fig 4c nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in both systems the abundance of which increased by 0 33 and 1 05 in r1 respectively this change could be an explanation for the promoted nh4 n removal rate in r1 aerobic zone furthermore various widely reported heterotrophic denitrifiers were identified and slight increases in abundance were observed for most of these members such as lautropia r0 0 92 r1 1 41 ottowia r0 0 51 r1 0 58 steroidobacter r0 0 87 r1 1 42 and arenimonas r0 0 15 r1 0 23 gui et al 2019 li et al 2017 ma et al 2015 xing et al 2018a the most abundant two genera candidatus microthrix and ardenticatena in both r1 and r0 were also reported to possess denitrifying capability to be specific the relative abundance of candidatus microthrix greatly dropped from 11 54 in r0 to 2 97 in r1 signaling a significant inhibition in the electrolysis aao reactor this genus was usually reported as a common filamentous bacterium in wwtps with capability of lipid metabolism and denitrification chen et al 2018 lienen et al 2014 a possible reason for its dominant growth in r0 could be plentiful lipid in the feeding raw wastewater dosing iron salts has been previously reported as a feasible way to suppress the growth of candidatus microthrix mallouhi and austermann haun 2014 hence the iron ion produced by electrolysis might indeed be responsible for the wash out of this genus in r1 by contrast ardenticatena another dominant genus assigned to heterotrophic denitrifiers hemp et al 2015 showed similar proportions in r0 and r1 moreover compared with r0 the relatively abundant genera defined as putative autotrophic denitrifiers e g sulfuritalea acidovorax thauera pseudomonas in r1 was regard as a trait closely associated with the electrolysis enhancement which provided alternative electron sources to achieve advanced denitrification thereby promoting the growth of these organisms given that the comparison on species level would be more precise due to their metabolic versatility and functional flexibility a more detailed discussion about autotrophic denitrifiers was described in section 3 4 it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of genus anaeromyxobacter which was capable of oxidizing organic compounds or hydrogen using diverse terminal electron acceptors fumarate fe3 no3 n etc sanford et al 2002 increased dramatically from 0 13 r0 to 0 75 r1 this is in accordance with the reported fact that adding fe ‚Ö≤ could lead to a large accumulation of anaeromyxobacter shi et al 2019 it can be inferred that electrolysis aao is a favorable growth environment for this genus and its role in n metabolism will be illustrated from functional genes perspective in following section 3 6 3 4 autotrophic denitrifiers and electron donors a wide variety of autotrophic denitrifiers with h2 fe2 and reduced sulfur s compounds as electron sinks were detected in this study and all of these species were enriched in r1 table 3 h2 and fe2 the direct products of electrolysis reaction are available electron sources for most of these autotrophic denitrifiers only two species are typical autotrophic denitrifying sulfur oxidizing bacteria i e sulfuricella denitrificans and thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens that cannot rely on electron sources other than sulfide as previously described sulfate reducing bacteria srb could be promoted in bio electrochemical system by accepting electrons from h2 or electrodes directly su et al 2012 and thus stimulated the whole s cycle including sulfur based autotrophic denitrification to further discriminate electron sources for the reduction process that occurred in electrolysis unit ex situ batch tests were conducted as described in section 2 3 and the results were shown in supplementary information fig s5 the nitrate reduction rate in abiotic test b1 was 3 62 mg n l h accounting for 34 8 of that obtained in biotic test assisted by electrolysis 10 42 mg n l h in b4 this indicates that autotrophic denitrifiers supported by electrolysis substantially contributed to the notable n removal in electrolysis chamber of r1 for the electrolysis biotic tests obviously similar nitrate reduction rates were obtained for the reactors fed with and without so4 2 s b3 and b4 suggesting that s cycle was not an essential electron supply mode this is consistent with the previously reported fact that s cycle plays a vital role in nitrate reduction only under conditions of high s n wang et al 2019b the sulfate reduction rate was measured as 0 624 mg s l h in b2 reactor which was operated without nitrate addition combining with results of b4 theoretically the maximum amount of electrons stored and resupplied by s cycle was 0 156 mmol e h accounting for 6 99 of electrons involved in nitrate reduction at most supplementary information text s2 this is in accordance with the fact that typical srb were present in r1 in low relative abundance fig s6 and consequently further supports the conclusion that contribution of s cycle to electrolysis driven denitrification was limited in addition a slight linear increase of so4 2 s was observed for the reactor without electrolysis b5 which could be a result of oxidizing of deposited s fes fes2 and s0 in sludge however no distinct no3 n reduction was found during the testing period evidencing the negligible role of deposited s as electron reservoir hence it can be deduced that h2 and fe2 are the dominant and direct electron donors in the electrolysis unit 3 5 differences of n metabolic pathways and functional genes to reveal the characteristics of the electrolysis driven enhancement key enzymes and functional genes were identified and thereafter classified according to kegg enzyme orthology databases in this study the metagenomes contained complete functional genes encoding key enzymes involved in traditional n metabolic pathways i e nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction as shown in fig 5 a and b the key enzymes catalyzing nh4 n oxidation ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase as well as their coding genes amoabc and hao showed upward trends in r1 as compared to reference reactor this outcome seems to be a response to the enrichment of nitrifying organisms to date limited studies were carried out regarding effects of electrolysis on nitrifying bacteria ju et al 2014 mentioned that effluent nh4 n concentrations of electrolyzed and non electrolyzed constructed wetland were not significantly different a similar conclusion was obtained in the current study however the positive influences of electrolysis on aob nob and nitrification related genes were ascertained by using metagenomic approach which resulted in an increase of ammonia oxidation rate in terms of denitrification pathway there was a distinct increase in abundance of nitrate reductase as the electrolysis intervention this result indicated that nitrate reduction process can be stimulated effectively in electrolysis aao which is accordant with the intensified no3 n removal additionally both narg and napa the functional genes encoding catalytic subunit of respiratory and periplasmic nitrate reductase morozkina and zvyagilskaya 2007 were retrieved in the two samples fig 5b and increased by 2 67 and 34 3 of that detected in r0 respectively therefore albeit narg was predominant the obvious impact of electrolysis intervention was mostly linked to napa and its coding product the abundance of other two classes of key enzymes associated with denitrification i e nitric oxide reductase encoded by norbc and nitrous oxide reductase encoded by nosz were reinforced significantly demonstrating that the augmented denitrification process in electrolysis aao was more inclined to perform with n2 as end product focusing on nitrite reductase interestingly there were no statistical difference between r0 and r1 p value was 0 059 which might explain the determined nitrite accumulation in electrolysis unit of r1 nevertheless the abundance of nirk and nirs which encode different types of nitrite reductase were down regulated by 27 0 and up regulated by 52 2 in r1 respectively fig 5b causing a switch of genes encoding nitrite reductase from nirk to nirs a rational conclusion is nirs type denitrifiers may gradually dominate the nitrite reduction in electrolysis aao according to the current knowledge nirs type denitrifiers usually exhibit preference to complete denitrification no3 n n2 due to a shared regulatory mechanism relying on the co occurrence of nirs norbc and nosz genes decleyre et al 2016 this phenomenon coincides with the discussion about no and n2o reductase and further evidences that complete denitrification was facilitated in electrolysis aao the electrolysis induced enhancement was also observed for dissimilatory nitrite reductase which may be the potential driving force for the slight nh4 n accumulation in electrolysis unit besides the proportion of assimilatory nitrate reductase showed a significant decline in r1 compared to r0 the detailed reasons for these variations will be discussed from the perspective of taxonomic origins in the subsequent network analysis 3 6 network analysis and microbial taxa functional genes associations in order to reveal the major hosts of n metabolic functional genes nfgs and further investigate the microbial roles in n metabolism the network analysis was adopted to explore and visualize the potential relevance between nfg subtypes and taxonomic groups genus level in the present work the concept of relevance degree was applied to describe the contribution of a certain genus to nfgs which was calculated by the proportion of each nfg subtype that carried by the genus the genera explaining a minimum of 5 of the taxonomic origins for at least one nfg subtype were defined as key hosts and were selected into networks by applying this criterion a total of 47 r0 and 52 r1 genera among which 39 genera were shared were selected as key hosts and were connected to nfgs by 122 and 145 linkages in r0 and r1 respectively fig 6 for r0 within the known genera seven nfg subtypes were assigned to bradyrhizobium and nitrosomonas respectively thus both of them were considered as hubs in the network specifically bradyrhizobium carried napa napb nirs nirb nird nasa and nira with relevance degree of 20 1 23 0 3 4 5 9 1 8 1 5 and 3 4 respectively this outcome demonstrated that in r0 bradyrhizobium played a vital role in nitrate reduction process and was partially involved in the reduction of nitrite including denitrification assimilatory and dnra pathways nitrosomonas was connected with nirk norb norc amoa amob amoc hao in particular it explained more than 90 of the origins for amoa amob amoc and 76 1 of hao was also located in this genus proving its leading role in ammonia oxidation other potential hosts included nitrospira narg narh nirk nird nira streptomyces narg nari nirk norb nirb caldilinea narh norc nosz nrfa nrfh et al it is worth noted that candidatus microthrix and ardenticatena the genera with high abundance in r0 showed strong relationships with few nfgs for example nirk and nasa were mainly found in candidatus microthrix with relevance degree of 17 6 and 68 6 respectively indicating candidatus microthrix primarily contributed to denitrification reduction of no2 n to no and assimilatory nitrate reduction hence the decreased abundance of assimilatory nitrate reductase in r1 should be attributed to the remarkable inhibition of this genus ardenticatena was the main reservoir of nosz 37 3 nrfa 29 8 and nrfh 43 1 implying that genus ardenticatena was a chief n2o scavenger in r0 and also largely contributed to dnra process compared with r0 genera involved in r1 network were more abundant fig 6b and most of the shared key hosts had resembling connections for example nitrosomonas still maintained strong relations with genes responsible for ammonia oxidation and ardenticatena remained the largest supplier of nosz nrfa and nrfh demonstrating the same roles of these bacteria in both r0 and r1 however the relevance degrees between some shared genera and nfgs had varied and was worth noting herein for instance the relevance degree between genus bradyrhizobium and napa decreased by 7 7 instead sulfuritalea and simplicispira the potential autotrophic denitrifiers table 3 were connected with napa with stronger degrees 14 3 and 11 5 respectively furthermore abatement of nirk carried by candidatus microthrix was clearly visible which could result from the great suppression for this genus and give a reason for the switch between nirk and nirs in r1 except for these shared connections there were also some exclusive nodes hosts and links in r1 network which made it more complex a new connection between sulfuritalea and nirs was developed additionally in r1 network evidencing the intensified role of sulfuritalea in nitrite reduction process other autotrophic denitrifiers e g rhodanobacter candidatus brocadia hydrogenophaga thioalkalivibrio that were retrieved solely in r1 network also became the major sources of multiple denitrifying genes such as narg narh napa and napb on the basis of the above analysis it can be concluded that contributions of diverse autotrophic denitrifiers to denitrification process were enhanced powerfully in the electrolysis aao out of these comparisons interestingly anaeromyxobacter only existed in r1 network and was connected to various nfgs narg 1 8 narh 2 1 nari 1 6 norb 2 2 nosz 3 4 nrfa 6 9 nrfh 8 4 since the abundant dissimilatory nitrite reductase coding genes that were taxonomically affiliated with anaeromyxobacter as well as its verified ability of employing hydrogen as electron donor the favorable growth of this genus might explain the intensified dnra process in electrolysis chamber partially whereas dnra instead of denitrification was considered as the principal nitrate respiring way for anaeromyxobacter sanford et al 2002 denitrifying genes carried by this genus were discovered in this study implying its potential role as denitrifier in the electrolysis aao system 4 conclusions this study allowed obtaining insights on intensified nutrients removal from low c n municipal sewage in electrolysis aao analyzing the microbial consortia structure and revealing metabolic mechanisms and characteristics of the electrolysis induced enhancement by installing an electrolysis device in anoxic2 chamber the n and p removal efficiencies could be improved rapidly and maintained stable profiles during 91 days of operation the intensified tn removal mainly occurred in anoxic2 compartment and trace amounts of tp was determined in all the reaction zones metagenomic based taxonomic comparison illustrated that electrolysis intervention had an adverse impact on genus candidatus microthrix reversely promoted the growth of nitrifying bacteria numerous autotrophic denitrifiers and most other heterotrophic denitrifiers in particular autotrophic denitrifiers employing h2 and fe2 as direct electron donors played a key role in the electrolysis driven denitrification furthermore a visible enrichment of genus anaeromyxobacter was also found in this electrolysis retrofitted system its augmented roles in dnra and denitrification were validated by network analysis in depth investigation on n metabolism pathways suggested that whole nitrification and denitrification steps with the exception of nitrite reduction were significantly improved in the electrolysis aao meanwhile among the different subtypes of nitrate and nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by napa and nirs seemed to be more sensitive to the electrolysis enhancement overall this work yields a new and fundamental understanding of electrolysis integrated activated sludge system and can serve as theoretical basis for its engineered application in wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

18083,the conventional biological nutrients removal process is challenged by insufficient organic carbon in influent to cross such an organic dependent barrier a pilot scale electrolysis integrated anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process was developed for enhanced removal of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from low carbon nitrogen c n municipal wastewater average removal efficiencies of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in the electrolysis aao reached to 77 24 and 95 08 respectively showing increases of 13 88 and 21 87 as compared to the control reactor spatial variations of n and p showed that nh4 n removal rate was promoted in aerobic zone of electrolysis aao the intensified tn elimination which was mostly reflected by abatement of no3 n with the concomitant slight accumulation of nh4 n and no2 n mainly occurred in anoxic2 compartment as the electrons supplied by electrolysis furthermore minor p contents were measured and remained almost unchanged along the reaction units indicating that chemical precipitation should be the dominant mechanism of p removal in electrolysis aao from the metagenomic based taxonomy phylum actinobacteria was dramatically inhibited and phylum proteobacteria dominated the electrolysis aao particularly nitrifying bacteria and multifarious autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched meanwhile a significant evolution of heterotrophic denitrifiers was found in electrolysis aao compared to control which was mostly reflected by the inhibition of genus candidatus microthrix batch tests further confirmed that autotrophic denitrifiers using h2 and fe2 as essential electron sinks were mainly responsible for the electrolysis induced denitrification differential metabolic capacities were revealed from the perspectives of functional enzymes and genes and network analysis allowed insight of microbial taxa functional genes associations and shed light on stronger relevance between autotrophic denitrifiers and denitrification associated genes in the electrolysis aao system graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrolysis modified aao process low c n municipal wastewater advanced n and p removal metagenomics 1 introduction with the rapid economic development and the significant improvement in living standards around the world considerable amounts of domestic and industrial wastes containing excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p are discharged into municipal wastewater which can cause eutrophication in receiving waters and bring potential risks to environmental and human health shen et al 2019 tian et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 hence increasingly strict discharge standards for municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps were proposed wang et al 2015 in china total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations in influent of municipal wwtps ranged from 19 to 51 mg l and 1 8 5 9 mg l respectively sun et al 2016 the most immediate challenge for advanced nutrients removal is the lack of organic carbon ding et al 2018 which is the electron donor as well as energy source for traditional biological denitrification and phosphorus removal given that most municipal wastewater in china especially in south regions is characterized by low carbon nitrogen ratio c n it is necessary to supply external organic carbon source such as methanol glycerine or sugar zubrowska sudol and walczak 2015 which may cause extra costs and potential residuals and therefore limits the sustainable operation of wwtps dasgupta et al 2017 as the most widespread biological nutrients removal configuration the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process can achieve simultaneous removal of organics n and p over the past decades various improvement avenues aimed at efficient exploitation of limited carbon source were developed for aao process to achieve advanced nutrients removal from low c n wastewater among them employing denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr in aao process has been confirmed its feasibility and attracts many attentions due to its capability of simultaneous removal of n and p with less carbon source to realize this enhancement a common approach is integrating aao and a biofilm system zhang et al 2016 in which efficient nitrification is implemented in the later unit and denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos are enriched in aao by increasing anoxic aerobic ratio zhang et al 2013 although excellent performance can be accomplished an additional treatment unit is sure to add the construction cost and land occupation another optimization technology is establishing nitrite based pathways in aao system such as partial nitrification denitrification jiang et al 2019 and partial nitrification anammox xiao et al 2016 which reduce more than 40 carbon demand however a drawback of this route is the difficulty of achieving stable nitrite accumulation which complicates its operation and control more recently nutrients removal using biological metabolism assisted by electrolysis has become one of the most attractive selections among various alternatives for treatment of low c n wastewater in such a system generally p is removed through electro coagulation motivated by electro dissolution of sacrificial anodes iron or aluminum considering the human health risks of aluminum salts kimura et al 2013 iron anode provides much more advantages the complete electrolysis process using iron as anode material can be described by the following reaction irdemez et al 2006 1 cathode 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 2 anode 4fe 4fe2 8e the h2 produced on cathode is a thermodynamically favorable electron sink for autotrophic denitrification and shows high denitrification rates sahu et al 2009 vasiliadou et al 2006a this hydrogenotrophic denitrification process has gained the most attention due to its capacity to break the organic dependent barrier furthermore h2 is regarded as the cleanest electron donor for denitrification since the low biomass yield and no undesirable substrate or derivative are generated during the reaction epsztein et al 2016 recent evidence has demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic denitrifying genera represented by hydrogenophaga thauera paracoccus etc could be effectively enriched in an electrolysis integrated constructed wetland treating synthetic wastewater without organic carbon proving the critical role of h2 driven denitrification gao et al 2017 in this novel system with the exception of h2 ferrous ion fe2 generated from anodizing of sacrificial iron anode can also act as electron donor for autotrophic denitrification however the redox differential between electron acceptor and donor is actually low 230 mv di capua et al 2019 resulting in a lower reaction rate nevertheless according to the previous study denitrifiers showed positive correlation with fe oxidizing bacteria feob and fe reducing bacteria ferb in an electrolysis constructed wetland indicating the autotrophic denitrification based on fe cycle may also indeed be responsible for nitrate removal in electrolysis augmented bio system zhang et al 2018 although considerable amounts of works have been conducted most of the hitherto reported studies focused on developing a separate bio electrochemical system for advanced treatment of wwtps effluents gao et al 2018 xu et al 2017 attempt of integrating electrolysis and basic biological process for treating low c n municipal wastewater is still lacked in our prior study electrolysis device was equipped in a modified aao reactor to intensify the nutrients removal from municipal sewage the performance of this retrofitted process under different current supplies was discussed gong et al 2018 it first verified the feasibility of applying electrolysis integrated aao process to achieve advanced nutrients removal without additional procedure however the microbial community composition metabolic mechanisms and enhancement characteristics are still unclear metagenomic analysis is an accurate and culture independent molecular method based on sequencing of total dna in environmental samples it has been applied in many research areas to reveal complex microbial communities and identify known and novel functional genes or enzymes daraei et al 2019 yazdanbakhsh et al 2019 in this study a pilot scale parallel experiment was performed and the mechanisms of this electrolysis driven enhancement were thoroughly investigated by using metagenomics the aims of this work were to i evaluate the performance of modified aao coupling electrolysis electrolysis aao during the long term operation ii reveal the metabolic mechanisms and characteristics from the perspectives of microbial community structure metabolic pathways and functional genes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus two structurally identical modified aao reactors were set up in this study fig 1 the reactor was made of plastic material with the configurations of anaerobic zone first anoxic zone anoxic1 first oxic

respectively the feeding 5 l h internal recycling 10 l h and sludge recycling 5 l h were controlled by peristaltic pumps and air was delivered directly to oxic sections from the bottom by bubbling with air pump the two reactors were operated in parallel as a control group reactor 0 r0 was a biological modified aao without electrolysis device reactor 1 r1 was electrolysis aao system which was

do was controlled at 2 4 mg l in aerobic zones by using a gas flow meter the applied current 200 ma was based on the optimal result in our previous work gong et al 2018 and the corresponding voltage ranged within 4 6 v anode was replaced when the voltage was out of this range 2 3 batch tests setup and operation to evaluate the biotic and abiotic contribution in electrolysis unit and quantitatively identify the roles of various electron donors five batch tests with different conditions and substrate were performed table 2 after stable operation a sealed beaker with a volume of 1 l

v2 1 3 parks et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance monitoring and comparison fig 2 depicts the nutrients removal performance of r0 and r1 during 91 days operation no3 n was the main tn species in the effluent of r0 and its concentration was 11 43 0 60 mg l trace amounts of nh4 n and no2 n were detected 0 5 mg l and average tn removal rate was 63 37 it can be presumed that the lack of organic carbon for denitrification limits a further removal of tn by contrast despite there was a similar nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent of r1 the no3 n concentration deeply decreased from 11 04 mg l to 6 79 mg l during the first 13 days of operation and then remained stable in the following period with concentration of 6 88 0 50 mg l indicating the electrolysis aao system could be constructed rapidly the average tn removal rate of r1 was 77 24 showing an increase of 13 88 as compared to control reactor r0 as for tp removal efficiency a sharp raising occurred in r1 once the operation starting after only 4 days average tp removal rate reached to 95 08 and effluent tp concentration was 0 19 0 04 mg l achieving an apparent enhancement in comparison to r0 average tp removal rate was 73 21 given that the enhanced po4 3 p elimination in electrolysis retrofitted system is due mainly to chemical precipitation process with participation of metal cation gao et al 2018 the iron ions produced by electro dissolution of anode might explain this intensified p removal overall the electrolysis aao could improve the removal efficiencies of n mostly in the form of no3 n and p rapidly and exhibited a stability during the long term operation furthermore the mlss concentration in r1 was higher than that in r0 over time fig s3a the retained fe in solid phase which might be caused by oxidizing of dissolved fe ii could explain this gap meanwhile little difference of mlvss was found between these reactors fig s3b suggesting the similar biomass contents it is possible to speculate that heterotrophic proliferation motivated by organic matters in influent was the decisive factor for biomass concentration 3 2 spatial distribution of n and p fig 3 presents the variations of n and p along reaction chambers it can be discerned that nh4 n removal mainly occurred in oxic1 chambers where the calculated average specific ammonia removal rates were 4 91 and 5 96 mg nh4 n g vss h for r0 and r1 respectively considering that do was controlled at a same level in these reactors this result proved that electrolysis aao has a positive effect on nitrification rate even though the nh4 n outflow contents of the compared systems were not different meanwhile tn removal in r1 exhibited an evident enhancement compared to r0 and the differences were mainly derived from anaerobic zone and anoxic2 zone different no3 n contents in returned sludge could explain the tn gap occurred in anaerobic tanks while the tn decrease detected in anoxic2 compartment of r1 should be attributed to electrolysis intervention focusing on anoxic2 chambers negligible variations of nh4 n and no3 n 0 1 mg l were observed in r0 and the weak no2 n reduction average 0 2 mg l was the main process this was mainly caused by the scarce organic carbon in this unit in contrast although slight nh4 n and no2 n accumulations were found in anoxic2 compartment of r1 the no3 n average 3 54 mg l was significantly removed allowing a severe decline of tn concentration therefore the electrolysis induced n removal enhancement was mostly reflected by nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction was presumed to be the limiting step of further n removal besides accumulation of nh4 n which is generated from dissimilatory reduction of nitrate has been extensively observed in other bio electrochemical systems huang et al 2013 tong et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 in our study similar phenomenon was found in electrolysis unit the corresponding microbial mechanisms would be revealed by metagenomics subsequently with regard to p distribution the p contents in r0 exhibited a continuously decreasing trend along reaction route unlike this trend however it remained almost unchanged and always maintained at low concentrations 0 2 mg l in r1 the iron compounds in sludge recycling might engender this instantaneous and considerable removal of aqueous p in r1 in depth investigations with respect to fe p products and the potential of p recovery are warranted we focus here on the microbial community evolutions and n metabolic mechanisms 3 3 microbial community structure and functions after searching against ncbi nr database a total of 29 398 298 r0 and 28 120 062 r1 reads were categorized to putative taxonomic groups among which 98 99 r0 and 98 98 r1 were bacteria followed by archaea r0 0 58 r1 0 59 eukaryota r0 0 28 r1 0 28 and norank r0 0 15 r1 0 16 microbial communities at phylum and class levels are shown in fig 4 a and b the dominant phyla in r0 were actinobacteria 40 59 followed by proteobacteria 25 10 chloroflexi 14 23 and bacteroidetes 8 93 while a notable shift of the most dominant phylum from actinobacteria to proteobacteria was detected in r1 implying that growth of actinobacteria could be inhibited and enrichment of proteobacteria could be facilitated by coupling electrolysis device taxonomic comparison down to class level suggested that the two classes belonged to phylum actinobacteria named actinobacteria and acidimicrobiia declined by 6 37 and 9 99 in r1 respectively according to previous reports actinobacteria and acidimicrobiia usually acted as bridge to maintain floc stability and dimension wilen et al 2008 in this study the sludge flocs collected from r1 was more compact and a remarkable size reduction was observed compared with r0 fig s4 the different macrostructure was expected to result from the remarkable reduction in abundance of the aforementioned two classes moreover the four subdivisions of proteobacteria alpha beta gamma and delta were all promoted in r1 which showed increases of 1 14 6 86 3 04 and 1 57 respectively lots of evidences have proven that numerous bacteria responsible for n removal are affiliated with the four subclasses of proteobacteria shu et al 2016 thus the excellent n removal performance in r1 could be attributable to this microbial evolution in addition based on the fact that previously identified autotrophic denitrifiers are randomly distributed within the four subdivisions of proteobacteria it was speculated that diverse autotrophic denitrifiers were enriched as the supply of alternative electron donors concerning the successions of microbial consortium at genus level as shown in fig 4c nitrosomonas and nitrospira were the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in both systems the abundance of which increased by 0 33 and 1 05 in r1 respectively this change could be an explanation for the promoted nh4 n removal rate in r1 aerobic zone furthermore various widely reported heterotrophic denitrifiers were identified and slight increases in abundance were observed for most of these members such as lautropia r0 0 92 r1 1 41 ottowia r0 0 51 r1 0 58 steroidobacter r0 0 87 r1 1 42 and arenimonas r0 0 15 r1 0 23 gui et al 2019 li et al 2017 ma et al 2015 xing et al 2018a the most abundant two genera candidatus microthrix and ardenticatena in both r1 and r0 were also reported to possess denitrifying capability to be specific the relative abundance of candidatus microthrix greatly dropped from 11 54 in r0 to 2 97 in r1 signaling a significant inhibition in the electrolysis aao reactor this genus was usually reported as a common filamentous bacterium in wwtps with capability of lipid metabolism and denitrification chen et al 2018 lienen et al 2014 a possible reason for its dominant growth in r0 could be plentiful lipid in the feeding raw wastewater dosing iron salts has been previously reported as a feasible way to suppress the growth of candidatus microthrix mallouhi and austermann haun 2014 hence the iron ion produced by electrolysis might indeed be responsible for the wash out of this genus in r1 by contrast ardenticatena another dominant genus assigned to heterotrophic denitrifiers hemp et al 2015 showed similar proportions in r0 and r1 moreover compared with r0 the relatively abundant genera defined as putative autotrophic denitrifiers e g sulfuritalea acidovorax thauera pseudomonas in r1 was regard as a trait closely associated with the electrolysis enhancement which provided alternative electron sources to achieve advanced denitrification thereby promoting the growth of these organisms given that the comparison on species level would be more precise due to their metabolic versatility and functional flexibility a more detailed discussion about autotrophic denitrifiers was described in section 3 4 it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of genus anaeromyxobacter which was capable of oxidizing organic compounds or hydrogen using diverse terminal electron acceptors fumarate fe3 no3 n etc sanford et al 2002 increased dramatically from 0 13 r0 to 0 75 r1 this is in accordance with the reported fact that adding fe ‚Ö≤ could lead to a large accumulation of anaeromyxobacter shi et al 2019 it can be inferred that electrolysis aao is a favorable growth environment for this genus and its role in n metabolism will be illustrated from functional genes perspective in following section 3 6 3 4 autotrophic denitrifiers and electron donors a wide variety of autotrophic denitrifiers with h2 fe2 and reduced sulfur s compounds as electron sinks were detected in this study and all of these species were enriched in r1 table 3 h2 and fe2 the direct products of electrolysis reaction are available electron sources for most of these autotrophic denitrifiers only two species are typical autotrophic denitrifying sulfur oxidizing bacteria i e sulfuricella denitrificans and thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens that cannot rely on electron sources other than sulfide as previously described sulfate reducing bacteria srb could be promoted in bio electrochemical system by accepting electrons from h2 or electrodes directly su et al 2012 and thus stimulated the whole s cycle including sulfur based autotrophic denitrification to further discriminate electron sources for the reduction process that occurred in electrolysis unit ex situ batch tests were conducted as described in section 2 3 and the results were shown in supplementary information fig s5 the nitrate reduction rate in abiotic test b1 was 3 62 mg n l h accounting for 34 8 of that obtained in biotic test assisted by electrolysis 10 42 mg n l h in b4 this indicates that autotrophic denitrifiers supported by electrolysis substantially contributed to the notable n removal in electrolysis chamber of r1 for the electrolysis biotic tests obviously similar nitrate reduction rates were obtained for the reactors fed with and without so4 2 s b3 and b4 suggesting that s cycle was not an essential electron supply mode this is consistent with the previously reported fact that s cycle plays a vital role in nitrate reduction only under conditions of high s n wang et al 2019b the sulfate reduction rate was measured as 0 624 mg s l h in b2 reactor which was operated without nitrate addition combining with results of b4 theoretically the maximum amount of electrons stored and resupplied by s cycle was 0 156 mmol e h accounting for 6 99 of electrons involved in nitrate reduction at most supplementary information text s2 this is in accordance with the fact that typical srb were present in r1 in low relative abundance fig s6 and consequently further supports the conclusion that contribution of s cycle to electrolysis driven denitrification was limited in addition a slight linear increase of so4 2 s was observed for the reactor without electrolysis b5 which could be a result of oxidizing of deposited s fes fes2 and s0 in sludge however no distinct no3 n reduction was found during the testing period evidencing the negligible role of deposited s as electron reservoir hence it can be deduced that h2 and fe2 are the dominant and direct electron donors in the electrolysis unit 3 5 differences of n metabolic pathways and functional genes to reveal the characteristics of the electrolysis driven enhancement key enzymes and functional genes were identified and thereafter classified according to kegg enzyme orthology databases in this study the metagenomes contained complete functional genes encoding key enzymes involved in traditional n metabolic pathways i e nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction as shown in fig 5 a and b the key enzymes catalyzing nh4 n oxidation ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase as well as their coding genes amoabc and hao showed upward trends in r1 as compared to reference reactor this outcome seems to be a response to the enrichment of nitrifying organisms to date limited studies were carried out regarding effects of electrolysis on nitrifying bacteria ju et al 2014 mentioned that effluent nh4 n concentrations of electrolyzed and non electrolyzed constructed wetland were not significantly different a similar conclusion was obtained in the current study however the positive influences of electrolysis on aob nob and nitrification related genes were ascertained by using metagenomic approach which resulted in an increase of ammonia oxidation rate in terms of denitrification pathway there was a distinct increase in abundance of nitrate reductase as the electrolysis intervention this result indicated that nitrate reduction process can be stimulated effectively in electrolysis aao which is accordant with the intensified no3 n removal additionally both narg and napa the functional genes encoding catalytic subunit of respiratory and periplasmic nitrate reductase morozkina and zvyagilskaya 2007 were retrieved in the two samples fig 5b and increased by 2 67 and 34 3 of that detected in r0 respectively therefore albeit narg was predominant the obvious impact of electrolysis intervention was mostly linked to napa and its coding product the abundance of other two classes of key enzymes associated with denitrification i e nitric oxide reductase encoded by norbc and nitrous oxide reductase encoded by nosz were reinforced significantly demonstrating that the augmented denitrification process in electrolysis aao was more inclined to perform with n2 as end product focusing on nitrite reductase interestingly there were no statistical difference between r0 and r1 p value was 0 059 which might explain the determined nitrite accumulation in electrolysis unit of r1 nevertheless the abundance of nirk and nirs which encode different types of nitrite reductase were down regulated by 27 0 and up regulated by 52 2 in r1 respectively fig 5b causing a switch of genes encoding nitrite reductase from nirk to nirs a rational conclusion is nirs type denitrifiers may gradually dominate the nitrite reduction in electrolysis aao according to the current knowledge nirs type denitrifiers usually exhibit preference to complete denitrification no3 n n2 due to a shared regulatory mechanism relying on the co occurrence of nirs norbc and nosz genes decleyre et al 2016 this phenomenon coincides with the discussion about no and n2o reductase and further evidences that complete denitrification was facilitated in electrolysis aao the electrolysis induced enhancement was also observed for dissimilatory nitrite reductase which may be the potential driving force for the slight nh4 n accumulation in electrolysis unit besides the proportion of assimilatory nitrate reductase showed a significant decline in r1 compared to r0 the detailed reasons for these variations will be discussed from the perspective of taxonomic origins in the subsequent network analysis 3 6 network analysis and microbial taxa functional genes associations in order to reveal the major hosts of n metabolic functional genes nfgs and further investigate the microbial roles in n metabolism the network analysis was adopted to explore and visualize the potential relevance between nfg subtypes and taxonomic groups genus level in the present work the concept of relevance degree was applied to describe the contribution of a certain genus to nfgs which was calculated by the proportion of each nfg subtype that carried by the genus the genera explaining a minimum of 5 of the taxonomic origins for at least one nfg subtype were defined as key hosts and were selected into networks by applying this criterion a total of 47 r0 and 52 r1 genera among which 39 genera were shared were selected as key hosts and were connected to nfgs by 122 and 145 linkages in r0 and r1 respectively fig 6 for r0 within the known genera seven nfg subtypes were assigned to bradyrhizobium and nitrosomonas respectively thus both of them were considered as hubs in the network specifically bradyrhizobium carried napa napb nirs nirb nird nasa and nira with relevance degree of 20 1 23 0 3 4 5 9 1 8 1 5 and 3 4 respectively this outcome demonstrated that in r0 bradyrhizobium played a vital role in nitrate reduction process and was partially involved in the reduction of nitrite including denitrification assimilatory and dnra pathways nitrosomonas was connected with nirk norb norc amoa amob amoc hao in particular it explained more than 90 of the origins for amoa amob amoc and 76 1 of hao was also located in this genus proving its leading role in ammonia oxidation other potential hosts included nitrospira narg narh nirk nird nira streptomyces narg nari nirk norb nirb caldilinea narh norc nosz nrfa nrfh et al it is worth noted that candidatus microthrix and ardenticatena the genera with high abundance in r0 showed strong relationships with few nfgs for example nirk and nasa were mainly found in candidatus microthrix with relevance degree of 17 6 and 68 6 respectively indicating candidatus microthrix primarily contributed to denitrification reduction of no2 n to no and assimilatory nitrate reduction hence the decreased abundance of assimilatory nitrate reductase in r1 should be attributed to the remarkable inhibition of this genus ardenticatena was the main reservoir of nosz 37 3 nrfa 29 8 and nrfh 43 1 implying that genus ardenticatena was a chief n2o scavenger in r0 and also largely contributed to dnra process compared with r0 genera involved in r1 network were more abundant fig 6b and most of the shared key hosts had resembling connections for example nitrosomonas still maintained strong relations with genes responsible for ammonia oxidation and ardenticatena remained the largest supplier of nosz nrfa and nrfh demonstrating the same roles of these bacteria in both r0 and r1 however the relevance degrees between some shared genera and nfgs had varied and was worth noting herein for instance the relevance degree between genus bradyrhizobium and napa decreased by 7 7 instead sulfuritalea and simplicispira the potential autotrophic denitrifiers table 3 were connected with napa with stronger degrees 14 3 and 11 5 respectively furthermore abatement of nirk carried by candidatus microthrix was clearly visible which could result from the great suppression for this genus and give a reason for the switch between nirk and nirs in r1 except for these shared connections there were also some exclusive nodes hosts and links in r1 network which made it more complex a new connection between sulfuritalea and nirs was developed additionally in r1 network evidencing the intensified role of sulfuritalea in nitrite reduction process other autotrophic denitrifiers e g rhodanobacter candidatus brocadia hydrogenophaga thioalkalivibrio that were retrieved solely in r1 network also became the major sources of multiple denitrifying genes such as narg narh napa and napb on the basis of the above analysis it can be concluded that contributions of diverse autotrophic denitrifiers to denitrification process were enhanced powerfully in the electrolysis aao out of these comparisons interestingly anaeromyxobacter only existed in r1 network and was connected to various nfgs narg 1 8 narh 2 1 nari 1 6 norb 2 2 nosz 3 4 nrfa 6 9 nrfh 8 4 since the abundant dissimilatory nitrite reductase coding genes that were taxonomically affiliated with anaeromyxobacter as well as its verified ability of employing hydrogen as electron donor the favorable growth of this genus might explain the intensified dnra process in electrolysis chamber partially whereas dnra instead of denitrification was considered as the principal nitrate respiring way for anaeromyxobacter sanford et al 2002 denitrifying genes carried by this genus were discovered in this study implying its potential role as denitrifier in the electrolysis aao system 4 conclusions this study allowed obtaining insights on intensified nutrients removal from low c n municipal sewage in electrolysis aao analyzing the microbial consortia structure and revealing metabolic mechanisms and characteristics of the electrolysis induced enhancement by installing an electrolysis device in anoxic2 chamber the n and p removal efficiencies could be improved rapidly and maintained stable profiles during 91 days of operation the intensified tn removal mainly occurred in anoxic2 compartment and trace amounts of tp was determined in all the reaction zones metagenomic based taxonomic comparison illustrated that electrolysis intervention had an adverse impact on genus candidatus microthrix reversely promoted the growth of nitrifying bacteria numerous autotrophic denitrifiers and most other heterotrophic denitrifiers in particular autotrophic denitrifiers employing h2 and fe2 as direct electron donors played a key role in the electrolysis driven denitrification furthermore a visible enrichment of genus anaeromyxobacter was also found in this electrolysis retrofitted system its augmented roles in dnra and denitrification were validated by network analysis in depth investigation on n metabolism pathways suggested that whole nitrification and denitrification steps with the exception of nitrite reduction were significantly improved in the electrolysis aao meanwhile among the different subtypes of nitrate and nitrite reductase enzymes encoded by napa and nirs seemed to be more sensitive to the electrolysis enhancement overall this work yields a new and fundamental understanding of electrolysis integrated activated sludge system and can serve as theoretical basis for

18084,photogranules are dense spherical agglomerates of cyanobacteria microalgae and non phototrophic microorganisms that have considerable advantages in terms of harvesting and nutrient removal rates for light driven wastewater treatment processes this ecosystem is poorly understood in terms of the microbial community structure and the response of the community to changing abiotic conditions to get a better understanding we investigated the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on photogranule formation and community assembly over a period of 148 days three laboratory bioreactors were inoculated with field samples from various locations in the netherlands and operated in sequencing batch mode the bioreactors were operated at four different hrts 2 00 1 00 0 67 0 33 days while retaining the same solid retention time of 7 days a microbial community with excellent settling characteristics 95 99 separation efficiency was established within 2 5 weeks the observed nutrient uptake rates ranged from 24 to 90 mgn l 1 day 1 and from 3 1 to 5 4 mgp l 1 day 1 depending on the applied hrt the transition from single cell suspension culture to floccular agglomeration to granular sludge was monitored by microscopy and 16s 18s sequencing in particular two important variables for driving aggregation and granulation and for the structural integrity of photogranules were identified 1 extracellular polymeric substances eps with high protein to polysaccharide ratio and 2 specific microorganisms the key players were found to be the cyanobacteria limnothrix and cephalothrix the colony forming photosynthetic eukaryotes within chlamydomonadaceae and the biofilm producing bacteria zoogloea and thauera knowing the makeup of the microbial community and the operational conditions influencing granulation and bioreactor function is crucial for successful operation of photogranular systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae and cyanobacteria phototrophic granulation extracellular polymeric substances metagenomics microbial ecology functional network 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment systems are ubiquitous and essential for maintaining high water quality and prevent excess discharge of nutrients and pollutants into the environment henze 2008 however wastewater treatment also comes at a cost as it is an energy intensive process mccarty et al 2011 and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions cakir and stenstrom 2005 hence improving the efficacy and sustainability of these systems through technological innovation may have broad scale impacts on global sustainability the incorporation of phototrophic organisms such as microalgae and cyanobacteria shows great potential in improving the sustainability of treatment processes by mitigating greenhouse gasses smith et al 2010 closing nutrient cycles fernandes et al 2015 matching wastewater n p ratio for effective treatment by using phototrophic consortia fernandes et al 2017 and providing oxygen to drive processes such as nitrification and polyphosphate accumulation oyserman et al 2017 while promising one of the current bottlenecks in the wider application of phototrophic communities in wastewater treatment is the harvesting of the biomass a principal operational parameter which ensures the effectiveness and economic feasibility of treatment is to retain the microbial community as dense biomass within the treatment system ardern and lockett 1914 milferstedt et al 2017a this requires operational parameters which steer the microbial community to form natural and well settling aggregates these aggregates may be described as either flocs or granules depending on their structure density and settleability in general granules are discrete well defined microbial aggregates formed by cell to cell attraction with regular dense and strong structure and excellent settleability although the first granules were discovered over 50 years ago lettinga et al 1980 the biological mechanisms driving granule formation and the operational parameters that select for their formation are still relatively unknown wil√©n et al 2018 this complex microbial function is far from being fully understood and bears many ecological questions that need to be answered merging granule technology with other biochemical processes such as photosynthesis holds the promise of producing well settling photoautotrophic systems in so called photogranules in general photogranules can be described as spherical biofilm systems of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganism photogranules were already obtained from different seeding cultures 1 hydrostatically incubated activated sludge abouhend et al 2018 2 activated granular sludge mixed with unicellular green algae liu et al 2017 and have demonstrated to work at lab scale in airlift reactors as well as in aeration free mechanically stirred reactors meng et al 2019 tiron et al 2017 photogranules are commonly cultivated in sequencing batch operation to provide cyclic wash out conditions assure selection of well settling biomass and prevent growth of individual cells in suspension this operation strategy is similar to the one applied in aerobic granular sludge technology and assures a selection pressure for granular morphology de kreuk 2006 motile filamentous cyanobacteria showed to be an important constituent of photogranule formation and vital under static incubation and mixed operation conditions abouhend et al 2018 milferstedt et al 2017b in green algae dominated photogranules zoogloea was shown to be involved in the granulation process due to eps production huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 few studies also addressed other functional groups such as nitrifiers abouhend et al 2018 huang et al 2015 tiron et al 2015 denitrifiers stauch white et al 2017 or polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos cai et al 2019 in photogranules however successful implementation of photogranular technology will require a deeper biological understanding of the processes and the microbial community that drive granular structure and function so that this knowledge may be parameterized both under static and hydrodynamic conditions integrating systems biology and community based approaches can provide significant insight into the physiology and role of specific organisms in community function oyserman et al 2016 which can help identify additional operational strategies to steer biomass characteristics towards a particular ecosystem function therefore in order to fully exploit photogranule technology a first step is linking information about the microbial ecology of phototrophic granulation with properties of the granules in this study we examined the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on the function and assembly of a photogranular community by using amplicon sequencing microscopic observation characterisation of the eps matrix and general acquisition of reactor performance key organisms and factors can be identified we compared taxonomical functional groups correlation with chemical and physical data from the bioreactor system to identify potential biological drivers of key functional properties this will enhance the understanding of photogranular systems and help to further improve the operational strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal bacterial community the

1 photogranule formation the development of a well settling algal bacterial community was strongly influenced by the applied hrt with decreasing hrt and therefore increasing hydraulic pressure the microbial community was driven more rapidly towards floccular aggregates specifically at an hrt 0 67 d the assembly time was reduced to 11 days compared to 32 days at hrt 2 00 the hydraulic pressure dictated the se as well which resulted in better separation at lower hrts when changing the hrt at day 116 from 2 00 d to 0 67 d and from 1 00 d to 0 33 d the settling properties increased significantly and the microbial community shifted to be dominated by photogranules in fig 1 the separation efficiency se of biomass from the liquid is displayed as a percentage of the total amount of biomass in the system as hrt decreased the separation efficiency of the biomass increased specifically a se higher than 90 in phase 1 was achieved for the reactor with an hrt of 0 67 d in 10 days the reactor with an hrt of 1 00 d achieved this se in 24 days of operation whereas the reactor operated at an hrt of 2 00 d required 32 days these results show that a lower hrt accelerated the assembly of flocs and granules by rapid selecting for well settling biomass the higher hydraulic pressure experienced by the microbial community at hrt 1 00 d and below drives a se greater than 90 furthermore in the case of hrt 0 67 d and hrt 0 33 d in phase 2 the se increased to 99 in fig 2 a the long term effect of hrt on se and svi is depicted a lower hrt drives a higher se and lower svi the variability in se and svi was also lower with lower hrt suggesting that low hrt increased the functional stability this implies that it promotes a more stable settling and therefore improves biomass retention in the system the increased se was accompanied by a decrease in svi while the microalgal bacterial community exhibited an svi of 300 ml g 1 at the start of operation it was reduced to an average of 57 9 ml g 1 when it began to show granular biomass structure the morphological changes of the photogranules during the operation were followed by microscopic observation with selected pictures shown in fig 1 the inoculum consisted of free organisms such as green algae cyanobacteria and bacteria motile filamentous cyanobacteria present in the inoculum started to entangle and form early aggregates as flocs in the first weeks of operation and started to incorporate other prokaryotes and colony forming photosynthetic eukaryotes after about 3 month of operation the first granular structures appeared as shown by the microscopic images of t 82 and 140 days in fig 1 it has been shown that eps may act like a glue that promotes the spatial alignment of both algae and bacteria to agglomerates flemming et al 2007 characterisation of the eps matrix in terms of proteins eps pn and polysaccharides eps ps showed that eps is a substantial part of the floccular and granular biomass ranging from 8 to 34 fig a4 in fig 2b the average eps is depicted for the applied hrt there is no significant difference in constituent eps pn and eps ps however there is a significant increase in pn ps ratio with lower hrt while being a substantial part from the first appearance of floccular structure there was a change from mostly eps ps to a majority of eps pn content this is reflected in a shift from the pn ps ratio in eps from 1 0 to 6 6 at hrt 0 67 the makeup of eps in the photogranules in the last month of operation at hrt 0 67 was found to be 239 42 mgeps gvss 1 with a pn ps ratio of about 6 6 3 2 nutrient removal performance the initial phase of reactor operation was characterized by a rapid assembly of a well settling floccular microbial community with stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal after 2 4 weeks in fig 3 a the average volumetric nutrient removal rates across the applied hrt are shown with decreasing hrt the volumetric removal rate for nitrogen increased significantly from 24 to 90 mgn l 1 day 1 with the maximum at hrt 0 33 after 40 days of operation nitrification started to occur in all three reactors but no stable nitrification rate was obtained until the end of operation fig a1 since the increase in nitrogen removal could not be explained with nitrogen assimilation in the biomass the potential denitrification was assessed therefore a mass balance for nitrogen biomass and the elemental composition of the biomass was performed in that way it was shown that for hrt 0 67 denitrification accounted for 23 of the nitrogen removal and for hrt 0 33 for 26 fig a7 the volumetric removal rate of phosphorus increased with decreasing hrt from 3 1 to 5 4 mgp l 1 day 1 however not significantly cod in the form of acetate was fully consumed in all applied hrts which translates in a volumetric removal rate of 97 580 mgcod l 1 day 1 fig a2 with decreasing hrt the biomass productivity increased as well fig 3b while there is no significantly difference in biomass productivity between hrt 2 00 1 00 and 0 67 there was a significant increase at hrt 0 33 this can be explained due to the increased cod load per day and the larger contribution of heterotrophic growth in the bioreactor fig a5 in phototrophic systems the removal rates per mol of photon supplied are important to know next to the volumetric removal rates considering a volumetric photon supply of 0 4 molph l 1 day 1 the removal rate per mol of photons range from 59 to 226 mgn molph day 1 nitrogen and 7 1 to 12 2 mgp molph day 1 for phosphorus depending on the applied hrt the biomass yield is ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 gx molph day 1 which is higher than observed values for phototrophic growth due to the heterotrophic growth that gets an increased importance at lower hrt 3 3 16s and 18s rrna gene based microbial community assembly the principal coordinates analysis pcoa demonstrated tight clustering of triplicate samples for both the 16s and 18s data sets fig 4 thus all downstream analysis on relative abundance for each date was conducted using the average otu read abundance from triplicates the pcoa revealed a clear and recurring trajectory of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic community from planktonic organisms to the assembly of photogranules reactor 1 and 2 followed a similar trajectory however reactor 3 which was operated at the lowest initial hrt of 0 67 days diverged from the other two reactors at day 32 but then re converged reaching the same general community structure by day 140 interestingly all three reactors showed a similar 16s microbial community at day 140 regardless of the history of the community and applied hrt the 18s community showed more dynamic and did not reach a stable community as the 16s one in both pcoa plots a horseshoe effect is visible this phenomenon is often observed in microbiome studies that sample along an environmental gradients in which multiple different niches are present and differentially represented morton et al 2017 here we show that this horseshoe effect was also observed through time as microbiomes adapt to novel conditions from their seed environment 3 3 1 prokaryotic community 16s for the clustering analysis 61 otus were included related to functional groups in correspondence with the midas database mcilroy et al 2017 and milferstedt et al 2017b table a4 in addition any of the top 20 otus that were not assigned a functional group were also included giving a final total of 54 the functional groups included phototrophs 19 taxa biofilm former 3 taxa filamentous organism 13 taxa nitrifiers 2 taxa denitrifiers 6 taxa polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 9 taxa and methanotrophs 6 taxa the analysis revealed four distinct bacterial communities in the time series initially the prokaryotic photosynthetic community was characterized by an abundance of rhodobacter otu 16 oscillatoria pcc 6304 otu 103 pseudanabaena pcc 7429 otu 385 tychonema ccap 1459 11b otu 401 cyanobium pcc 6307 otu 819 planktothricoides sr001 otu 1279 and phormidium ets 05 otu 1374 this diverse community of cyanobacteria decreased through time and was replaced in all reactors by a simplified cyanobacterial community dominated by limnothrix otu 4 10 and cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 11 other cyanobacterial otus such as leptolyngbya ant l52 2 otu 291 leptolyngbya pcc 6306 otu 2 and alkalinema cena528 otu 15 showed no distinct pattern over the course of the experiment and exhibit a similar abundance at the beginning and the end of the experiment concomitant to the increase of the simplified photosynthetic community the non photosynthetic prokaryotic reference taxa for biofilm formation zoogloea otu 12 thauera otu 24 and meiothermus otu 7 increased in all treatments zoogloea became the most abundant organism at the end of the time series with 13 18 relative abundance in contrast meiothermus showed its highest abundance 18 at day 32 at hrt 1 00 d and then decreased in all reactors the nitrifying bacterial community was composed of only a single identified otu nitrosomonas otu 68 within the nitrosomonadaceae family which saw a general increase over time from the inoculum several heterotrophic nitrifiers and aerobic denitrifiers were present in considerable abundance such as comamonas otu 23 zoogloea otu 12 pseudomonas otu 385 diaphorobacter otu 10 thauera otu 24 and pelomonas otu 202 the functional group of paos showed a general increase over time except for gemmatimonas otu 313 which initially increased at hrt 1 00 and 0 67 with a sudden decrease most likely due to washout the most prominent representatives that increased were pseudomonas otu 3 acinetobacter otu 18 and the novel cyanobacterial lineage obscuribacterales otu 80 a putative pao enriched in a photo ebpr system oyserman et al 2017 3 3 2 eukaryotic community 18s in the majority of the sampling points known photosynthetic organisms represented over 90 of the eukaryotic community based on relative abundance initially the photosynthetic fraction of the eukaryotes was dominated by only three green algae chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 13 chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 32 and desmodesmus sp hsj717 otu 43 20 both chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 and chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 were present in the initial inoculum but showed divergent patterns through time in all reactors chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 showed a steep increase until day 25 whereas chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 decreased in relative abundance despite these divergent early trajectories both populations eventually rebounded and returned to similar relative abundances as in the beginning in contrast desmodesmus sp hsj717 otu 43 generally showed a decrease in all reactors in the final photosynthetic eukaryotic community a more diverse assemblage was found next to chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 23 29 and chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 8 19 the community was enriched with scenedesmaceae sp a2 2 otu 78 2 9 chlamydomonadaceae sp kmmcc fc 97 otu 20 5 7 and chlamydomonadales otu 3 14 16 the non photosynthetic eukaryotic community was characterized by predatory eukaryotic organisms such as rotifers ciliates amoeba and fungi amongst the predatory eukaryotic community we detected echinamoeba exundans otu 119 spirotrichea otu 29 bilateria otu 69 vermamoeba otu 56 ascomycota otu 168 and basidiomycota otu 30 these taxa were present in all sample points at very low levels except on day 140 when a sudden increase was observed in all three reactors 3 4 correlation network of microbial community biomass characteristics and reactor function a correlation network using pearson correlation coefficient pcc was carried out to assess the relation between operational conditions functional parameters and microbial community in fig 5 the correlation network for all taxa both prokaryotic and eukaryotic show a positive correlation with biomass characteristics eps cnp content svi and reactor performance se nutrient removal the most connected nodes in the network are attributed to motile filamentous cyanobacteria colony forming photosynthetic eukaryotes biofilm producing denitrifiers and organism involved in the removal and conversion of nitrogen se svi and eps content are strongly correlated to the cyanobacteria limnothrix otu 4 and cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 while eps is correlated with zoogloea otu 12 thauera otu 24 limnothrix otu 4 and cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 the node for eps ps is isolated from the rest of the network and is mostly correlated with eukaryote desmodesmus sp hsj717 otu 43 from the network analysis it was shown that the total nitrogen removal rate is mainly attributed to the phototrophic eukaryotes chlamydomonadaceae sp kmmcc fc 97 otu 20 and chlamydomonadales otu 3 and the non phototrophic prokaryote thauera otu 24 partial nitrification is largely correlated with comamonas otu 23 alicycliphilus otu 9 pseudomonas otu 3 nitrosomonas otu 68 and diaphorobacter otu 10 while nitrification is correlated with diaphorobacter otu 10 and an otu from the family a4b otu 137 in this network one taxa from the order of obscuribacterales otu 80 is present and is the only node connected to p removal a significant correlation of three taxa from the family microscillaceae otu 76 mle 1 27 otu 25 and the genus pelomonas otu 202 with phosphorus content of the biomass is observed these organisms belong to the family of comamonadaceae that is often observed in wastewater treatment systems and show many putative paos interestingly leptolyngbya pcc 6306 otu 2 and other otus that were abundant throughout such as acidovorax otu 149 chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 and chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 did not correlate with function likely because they did not vary in relative abundance through time as they were in high abundance in the inoculant and maintained this status as abundant organisms 4 discussion 4 1 photogranule formation one of the most fundamental selection criteria for biomass in bioreactors is sedimentation effective settling and retention within the system is generally achieved through the formation of aggregates such as floc and granules organisms that do not participate in granule formation do not settle and therefore are washed out of the system here we show that applying lower hrt increases the rate at which granule formation is achieved in all hrts the eps matrix makes a substantial part of the total photogranular biomass with no significant difference among them the eps obtained from photogranules at the end of the experiment showed an average eps content of 239 42 mgeps gvss 1 with a pn ps ratio of about 6 6 this is lower than values found for aerobic granules 311 418 mgeps gvss 1 however with a higher pn ps ratio 3 4 6 2 adav and lee 2008 our observation fall within the range of recent studies on photogranules that reported eps values from 35 1 to 252 3 mgeps gvss 1 with an pn ps ratio from 1 2 to 6 9 ansari et al 2019 cai et al 2019 kuo dahab et al 2018 the hrt had no consistent effect on the overall eps pn content but generally lead to increasing pn ps ratio at lower hrt with increasing pn ps ratio the se increases while the svi decreases fig 2a fig a4 these findings are in agreement with previous research on aerobic granules that highlighted the importance of high pn ps ratio for successful granulation adav et al 2008 pronk et al 2017 seviour et al 2012 the high eps pn and low eps ps observed is attributed to increased hydrophobicity by decreasing the negative surface charge and excess gibbs energy of the surface ding et al 2015 wil√©n et al 2018 activated sludge with floccular structure has usually a pn ps ratio of around 0 9 that indicates low hydrophobicity adav and lee 2008 polysaccharides contribute to the formation of cross network structure with cells seviour et al 2009 however a higher polysaccharide compared to protein content is associated with floccular structures with loose morphology and slime properties flemming et al 2007 the increase of the pn ps from flocs 0 7 to photogranules 6 6 is in accordance with the change in surface properties of the biomass to photogranules fig a3 4 2 nutrient removal of a photogranular bioreactor the maximum removal rate of 90 mgn l 1 day 1 and 5 4 mgp l 1 day 1 was three times higher than similar photo heterotrophic treatment systems liu et al 2017 van den hende et al 2014 2011 wang et al 2015 the ammonical nitrogen removal in particular was improved through time due to nitrification denitrification which correlated with the change of the microbial community from flocs to granules nitrification denitrification are generally described as an additional nitrogen removal path in the use of algal bacterial communities arashiro et al 2017 oyserman et al 2017 rada ariza et al 2017 van der steen et al 2015 the consensus is that the assembly of microbes to flocs and granules increases the stratification over the biomass and hence creates anoxic anaerobic conditions in the core which would allow denitrifiers to convert nitrate into nitrogen gas adav et al 2010 an overall increase in volumetric nitrogen removal rate was observed with decreasing hrt from 2 00 to 0 33 days that was not proportional to the n assimilation in the biomass this suggests that the higher ammonium and cod loading at lower hrt had a positive effect on the nitrifying denitrifying community in the photogranules as shown by princic et al 1998 for aerobic granules the higher nutrient loading could lead to a deeper penetration of nutrients in the granular structure and increased denitrification alpkvist et al 2006 the high abundance of zoogloea and thauera both known denitrifiers could have influenced the n removal at hrt 0 67 and 0 33 days fig a8 the main removal mechanism for p is via assimilation in biomass that matches with the biomass productivity and p content about 1 although the presence of several putative paos was detected by 16s analysis only obscuribacteriales correlated with p removal a finding in agreement with oyserman et al 2017 which also saw the enrichment of this lineage under non granular photosynthetic feast famine conditions carvalho et al 2018 demonstrated as well the successful implementation of photosynthetic cultures enriched in paos under feast famine conditions in our study the enrichment of paos was not selected for directly incorporating the feast famine regime that selects for pao could increase the p removal of photogranules while maintaining the benefits of well settling granular sludge 4 3 community assembly of planktonic organisms to photogranules the two most abundant photosynthetic prokaryotic taxa limnothrix otu 4 cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 are both motile filamentous cyanobacteria from the order of limnotrichales and nostocales these taxa are ubiquitous in nature but have not been reported previously to play an important role in the formation of photogranules they show great functional and morphological similarities with the genus microcoleus a motile filamentous cyanobacteria previously found in photogranules by milferstedt et al 2017b and stauch white et al 2017 in their research they hypothesize that at least one motile filamentous cyanobacteria in high abundance is necessary to form photogranules our results support these findings our and previous reported findings confirm that these filamentous cyanobacteria have an important role in the initiation of photogranulation interestingly filamentous bacteria such as thiothrix in aerobic granules are generally unwanted since they lead to outgrowth and bulking sludge de kreuk 2006 however in the formation of anaerobic granular sludge the filamentous methanosaeta is thought to be crucial in granulation this was proposed as the spaghetti theory by wiegant 1988 in photogranulation a similar concept could be developed where filamentous organisms may become entangled in microscopic knots which become the nucleus a niche for other organisms to attach and form agglomerates that mature to granules with the assembly of photogranules known biofilm producing prokaryotes such as zoogloea otu 12 thauera otu 24 and meiothermus otu 7 were enriched as granule formation progressed these organisms were previously reported as important for the assemblage of aerobic granules by weissbrodt et al 2013 and found to be a vital part of the microbial community in aerobic granules incubated under photosynthetic conditions cai et al 2019 guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 as known biofilm and therefore eps producers it is very likely that they substantially contribute to the granular matrix however it is not possible to state which organisms contributed to what extend to the eps matrix interestingly we saw that the washout conditions of decreasing hrt only dictated the time for photogranule assembly despite ending with similar microbial community structure fig 4 this suggests that while hrt might not drive differences in final community structure of a granule it does increase the rate at which granule formation is achieved based on other functional parameters such as se svi and eps srt could have a larger effect on the final algal bacterial community as bradley et al 2019 recently showed other operational choices such as settling time feeding regime nutrient limitation aeration or mechanical mixing would be interesting to test and evaluate the determining effect on the community structure of photogranules 4 4 network analysis of microbial community structure and reactor function finding biological drivers of physical and chemical properties in photogranules the network analysis showed that only a few organisms drive a wide array of functional parameters microbes with the highest connectivity included the cyanobacteria limnothrix otu 4 cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 and the photosynthetic eukaryote chlamydomonadales otu 3 suggesting they may be key players in granule formation and community structure their strong correlation with svi se and pn ps ratio indicates their structural importance in the photogranular makeup additionally they are related to nitrogen removal which could be simply explained by their high relative abundance interestingly otu 137 from the family of a4b showed a strong positive correlation with svi se and the pn ps ratio of eps as well these taxa usually make up the core microbial community of anaerobic digesters xia et al 2016 their presence could be an indicator for dense granular structures that provide an anaerobic niche despite a highly aerated system this is especially seen in the relationship with svi and a4b which has the strongest correlation of all organisms in the microbial community conversely the network analysis also showed that one parameter or function can be influenced by many different organisms of the community in various degrees functions associated with the eps matrix are influenced by various organisms zoogloea otu 12 which was expected to strongly correlate with eps related functions only weakly correlates with eps pn however a strong correlation with n content in the biomass and nitrogen removal rate was observed thauera otu 24 another known eps producer and prominent denitrifier exhibits a much stronger correlation to nitrogen removal than to eps related functions adav et al 2010 although less abundant it suggests that this taxon has a stronger influence on the functional parameters the most prominent being svi se eps ps and nitrogen removal but also other more conserved reactor functions such as partial nitrification and nitrification are connected to many organisms of the community especially of the genus nitrosomonas comamonas pseudomonas diaphorobacter thauera and pelomonas as shown here when starting with a suspended diverse microbial community and by applying the right operational criteria such as phototrophic conditions sedimentation and hydrodynamic a photogranular community can be formed a subsequent question would be on how to stir the microbial community of the photogranule to improve desired traits such as nitrogen or phosphorus removal ideally photogranules have excellent sedimentation incorporates high nutrient removal rates and requires minimum external input such as aeration the photogranules obtained in this study show three times higher up to 90 mgn l 1 day 1 removal performance in comparison to other phototrophic systems but are still lower than other conventional treatment systems for aerobic granular sludge operated at full scale maximum volumetric removal rates are reported from 170 mgn l 1 d 1 and 240 mgp l 1 d 1 pronk et al 2015 this is 2 for n and 50 for p times higher than the volumetric removal rates obtained here to improve the nutrient removal rate of n and p the focus could be to improve the conditions for higher nitrification rates and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr by paos this would require additional operation strategies which amongst others would include a sophisticated feeding strategy for example with providing feast famine conditions of the primary nutrient n p cod as in oyserman et al 2017 in this way another selection on nutrient limitation would be applied on the microbial community that would promote organisms that produce storage compounds such as eps lipids polyhydroxyalkanoate polyp due to the density of these polymers it might be beneficial for the overall treatment process by promoting settleability and nutrient removal but might also be interesting for later applications of the photogranular biomass in addition microalgae would fuel the whole process by converting photonic energy into chemical energy potentially excluding external oxygen supply and reduce greenhouse gases such as co2 borowitzka and moheimani 2013 5 conclusion low hrts provide cyclic wash out conditions in the bioreactors with a strong selective pressure for well settling biomass decreasing hrt improved settling with a critical hrt threshold of 1 day below this threshold settling efficiency was above 95 but above this threshold separation efficiency stayed below 90 despite the differences between reactors in hrt after one month of operation all three reactors showed a similar microbial community with floccular structure and good separation efficiencies after three months of operation photogranules were obtained in all bioreactors decreased hrt provides a shortcut to produce well settling biomass fig 1 alters reactor community structure more rapidly fig 4 and maintains high nutrient removal and reactor function figs 2 and 3 future research should be aimed to understand additional factors related to granule formation such as srt and nutrient feeding strategies and parametrizing them in combination with low hrt the network analysis identified the key bacterial and eukaryotic taxa driving reactor functions the settling properties of the granules were most linked to motile filamentous cyanobacteria limnothrix cephalothrix sag 75 79 colony forming photosynthetic eukaryote chlamydomonadales in combination with eps producers zoogloea thauera the nutrient removal properties were most linked to nitrifiers denitrifiers nitrosomonas comamonas thauera pseudomonas diaphorobacter and pelomonas and putative paos obscuribacterales in this experiment a different microbial assemblage was found when compared to others in literature but with similar functions therefore it might not be about specific strains but about having a representative s from a function group with many potential strains further research is needed to find out if the final community structure and function is decoupled and depend mostly on the operation conditions rather than on the inoculum declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

18084,photogranules are dense spherical agglomerates of cyanobacteria microalgae and non phototrophic microorganisms that have considerable advantages in terms of harvesting and nutrient removal rates for light driven wastewater treatment processes this ecosystem is poorly understood in terms of the microbial community structure and the response of the community to changing abiotic conditions to get a better understanding we investigated the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on photogranule formation and community assembly over a period of 148 days three laboratory bioreactors were inoculated with field samples from various locations in the netherlands and operated in sequencing batch mode the bioreactors were operated at four different hrts 2 00 1 00 0 67 0 33 days while retaining the same solid retention time of 7 days a microbial community with excellent settling characteristics 95 99 separation efficiency was established within 2 5 weeks the observed nutrient uptake rates ranged from 24 to 90 mgn l 1 day 1 and from 3 1 to 5 4 mgp l 1 day 1 depending on the applied hrt the transition from single cell suspension culture to floccular agglomeration to granular sludge was monitored by microscopy and 16s 18s sequencing in particular two important variables for driving aggregation and granulation and for the structural integrity of photogranules were identified 1 extracellular polymeric substances eps with high protein to polysaccharide ratio and 2 specific microorganisms the key players were found to be the cyanobacteria limnothrix and

maintaining high water quality and prevent excess discharge of nutrients and pollutants into the environment henze 2008 however wastewater treatment also comes at a cost as it is an energy intensive process mccarty et al 2011 and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions cakir and stenstrom 2005 hence improving the efficacy and sustainability of these systems through technological innovation may have broad scale impacts on global sustainability the incorporation of phototrophic organisms such as microalgae and cyanobacteria shows great potential in improving the sustainability of treatment processes by mitigating greenhouse gasses smith et al 2010 closing nutrient cycles fernandes et al 2015 matching wastewater n p ratio for effective treatment by using phototrophic consortia fernandes et al 2017 and providing oxygen to drive processes such as nitrification and polyphosphate accumulation oyserman et al 2017 while promising one of the current bottlenecks in the wider application of phototrophic communities in wastewater treatment is the harvesting of the biomass a principal operational parameter which ensures the effectiveness and economic feasibility of treatment is to retain the microbial community as dense biomass within the treatment system ardern and lockett 1914 milferstedt et al 2017a this requires operational parameters which steer the microbial community to form natural and well settling aggregates these aggregates may be described as either flocs or granules depending on their structure density and settleability in general granules are discrete well defined microbial aggregates formed by cell to cell attraction with regular dense and strong structure and excellent settleability although the first granules were discovered over 50 years ago lettinga et al 1980 the biological mechanisms driving granule formation and the operational parameters that select for their formation are still relatively unknown wil√©n et al 2018 this complex microbial function is far from being fully understood and bears many ecological questions that need to be answered merging granule technology with other biochemical processes such as photosynthesis holds the promise of producing well settling photoautotrophic systems in so called photogranules in general photogranules can be described as spherical biofilm systems of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganism photogranules were already obtained from different seeding cultures 1 hydrostatically incubated activated sludge abouhend et al 2018 2 activated granular sludge mixed with unicellular green algae liu et al 2017 and have demonstrated to work at lab scale in airlift reactors as well as in aeration free mechanically stirred reactors meng et al 2019 tiron et al 2017 photogranules are commonly cultivated in sequencing batch operation to provide cyclic wash out conditions assure selection of well settling biomass and prevent growth of individual cells in suspension this operation strategy is similar to the one applied in aerobic granular sludge technology and assures a selection pressure for granular morphology de kreuk 2006 motile filamentous cyanobacteria showed to be an important constituent of photogranule formation and vital under static incubation and mixed operation conditions abouhend et al 2018 milferstedt et al 2017b in green algae dominated photogranules zoogloea was shown to be involved in the granulation process due to eps production huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 few studies also addressed other functional groups such as nitrifiers abouhend et al 2018 huang et al 2015 tiron et al 2015 denitrifiers stauch white et al 2017 or polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos cai et al 2019 in photogranules however successful implementation of photogranular technology will require a deeper biological understanding of the processes and the microbial community that drive granular structure and function so that this knowledge may be parameterized both under static and hydrodynamic conditions integrating systems biology and community based approaches can provide significant insight into the physiology and role of specific organisms in community function oyserman et al 2016 which can help identify additional operational strategies to steer biomass characteristics towards a particular ecosystem function therefore in order to fully exploit photogranule technology a first step is linking information about the microbial ecology of phototrophic granulation with properties of the granules in this study we examined the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on the function and assembly of a photogranular community by using amplicon sequencing microscopic observation characterisation of the eps matrix and general acquisition of reactor performance key organisms and factors can be identified we compared taxonomical functional groups correlation with chemical and physical data from the bioreactor system to identify potential biological drivers of key functional properties this will enhance the understanding of photogranular systems and help to further improve the operational strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal bacterial community the

decanting the settled biomass twice a week to lower the biomass concentration to 1 g l 1 the biomass concentration within the bioreactor before harvesting the biomass was usually between 2 and 3 g l 1

1 photogranule formation the development of a well settling algal bacterial community was strongly influenced by the applied hrt with decreasing hrt and therefore increasing hydraulic pressure the microbial community was driven more rapidly towards floccular aggregates specifically at an hrt 0 67 d the assembly time was reduced to 11 days compared to 32 days at hrt 2 00 the hydraulic pressure dictated the se as well which resulted in better separation at lower hrts when changing the hrt at day 116 from 2 00 d to 0 67 d and from 1 00 d to 0 33 d the settling properties increased significantly and the microbial community shifted to be dominated by photogranules in fig 1 the separation efficiency se of biomass from the liquid is displayed as a percentage of the total amount of biomass in the system as hrt decreased the separation efficiency of the biomass increased specifically a se higher than 90 in phase 1 was achieved for the reactor with an hrt of 0 67 d in 10 days the reactor with an hrt of 1 00 d achieved this se in 24 days of operation whereas the reactor operated at an hrt of 2 00 d required 32 days these results show that a lower hrt accelerated the assembly of flocs and granules by rapid selecting for well settling biomass the higher hydraulic pressure experienced by the microbial community at hrt 1 00 d and below drives a se greater than 90 furthermore in the case of hrt 0 67 d and hrt 0 33 d in phase 2 the se increased to 99 in fig 2 a the long term effect of hrt on se and svi is depicted a lower hrt drives a higher se and lower svi the variability in se and svi was also lower with lower hrt suggesting that low hrt increased the functional stability this implies that it promotes a more stable settling and therefore improves biomass retention in the system the increased se was accompanied by a decrease in svi while the microalgal bacterial community exhibited an svi of 300 ml g 1 at the start of operation it was reduced to an average of 57 9 ml g 1 when it began to show granular biomass structure the morphological changes of the photogranules during the operation were followed by microscopic observation with selected pictures shown in fig 1 the inoculum consisted of free organisms such as green algae cyanobacteria and bacteria motile filamentous cyanobacteria present in the inoculum started to entangle and form early aggregates as flocs in the first weeks of operation and started to incorporate other prokaryotes and colony forming photosynthetic eukaryotes after about 3 month of operation the first granular structures appeared as shown by the microscopic images of t 82 and 140 days in fig 1 it has been shown that eps may act like a glue that promotes the spatial alignment of both algae and bacteria to agglomerates flemming et al 2007 characterisation of the eps matrix in terms of proteins eps pn and polysaccharides eps ps showed that eps is a substantial part of the floccular and granular biomass ranging from 8 to 34 fig a4 in fig 2b the average eps is depicted for the applied hrt there is no significant difference in constituent eps pn and eps ps however there is a significant increase in pn ps ratio with lower hrt while being a substantial part from the first appearance of floccular structure there was a change from mostly eps ps to a majority of eps pn content this is reflected in a shift from the pn ps ratio in eps from 1 0 to 6 6 at hrt 0 67 the makeup of eps in the photogranules in the last month of operation at hrt 0 67 was found to be 239 42 mgeps gvss 1 with a pn ps ratio of about 6 6 3 2 nutrient removal performance the initial phase of reactor operation was characterized by a rapid assembly of a well settling floccular microbial community with stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal after 2 4 weeks in fig 3 a the average volumetric nutrient removal rates across the applied hrt are shown with decreasing hrt the volumetric removal rate for nitrogen increased significantly from 24 to 90 mgn l 1 day 1 with the maximum at hrt 0 33 after 40 days of operation nitrification started to occur in all three reactors but no stable nitrification rate was obtained until the end of operation fig a1 since the increase in nitrogen removal could not be explained with nitrogen assimilation in the biomass the potential denitrification was assessed therefore a mass balance for nitrogen biomass and the elemental composition of the biomass was performed in that way it was shown that for hrt 0 67 denitrification accounted for 23 of the nitrogen removal and for hrt 0 33 for 26 fig a7 the volumetric removal rate of phosphorus increased with decreasing hrt from 3 1 to 5 4 mgp l 1 day 1 however not significantly cod in the form of acetate was fully consumed in all applied hrts which translates in a volumetric removal rate of 97 580 mgcod l 1 day 1 fig a2 with decreasing hrt the biomass productivity increased as well fig 3b while there is no significantly difference in biomass productivity between hrt 2 00 1 00 and 0 67 there was a significant increase at hrt 0 33 this can be explained due to the increased cod load per day and the larger contribution of heterotrophic growth in the bioreactor fig a5 in phototrophic systems the removal rates per mol of photon supplied are important to know next to the volumetric removal rates considering a volumetric photon supply of 0 4 molph l 1 day 1 the removal rate per mol of photons range from 59 to 226 mgn molph day 1 nitrogen and 7 1 to 12 2 mgp molph day 1 for phosphorus depending on the applied hrt the biomass yield is ranging from 1 0 to 1 7 gx molph day 1 which is higher than observed values for phototrophic growth due to the heterotrophic growth that gets an increased importance at lower hrt 3 3 16s and 18s rrna gene based microbial community assembly the principal coordinates analysis pcoa demonstrated tight clustering of triplicate samples for both the 16s and 18s data sets fig 4 thus all downstream analysis on relative abundance for each date was conducted using the average otu read abundance from triplicates the pcoa revealed a clear and recurring trajectory of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic community from planktonic organisms to the assembly of photogranules reactor 1 and 2 followed a similar trajectory however reactor 3 which was operated at the lowest initial hrt of 0 67 days diverged from the other two reactors at day 32 but then re converged reaching the same general community structure by day 140 interestingly all three reactors showed a similar 16s microbial community at day 140 regardless of the history of the community and applied hrt the 18s community showed more dynamic and did not reach a stable community as the 16s one in both pcoa plots a horseshoe effect is visible this phenomenon is often observed in microbiome studies that sample along an environmental gradients in which multiple different niches are present and differentially represented morton et al 2017 here we show that this horseshoe effect was also observed through time as microbiomes adapt to novel conditions from their seed environment 3 3 1 prokaryotic community 16s for the clustering analysis 61 otus were included related to functional groups in correspondence with the midas database mcilroy et al 2017 and milferstedt et al 2017b table a4 in addition any of the top 20 otus that were not assigned a functional group were also included giving a final total of 54 the functional groups included phototrophs 19 taxa biofilm former 3 taxa filamentous organism 13 taxa nitrifiers 2 taxa denitrifiers 6 taxa polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 9 taxa and methanotrophs 6 taxa the analysis revealed four distinct bacterial communities in the time series initially the prokaryotic photosynthetic community was characterized by an abundance of rhodobacter otu 16 oscillatoria pcc 6304 otu 103 pseudanabaena pcc 7429 otu 385 tychonema ccap 1459 11b otu 401 cyanobium pcc 6307 otu 819 planktothricoides sr001 otu 1279 and phormidium ets 05 otu 1374 this diverse community of cyanobacteria decreased through time and was replaced in all reactors by a simplified cyanobacterial community dominated by limnothrix otu 4 10 and cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 11 other cyanobacterial otus such as leptolyngbya ant l52 2 otu 291 leptolyngbya pcc 6306 otu 2 and alkalinema cena528 otu 15 showed no distinct pattern over the course of the experiment and exhibit a similar abundance at the beginning and the end of the experiment concomitant to the increase of the simplified photosynthetic community the non photosynthetic prokaryotic reference taxa for biofilm formation zoogloea otu 12 thauera otu 24 and meiothermus otu 7 increased in all treatments zoogloea became the most abundant organism at the end of the time series with 13 18 relative abundance in contrast meiothermus showed its highest abundance 18 at day 32 at hrt 1 00 d and then decreased in all reactors the nitrifying bacterial community was composed of only a single identified otu nitrosomonas otu 68 within the nitrosomonadaceae family which saw a general increase over time from the inoculum several heterotrophic nitrifiers and aerobic denitrifiers were present in considerable abundance such as comamonas otu 23 zoogloea otu 12 pseudomonas otu 385 diaphorobacter otu 10 thauera otu 24 and pelomonas otu 202 the functional group of paos showed a general increase over time except for gemmatimonas otu 313 which initially increased at hrt 1 00 and 0 67 with a sudden decrease most likely due to washout the most prominent representatives that increased were pseudomonas otu 3 acinetobacter otu 18 and the novel cyanobacterial lineage obscuribacterales otu 80 a putative pao enriched in a photo ebpr system oyserman et al 2017 3 3 2 eukaryotic community 18s in the majority of the sampling points known photosynthetic organisms represented over 90 of the eukaryotic community based on relative abundance initially the photosynthetic fraction of the eukaryotes was dominated by only three green algae chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 13 chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 32 and desmodesmus sp hsj717 otu 43 20 both chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 and chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 were present in the initial inoculum but showed divergent patterns through time in all reactors chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 showed a steep increase until day 25 whereas chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 decreased in relative abundance despite these divergent early trajectories both populations eventually rebounded and returned to similar relative abundances as in the beginning in contrast desmodesmus sp hsj717 otu 43 generally showed a decrease in all reactors in the final photosynthetic eukaryotic community a more diverse assemblage was found next to chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 23 29 and chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 8 19 the community was enriched with scenedesmaceae sp a2 2 otu 78 2 9 chlamydomonadaceae sp kmmcc fc 97 otu 20 5 7 and chlamydomonadales otu 3 14 16 the non photosynthetic eukaryotic community was characterized by predatory eukaryotic organisms such as rotifers ciliates amoeba and fungi amongst the predatory eukaryotic community we detected echinamoeba exundans otu 119 spirotrichea otu 29 bilateria otu 69 vermamoeba otu 56 ascomycota otu 168 and basidiomycota otu 30 these taxa were present in all sample points at very low levels except on day 140 when a sudden increase was observed in all three reactors 3 4 correlation network of microbial community biomass characteristics and reactor function a correlation network using pearson correlation coefficient pcc was carried out to assess the relation between operational conditions functional parameters and microbial community in fig 5 the correlation network for all taxa both prokaryotic and eukaryotic show a positive correlation with biomass characteristics eps cnp content svi and reactor performance se nutrient removal the most connected nodes in the network are attributed to motile filamentous cyanobacteria colony forming photosynthetic eukaryotes biofilm producing denitrifiers and organism involved in the removal and conversion of nitrogen se svi and eps content are strongly correlated to the cyanobacteria limnothrix otu 4 and cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 while eps is correlated with zoogloea otu 12 thauera otu 24 limnothrix otu 4 and cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 the node for eps ps is isolated from the rest of the network and is mostly correlated with eukaryote desmodesmus sp hsj717 otu 43 from the network analysis it was shown that the total nitrogen removal rate is mainly attributed to the phototrophic eukaryotes chlamydomonadaceae sp kmmcc fc 97 otu 20 and chlamydomonadales otu 3 and the non phototrophic prokaryote thauera otu 24 partial nitrification is largely correlated with comamonas otu 23 alicycliphilus otu 9 pseudomonas otu 3 nitrosomonas otu 68 and diaphorobacter otu 10 while nitrification is correlated with diaphorobacter otu 10 and an otu from the family a4b otu 137 in this network one taxa from the order of obscuribacterales otu 80 is present and is the only node connected to p removal a significant correlation of three taxa from the family microscillaceae otu 76 mle 1 27 otu 25 and the genus pelomonas otu 202 with phosphorus content of the biomass is observed these organisms belong to the family of comamonadaceae that is often observed in wastewater treatment systems and show many putative paos interestingly leptolyngbya pcc 6306 otu 2 and other otus that were abundant throughout such as acidovorax otu 149 chlorella sorokiniana otu 1 and chlorococcum vacuolatum otu 4 did not correlate with function likely because they did not vary in relative abundance through time as they were in high abundance in the inoculant and maintained this status as abundant organisms 4 discussion 4 1 photogranule formation one of the most fundamental selection criteria for biomass in bioreactors is sedimentation effective settling and retention within the system is generally achieved through the formation of aggregates such as floc and granules organisms that do not participate in granule formation do not settle and therefore are washed out of the system here we show that applying lower hrt increases the rate at which granule formation is achieved in all hrts the eps matrix makes a substantial part of the total photogranular biomass with no significant difference among them the eps obtained from photogranules at the end of the experiment showed an average eps content of 239 42 mgeps gvss 1 with a pn ps ratio of about 6 6 this is lower than values found for aerobic granules 311 418 mgeps gvss 1 however with a higher pn ps ratio 3 4 6 2 adav and lee 2008 our observation fall within the range of recent studies on photogranules that reported eps values from 35 1 to 252 3 mgeps gvss 1 with an pn ps ratio from 1 2 to 6 9 ansari et al 2019 cai et al 2019 kuo dahab et al 2018 the hrt had no consistent effect on the overall eps pn content but generally lead to increasing pn ps ratio at lower hrt with increasing pn ps ratio the se increases while the svi decreases fig 2a fig a4 these findings are in agreement with previous research on aerobic granules that highlighted the importance of high pn ps ratio for successful granulation adav et al 2008 pronk et al 2017 seviour et al 2012 the high eps pn and low eps ps observed is attributed to increased hydrophobicity by decreasing the negative surface charge and excess gibbs energy of the surface ding et al 2015 wil√©n et al 2018 activated sludge with floccular structure has usually a pn ps ratio of around 0 9 that indicates low hydrophobicity adav and lee 2008 polysaccharides contribute to the formation of cross network structure with cells seviour et al 2009 however a higher polysaccharide compared to protein content is associated with floccular structures with loose morphology and slime properties flemming et al 2007 the increase of the pn ps from flocs 0 7 to photogranules 6 6 is in accordance with the change in surface properties of the biomass to photogranules fig a3 4 2 nutrient removal of a photogranular bioreactor the maximum removal rate of 90 mgn l 1 day 1 and 5 4 mgp l 1 day 1 was three times higher than similar photo heterotrophic treatment systems liu et al 2017 van den hende et al 2014 2011 wang et al 2015 the ammonical nitrogen removal in particular was improved through time due to nitrification denitrification which correlated with the change of the microbial community from flocs to granules nitrification denitrification are generally described as an additional nitrogen removal path in the use of algal bacterial communities arashiro et al 2017 oyserman et al 2017 rada ariza et al 2017 van der steen et al 2015 the consensus is that the assembly of microbes to flocs and granules increases the stratification over the biomass and hence creates anoxic anaerobic conditions in the core which would allow denitrifiers to convert nitrate into nitrogen gas adav et al 2010 an overall increase in volumetric nitrogen removal rate was observed with decreasing hrt from 2 00 to 0 33 days that was not proportional to the n assimilation in the biomass this suggests that the higher ammonium and cod loading at lower hrt had a positive effect on the nitrifying denitrifying community in the photogranules as shown by princic et al 1998 for aerobic granules the higher nutrient loading could lead to a deeper penetration of nutrients in the granular structure and increased denitrification alpkvist et al 2006 the high abundance of zoogloea and thauera both known denitrifiers could have influenced the n removal at hrt 0 67 and 0 33 days fig a8 the main removal mechanism for p is via assimilation in biomass that matches with the biomass productivity and p content about 1 although the presence of several putative paos was detected by 16s analysis only obscuribacteriales correlated with p removal a finding in agreement with oyserman et al 2017 which also saw the enrichment of this lineage under non granular photosynthetic feast famine conditions carvalho et al 2018 demonstrated as well the successful implementation of photosynthetic cultures enriched in paos under feast famine conditions in our study the enrichment of paos was not selected for directly incorporating the feast famine regime that selects for pao could increase the p removal of photogranules while maintaining the benefits of well settling granular sludge 4 3 community assembly of planktonic organisms to photogranules the two most abundant photosynthetic prokaryotic taxa limnothrix otu 4 cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 are both motile filamentous cyanobacteria from the order of limnotrichales and nostocales these taxa are ubiquitous in nature but have not been reported previously to play an important role in the formation of photogranules they show great functional and morphological similarities with the genus microcoleus a motile filamentous cyanobacteria previously found in photogranules by milferstedt et al 2017b and stauch white et al 2017 in their research they hypothesize that at least one motile filamentous cyanobacteria in high abundance is necessary to form photogranules our results support these findings our and previous reported findings confirm that these filamentous cyanobacteria have an important role in the initiation of photogranulation interestingly filamentous bacteria such as thiothrix in aerobic granules are generally unwanted since they lead to outgrowth and bulking sludge de kreuk 2006 however in the formation of anaerobic granular sludge the filamentous methanosaeta is thought to be crucial in granulation this was proposed as the spaghetti theory by wiegant 1988 in photogranulation a similar concept could be developed where filamentous organisms may become entangled in microscopic knots which become the nucleus a niche for other organisms to attach and form agglomerates that mature to granules with the assembly of photogranules known biofilm producing prokaryotes such as zoogloea otu 12 thauera otu 24 and meiothermus otu 7 were enriched as granule formation progressed these organisms were previously reported as important for the assemblage of aerobic granules by weissbrodt et al 2013 and found to be a vital part of the microbial community in aerobic granules incubated under photosynthetic conditions cai et al 2019 guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 as known biofilm and therefore eps producers it is very likely that they substantially contribute to the granular matrix however it is not possible to state which organisms contributed to what extend to the eps matrix interestingly we saw that the washout conditions of decreasing hrt only dictated the time for photogranule assembly despite ending with similar microbial community structure fig 4 this suggests that while hrt might not drive differences in final community structure of a granule it does increase the rate at which granule formation is achieved based on other functional parameters such as se svi and eps srt could have a larger effect on the final algal bacterial community as bradley et al 2019 recently showed other operational choices such as settling time feeding regime nutrient limitation aeration or mechanical mixing would be interesting to test and evaluate the determining effect on the community structure of photogranules 4 4 network analysis of microbial community structure and reactor function finding biological drivers of physical and chemical properties in photogranules the network analysis showed that only a few organisms drive a wide array of functional parameters microbes with the highest connectivity included the cyanobacteria limnothrix otu 4 cephalothrix sag 75 79 otu 5 and the photosynthetic eukaryote chlamydomonadales otu 3 suggesting they may be key players in granule formation and community structure their strong correlation with svi se and pn ps ratio indicates their structural importance in the photogranular makeup additionally they are related to nitrogen removal which could be simply explained by their high relative abundance interestingly otu 137 from the family of a4b showed a strong positive correlation with svi se and the pn ps ratio of eps as well these taxa usually make up the core microbial community of anaerobic digesters xia et al 2016 their presence could be an indicator for dense granular structures that provide an anaerobic niche despite a highly aerated system this is especially seen in the relationship with svi and a4b which has the strongest correlation of all organisms in the microbial community conversely the network analysis also showed that one parameter or function can be influenced by many different organisms of the community in various degrees functions associated with the eps matrix are influenced by various organisms zoogloea otu 12 which was expected to strongly correlate with eps related functions only weakly correlates with eps pn however a strong correlation with n content in the biomass and nitrogen removal rate was observed thauera otu 24 another known eps producer and prominent denitrifier exhibits a much stronger correlation to nitrogen removal than to eps related functions adav et al 2010 although less abundant it suggests that this taxon has a stronger influence on the functional parameters the most prominent being svi se eps ps and nitrogen removal but also other more conserved reactor functions such as partial nitrification and nitrification are connected to many organisms of the community especially of the genus nitrosomonas comamonas pseudomonas diaphorobacter thauera and pelomonas as shown here when starting with a suspended diverse microbial community and by applying the right operational criteria such as phototrophic conditions sedimentation and hydrodynamic a photogranular community can be formed a subsequent question would be on how to stir the microbial community of the photogranule to improve desired traits such as nitrogen or phosphorus removal ideally photogranules have excellent sedimentation incorporates high nutrient removal rates and requires minimum external input such as aeration the photogranules obtained in this study show three times higher up to 90 mgn l 1 day 1 removal performance in comparison to other phototrophic systems but are still lower than other conventional treatment systems for aerobic granular sludge operated at full scale maximum volumetric removal rates are reported from 170 mgn l 1 d 1 and 240 mgp l 1 d 1 pronk et al 2015 this is 2 for n and 50 for p times higher than the volumetric removal rates obtained here to improve the nutrient removal rate of n and p the focus could be to improve the conditions for higher nitrification rates and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr by paos this would require additional operation strategies which amongst others would include a sophisticated feeding strategy for example with providing feast famine conditions of the primary nutrient n p cod as in oyserman et al 2017 in this way another selection on nutrient limitation would be applied on the microbial community that would promote organisms that produce storage compounds such as eps lipids polyhydroxyalkanoate polyp due to the density of these polymers it might be beneficial for the overall treatment process by promoting settleability and nutrient removal but might also be interesting for later applications of the photogranular biomass in addition microalgae would fuel the whole process by converting photonic energy into chemical energy potentially excluding external oxygen supply and reduce greenhouse gases such as co2 borowitzka and moheimani 2013 5 conclusion low hrts provide cyclic wash out conditions in the bioreactors with a strong selective pressure for well settling biomass decreasing hrt improved settling with a critical hrt threshold of 1 day below this threshold settling efficiency was above 95 but above this threshold separation efficiency stayed below 90 despite the differences between reactors in hrt after one month of operation all three reactors showed a similar microbial community with floccular structure and good separation efficiencies after three months of operation photogranules were obtained in all bioreactors decreased hrt provides a shortcut to produce well settling biomass fig 1 alters reactor community structure more rapidly fig 4 and maintains high nutrient removal and reactor function figs 2 and 3 future research should be aimed to understand additional factors related to granule formation such as srt and nutrient feeding strategies and parametrizing them in combination with low hrt the network analysis identified the key bacterial and eukaryotic taxa driving reactor functions the settling properties of the granules were most linked to motile filamentous cyanobacteria limnothrix cephalothrix sag 75 79 colony forming photosynthetic eukaryote chlamydomonadales in combination with eps producers zoogloea thauera the nutrient removal properties were most linked to nitrifiers denitrifiers nitrosomonas comamonas thauera pseudomonas diaphorobacter and pelomonas and putative paos obscuribacterales in this experiment a different microbial assemblage was found when compared to others in literature but with similar functions therefore it might not be about specific strains but about having a representative s from a function group with many potential strains further research is needed to find out if the final community structure and function is decoupled and depend mostly on the operation conditions rather than
