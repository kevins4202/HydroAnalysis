19615,sludge pumps in wastewater treatment plants are often oversized due to uncertainty in calculation of pressure drop this issue costs millions of dollars for industry to purchase and operate the oversized pumps besides costs higher electricity consumption is associated with extra co2 emission which creates huge environmental impacts calculation of pressure drop via current pipe flow theory requires model estimation of flow curve data which depends on regression analysis and also varies with natural variation of rheological data this study investigates impact of variation of rheological data and regression analysis on variation of pressure drop calculated via current pipe flow theories results compare the variation of calculated pressure drop between different models and regression methods and suggest on the suitability of each method graphical abstract image 1 introduction optimisation of pumping systems can significantly reduce the energy consumption by wastewater treatment plants since pumps are among the highest energy consumers in wastewater treatment processes rheological characterisation of sludge is important since it provides the essential information used in the design and optimisation of pumping systems eshtiaghi et al 2013 slatter 1997 the pipe flow theory for sludge is well developed slatter 2003 2008 but the wide variability of the reported rheological model parameters hinders application of the theory to practical engineering design e g the variability in herschel bulkley hb model parameters used to describe sludge flow behaviour this variability is more than an order of magnitude for some of the parameters anderson et al 2008 water environment 2008 the reason for the variability in sludge rheological data is unknown but there are several possible reasons for this one is that due to the difference in sludge sourcing and its treatment method the sludge characteristics vary between sites jin et al 2003 the second possibility is temporal variability in sludge characteristics at a single site this temporal variability may be a result of the temporal change in sludge composition which occurs with the change of season mahmoud et al 2004 water environment 2008 or time of sampling another possibility is the reliability of the method used for the analysis of sludge rheological data i e nonlinear regression ratkovich et al 2013 this is more important where a three parameter model such as hb fits the sludge flow curve this inconsistency has resulted in proposing different relationships for the variation of hb model parameters with sludge concentration dabak and yucel 1987 farno et al 2015 lotito et al 1997 mori et al 2006 as of other biological systems he 2014 zi 2011 not only sludge composition naturally contains variation but also sludge rheological data and model parameters introduce random errors dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 regardless of the source of errors such non deterministic features in every realistic engineering design contribute to stochasticity in the outcome dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 engineers face two problems in the design of pumping systems for sewage sludge one is the variability in the pressure drop as a result of the variability in the nature of sewage sludge second is the non newtonian behaviour of sewage sludge which requires accurate rheological data and not relying on the rule of thumb approaches anderson et al 2008 slatter 2001 the design of these systems requires a reliable means of estimating pressure drop at various flow rates this is a complicated task because the description of the complex behaviour of sludge i e flow behaviour typically requires two or three rheological parameters rather than the more traditional use of a single viscosity value for simpler fluids malkin et al 2004 slatter 2004 municipal sewage sludge is known as a shear thinning viscoplastic material literature has mostly used bingham plastic bp herschel bulkley hb and recently modified herschel bulkley modified hb models to describe sludge flow curve 1 τ τ b k γ 2 τ τ h k γ n 3 τ τ h k γ n α γ where τ pa is shear stress γ dv dr s 1 is shear rate v m s is velocity along the flow direction e g along a pipeline r m is flow cross section distance e g radial distant from pipe centre and τ b pa τ h pa k pa sn n and α pa s are fitting parameters of the models bp is a linear model which has only two fitting parameters applying a linear model results in an easy straight forward regression approach however this model predicts apparent viscosity with high errors at medium and high shear rates as it ignores sludge widely known shear thinning characteristics baudez et al 2011 in contrast hb model has three fitting parameters and well fits sludge flow curve at medium and low range shear rates addition of a power exponent in eq 2 results in a nonlinear model which requires a nonlinear fitting approach the drawback of using hb model is that it under estimates apparent viscosity at high shear rates baudez et al 2011 this issue is fixed by adding the third term in eq 3 compromising modified hb with four fitting parameters modified hb model well fits the sludge flow curve at a wider shear rate range due to a higher number of fitting parameters baudez et al 2011 however this additional parameter may induce uncertainty over fitting parameters as well as in the calculation of pressure drop in pipeline the main purpose of fitting rheological models to sludge flow curve is to predict the pressure difference required to properly transfer sludge in pipe lines carthew et al 1983 eshtiaghi et al 2013 mulbarger et al 1981 according to the pipe flow theory bird 2002 shear stress along a pipe distributes linearly across the pipe cross section 4 τ δ p l r 2 where δp pa is the pressure difference along a pipe with the length of l m however sludge has a yield stress e g τ b τ h below which it does not flow as a result close to the pipe centre and depending on the imposed pressure difference there might be an area in which the actual shear stress which the sludge experiences is less than its yield stress in this case there will be a solid plug like core in the middle of the pipe in other words if the pressure difference imposed on sludge to flow in a pipeline is not large enough part of the sludge remains unsheared and plug flow will form the radius of plug flow is calculated as follows 5 r p τ y τ w r where r m is pipe radius τ y pa is yield stress and τ w pa is shear stress at pipe wall chhabra and richardson 2011 if it is assumed that the model yield stress is equal to actual material yield stress τ y τ h then in the laminar regime velocity is calculated by integrating eq 2 in respect to r and satisfying no wall slip condition v at r r 0 6 v n r n 1 τ w k 1 n 1 τ h τ w n 1 n r r τ h τ w n 1 n r rp 7 v n r n 1 τ w k 1 n 1 τ h τ w n 1 n r rp flow rate is also calculated by integrating velocity across the pipe cross section 8 q π r 3 n τ w k 1 τ h τ w n 1 n 1 τ h τ w 2 3 n 1 2 τ h τ w 1 τ h τ w 2 n 1 τ h τ w 2 n 1 substituting n 1 in eqs 6 8 yields velocity and flow rate for bp model eq 1 instead of hb model eq 2 however substituting eq 4 in modified hb model eq 3 yields the following nonlinear ordinary differential equation which to our best knowledge no analytical solution has yet been developed for 9 δ p l r 2 τ h k d v d r n α d v d r in this study a numerical solution was developed in matlab to calculate velocity and flow rate based on modified hb model eqs 6 8 and numerical solution of eq 9 are only valid in laminar regime in turbulent regime no exact mathematical analysis has yet been developed for hb or bp several semi theoretical equations have been proposed based on modifications of expression of shear stress at the pipe wall for newtonian fluids chhabra and richardson 2011 slatter 2008 slatter 2008 proposed a logarithmic velocity distribution for turbulent flow of non newtonian fluids as follows 10 v v 2 5 ln r ε b 3 75 where v τ y ρ 1 2 ρ kg m3 is fluid density ε is pipe roughness and b is classic roughness function in slatter 2008 approach b varies with rough wall reynolds number defined as follows 11 r e r 8 ρ v 2 τ y k 8 v 2 ε for concentrated sludge slatter 2008 showed b equals to 8 5 at re r 3 32 rough wall turbulent flow and b equals to 2 5 ln re r 5 5 at re r 3 32 therefore the flow regime needs to be identified to know which equation either eqs 6 9 or eq 10 is applied in flow of newtonian fluids in pipe the flow regime changes from laminar to turbulent regime at the reynolds number of 2100 based on the original definition of reynolds number slatter 1995 formulated re 3 eq 12 for fluids that obey hb and bp models reynolds number defined as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces is used to identify the flow regime in re 3 approach the transition of regime from laminar to turbulence also occurs at 2100 12 r e 3 8 ρ v a n n τ y k 8 v a n n d s h e a r n where v ann m s and d shear m are velocity and diameter in the sheared area of pipe annulus velocity respectively re 3 approach has been widely tested and used for sludge slatter 2003 slatter and wasp 2000 generally estimation of model parameters is a minimization problem in which an objective function is defined and minimised at a value that is in the centre of samples the solution depends on the choice of the objective function e g eq 13 and 14 as well as model structure i e linear such as bp or nonlinear such as hb or modified hb and solver dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 where a linear model such as bp is dealt the model parameters are usually estimated analytically by differentiating the objective function with respect to the model parameters however in the case of nonlinear models such as hb or modified hb a numerical approach that searches the parameter space systematically has to be used for example non linear curve fitting of matlab by default employs trust region algorithm to adjust the model parameters and determine whether the fit improves mathworks 2016 some minimization methods use linearization technique to reduce the complexity of parameters estimation for model like hb or mhb but this method can lead to biased parameter estimation the basic assumption is that the measured variables are independent and identically distributed normally but such reparameterisation linearizing the model can violate this assumption dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 the most used objective function today is the sum of squared errors 13 j θ i 1 n y i y ˆ i θ 2 where y i are the measurements ŷ i θ are the model predictions for a given parameter set θ and n is the total number of measurement points the parameters which yield the least value of j θ are selected as model parameters ordinary least squares fitting formulation however eq 13 should be used where the standard deviations of the measurements are constant and the residual errors the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest are normally distributed if standard deviation is different in each data point a general form of eq 13 called the maximum likelihood objective function can be used 14 j θ i 1 n 1 σ i 2 y i y ˆ i θ 2 where σ i is the standard deviation of the measurements y i eq 14 does not require constant standard deviations at all measurement points as a condition but it still takes the assumption that the measurement errors are normally distributed when standard deviations of the measurements are not available then eq 14 can be transferred to weighted least squares function in which instead of 1 σ i 2 weights are added based on engineering judgment robinson 1985 sometimes the weight in eq 14 can be assigned proportional to the measured value y i due to more reliable measurement at high shear rates however this may not be always a right judgement as it does not consider impacts of rheometer limits as well as probability of slippage vortex and turbulence flow but often the residual errors are not necessarily normally distributed this problem may occur particularly where bp or hb models are used as shear rate increases the residual errors increase for hb and bp models to tackle this issue one solution is to give weighting to residual errors this is possible where repeats of measurements are available which due to sludge variant nature may not be the case it is important to be noted that an incorrect weighting derives biased results the other resolution is to cut the data with high residual errors for example if the highest measureable shear rate for sludge is 1000 s 1 one may abandon the data collected beyond an even smaller shear rate of 500 s 1 but to make a decision from where data needs to be cut is not easy for an inexperienced rheologist to avoid subjective judgments robust estimation method can be used where the residual errors are not normally distributed in a robust estimation the data which do not belong to the distribution type of the majority of data outliers are removed or weighted lower than others as a result in robust method outlier data do not impact on the estimation of model parameters as well as confidence regions note apart from removing outliers the robust method may use the same ordinary least squares fitting to find the model parameter a decision on whether parameter estimation is good or bad can be made through residual analysis if a model and selected regression methods are suitable the residuals should hold similar characteristics such as randomness homoscedasticity homogeneity of variance normal distribution with the measurements dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 as discussed above selection of model and regression methods may cause some errors in estimation of model parameters in fact no perfect algorithm exists for estimating nonlinear model parameters in addition sludge rheological data contains random errors which then add more errors to those of model selection and regression method the variation of estimated model parameters related to the variation of data assuming the model and the regression method are correct can be estimated via calculation of 95 confidence region 95 confidence region is a multi dimensional region in which true model parameter with a probability of 95 is located dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 regardless of the source of errors the pressure drop calculated for sludge pipeline cannot be useful as long as the certainty of the estimated value is not known the questions raised here is how these variations impact on the final value calculated for the pressure drop and how much is the variation of the final value in this study model parameters are not estimated as unique numbers but as variable numbers in 95 confidence region this study predicts the probability distribution of pressure drop calculation in typical sludge pipe line when the model parameters vary in the 95 confidence region different parameter estimation scenarios including selection of rheological model from eq 1 or 2 or 3 and robust or non robust fitting techniques are compared together in terms of the range of variation standard deviation created in the calculation of pressure drop for a typical sludge pipe line also sensitivity analysis is employed to identify which model parameters are mostly correlated with the output i e pressure drop calculation for sludge pipeline hamby 1994 2 materials and methods 2 1 rheological characterisation waste activated sludge was sampled at initial solid concentration of 3 5 weight by weight from one of the melbourne wastewater treatment plants periodically over a one year period sludge was concentrated to 5 6 7 and 8 using buchner funnel vacuum filtration process sludge was stored in sealed containers in a fridge 4 c for at least one month and they were homogenized to room temperature before any rheological measurement rheological measurements were performed using a stress controlled rheometer hr3 ta instruments equipped with a vane and rough cup inner diameter 28 mm outer diameter 30 mm length 42 mm and a water bath to control temperature before rheological measurement samples were also pre sheared at 20 c and 1000 s 1 for 10 min followed by 1 min equilibrium the flow curves were measured for sludge at different concentrations by applying a decreasing stress ramp corresponding to the shear rate of 1000 10 s 1 the same procedure was repeated at various temperatures ranging between 20 and 80 c note sludge was covered with a thin layer of insoluble oil as well as a lead to prevent evaporation during the tests at higher temperatures so that the dry solid content of sludge remained unchanged farno et al 2014 a master flow curve was created by shifting all sludge flow curves towards the flow curve of 3 5 sludge at 20 c farno et al 2014 see fig 1 the master curve data were used in all model fitting since the master flow curve includes a wider range of shear stress shear rates data master flow curve assumes that all flow curves regardless of temperature and concentration can be fitted with herschel bulkley model at a fixed power index therefore the conclusion which will be made using the master curve data is a generalised conclusion for the range of measurement temperatures 20 80 c and concentrations 3 5 8 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 5687803 2 2 pressure drop calculation in this study critical pressure drop was calculated for a typical pipeline of sludge with 300 m length and 10 cm diameter critical pressure drop was only chosen here for the sake of comparing different models eqs 1 3 and estimation techniques ordinary least squares robust fitting note once the critical pressure is known in a pipe line system it is of interest to operate sludge pipe line above this critical pressure drop to be sure operating in the turbulent regime to prevent sludge settling farno et al 2017 slatter and wasp 2000 in this study the default robust method of matlab which gives weighting based on bisquare function was used as follows 15 w d 1 1 d 2 2 where w is a vector containing weights and d is 16 d r e s i d u a l e r r o r s t u n i n g f a c t o r s 1 h 2 where by default tuning factor is 4 68 tuning factor estimates the parameters that are approximately 95 as statistically efficient as the ordinary least squares estimates h is the vector of leverage values from a least squares fit each h i is ith diagonal term of hat matrix and s is 17 s m a d 0 675 where mad is the median absolute deviation of the residuals from their median which scales the residuals during the iterations mathworks 2016 hat matrix is calculated using jacobean matrix j as follows 18 h j j t j 1 j t for calculation of critical pressure drop a calculation procedure involved with trial and error was developed in matlab as annulus velocity is required for determination of the flow regime with eq 12 a trial and error was employed to identify the flow regime and corresponding critical pressure drop through eqs 5 9 the procedure starts with a guess of τ w 2 5τ y and calculating corresponding velocity in laminar regime via eqs 5 9 then re 3 is calculated via eq 12 τ w gradually increases τ w i 1 τ w i 0 05 i is step number until its corresponding re 3 reaches to 2100 τ w at the re 3 of 2100 is used to calculate the critical pressure drop via eq 4 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 5708431 as mentioned eq 9 derived from modified hb does not have an analytical solution therefore a numerical solution in matlab was employed for the first time to solve it https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 5687923 the solution procedure includes solving eq 9 for dv dr with nonlinear least squares function and discretization of dv dr with backward finite difference starting with v 0 at pipe wall i e no slip condition re 3 was extended for modified hb based on the original definition of re i e the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces as follows

models was calculated using generic populations of the model parameters the generic populations were random numbers which were generated in the 95 confidence region of model parameters the random numbers were generated based on a multivariate normal distribution which was made by covariance matrix and estimated model parameters from the model fittings the sensitivity analysis was done to determine the influence of input parameters on model predictions he 2014 fourier amplitude sensitivity analysis was adopted from the work of cannavó 2012 and it was modified for this application cannavó s global sensitivity analysis toolbox includes several sensitivity analysis methods fourier amplitude sensitivity analysis has been adopted here due to its low computation time and its successful application to several non linear models see cannavó 2012 for further information 3 results and discussion 3 1 residual error analysis to check the parameter estimation accuracy the distribution of residuals error was plotted against shear rate fig 2 shows the variation of residuals error with shear rate data for bp hb and modified hb models fitted to experimental data as can be seen in fig 2a the residual errors calculated from fitting of bp model to sludge flow curve depict obvious sign of autocorrelation no randomness there are two shear rates in which the residual errors are zero the shear rates of 30 and 700 s 1 fig 2a suggests bp is not a comprehensive model for fitting sludge flow curve one may drop low shear rate and high shear rate data and fit bp model to data within the range of 30 700 s 1 to reduce the residual errors in addition since the residual errors of bp are neither homoscedastic nor normally distributed eq 13 and 14 are not proper objective functions for this fitting fig 2b shows the residual errors from fitting hb model are equally distributed around zero between the shear rates of 5 300 s 1 also there is only a minor deviation from equal distribution between 300 and 1000 s 1 however there are significant under estimations of shear stress beyond the shear rates of 1000 s 1 residual errors 0 corresponds to under estimations of shear stress or over estimation of shear rate also there is little over estimation of shear stress at very low shear rate below 10 s 1 the errors at low stresses may be associated with the over estimation of yield stress with hb equation baudez and coussot 2001 fig 2c shows modified version of hb well fits the experimental data at the widest shear stress range as can be seen the residual errors in fig 3 c are random and equally distributed from the lowest measured shear rate up to 1000 s 1 but between 1000 and 1500 s 1 mhb predicts the flow curve with minor errors overall bp is not an adequate model to fit sludge flow curve whereas hb and modified hb can fit the sludge flow curve in the shear rate of 5 1000 s 1 and 0 1 1500 s 1 respectively fig 3a c shows the evolution of residual errors by robust fitting method in fig 3a and b the residual errors show less deviation from zero at very low shear rates below 5 s 1 however for the rest of graph both figs 2 and 3 shows similar trend of the variation of residual errors with shear rates interestingly there is almost no difference between fig 2c ordinary least squares fitting and fig 3c robust fitting one can conclude that the robust fitting improved fitness of bp and hb model for the experimental data at low shear rates 3 2 parameter estimation the model parameters are used for calculating the pressure drop with eqs 4 12 therefore the variations of estimated model parameters impact on the variation of calculated pressure drop naturally the confidence level of the measurements increases with the number of measurement repeats but there are always random errors in the measurements of sludge rheology the question is how many repeats are required to achieve enough confidence for the finally calculated pressure drop fig 4 a c compares the 95 confidence interval of estimated model parameters τh or τb with k between one repeat and one hundred repeats of flow curve measurements each composed of thirty measurement points also fig 4 compares the 95 confidence interval of estimated model parameters between different models a bp b hb and c modified hb fig 4 shows the 95 confidence region for τh vs k and τb vs k became significantly smaller for all three models when more data was used for estimating the model parameters fig 4a has the highest area fig 4b has the medium area and fig 4c has the lowest area although fig 4c has the smallest area it has the widest range of variation in yield stress particularly when one dataset is used see τ h variation between 8 and 17 pa whereas yield stress varies 22 25 pa and 15 5 17 5 pa for bp and hb models respectively similarly the range of variation of k is at highest for modified hb model the huge variation of modified hb model parameters for one dataset implies that the addition of fourth parameters to classical hb model induces big uncertainty over estimated model parameters but as can be seen in fig 4c where a large number of datasets were considered for regression the 95 confidence region reduced to a very small area suggesting very certain results therefore one should fit experimental data by modified hb model where only many datasets are available 3 3 confidence in calculation of pressure drop the probability density function of critical pressure drops distribution in the pipeline is shown in fig 5 as can be seen the calculated critical pressure drops exhibited the lowest standard deviation σ for hb model this means hb resulted in less variation of calculated pressure drop whereas bp model see fig 5a shows markedly high standard deviation hb model shows the standard deviation of 190 pa which is slightly lower than modified hb with 657 pa also the mean value of calculated critical pressure μ using bp hb and modified hb models are 278 248 and 224 kpa respectively fig 6 shows the evolution of σ with the number of data set test repeat at different solid concentration and temperatures which was fitted by bp hb and mhb models the more data the less σ more certain value calculated for critical pressure drop fig 6 shows how many repeats may be required to obtain a certain margin of error in the calculated pressure drop also fig 6 compares σ of critical pressure drop between ordinary nonlinear least squares fitting and robust fitting for different models as seen in fig 6 applying robust fitting did not reduce the σ of critical pressure drop for bp model whereas applying robust method reduced σ of critical pressure drop for hb and mhb models overall the standard deviation of the distribution of the critical pressure drop σ was at lowest value where hb model fitted to experimental data with robust method table 1 presents sensitivity analysis of the pressure drop calculation procedure in respect to variation of bp hb and mhb model parameters the calculated pressure drops were mostly correlated to the variation of k for all three models variation of yield stress was less influential on the calculated pressure drop value when hb and mhb model was used to fit experimental flow curve data α had a weak influence on the calculation of pressure drop and it can be removed therefore mhb can be assumed as over parameterised model when the objective is pressure drop calculation in sludge pipeline however as fewer errors were observed at high shear rate for mhb it is of benefit to use mhb model only when limited data in high shear rate range is available 4 conclusion the following conclusions are made for calculation of pressure drop in sludge pipeline 1 bingham plastic model best fitted sludge flow curve data between 30 and 700 s 1 with ordinary least squares method the residuals analysis indicated that least squares method is not an appropriate method for fitting bingham plastic model to sludge flow curve 2 herschel bulkley model best fitted sludge flow curve data between 10 and 300 s 1 with robust fitting method 3 modified herschel bulkley best fitted sludge flow curve data between 0 1 and 1000 s 1 with either of ordinary least squares or robust fitting methods 4 the calculated pressure drops show the lowest variation with respect to the variation of experimental data when herschel bulkley fit the experimental data by robust method 5 the calculated pressure drop was highly sensitive to the variation of k resulted from the variation of experimental data 6 addition of the fourth fitting parameter α to herschel bulkley model increased the probability of error in calculated pressure drop α weakly correlated to the calculated pressure drop therefore modified herschel bulkley was considered as over parameterised model for calculating pressure drop however as modified herschel bulkley best predicted experimental data at very low and high shear rates therefore it should be used particularly where limited data at very low or very high shear rates is available acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of

pipe wall for newtonian fluids chhabra and richardson 2011 slatter 2008 slatter 2008 proposed a logarithmic velocity distribution for turbulent flow of non newtonian fluids as follows 10 v v 2 5 ln r ε b 3 75 where v τ y ρ 1 2 ρ kg m3 is fluid density ε is pipe roughness and b is classic roughness function in slatter 2008 approach b varies with rough wall reynolds number defined as follows 11 r e r 8 ρ v 2 τ y k 8 v 2 ε for concentrated sludge slatter 2008 showed b equals to 8 5 at re r 3 32 rough wall turbulent flow and b equals to 2 5 ln re r 5 5 at re r 3 32 therefore the flow regime needs to be identified to know which equation either eqs 6 9 or eq 10 is applied in flow of newtonian fluids in pipe the flow regime changes from laminar to turbulent regime at the reynolds number of 2100 based on the original definition of reynolds number slatter 1995 formulated re 3 eq 12 for fluids that obey hb and bp models reynolds number defined as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces is used to identify the flow regime in re 3 approach the transition of regime from laminar to turbulence also occurs at 2100 12 r e 3 8 ρ v a n n τ y k 8 v a n n d s h e a r n where v ann m s and d shear m are velocity and diameter in the sheared area of pipe annulus velocity respectively re 3 approach has been widely tested and used for sludge slatter 2003 slatter and wasp 2000 generally estimation of model parameters is a minimization problem in which an objective function is defined and minimised at a value that is in the centre of samples the solution depends on the choice of the objective function e g eq 13 and 14 as well as model structure i e linear such as bp or nonlinear such as hb or modified hb and solver dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 where a linear model such as bp is dealt the model parameters are usually estimated analytically by differentiating the objective function with respect to the model parameters however in the case of nonlinear models such as hb or modified hb a numerical approach that searches the parameter space systematically has to be used for example non linear curve fitting of matlab by default employs trust region algorithm to adjust the model parameters and determine whether the fit improves mathworks 2016 some minimization methods use linearization technique to reduce the complexity of parameters estimation for model like hb or mhb but this method can lead to biased parameter estimation the basic assumption is that the measured variables are independent and identically distributed normally but such reparameterisation linearizing the model can violate this assumption dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 the most used objective function today is the sum of squared errors 13 j θ i 1 n y i y ˆ i θ 2 where y i are the measurements ŷ i θ are the model predictions for a given parameter set θ and n is the total number of measurement points the parameters which yield the least value of j θ are selected as model parameters ordinary least squares fitting formulation however eq 13 should be used where the standard deviations of the measurements are constant and the residual errors the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest are normally distributed if standard deviation is different in each data point a general form of eq 13 called the maximum likelihood objective function can be used 14 j θ i 1 n 1 σ i 2 y i y ˆ i θ 2 where σ i is the standard deviation of the measurements y i eq 14 does not require constant standard deviations at all measurement points as a condition but it still takes the assumption that the measurement errors are normally distributed when standard deviations of the measurements are not available then eq 14 can be transferred to weighted least squares function in which instead of 1 σ i 2 weights are added based on engineering judgment robinson 1985 sometimes the weight in eq 14 can be assigned proportional to the measured value y i due to more reliable measurement at high shear rates however this may not be always a right judgement as it does not consider impacts of rheometer limits as well as probability of slippage vortex and turbulence flow but often the residual errors are not necessarily normally distributed this problem may occur particularly where bp or hb models are used as shear rate increases the residual errors increase for hb and bp models to tackle this issue one solution is to give weighting to residual errors this is possible where repeats of measurements are available which due to sludge variant nature may not be the case it is important to be noted that an incorrect weighting derives biased results the other resolution is to cut the data with high residual errors for example if the highest measureable shear rate for sludge is 1000 s 1 one may abandon the data collected beyond an even smaller shear rate of 500 s 1 but to make a decision from where data needs to be cut is not easy for an inexperienced rheologist to avoid subjective judgments robust estimation method can be used where the residual errors are not normally distributed in a robust estimation the data which do not belong to the distribution type of the majority of data outliers are removed or weighted lower than others as a result in robust method outlier data do not impact on the estimation of model parameters as well as confidence regions note apart from removing outliers the robust method may use the same ordinary least squares fitting to find the model parameter a decision on whether parameter estimation is good or bad can be made through residual analysis if a model and selected regression methods are suitable the residuals should hold similar characteristics such as randomness homoscedasticity homogeneity of variance normal distribution with the measurements dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 as discussed above selection of model and regression methods may cause some errors in estimation of model parameters in fact no perfect algorithm exists for estimating nonlinear model parameters in addition sludge rheological data contains random errors which then add more errors to those of model selection and regression method the variation of estimated model parameters related to the variation of data assuming the model and the regression method are correct can be estimated via calculation of 95 confidence region 95 confidence region is a multi dimensional region in which true model parameter with a probability of 95 is located dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 regardless of the source of errors the pressure drop calculated for sludge pipeline cannot be useful as long as the certainty of the estimated value is not known the questions raised here is how these variations impact on the final value calculated for the pressure drop and how much is the variation of the final value in this study model parameters are not estimated as unique numbers but as variable numbers in 95 confidence region this study predicts the probability distribution of pressure drop calculation in typical sludge pipe line when the model parameters vary in the 95 confidence region different parameter estimation scenarios including selection of rheological model from eq 1 or 2 or 3 and robust or non robust fitting techniques are compared together in terms of the range of variation standard deviation created in the calculation of pressure drop for a typical sludge pipe line also sensitivity analysis is employed to identify which model parameters are mostly correlated with the output i e pressure drop calculation for sludge pipeline hamby 1994 2 materials and methods 2 1 rheological characterisation waste activated sludge was sampled at initial solid concentration of 3 5 weight by weight from one of the melbourne wastewater treatment plants periodically over a one year period sludge was concentrated to 5 6 7 and 8 using buchner funnel vacuum filtration process sludge was stored in sealed containers in a fridge 4 c for at least one month and they were homogenized to room temperature before any rheological measurement rheological measurements were performed using a stress controlled rheometer hr3 ta instruments equipped with a vane and rough cup inner diameter 28 mm outer diameter 30 mm length 42 mm and a water bath to control temperature before rheological measurement samples were also pre sheared at 20 c and 1000 s 1 for 10 min followed by 1 min equilibrium the flow curves were measured for sludge at different concentrations by applying a decreasing stress ramp corresponding to the shear rate of 1000 10 s 1 the same procedure was repeated at various temperatures ranging between 20 and 80 c note sludge was covered with a thin layer of insoluble oil as well as a lead to prevent evaporation during the tests at higher temperatures so that the dry solid content of sludge remained unchanged farno et al 2014 a master flow curve was created by shifting all sludge flow curves towards the flow curve of 3 5 sludge at 20 c farno et al 2014 see fig 1 the master curve data were used in all model fitting since the master flow curve includes a wider range of shear stress shear rates data master flow curve assumes that all flow curves regardless of temperature and concentration can be fitted with herschel bulkley model at a fixed power index therefore the conclusion which will be made using the master curve data is a generalised conclusion for the range of measurement temperatures 20 80 c and concentrations 3 5 8 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 5687803 2 2 pressure drop calculation in this study critical pressure drop was calculated for a typical pipeline of sludge with 300 m length and 10 cm diameter critical pressure drop was only chosen here for the sake of comparing different models eqs 1 3 and estimation techniques ordinary least squares robust fitting note once the critical pressure is known in a pipe line system it is of interest to operate sludge pipe line above this critical pressure drop to be sure operating in the turbulent regime to prevent sludge settling farno et al 2017 slatter and wasp 2000 in this study the default robust method of matlab which gives weighting based on bisquare function was used as follows 15 w d 1 1 d 2 2 where w is a vector containing weights and d is 16 d r e s i d u a l e r r o r s t u n i n g f a c t o r s 1 h 2 where by default tuning factor is 4 68 tuning factor estimates the parameters that are approximately 95 as statistically efficient as the ordinary least squares estimates h is the vector of leverage values from a least squares fit each h i is ith diagonal term of hat matrix and s is 17 s m a d 0 675 where mad is the median absolute deviation of the residuals from their median which scales the residuals during the iterations mathworks 2016 hat matrix is calculated using jacobean matrix j as follows 18 h j j t j 1 j t for calculation of critical pressure drop a calculation procedure involved with trial and error was developed in matlab as annulus velocity is required for determination of the flow regime with eq 12 a trial and error was employed to identify the flow regime and corresponding critical pressure drop through eqs 5 9 the procedure starts with a guess of τ w 2 5τ y and calculating corresponding velocity in laminar regime via eqs 5 9 then re 3 is calculated via eq 12 τ w gradually increases τ w i 1 τ w i 0 05 i is step number until its corresponding re 3 reaches to 2100 τ w at the re 3 of 2100 is used to calculate the critical pressure drop via eq 4 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 5708431 as mentioned eq 9 derived from modified hb does not have an analytical solution therefore a numerical solution in matlab was employed for the first time to solve it https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 5687923 the solution procedure includes solving eq 9 for dv dr with nonlinear least squares function and discretization of dv dr with backward finite difference starting with v 0 at pipe wall i e no slip condition re 3 was extended for modified hb based on the original definition of re i e the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces as follows

models was calculated using generic populations of the model parameters the generic populations were random numbers which were generated in the 95 confidence region of model parameters the random numbers were generated based on a multivariate normal distribution which was made by covariance matrix and estimated model parameters from the model fittings the sensitivity analysis was done to determine the influence of input parameters on model predictions he 2014 fourier amplitude sensitivity analysis was adopted from the work of cannavó 2012 and it was modified for this application cannavó s global sensitivity analysis toolbox includes several sensitivity analysis methods fourier amplitude sensitivity analysis has been adopted here due to its low computation time and its successful application to several non linear models see cannavó 2012 for further information 3 results and discussion 3 1 residual error analysis to check the parameter estimation accuracy the distribution of residuals error was plotted against shear rate fig 2 shows the variation of residuals error with shear rate data for bp hb and modified hb models fitted to experimental data as can be seen in fig 2a the residual errors calculated from fitting of bp model to sludge flow curve depict obvious sign of autocorrelation no randomness there are two shear rates in which the residual errors are zero the shear rates of 30 and 700 s 1 fig 2a suggests bp is not a comprehensive model for fitting sludge flow curve one may drop low shear rate and high shear rate data and fit bp model to data within the range of 30 700 s 1 to reduce the residual errors in addition since the residual errors of bp are neither homoscedastic nor normally distributed eq 13 and 14 are not proper objective functions for this fitting fig 2b shows the residual errors from fitting hb model are equally distributed around zero between the shear rates of 5 300 s 1 also there is only a minor deviation from equal distribution between 300 and 1000 s 1 however there are significant under estimations of shear stress beyond the shear rates of 1000 s 1 residual errors 0 corresponds to under estimations of shear stress or over estimation of shear rate also there is little over estimation of shear stress at very low shear rate below 10 s 1 the errors at low stresses may be associated with the over estimation of yield stress with hb equation baudez and coussot 2001 fig 2c shows modified version of hb well fits the experimental data at the widest shear stress range as can be seen the residual errors in fig 3 c are random and equally distributed from the lowest measured shear rate up to 1000 s 1 but between 1000 and 1500 s 1 mhb predicts the flow curve with minor errors overall bp is not an adequate model to fit sludge flow curve whereas hb and modified hb can fit the sludge flow curve in the shear rate of 5 1000 s 1 and 0 1 1500 s 1 respectively fig 3a c shows the evolution of residual errors by robust fitting method in fig 3a and b the residual errors show less deviation from zero at very low shear rates below 5 s 1 however for the rest of graph both figs 2 and 3 shows similar trend of the variation of residual errors with shear rates interestingly there is almost no difference between fig 2c ordinary least squares fitting and fig 3c robust fitting one can conclude that the robust fitting improved fitness of bp and hb model for the experimental data at low shear rates 3 2 parameter estimation the model parameters are used for calculating the pressure drop with eqs 4 12 therefore the variations of estimated model parameters impact on the variation of calculated pressure drop naturally the confidence level of the measurements increases with the number of measurement repeats but there are always random errors in the measurements of sludge rheology the question is how many repeats are required to achieve enough confidence for the finally calculated pressure drop fig 4 a c compares the 95 confidence interval of estimated model parameters τh or τb with k between one repeat and one hundred repeats of flow curve measurements each composed of thirty measurement points also fig 4 compares the 95 confidence interval of estimated model parameters between different models a bp b hb and c modified hb fig 4 shows the 95 confidence region for τh vs k and τb vs k became significantly smaller for all three models when more data was used for estimating the model parameters fig 4a has the highest area fig 4b has the medium area and fig 4c has the lowest area although fig 4c has the smallest area it has the widest range of variation in yield stress particularly when one dataset is used see τ h variation between 8 and 17 pa whereas yield stress varies 22 25 pa and 15 5 17 5 pa for bp and hb models respectively similarly the range of variation of k is at highest for modified hb model the huge variation of modified hb model parameters for one dataset implies that the addition of fourth parameters to classical hb model induces big uncertainty over estimated model parameters but as can be seen in fig 4c where a large number of datasets were considered for regression the 95 confidence region reduced to a very small area suggesting very certain results therefore one should fit experimental data by modified hb model where only many datasets are available 3 3 confidence in calculation of pressure drop the probability density function of critical pressure drops distribution in the pipeline is shown in fig 5 as can be seen the calculated critical pressure drops exhibited the lowest standard deviation σ for hb model this means hb resulted in less variation of calculated pressure drop whereas bp model see fig 5a shows markedly high standard deviation hb model shows the standard deviation of 190 pa which is slightly lower than modified hb with 657 pa also the mean value of calculated critical pressure μ using bp hb and modified hb models are 278 248 and 224 kpa respectively fig 6 shows the evolution of σ with the number of data set test repeat at different solid concentration and temperatures which was fitted by bp hb and mhb models the more data the less σ more certain value calculated for critical pressure drop fig 6 shows how many repeats may be required to obtain a certain margin of error in the calculated pressure drop also fig 6 compares σ of critical pressure drop between ordinary nonlinear least squares fitting and robust fitting for different models as seen in fig 6 applying robust fitting did not reduce the σ of critical pressure drop for bp model whereas applying robust method reduced σ of critical pressure drop for hb and mhb models overall the standard deviation of the distribution of the critical pressure drop σ was at lowest value where hb model fitted to experimental data with robust method table 1 presents sensitivity analysis of the pressure drop calculation procedure in respect to variation of bp hb and mhb model parameters the calculated pressure drops were mostly correlated to the variation of k for all three models variation of yield stress was less influential on the calculated pressure drop value when hb and mhb model was used to fit experimental flow curve data α had a weak influence on the calculation of pressure drop and it can be removed therefore mhb can be assumed as over parameterised model when the objective is pressure drop calculation in sludge pipeline however as fewer errors were observed at high shear rate for mhb it is of benefit to use mhb model only when limited data in high shear rate range is available 4 conclusion the following conclusions are made for calculation of pressure drop in sludge pipeline 1 bingham plastic model best fitted sludge flow curve data between 30 and 700 s 1 with ordinary least squares method the residuals analysis indicated that least squares method is not an appropriate method for fitting bingham plastic model to sludge flow curve 2 herschel bulkley model best fitted sludge flow curve data between 10 and 300 s 1 with robust fitting method 3 modified herschel bulkley best fitted sludge flow curve data between 0 1 and 1000 s 1 with either of ordinary least squares or robust fitting methods 4 the calculated pressure drops show the lowest variation with respect to the variation of experimental data when herschel bulkley fit the experimental data by robust method 5 the calculated pressure drop was highly sensitive to the variation of k resulted from the variation of experimental data 6 addition of the fourth fitting parameter α to herschel bulkley model increased the probability of error in calculated pressure drop α weakly correlated to the calculated pressure drop therefore modified herschel bulkley was considered as over parameterised model for calculating pressure drop however as modified herschel bulkley best predicted experimental data at very low and high shear rates therefore it should be used particularly where limited data at very low or very high shear rates is available acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of

19616,thin film composite tfc membranes are the gold standard for the application of forward osmosis fo in seawater desalination and wastewater treatment however bidirectional mass transport phenomena in this process still hinder its wider application a deeper understanding of ion transport behavior in various solution conditions is critical for the fabrication of fo membrane and future development of fo process in this work we systematically investigated the influences of solution chemistry on ion mass transport in tfc fo membranes our results suggested that the mass transports of cations were much larger than those of anions in fo processes and monovalent cations with smaller hydrated radius could induce greater cation exchange than divalent cations though anions did not participate in the cation exchange processes directly cations paired with nitrate could transport through the tfc membrane more readily than those paired with chloride or sulfate additionally a set of experiments with series solution concentrations confirmed the existence of cation transport bottleneck for one tfc fo membrane we found that the cation transport capacity of tfc membranes was mainly determined by the concentration of feed solution and the generation of cation exchange behavior was independent of water transport engineering implications of our findings for fo application were also discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis cation exchange solute species solution concentration thin film composite membrane 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is an emerging membrane technology which has attracted increasing research attention and industrial interests in the past decade elimelech and phillip 2011 shaffer et al 2015 differing from the conventional pressure driven membrane processes e g reverse osmosis ro fo utilizes the osmotic pressure in driving water permeation from feed solution to draw solution this difference in driving force enables fo with several advantages in terms of energy saving and fouling reversibility compared with the pressure driven membrane process specifically when using the novel thermolytic solution of ammonia carbon dioxide as a draw solution logan and elimelech 2012 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 2008 fo could leverage low grade heat as a partial source of energy thereby decreasing energy input shaffer et al 2015 zhao et al 2012b additionally due to the lack of hydraulic pressure the foulant layer formed on the fo membrane is much less compact which could be easily removed through periodic rinses thereby imparting fo process with high fouling recovery lee et al 2010 mi and elimelech 2008 2010 therefore fo holds substantial promise in treating feed waters with high salinity and fouling potential hoover et al 2011 shaffer et al 2013 towards the goal of zero liquid discharge or valuable resource recovery tong and elimelech 2016 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a similar to the pressure driven membrane processes thin film composite tfc membranes which comprise a polyamide salt rejecting active layer on top of a polysulfone support lu et al 2015b are still the gold standard for fo applications werber et al 2016 owing to their higher water permeability and salt rejection compared to those of the cellulose triacetate membranes table s1 wang et al 2016 yip et al 2010 the success in the fabrication of the tfc fo membranes facilitated the real engineering application of fo process wang et al 2010 yip et al 2010 which has been recently demonstrated in effective treating and recycling of the produced water from shale gas production and industrial wastewaters from coal fired power plants hickenbottom et al 2013 hopwood 2014 lutchmiah et al 2014 mcginnis et al 2013 despite the current successes and promises of the tfc membranes in fo applications there is still a need for a deeper understanding of the mass transport mechanisms to achieve better desalination performance through material design and process optimization in fo the generation of water permeation is associated with the inevitable reserve solute transport which is theoretically driven by the concentration gradient from the concentrated draw solution to the diluted feed solution cath et al 2006 suh and lee 2013 however recent efforts in this area have demonstrated a notable ion exchange mechanism in tfc fo membranes arena et al 2015a 2015b 2014 coday et al 2013 lu et al 2014 which differs significantly from the well established solution diffusion mechanism in conventional pressure driven ro process hancock and cath 2009 wang et al 2014 specifically the tfc membranes exhibited significantly enhanced cation diffusions when monovalent cations are present in both draw and feed solutions this phenomenon is primarily ascribed to the ionization of carboxyl groups which renders the negative charge on the surface of the polyamide active layer arena et al 2015a lu et al 2014 the cations in one side tend to adsorb to the negative surface and transport through the polyamide layer while exchange with the cations adsorbed on the other side the polyamide layer to maintain the electroneutrality which is analogous to that in the ion exchange membrane nasef and hegazy 2004 similar to the reverse solute flux cation exchange transport is also detrimental to fo process due to loss of draw solutes jin et al 2011 acceleration of water flux decline by fouling boo et al 2012 lu et al 2015a she et al 2012 xie et al 2015 and deteriorate the quality of product water xie et al 2012 additionally these detriments would be remarkably aggravated by the severe cation exchange flux which is normally several times higher than the typical reverse solute flux governed by the solution diffusion mechanism arena et al 2014 lu et al 2014 therefore substantial efforts have been devoted to the control of the cation exchange flux for example a previous study developed a strategy by grafting ethylenediamine to the carboxyl groups thus imparting the surface with less negative charge lu et al 2014 which in turn effectively inhibiting the exchange of cations the other strategy involved adjusting solution ph below the pk a of carboxyl group 5 2 arena et al 2014 coronell et al 2008 lu et al 2014 thereby protonating the carboxyl groups to achieve a neutral surface which also impedes the occurrence of cation exchange behavior chen et al 2017 the above studies suggest a critical role of the carboxyl group in determining the cation exchange phenomenon with tuning membrane surface charge having received particular attention these results could potentially facilitate the fabrication of high performance tfc fo membranes however when applying fo process in treating real wastewaters the relative importance of solution chemistry particularly solute composition and concentration on the cation exchange behavior of tfc membranes has not been systematically evaluated in term of composition although previous studies indicated that ion exchange would take place with the presence of monovalent cations on both sides of the membrane e g nh4 na or k na arena et al 2015a lu et al 2014 the exact roles of other ionic species including anions and divalent cations have not been well documented additionally when considering the solution concentration for example high salinity produced water from the marcellus shale in pennsylvania which is the largest shale gas reservoir with over a decade of drilling activities varied significantly in concentration of total dissolved solids tds from 8000 to 360000 mg l 1 shaffer et al 2013 besides the shale gas produced water the abundant brackish water could also be classified with tds ranging from 1000 to 15000 mg l 1 alghoul et al 2009 such remarkable fluctuation in feed water quality may substantially influence ion transport behavior in tfc membranes thereby eventually impairing the system adaptability of fo process therefore it is important to systematically investigate the possible role of solution chemistry in ion exchange behavior in order to provide mechanistic insight and guidance for further optimization in fo process design in this paper we systematically investigate the influence of solution chemistry composition and concentration on the ion transport in tfc fo membrane which has practical significance for fo application specifically we first compare the diffusion rate of ions using different ion pairs in both tertiary and quaternary systems then we evaluate the role of solution concentration including both draw and feed solutions on cation exchange behavior and compare the operation modes on ion diffusion last diffusion test is conducted to investigate the effect of water flux on cation mass transport our results indicate that solution chemistry does play a significant role in cation exchange behavior in tfc fo membrane these findings not only enable a deeper understanding of ion transport mechanism in tfc membrane but also provide empirical evidence for the better design of fo process in engineered applications 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane and solution chemistry a commercial tfc fo membrane was obtained from oasys water oasys water inc boston ma the membrane was fabricated through interfacial polymerization and the membrane surface has carboxyl group generated from hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride groups tiraferri and elimelech 2012 the carboxyl group density was 21 0 0 9 nm 2 which was quantified in a previous study using a dye staining assay lu et al 2014 zeta potential and membrane morphologies were provided in fig s1 and fig s2 respectively before use tfc membranes were immersed in 25 isopropanol for 30 min followed by thorough rinsing with de ionized di water and subsequently stocked in di water overnight to investigate the influences of solution chemistry on mass transfer in tfc fo membrane we adjusted solute species by using different types of salts in both feed and draw solutions a ternary electrolyte experiment was conducted to estimate the effect of cation size in fo process kcl mgcl2 or cacl2 was separately used as the feed solute while nacl or cacl2 was used as draw solute besides the influence of cations the effect of anion type was also investigated by using nacl nano3 or na2so4 as draw solute when investigating the role of solution concentration a range of draw solutions from 0 5 to 2 m and feed solutions from 1 to 500 mm were used to eliminate the cation exchange inhibition behavior from divalent cations monovalent salts nacl and kno3 were used as the solutes in the section where concentration influence was investigated all solutes used were strong acid or base electrolytes and ph values for the samples were in the range of 6 8 tables s2 and s3 so the influence of ph on cation exchange in tfc membranes was negligible in this study unless otherwise specified di water and acs grade salts were used in all the experiments 2 2 forward osmosis setup and experimental procedures experiments were conducted with a lab scale crossflow apparatus described previously lu et al 2014 the channels on both sides of the membrane were 77 mm in length 26 mm in width and 3 mm in height samplings proceeded at 0 and 30 min after the water flux was stable the initial volumes of draw solution and feed solution were both 1 l the mass transport of ions in tfc membrane was investigated under two operational modes 1 fo mode the active layer of membrane facing feed solution was proceeded to study the ionic transport behavior in various solution conditions concentration and composition 2 pressure retarded osmosis pro the active layer of membrane facing draw solution mode was used to evaluate the role of membrane orientation to make our data more reliable we performed prescreening experiments to test the tfc membrane properties for each coupon using pure water flux as feed solution and 1 m nacl as draw solution in these experiments we used conductivity meter ddsj 308a shanghai rex instrument factory to measure the concentration of nacl in the feed solution and subsequently calculate the reverse salt flux after that only the coupons with similar transport properties will be used for further experiments all the experiments were controlled at 25 0 0 5 c and the cross flow velocity was 10 68 cm s 1 2 3 measurement of bidirectional ion flux and specific ion flux inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 5300 perkin elmer fremont ca and ion chromatography ic ics 3000 dionex sunnyvale ca were applied to quantify the concentration of cations and anions in solutions respectively the detection limits of icp oes and ic were 10 μg l 1 and 0 5 μmol l 1 respectively for samples obtained from 0 5 m or 1 m draw solution ten times dilution were needed before icp oes and ic measurements to maintain the accuracy samples obtained from draw solution with higher concentration were diluted accordingly the relative standard deviation rsd for the results obtained from icp oes and ic was less than 2 the water flux j w was calculated by dividing the increased volume of draw solution by membrane area 20 02 cm2 and time intervals 1 min the forward and reverse ion fluxes j s were calculated by measuring the ion concentration in draw solution and feed solution respectively 1 c v 0 j w a m t j s a m t where c is the ion concentration of feed ion in draw solution or draw ion in feed solution after 30 min v 0 is the initial volume of feed solution for reverse solute flux or draw solution for forward solute flux j w is the average water flux a m is the membrane area and t is the time interval note that for the reverse solute flux there is a decrease of feed solution volume minus was used in equation 1 while for the forward solute flux there is an increase of draw solution volume plus was used in equation 1 to quantitatively evaluate the ion bidirectional transport specific ion flux j specific the ratio of j s and j w was calculated to assess the ion selectivity of membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 cation exchange behavior in ternary system to confirm the great influence of negative charge on the solute fluxes of tfc membranes ternary experiments using salts with various cations and same anion i e chloride were conducted an obvious mass transfer occurred when monovalent cations were on both sides of tfc membrane kcl nacl panel fig 1 and this intense ion exchange between na and k was comparable to the existing literature j na 1 57 1 79 mol m 2 h 1 j k 1 69 1 79 mol m 2 h 1 arena et al 2015a the reverse solute flux of na and the forward solute flux of k were nearly equal value in our study to maintain electrical neutrality on both feed and draw solutions divalent cations like ca2 and mg2 possess higher positive valences in the solutions implying higher affinities towards the negative membrane surfaces however both ca2 and mg2 exhibited decreased ion exchange rates including both reverse flux and forward flux in particular after using feed solution with divalent cations i e ca2 or mg2 the reverse fluxes of monovalent cation na decreased by around 50 compared with that of kcl nacl panel simultaneously the forward ion fluxes of ca2 and mg2 were much lower than the k forward flux in kcl nacl panel j ca2 0 10 0 25 mol m 2 h 1 j mg2 0 06 0 08 mol m 2 h 1 additionally when using draw solution with divalent ca2 i e kcl cacl2 panel in fig 1 the forward diffusion of k also decreased around 50 0 72 0 85 mol m 2 h 1 compared to that using nacl as draw solution i e kcl nacl panel in fig 1 these phenomena could be attributed to the larger hydrated radius of divalent cation which significantly restrained the transport of ions in the membrane materials in particular ca2 and mg2 have hydration radiuses of 0 412 and 0 428 nm respectively which are larger than 0 331 nm for k table s4 nightingale 1959 the larger divalent ions would be more effectively rejected by the dense polyamide layer of tfc membrane thus greatly inhibiting the ion exchange phenomenon of na in the tertiary systems these suggests that when designing the draw solution it is favorable to select solutes with multi valent cations rather than monovalent cations which not only decrease the reverse transport of draw solute achilli et al 2010 holloway et al 2015 also inhibit the extent of cation exchange in tfc fo membrane interestingly besides the diffusion of na to neutralize the positive charge caused by divalent cation flux there were excess na ions transported across the membrane also note that the transfer of h or oh was negligible because the ph of solutions remained stable during the experiments table s2 we calculated the flux of h for each experiment and j h was three orders of magnitude smaller than j s table s2 which could verify that the transport of h was insignificant similar with the divalent cation ca2 or mg2 vs monovalent cation na system in our study the excess of reverse solute flux was also observed in the monovalent cation na vs monovalent cation k or nh4 system arena et al 2015a lu et al 2014 this result implied that excess na was transported by diffusion which is caused by the concentration gradient 3 2 effect of solution species on cation exchange as an important property of solution chemistry the effect of solute species on ion exchange in tfc fo membranes has not been systematically investigated in literature especially the influence of anions therefore we conducted a series of experiments using nacl nano3 or na2so4 as draw solution these draw solutes have the same cation i e na with three different anions cl no3 and so4 2 which isolate the influences of cations or anions and investigate their roles independently the results are plotted in fig 2 when using di water as the feed the reverse flux of na2so4 fig 2m j na 0 09 0 12 mol m 2 h 1 was less than those of nacl fig 2a and nano3 fig 2g j na 0 3 0 4 mol m 2 h 1 in this condition ion transport was determined by the solution diffusion mechanism therefore the larger hydrated radius of so4 2 exhibited a lower ion transfer rate than monovalent ions obvious cation exchange behaviors were observed among all three kinds of draw solutions when monovalent cation k was used in the feed solution j na larger than 2 mol m 2 h 1 whereas in nacl draw solution group both mg no3 2 fig 2e and mgso4 fig 2f in feed solutions reduced the reverse solute flux at a similar level j na 0 7 1 0 mol m 2 h 1 in relative to that using k feed solute panels b and c though no3 exhibited a larger anion flux than so4 2 these results suggested that divalent cations had a significant inhibiting influence on the reverse flux of na and anion species did not affect the inhibiting level the experiments of cacl2 nano3 fig 2k and mgso4 nano3 fig 2l illustrated the divalent cation inhibition mechanism as well and furthermore mg2 had a stronger inhibition effect than ca2 because of its larger hydration radius this phenomenon was also consistent with the data presented in fig 1 so far most of the research on developing draw solutions focused on reducing reverse solute flux and generating higher osmosis pressure but none of them has considered the cation exchange between feed and draw solutes for instance inorganic divalent anionic salts na2so4 or k2so4 achilli et al 2010 and novel sodium or potassium based polymeric draw solutions ge et al 2012 may exist potential cation exchange in desalination processes though the changes of anion species could not restrain the cation exchange behavior completely some extraordinary phenomena about forward and reverse fluxes of monovalent cations were observed when no3 existed in solutions compared with the experiments using kcl or k2so4 as the feed solutes a more intense cation exchange between k and na were observed when the feed solutes contained no3 in the group of kno3 nacl kno3 nano3 and kno3 na2so4 particularly the maximum cation fluxes were found in kno3 nano3 fig 2h j na 4 1 4 4 mol m 2 h 1 because there was no obvious difference of j k when using kcl or k2so4 as feed solutes particularly in na2so4 draw solution group fig 2n and 2p this ruled out the hydrated radius of anions as a possible mechanism for the exceptional high cation fluxes therefore only the presence of no3 in the feed solution could be attributed as a major cause for the mass transfer of no3 in fo irvine found a more readily diffusion behavior of no3 in a cta fo membrane irvine et al 2013 and hancock also discovered that the flux of no3 could not be predicted well hancock and cath 2009 however both of their observations were based on the cta fo membrane which has different chemistry from the tfc membrane used herein additionally the fluxes of no3 were comparable with those of cl in our study e g fig 2c which were significantly less than cations therefore it might be attributed to some other mechanisms we surmised that nitrate could form hydrogen bonding with the amine group of the polyamide layer no3 h2n thus enhancing the adsorption of nitrate ions on the membrane surface bisson et al 1997 wu et al 2016 the accumulation of no3 ions increases the negative charge on the surface thereby facilitating the cation exchange atr ftir spectra of pristine membrane and no3 soaked membrane was showed in fig s3 weak shifts around 3300 cm 1 occurred for the no3 soaked membranes which suggested some possible interactions between no3 and membrane functional groups thereby enhancing the transport no3 we will perform a more systematic investigation on this interesting transport behavior of nitrate in the future study 3 3 role of solution concentration in ion bidirectional diffusion solution concentration is an important property of solution chemistry most of the previous literature focused on investigating the role of draw solution concentration irvine et al 2013 while the role of feed solution concentration in ion exchange has not been well documented a series of quaternary experiments using nacl and kno3 as solutes were performed to give a combined observation fig 3 and fig 4 note that cation exchanges were the major transfer phenomenon in these experiments and there were little variations of anion fluxes 3 3 1 concentration of feed solution we first fixed the draw concentration of nacl at 0 5 m and increased the feed solution concentration of kno3 from 1 to 100 mm fig 3a interestingly both the fluxes of na and k increased linearly along with the increasing concentration of kno3 additionally we also calculated specific solute flux j specific a ratio of solute flux and water flux to exclude the influence of the support layer structural parameter as well as the concentration gradient between feed and draw solutions hancock and cath 2009 phillip et al 2010 as shown in fig 3b specific reverse solute fluxes of specific ions also exhibited a similar trend as the solute flux under our experimental conditions the reverse flux of na was nearly equal to the forward flux of k though δc na the concentration difference of na in the draw solution was much larger than δc k therefore the solution diffusion equation which is driven by concentration gradient could not accurately describe the reverse transport of na in cation exchange process in fact donnan effect is a major driving force to drive the cations in draw solution to permeate through the membrane and keep charge balance of the solutions these results suggested that the concentration of kno3 in the feed solution played a dominant role of cation exchange behavior in tfc fo membranes experiments using 1 m nacl draw solution showed a similar linear trend fig s4 further investigations were conducted below for seeking possible explanations some specific characteristics may lead k transport through the membrane more readily than na the hydrated radius of k is smaller than na 0 331 vs 0 358 nm nightingale 1959 and the diffusion rate of kcl is greater than nacl hancock et al 2011 if the k was a particular initiator to induce the ion exchange and na diffused subsequently to neutralize the solution charge the phenomenon mentioned above could be explained and the fluxes of cations were determined by the concentration of k to confirm this hypothesis we switched the solute species of draw and feed solutions fig 3c draw solutions were 0 5 m kno3 and feed solutions were nacl with the concentrations varied from 1 to 100 mm however the cation solute fluxes k and na still exhibited a linear increase with the increasing feed solution i e nacl concentration which is the same as we observed in fig 3a these results provided stronger evidence that the concentration of feed solution rather than the species of feed solution played a significant role in cation exchange 3 3 2 concentration of draw solution to further investigate the effect of feed solution concentration we further increased kno3 solution concentration from 500 to 2000 mm fig 3e and kept the nacl concentration at 0 5 m in this concentration range the solute fluxes of cations i e k and na remained quite stable without further increase which exhibited a quite different behavior from that of the lower feed solution concentration range i e kno3 1 100 mm fig 3a note that when the concentration of kno3 was higher than 500 mm which was equal to the concentration of nacl draw solution the kno3 solution was shifted from feed solution to draw solution and the direction of water flow will be reversed the variation of water flux with different kno3 concentrations was showed in fig s5 similar results could also be found in fig 3g where the increasing concentration of nacl draw solution would not affect the cation exchange rate significantly nathan et al defined the specific reverse solute flux to evaluate the selectivity of the membrane and j specific would be constant despite the draw solution concentration for cta membrane when using di water as the feed solution cath et al 2013 hancock and cath 2009 kong et al 2014 phillip et al 2010 however in our experiments when the feed solution concentration was fixed at 0 1 m kno3 the increment of j s showed a gradual slowdown fig 3g while the water flux increase with the increase of draw solution concentration therefore the j specific for cations decreased gradually with the increase of draw solution concentration fig 3h it should also be noticed that in all the experiments conducted in this section fig 3 the anions fluxes remained quite constant with the changes of feed or draw solution concentration which further ruled out the influence of anion in the current system taken together these results in fig 3 suggested that the concentration of feed solution rather than the species in solutions or the concentration of draw solution played the predominant role in bidirectional cation exchange behavior 3 3 3 impact of water transport in the view of the above investigations it is prone to raise another question does the water flux determine the cation exchange since it has the same transport direction with forward solute flux to investigate the role of water transport in the cation exchange we designed a diffusion test using 250 0 mm nacl and 254 7 mm kcl on the two sides of the tfc membrane respectively these two solutions had an equal osmotic pressure both at 11 32 atm calculated by oli software inc morris plains nj thus exhibiting no water flux during the test however the salt fluxes of na and k were 4 08 mol m 2 h 1 and 5 75 mol m 2 h 1 respectively indicating that the occurrence of cation exchange behavior was independent of water transport previous studies in fo demonstrated the correlation of water flux j w and reverse solute flux j s hancock and cath 2009 phillip et al 2010 namely a higher water flux results in a higher solute flux for the same membrane coupon in which the ratio between solute flux and water flux is constant as echoed by 2 j s j w b a 1 n r g t where a and b are water and salt permeabilities respectively n is the number of dissolved species created by the draw solute e g 2 for nacl r g is the ideal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature however the validity of this correlation is limited when the cation exchange takes place since we observe that even under equal osmotic pressure for both sides where the water flux is zero there was still a substantial quantity of cations exchanged in addition considering the deceleration of the increase rate of j k in fig 3g the effect of water flux on cation exchange was reduced gradually these results clearly indicate that the chemistry of membrane surface is the major cause to initiate cation exchange 3 3 4 non directional cation exchange in polyamide a set of experiments was also conducted in pro mode to investigate the interaction between the feed solution and the polyamide active layer of the tfc membrane nearly identical results with fo mode including the trend and numerical values of the cationic fluxes were observed in pro mode fig 4 it could be proposed that the cation exchange could happen on both sides of the polyamide surface and the water fluxes also showed a gradually reduced impact for their fluxes especially for the k at the range of high draw solution concentration whereas the gradually increased fluxes of cl and no3 j cl and j no3 in fig 4c suggested that the transport of anions were governed by the solution diffusion in the pro mode it is noteworthy that in both fo and pro modes the reverse cation fluxes were slightly lower than the forward cation fluxes which could be attributed to two possible explanations i the water flux direction was from feed solution to draw solution thus more salts diffused across the fo membrane from in the same direction as water diffusion ii there is the existence of diluted concentration polarization at the interface of the draw solution and polyamide active layer mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 4 conclusion as a unique behavior in fo process the reverse transport of draw solute could be enhanced by monovalent cations in the feed solution which was mainly attributed to the presence of carboxyl groups on tfc membrane surface we have demonstrated the significant impact of solution chemistry on cation exchange of tfc fo membranes both the reverse and forward monovalent cation fluxes were closely related to the concentration of feed solution we surmised that in tfc membranes the chemical natures of solutions including solute species and feed solution concentration played crucial roles in cation mass transport ion exchange was higher pronounced between two monovalent cations and it would be retarded when at least one of the monovalent cations was replaced by divalent cation because of its larger hydrated radius in terms of the other factors the concentration of monovalent cation in feed solution deserved more concern in process design the reverse fluxes of cations were related to the concentration of feed solution to maintain charge equilibrium in other words there was a bottleneck of cation mass transfer capacity for a tfc membrane and the quantities of cation fluxes were determined by feed solution concentration considering significant interests in applying fo process to treat water containing high concentration monovalent salts e g shale gas produced water brackish water or ro brine systematic evaluation and pretreatment of feed solution should be conducted to minimize the cation exchange effect thereby enhancing the system efficiency in salt removal to decrease or alleviate the cation exchange using salts with divalent cation as draw solute is an economical and practical alternative additionally fabrication of less negatively charged tfc membranes without sacrificing salt selectivity is also a promising alternative lu et al 2014 noting that in the real world applications the cation exchange of tfc membrane would be more sophisticated considering the potential influence of foulants on the surface charge of the membrane as well as the different interactions between fouled surfaces and charged ions therefore future investigations in the related fields are critical for extending and

19616,thin film composite tfc membranes are the gold standard for the application of forward osmosis fo in seawater desalination and wastewater treatment however bidirectional mass transport phenomena in this process still hinder its wider application a deeper understanding of ion transport behavior in various solution conditions is critical for the fabrication of fo membrane and future development of fo process in this work we systematically investigated the influences of solution chemistry on ion mass transport in tfc fo membranes our results suggested that the mass transports of cations were much larger than those of anions in fo processes and monovalent cations with smaller hydrated radius could induce greater cation exchange than divalent cations though anions did not participate in the cation exchange processes directly cations paired with nitrate could transport through the tfc membrane more readily than those paired with chloride or sulfate additionally a set of experiments with series solution concentrations confirmed the existence of cation transport bottleneck for one tfc fo membrane we found that the cation transport capacity of tfc membranes was mainly determined by the concentration of feed solution and the generation of cation exchange behavior was independent of water transport engineering implications of our findings for fo application were also discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords forward osmosis cation exchange solute species solution concentration thin film composite membrane 1 introduction forward osmosis fo is an emerging membrane technology which has attracted increasing research attention and industrial interests in the past decade elimelech and phillip 2011 shaffer et al 2015 differing from the conventional pressure driven membrane processes e g reverse osmosis ro fo utilizes the osmotic pressure in driving water permeation from feed solution to draw solution this difference in driving force enables fo with several advantages in terms of energy saving and fouling reversibility compared with the pressure driven membrane process specifically when using the novel thermolytic solution of ammonia carbon dioxide as a draw solution logan and elimelech 2012 mcginnis and elimelech 2007 2008 fo could leverage low grade heat as a partial source of energy thereby decreasing energy input shaffer et al 2015 zhao et al 2012b additionally due to the lack of hydraulic pressure the foulant layer formed on the fo membrane is much less compact which could be easily removed through periodic rinses thereby imparting fo process with high fouling recovery lee et al 2010 mi and elimelech 2008 2010 therefore fo holds substantial promise in treating feed waters with high salinity and fouling potential hoover et al 2011 shaffer et al 2013 towards the goal of zero liquid discharge or valuable resource recovery tong and elimelech 2016 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2012a similar to the pressure driven membrane processes thin film composite tfc membranes which comprise a polyamide salt rejecting active layer on top of a polysulfone support lu et al 2015b are still the gold standard for fo applications werber et al 2016 owing to their higher water permeability and salt rejection compared to those of the cellulose triacetate membranes table s1 wang et al 2016 yip et al 2010 the success in the fabrication of the tfc fo membranes facilitated the real engineering application of fo process wang et al 2010 yip et al 2010 which has been recently demonstrated in effective treating and recycling of the produced water from shale gas production and industrial wastewaters from coal fired power plants hickenbottom et al 2013 hopwood 2014 lutchmiah et al 2014 mcginnis et al 2013 despite the current successes and promises of the tfc membranes in fo applications there is still a need for a deeper understanding of the mass transport mechanisms to achieve better desalination performance through material design and process optimization in fo the generation of water permeation is associated with the inevitable reserve solute transport which is theoretically driven by the concentration gradient from the concentrated draw solution to the diluted feed solution cath et al 2006 suh and lee 2013 however recent efforts in this area have demonstrated a notable ion exchange mechanism in tfc fo membranes arena et al 2015a 2015b 2014 coday et al 2013 lu et al 2014 which differs significantly from the well established solution diffusion mechanism in conventional pressure driven ro process hancock and cath 2009 wang et al 2014 specifically the tfc membranes exhibited significantly enhanced cation diffusions when monovalent cations are present in both draw and feed solutions this phenomenon is primarily ascribed to the ionization of carboxyl groups which renders the negative charge on the surface of the polyamide active layer arena et al 2015a lu et al 2014 the cations in one side tend to adsorb to the negative surface and transport through the polyamide layer while exchange with the cations adsorbed on the other side the polyamide layer to maintain the electroneutrality which is analogous to that in the ion exchange membrane nasef and hegazy 2004 similar to the reverse solute flux cation exchange transport is also detrimental to fo process due to loss of draw solutes jin et al 2011 acceleration of water flux decline by fouling boo et al 2012 lu et al 2015a she et al 2012 xie et al 2015 and deteriorate the quality of product water xie et al 2012 additionally these detriments would be remarkably aggravated by the severe cation exchange flux which is normally several times higher than the typical reverse solute flux governed by the solution diffusion mechanism arena et al 2014 lu et al 2014 therefore substantial efforts have been devoted to the control of the cation exchange flux for example a previous study developed a strategy by grafting ethylenediamine to the carboxyl groups thus imparting the surface with less negative charge lu et al 2014 which in turn effectively inhibiting the exchange of cations the other strategy involved adjusting solution ph below the pk a of carboxyl group 5 2 arena et al 2014 coronell et al 2008 lu et al 2014 thereby protonating the carboxyl groups to achieve a neutral surface which also impedes the occurrence of cation exchange behavior chen et al 2017 the above studies suggest a critical role of the carboxyl group in determining the cation exchange phenomenon with tuning membrane surface charge having received particular attention these results could potentially facilitate the fabrication of high performance tfc fo membranes however when applying fo process in treating real wastewaters the relative importance of solution chemistry particularly solute composition and concentration on the cation exchange behavior of tfc membranes has not been systematically evaluated in term of composition although previous studies indicated that ion exchange would take place with the presence of monovalent cations on both sides of the membrane e g nh4 na or k na arena et al 2015a lu et al 2014 the exact roles of other ionic species including anions and divalent cations have not been well documented additionally when considering the solution concentration for example high salinity produced water from the marcellus shale in pennsylvania which is the largest shale gas reservoir with over a decade of drilling activities varied significantly in concentration of total dissolved solids tds from 8000 to 360000 mg l 1 shaffer et al 2013 besides the shale gas produced water the abundant brackish water could also be classified with tds ranging from 1000 to 15000 mg l 1 alghoul et al 2009 such remarkable fluctuation in feed water quality may substantially influence ion transport behavior in tfc membranes thereby eventually impairing the system adaptability of fo process therefore it is important to systematically investigate the possible role of solution chemistry in ion exchange behavior in order to provide mechanistic insight and guidance for further optimization in fo process design in this paper we systematically investigate the influence of solution chemistry composition and concentration on the ion transport in tfc fo membrane which has practical significance for fo application specifically we first compare the diffusion rate of ions using different ion pairs in both tertiary and quaternary systems then we evaluate the role of solution concentration including both draw and feed solutions on cation exchange behavior and compare the operation modes on ion diffusion last diffusion test is conducted to investigate the effect of water flux on cation mass transport our results indicate that solution chemistry does play a significant role in cation exchange behavior in tfc fo membrane these findings not only enable a deeper understanding of ion transport mechanism in tfc membrane but also provide empirical evidence for the better design of fo process in engineered applications 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane and solution chemistry a commercial tfc fo membrane was obtained from oasys water oasys water inc boston ma the membrane was fabricated through interfacial polymerization and the membrane surface has carboxyl group generated from hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride groups tiraferri and elimelech 2012 the carboxyl group density was 21 0 0 9 nm 2 which was quantified in a previous study using a dye staining assay lu et al 2014 zeta potential and membrane morphologies were provided in fig s1 and fig s2 respectively before use tfc membranes were immersed in 25 isopropanol for 30 min followed by thorough rinsing with de ionized di water and subsequently stocked in di water overnight to investigate the influences of solution chemistry on mass transfer in tfc fo membrane we adjusted solute species by using different types of salts in both feed and draw solutions a ternary electrolyte experiment was conducted to estimate the effect of cation size in fo process kcl mgcl2 or cacl2 was separately used as the feed solute while nacl or cacl2 was used as draw solute besides the influence of cations the effect of anion type was also investigated by using nacl nano3 or na2so4 as draw solute when investigating the role of solution concentration a range of draw solutions from 0 5 to 2 m and feed solutions from 1 to 500 mm were used to eliminate the cation exchange inhibition behavior from divalent cations monovalent salts nacl and kno3 were used as the solutes in the section where concentration influence was investigated all solutes used were strong acid or base electrolytes and ph values for the samples were in the range of 6 8 tables s2 and s3 so the influence of ph on cation exchange in tfc membranes was negligible in this study unless otherwise specified di water and acs grade salts were used in all the experiments 2 2 forward osmosis setup and experimental procedures experiments were conducted with a lab scale crossflow apparatus described previously lu et al 2014 the channels on both sides of the membrane were 77 mm in length 26 mm in width and 3 mm in height samplings proceeded at 0 and 30 min after the water flux was stable the initial volumes of draw solution and feed solution were both 1 l the mass transport of ions in tfc membrane was investigated under two operational modes 1 fo mode the active layer of membrane facing feed solution was proceeded to study the ionic transport behavior in various solution conditions concentration and composition 2 pressure retarded osmosis pro the active layer of membrane facing draw solution mode was used to evaluate the role of membrane orientation to make our data more reliable we performed prescreening experiments to test the tfc membrane properties for each coupon using pure water flux as feed solution and 1 m nacl as draw solution in these experiments we used conductivity meter ddsj 308a shanghai rex instrument factory to measure the concentration of nacl in the feed solution and subsequently calculate the reverse salt flux after that only the coupons with similar transport properties will be used for further experiments all the experiments were controlled at 25 0 0 5 c and the cross flow velocity was 10 68 cm s 1 2 3 measurement of bidirectional ion flux and specific ion flux inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 5300 perkin elmer fremont ca and ion chromatography ic ics 3000 dionex sunnyvale ca were applied to quantify the concentration of cations and anions in solutions respectively the detection limits of icp oes and ic were 10 μg l 1 and 0 5 μmol l 1 respectively for samples obtained from 0 5 m or 1 m draw solution ten times dilution were needed before icp oes and ic measurements to maintain the accuracy samples obtained from draw solution with higher concentration were diluted accordingly the relative standard deviation rsd for the results obtained from icp oes and ic was less than 2 the water flux j w was calculated by dividing the increased volume of draw solution by membrane area 20 02 cm2 and time intervals 1 min the forward and reverse ion fluxes j s were calculated by measuring the ion concentration in draw solution and feed solution respectively 1 c v 0 j w a m t j s a m t where c is the ion concentration of feed ion in draw solution or draw ion in feed solution after 30 min v 0 is the initial volume of feed solution for reverse solute flux or draw solution for forward solute flux j w is the average water flux a m is the membrane area and t is the time interval note that for the reverse solute flux there is a decrease of feed solution volume minus was used in equation 1 while for the forward solute flux there is an increase of draw solution volume plus was used in equation 1 to quantitatively evaluate the ion bidirectional transport specific ion flux j specific the ratio of j s and j w was calculated to assess the ion selectivity of membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 cation exchange behavior in ternary system to confirm the great influence of negative charge on the solute fluxes of tfc membranes ternary experiments using salts with various cations and same anion i e chloride were conducted an obvious mass transfer occurred when monovalent cations were on both sides of tfc membrane kcl nacl panel fig 1 and this intense ion exchange between na and k was comparable to the existing literature j na 1 57 1 79 mol m 2 h 1 j k 1 69 1 79 mol m 2 h 1 arena et al 2015a the reverse solute flux of na and the forward solute flux of k were nearly equal value in our study to maintain electrical neutrality on both feed and draw solutions divalent cations like ca2 and mg2 possess higher positive valences in the solutions implying higher affinities towards the negative membrane surfaces however both ca2 and mg2 exhibited decreased ion exchange rates including both reverse flux and forward flux in particular after using feed solution with divalent cations i e ca2 or mg2 the reverse fluxes of monovalent cation na decreased by around 50 compared with that of kcl nacl panel simultaneously the forward ion fluxes of ca2 and mg2 were much lower than the k forward flux in kcl nacl panel j ca2 0 10 0 25 mol m 2 h 1 j mg2 0 06 0 08 mol m 2 h 1 additionally when using draw solution with divalent ca2 i e kcl cacl2 panel in fig 1 the forward diffusion of k also decreased around 50 0 72 0 85 mol m 2 h 1 compared to that using nacl as draw solution i e kcl nacl panel in fig 1 these phenomena could be attributed to the larger hydrated radius of divalent cation which significantly restrained the transport of ions in the membrane materials in particular ca2 and mg2 have hydration radiuses of 0 412 and 0 428 nm respectively which are larger than 0 331 nm for k table s4 nightingale 1959 the larger divalent ions would be more effectively rejected by the dense polyamide layer of tfc membrane thus greatly inhibiting the ion exchange phenomenon of na in the tertiary systems these suggests that when designing the draw solution it is favorable to select solutes with multi valent cations rather than monovalent cations which not only decrease the reverse transport of draw solute achilli et al 2010 holloway et al 2015 also inhibit the extent of cation exchange in tfc fo membrane interestingly besides the diffusion of na to neutralize the positive charge caused by divalent cation flux there were excess na ions transported across the membrane also note that the transfer of h or oh was negligible because the ph of solutions remained stable during the experiments table s2 we calculated the flux of h for each experiment and j h was three orders of magnitude smaller than j s table s2 which could verify that the transport of h was insignificant similar with the divalent cation ca2 or mg2 vs monovalent cation na system in our study the excess of reverse solute flux was also observed in the monovalent cation na vs monovalent cation k or nh4 system arena et al 2015a lu et al 2014 this result implied that excess na was transported by diffusion which is caused by the concentration gradient 3 2 effect of solution species on cation exchange as an important property of solution chemistry the effect of solute species on ion exchange in tfc fo membranes has not been systematically investigated in literature especially the influence of anions therefore we conducted a series of experiments using nacl nano3 or na2so4 as draw solution these draw solutes have the same cation i e na with three different anions cl no3 and so4 2 which isolate the influences of cations or anions and investigate their roles independently the results are plotted in fig 2 when using di water as the feed the reverse flux of na2so4 fig 2m j na 0 09 0 12 mol m 2 h 1 was less than those of nacl fig 2a and nano3 fig 2g j na 0 3 0 4 mol m 2 h 1 in this condition ion transport was determined by the solution diffusion mechanism therefore the larger hydrated radius of so4 2 exhibited a lower ion transfer rate than monovalent ions obvious cation exchange behaviors were observed among all three kinds of draw solutions when monovalent cation k was used in the feed solution j na larger than 2 mol m 2 h 1 whereas in nacl draw solution group both mg no3 2 fig 2e and mgso4 fig 2f in feed solutions reduced the reverse solute flux at a similar level j na 0 7 1 0 mol m 2 h 1 in relative to that using k feed solute panels b and c though no3 exhibited a larger anion flux than so4 2 these results suggested that divalent cations had a significant inhibiting influence on the reverse flux of na and anion species did not affect the inhibiting level the experiments of cacl2 nano3 fig 2k and mgso4 nano3 fig 2l illustrated the divalent cation inhibition mechanism as well and furthermore mg2 had a stronger inhibition effect than ca2 because of its larger hydration radius this phenomenon was also consistent with the data presented in fig 1 so far most of the research on developing draw solutions focused on reducing reverse solute flux and generating higher osmosis pressure but none of them has considered the cation exchange between feed and draw solutes for instance inorganic divalent anionic salts na2so4 or k2so4 achilli et al 2010 and novel sodium or potassium based polymeric draw solutions ge et al 2012 may exist potential cation exchange in desalination processes though the changes of anion species could not restrain the cation exchange behavior completely some extraordinary phenomena about forward and reverse fluxes of monovalent cations were observed when no3 existed in solutions compared with the experiments using kcl or k2so4 as the feed solutes a more intense cation exchange between k and na were observed when the feed solutes contained no3 in the group of kno3 nacl kno3 nano3 and kno3 na2so4 particularly the maximum cation fluxes were found in kno3 nano3 fig 2h j na 4 1 4 4 mol m 2 h 1 because there was no obvious difference of j k when using kcl or k2so4 as feed solutes particularly in na2so4 draw solution group fig 2n and 2p this ruled out the hydrated radius of anions as a possible mechanism for the exceptional high cation fluxes therefore only the presence of no3 in the feed solution could be attributed as a major cause for the mass transfer of no3 in fo irvine found a more readily diffusion behavior of no3 in a cta fo membrane irvine et al 2013 and hancock also discovered that the flux of no3 could not be predicted well hancock and cath 2009 however both of their observations were based on the cta fo membrane which has different chemistry from the tfc membrane used herein additionally the fluxes of no3 were comparable with those of cl in our study e g fig 2c which were significantly less than cations therefore it might be attributed to some other mechanisms we surmised that nitrate could form hydrogen bonding with the amine group of the polyamide layer no3 h2n thus enhancing the adsorption of nitrate ions on the membrane surface bisson et al 1997 wu et al 2016 the accumulation of no3 ions increases the negative charge on the surface thereby facilitating the cation exchange atr ftir spectra of pristine membrane and no3 soaked membrane was showed in fig s3 weak shifts around 3300 cm 1 occurred for the no3 soaked membranes which suggested some possible interactions between no3 and membrane functional groups thereby enhancing the transport no3 we will perform a more systematic investigation on this interesting transport behavior of nitrate in the future study 3 3 role of solution concentration in ion bidirectional diffusion solution concentration is an important property of solution chemistry most of the previous literature focused on investigating the role of draw solution concentration irvine et al 2013 while the role of feed solution concentration in ion exchange has not been well documented a series of quaternary experiments using nacl and kno3 as solutes were performed to give a combined observation fig 3 and fig 4 note that cation exchanges were the major transfer phenomenon in these experiments and there were little variations of anion fluxes 3 3 1 concentration of feed solution we first fixed the draw concentration of nacl at 0 5 m and increased the feed solution concentration of kno3 from 1 to 100 mm fig 3a interestingly both the fluxes of na and k increased linearly along with the increasing concentration of kno3 additionally we also calculated specific solute flux j specific a ratio of solute flux and water flux to exclude the influence of the support layer structural parameter as well as the concentration gradient between feed and draw solutions hancock and cath 2009 phillip et al 2010 as shown in fig 3b specific reverse solute fluxes of specific ions also exhibited a similar trend as the solute flux under our experimental conditions the reverse flux of na was nearly equal to the forward flux of k though δc na the concentration difference of na in the draw solution was much larger than δc k therefore the solution diffusion equation which is driven by concentration gradient could not accurately describe the reverse transport of na in cation exchange process in fact donnan effect is a major driving force to drive the cations in draw solution to permeate through the membrane and keep charge balance of the solutions these results suggested that the concentration of kno3 in the feed solution played a dominant role of cation exchange behavior in tfc fo membranes experiments using 1 m nacl draw solution showed a similar linear trend fig s4 further investigations were conducted below for seeking possible explanations some specific characteristics may lead k transport through the membrane more readily than na the hydrated radius of k is smaller than na 0 331 vs 0 358 nm nightingale 1959 and the diffusion rate of kcl is greater than nacl hancock et al 2011 if the k was a particular initiator to induce the ion exchange and na diffused subsequently to neutralize the solution charge the phenomenon mentioned above could be explained and the fluxes of cations were determined by the concentration of k to confirm this hypothesis we switched the solute species of draw and feed solutions fig 3c draw solutions were 0 5 m kno3 and feed solutions were nacl with the concentrations varied from 1 to 100 mm however the cation solute fluxes k and na still exhibited a linear increase with the increasing feed solution i e nacl concentration which is the same as we observed in fig 3a these results provided stronger evidence that the concentration of feed solution rather than the species of feed solution played a significant role in cation exchange 3 3 2 concentration of draw solution to further investigate the effect of feed solution concentration we further increased kno3 solution concentration from 500 to 2000 mm fig 3e and kept the nacl concentration at 0 5 m in this concentration range the solute fluxes of cations i e k and na remained quite stable without further increase which exhibited a quite different behavior from that of the lower feed solution concentration range i e kno3 1 100 mm fig 3a note that when the concentration of kno3 was higher than 500 mm which was equal to the concentration of nacl draw solution the kno3 solution was shifted from feed solution to draw solution and the direction of water flow will be reversed the variation of water flux with different kno3 concentrations was showed in fig s5 similar results could also be found in fig 3g where the increasing concentration of nacl draw solution would not affect the cation exchange rate significantly nathan et al defined the specific reverse solute flux to evaluate the selectivity of the membrane and j specific would be constant despite the draw solution concentration for cta membrane when using di water as the feed solution cath et al 2013 hancock and cath 2009 kong et al 2014 phillip et al 2010 however in our experiments when the feed solution concentration was fixed at 0 1 m kno3 the increment of j s showed a gradual slowdown fig 3g while the water flux increase with the increase of draw solution concentration therefore the j specific for cations decreased gradually with the increase of draw solution concentration fig 3h it should also be noticed that in all the experiments conducted in this section fig 3 the anions fluxes remained quite constant with the changes of feed or draw solution concentration which further ruled out the influence of anion in the current system taken together these results in fig 3 suggested that the concentration of feed solution rather than the species in solutions or the concentration of draw solution played the predominant role in bidirectional cation exchange behavior 3 3 3 impact of water transport in the view of the above investigations it is prone to raise another question does the water flux determine the cation exchange since it has the same transport direction with forward solute flux to investigate the role of water transport in the cation exchange we designed a diffusion test using 250 0 mm nacl and 254 7 mm kcl on the two sides of the tfc membrane respectively these two solutions had an equal osmotic pressure both at 11 32 atm calculated by oli software inc morris plains nj thus exhibiting no water flux during the test however the salt fluxes of na and k were 4 08 mol m 2 h 1 and 5 75 mol m 2 h 1 respectively indicating that the occurrence of cation exchange behavior was independent of water transport previous studies in fo demonstrated the correlation of water flux j w and reverse solute flux j s hancock and cath 2009 phillip et al 2010 namely a higher water flux results in a higher solute flux for the same membrane coupon in which the ratio between solute flux and water flux is constant as echoed by 2 j s j w b a 1 n r g t where a and b are water and salt permeabilities respectively n is the number of dissolved species created by the draw solute e g 2 for nacl r g is the ideal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature however the validity of this correlation is limited when the cation exchange takes place since we observe that even under equal osmotic pressure for both sides where the water flux is zero there was still a substantial quantity of cations exchanged in addition considering the deceleration of the increase rate of j k in fig 3g the effect of water flux on cation exchange was reduced gradually these results clearly indicate that the chemistry of membrane surface is the major cause to initiate cation exchange 3 3 4 non directional cation exchange in polyamide a set of experiments was also conducted in pro mode to investigate the interaction between the feed solution and the polyamide active layer of the tfc membrane nearly identical results with fo mode including the trend and numerical values of the cationic fluxes were observed in pro mode fig 4 it could be proposed that the cation exchange could happen on both sides of the polyamide surface and the water fluxes also showed a gradually reduced impact for their fluxes especially for the k at the range of high draw solution concentration whereas the gradually increased fluxes of cl and no3 j cl and j no3 in fig 4c suggested that the transport of anions were governed by the solution diffusion in the pro mode it is noteworthy that in both fo and pro modes the reverse cation fluxes were slightly lower than the forward cation fluxes which could be attributed to two possible explanations i the water flux direction was from feed solution to draw solution thus more salts diffused across the fo membrane from in the same direction as water diffusion ii there is the existence of diluted concentration polarization at the interface of the draw solution and polyamide active layer mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 4 conclusion as a unique behavior in fo process the reverse transport of draw solute could be enhanced by monovalent cations in the feed solution which was mainly attributed to the presence of carboxyl groups on tfc membrane surface we have demonstrated the significant impact of solution chemistry on cation exchange of tfc fo membranes both the reverse and forward monovalent cation fluxes were closely related to the concentration of feed solution we surmised that in tfc membranes the chemical natures of solutions including solute species and feed solution concentration played crucial roles in cation mass transport ion exchange was higher pronounced between two monovalent cations and it would be retarded when at least one of the monovalent cations was replaced by divalent cation because of its larger hydrated radius in terms of the other factors the concentration of monovalent cation in feed solution deserved more concern in process design the reverse fluxes of cations were related to the concentration of feed solution to maintain charge equilibrium in other words there was a bottleneck of cation mass transfer capacity for a tfc membrane and the quantities of cation fluxes were determined by feed solution concentration considering significant interests in applying fo process to treat water containing high concentration monovalent salts e g shale gas produced water brackish water or ro brine systematic evaluation and pretreatment of feed solution should be conducted to minimize the cation exchange effect thereby enhancing the system efficiency in salt removal to decrease or alleviate the cation exchange using salts with divalent cation as draw solute is an economical and practical alternative additionally fabrication of less negatively charged tfc membranes without sacrificing salt selectivity is also a promising alternative lu et al 2014 noting that in the real world applications the cation exchange of tfc membrane would be more sophisticated considering the potential influence of foulants on the surface charge of the membrane as well as the different interactions between fouled surfaces and charged ions therefore future investigations in the related fields are critical for extending and

19617,the widespread use of commercial silver nanoparticles ag nps inevitably results in their increased release into natural waters and subsequent deposition in sediments requiring the environmental impact of such deposition to be closely investigated hence the effects of ag nps polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp ag nps and sliver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps on denitrification induced gas production n2o and 15n n2 and denitrifying microbes in freshwater sediments were investigated slurry experiments 8 h combined with a 15no3 addition technique were performed to determine the gaseous production the abundance of relative functional genes nirk nirs and nosz and the composition of functional community were determined through rt pcr and high throughput sequencing respectively the obtained results showed that the toxicity of nps on denitrification depended on their type ag ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and concentration e g all 1 mg l nps exhibited no effects on denitrification whereas evident hormesis effect induced acceleration was observed in the case of ag conversely 10 mg l ag and ag nps significantly inhibited the release rates of n2o and n2 by decreasing the abundance of functional genes nirk and or nirs and the predominant bacteria paracoccus pvp ag and ag2s nps had no effects on n2 release rates and the composition of denitrifiers however inhibited the emission of n2o by reducing the abundance of nirk suggesting that normal denitrification induced n2 formation in sediments could still be sustained when the n2o production decrease lied within a certain range further the inhibiting ability of ag containing nps was caused by their intrinsic nanotoxicity to functional microbes rather than by the general toxicity of ag besides ag2s nps as a main detoxification form of agnps were revealed to be intrinsically nanotoxic to denitrifiers albeit showing the lowest inhibitory effect among the three tested nps thus this study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of ag containing nps on denitrification in sediments depends on their morphology and type implying that the stability and toxicity of ag containing nps should be considered with caution graphical abstract image 1 keywords ag nanoparticles denitrification toxicity isotope labeling sediment 1 introduction ag nanoparticles ag nps exhibit antimicrobial activity and are thus widely used as broad spectrum antimicrobial agents gottschalk et al 2009 keller et al 2013 liu et al 2010 however their increasing usage unavoidably leads to release into aquatic systems such as freshwater estuaries and seawater jiang et al 2017 keller et al 2013 through direct or indirect ways including commercial product use degradation discharge from wastewater treatment plants and rainfall induced washout from landfills and soil antizar ladislao et al 2015 thus posing potential risks to natural water bodies and impacting microbial ecosystems yang et al 2013 after a series of events such as aggregation dissolution complexation transformation and sedimentation ag nps are assumed to be mainly deposited in sediments ellis et al 2016 garner and keller 2014 praetorius et al 2012 it has been predicted that concentrations of ag nps were 0 1 900 μg kg in sediments and even up to mg kg in heavily polluted places blaser et al 2008 fabrega et al 2011 gottschalk et al 2009 2013 previous studies have shown that the bioavailability and toxicity of ag nps and the ag ions released from them is decreased by reactions with phosphate chloride or sulfide ions as well as by complexation with other common ligands in artificial water and freshwater fabrega et al 2009 garner and keller 2014 jacobson et al 2005 hence when ag nps are deposited in complex systems such as sediments np property and reactivity changes can affect the microbial processes and ecosystem functions therein beddow et al 2017 recently the potential impact of ag nps on sediment systems has been extensively explored with the main focus being on the whole community structure biomass and microbial activity bao et al 2016 bradford et al 2009 moore et al 2016 mühling et al 2009 however there has been no intensive research dealing with the potential impacts of ag np deposition on nutrient cycles and functional microbe communities in sediments denitrification is a stepwise reduction process utilizing no3 as an electron acceptor and reducing it to n2o and finally to n2 jahangir et al 2017 seitzinger 2008 with this multistep process mainly genetically controlled by narg napa nitrate reduction nirk nirs nitrite reduction norb nitric oxide reduction and nosz nitrous oxide reduction genes harter et al 2016 philippot et al 2007 and it plays an important role in n cycling significantly influencing the removal of bioavailable nitrogen from natural ecosystems seitzinger et al 2006 yao et al 2016 previous works have shown the importance of functional gene abundance to denitrification with the involved microorganisms being sensitive to ag nps xu et al 2014 durenkamp et al 2016 harter et al 2016 vandevoort and arai 2012 for example both chen et al 2014 and vandevoort and arai 2012 found that ag nps remarkably affect the functional communities of denitrifying microbes and change the dominant bacteria in activated sludge and soil at inhibitory concentrations of 0 5 and 100 mg l respectively these results also indicated that several factors such as physiochemical conditions of environment microbial community structure and concentration of nps determined the toxicity of ag nps colman et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge the effects of ag nps on denitrification and functional bacterial community structures in sediments have not been reported yet moreover although the antimicrobial activity of nps e g zno cu and ag in pure bacterial cultures natural water activated sludge and biofilms is ascribed to metal ion release lok et al 2007 sheng and liu 2011 xiu et al 2012 yuan et al 2015 it is still not clear whether this mechanism is valid in the case of complex sediments sheng and liu 2017 zhang et al 2016 additionally several studies have indicated that the blockage of full nitrate reduction to n2 significantly affects the emission of n2o an important denitrification intermediate giles et al 2017 harter et al 2016 n2o is a well known greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance with the global warming potential about 300 time than that of co2 usepa 2014 hence a better understanding of the inhibitory effect of ag nps on denitrification and the potential toxicity mechanisms would help to further elucidate the effects of these nanoparticles on n cycling in complex ecosystems previous studies have documented that the physicochemical and biological properties of ag nps are determined by their size shape coating and initial chemistry ellis et al 2016 xiu et al 2012 with the coating type e g polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp citrate tween 80 polyvinyl alcohol pva etc reported to exhibit a particularly large influence sigg and lindauer 2015 yang et al 2011 notably coatings can exert a stabilizing effect on ag nps and enhance their electrostatic or steric repulsive interactions angel et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 to decrease their toxicity however a number of investigations revealed that coatings only influence the initial stage of dissolution and inhibitory activity decrease with their effects becoming less pronounced in the long term angel et al 2013 besides the deposited ag nps could spontaneously convert into ag2s nps in anaerobic environments within short time and sulfidation was regarded as the major natural detoxification mechanism of ag nps due to the extremely low solubility of ag2s reinsch et al 2012 however resent researches found that the stability of ag2s nps is often overestimated particularly in intricate systems doolette et al 2015 stegemeier et al 2015 for example the dissolution of ag2s nps under visible light irradiation is enhanced in the presence of fe3 li et al 2015 and the stability of coated ag2s nps is significantly reduced by aqueous chlorine li et al 2017 moreover judy et al 2015 revealed that ag2s nps inhibit the growth of plants and the abundance of microbial communities in soil considering that denitrification often taken place in anaerobic environments and ag2s nps were the major form of ag nps in anaerobic sediments and soils hashimoto et al 2017 the potential effects of ag2s nps on denitrification should be investigated in greater detail particularly in the case of complex environments such as sediments in view of the above we herein evaluated the effects of different types of ag containing nps ag nps pvp ag nps and ag2s nps on denitrification in sediments and determined the origin of their toxicity to denitrifiers the main objectives of our study were to i investigate the effect of ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and ag on denitrification in sediments ii determine if nps influence the production of n2 and n2o iii clarify potential mechanisms of np induced denitrification inhibition in sediments by monitoring the expression of denitrification responsible genes nirk nirs and nosz and the composition of functional genes communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the samples were collected at the zhushan bay 31 3794 n 120 0249 e of the taihu lake fig 1 in may 2017 taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china and has become one of the most severely polluted lakes high amounts of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage have been discharged into zhushan bay leading to severe pollution such as heavy metal and organic contaminants and deterioration of water quality tao et al 2012 considering the rapid development of nanotechnology and the antimicrobial of ag nps more and more ag nps would be released into this areas and result in the potential ecological risk to the local aquatic environment the average depth of water was 1 8 m and

and have been listed in table s2 twenty five liters overlying water and 25 kg surface sediment samples 0 8 cm were sampled from zhushan bay within 1 km of the landmark in fig 1 using a poly methyl methacrylate water sampler uwitec austria and gravity corer rigo co japan respectively and brought back to the laboratory on ice as soon as possible yao et al 2016 prior to experiments the sediment was mixed to avoid heterogeneity and wet sieved 0 6 mm to remove large particles phytodetritus and zoobenthos the overlying water was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane miao et al 2017 experiments were commenced within 48 h after sampling all containers used for sampling were washed with 10 v hno3 for 24 h the contents of nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonia nh4 in overlying water and sediments were determined using a continuous flow auto analyzer skalar breda netherlands total organic carbon toc content was measured by a toc analyzer liqui tocii elementary germany trace metal levels in sediments table s4 were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700 usa using the digestion method ma et al 2010 with the concentration of ag 0 08 0 03 mg kg dry weight determined to be negligible for subsequent exposure experiments besides other physicochemical parameters such as sediment ph avs acid volatile sulfides the concentration of so4 2 and moisture were also determined and the obtained samples are presented in tables s2 and s3 more details methods were available in supplementary materials 2 2 np preparation and characterization the toxicity of three ag containing nps ag ag pvp and ag2s nps were investigated with ag np and pvp ag np powders purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and pvp coated ag2s nps referred to as simply ag2s nps synthesized as described by li et al 2016 briefly sulfur 7 1 mg was dissolved in ethanol 10 ml at 60 c and the obtained solution was dropwise added to a mixture of pvp 40 10 mg and aqueous agno3 50 ml 170 mg l in the dark after 5 h reaction at 95 c the aqueous solution was sonicated for 30 min to avoid agglomeration and obtain a uniform distribution of ag2s nps sadovnikov et al 2016 which were washed five times with sterile ultrapure deionized di water milli q millipore by 30 min centrifugation at 9384g li et al 2016 the obtained nanoparticles colloid solution was vacuum lyophilized to afford ag2s np powders for further experiments the average diameters of original ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were less than 100 nm fig s1 as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s4800 japan imaging the crystal structures of nps were determined by x ray diffraction xrd philips x pert mpd pro netherlands cu k α radiation 40 kv 100 ma with xrd patterns recorded for 2θ 20 80 confirming the identity and structure acanthite of ag2s nps fig s1 stock solutions 100 mg l of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were prepared by dispersing the corresponding powders in sterile di water upon 30 min sonication at 400 w miao et al 2017 the concentrations of released ag were evaluated by centrifuging stock solutions at 20 000 g for 30 min and analyzing the supernatants by icp ms with the fractions of ag released from ag pvp ag and ag2s nps being less than 0 80 0 14 and 0 10 respectively 2 3 np aggregation and dissolution 1 and10 mg l were selected in this study which may be significantly greater than model predictions however high concentration was often used to explore the possible toxicity mechanisms of nps and observations of no effect or minimal effects at high concentrations will also be applicable to low environmentally relevant concentrations fan et al 2017 moreover the incidental or accidental release of ag based nps to natural systems represents a potential risk the aggregation and dissolution of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were studied to better understand their behavior and toxicity mechanism in aqueous systems briefly filtered and deoxygenated water samples were placed into sediment free 20 ml gas tight brown vials and three np stock solutions were added to afford final np concentrations of 1 or 10 mg l then samples were placed in a rotary shaker 175 rpm 25 c being subsequently removed at certain time intervals 1 2 4 6 and 8 h for aggregation and dissolution analyses sigg and lindauer 2015 more details of this are given in the supplementary materials 2 4 exposure experiments the effects of different nps on denitrification in sediments were probed by slurry suspension methods featuring the addition of 15no3 hou et al 2014 risgaard petersen et al 2004 sieved and homogenized sediment samples were transferred into 20 ml gas tight brown vials suspended in overlying water collected from the sampling site no headspace sediment to water ratio 1 7 and deoxygenated using high purity he the vials were sealed with butyl rubber septa and al screw caps to avoid gas leakage and create an anaerobic environment prior to np and 15no3 addition all vials were pre incubated for 24 h at 25 c to remove residual oxygen a 200 mm stock solution of k15no3 55 15n shanghai research institute of chemical industry china was added to sample vials to afford a final concentration of 100 μm based on the background nitrate concentration in water fernandes et al 2016 hou et al 2014 with solutions of ag np pvp ag np ag2s np and agno3 simultaneously pulse injected to obtain concentrations of 0 control 1 and 10 mg l respectively except for 10 mg l agno3 all other samples were treated with 200 mm kno3 to achieve the nitrate concentration of the former sample solutions were purged with high purity he prior to the above addition and all operations were conducted in a glove box under n2 risgaard petersen et al 2004 six replicates were prepared for each group and incubated for 8 h upon shaking rotary shaker 175 rpm 25 c hou et al 2014 at the end of the experiment samples were spiked with 200 μl of 50 w zncl2 to inhibit the activity of denitrifying microbes and stop the incubation risgaard petersen et al 2004 after the exposure test half of the replicates were used to determine the concentrations of 29n2 and 30n2 with the other half used to monitor the production of n2o 29n2 and 30n2 were analyzed using membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden analytical uk with the lowest detectable concentration of n2 equaling 0 05 μm the above technique can be used for direct and operationally straightforward analysis of dissolved nitrogen gas 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 in water samples as has been shown by numerous studies yin et al 2014 the concentration of n2o during incubation was measured by carefully adding 5 ml of high purity he into each sample vial to replace the water phase and shaking the vials for 1 h to equilibrate n2o between gas and liquid phases subsequently the n2o concentration in the headspace was measured by gas chromatography gc agilent 7890 with the n2o detection limit equaling 0 1 ppb the release rates of n2 d 15 n 2 μmol15 n l 1 h 1 and n2o d n 2 o nmoln l 1 h 1 were calculated according to the concentrations of 15n n2 and n2o thamdrup and dalsgaard 2002 risgaard petersen et al 2004 yao et al 2016 as 1 d 29 c30 2 1 fn fn 1

yao et al 2016 see supplementary materials 2 5 quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr and illumina high throughput sequencing after incubation 0 5 g sediment samples were extracted from each vial snap frozen in liquid n2 and stored at 80 c until dna extraction giles et al 2017 the abundance of denitrifying functional genes coding nitrite reductase nirk nirs and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were quantified by q pcr tib 8600 canada the nirk nirs genes are the first step to catalyze the reduction of soluble nitrite to gaseous product and the nosz is unique in being the only known gene to catalyse the final step in denitrification these three genes have been shown to be more sensitive to hazardous substances hou et al 2014 gui et al 2017 hence nirk nirs and nosz genes were selected to explore the reasons for the effects of ag based nps and ag on denitrification in this study the primers of nirk nirs and nosz and rt pcr conditions were listed in table 1 the reaction mixtures used for rt pcr comprised 10 μl of aceq qpcr sybr green master mix 0 4 μl each of primers f and r 10 μm and 1 μl of template dna with the thermal conditions listed in table 1 standard curves were established using three primer amplified gene fragments with r 2 amplification efficiency values of 0 997 85 0 0 998 89 7 and 0 998 91 4 obtained for nirk nirs and nosz respectively besides high throughput sequencing was performed to explore the microbial community composition of nirs type nirk type and nosz type denitrifiers in the sediment and as a further supplement for pcr results illumina miseq high throughput sequencing was performed at magigene biotech co ltd guangzhou china the amplicons with sequences shorter than 200 bps and of low quality quality score 25 were removed miao et al 2018 then the normalized samples were individually classified and analyzed by the rdp ribosomal database project database http rdp cme msu edu the specific methods and data analysis are available in the supplementary materials 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical significance of changes was determined by one way analysis of variance anova with the tukey s multiple range test spss 17 0 the p values below 0 05 were considered statistically significant all tests were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as mean standard deviation and significant differences are indicated by different letters shown above the error bars he et al 2016 yan et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation and dissolution of nps in overlying water since the size of ag containing nps and the concentration of released ag are important factors determining np toxicity miao et al 2017 xiu et al 2012 yang et al 2013 np aggregation and dissolution tests were conducted prior to exposure experiments in general the hdds of 1 mg l nps were almost stable within 8 h whereas distinct aggregation was observed for 10 mg l nps fig s2 throughout the test the np hdds in the 10 mg l group decreased in the order of ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps revealing the enhanced stability of pvp coated nps the concentrations of dissolved ag in 1 and 10 mg l groups were stably low at all exposure times with the fractions of released ag being less than 1 in all cases table s5 and thus being insignificant for exposure experiments these low release fractions were ascribed to limited np dissolution under oxygen free conditions zhang et al 2016 3 2 effects of nps on the release of 15n n2 29n2 and 30n2 compared to the control sample 1 mg l np groups exhibited similar performances during short term exposure p 0 05 fig 2 these results were consistent with those obtained in previous studies which revealed that 1 mg l ag nps and pvp ag nps did not significantly affect the production of 29n2 and 30n2 in sediments and soil due to having a limited influence on microbial activity particularly in more complex environments bradford et al 2009 chen et al 2014 vandevoort and arai 2012 however yang et al 2013 found that low concentrations of ag nps 1 mg l inhibited the activity of pseudomonas stutzeri with this discrepancy in toxicity mainly attributed to the variable bioavailability of nps in different environmental media when released into sediments nps tend to interact with other common sediment components e g clay minerals fe and mn containing compounds and normal organic matter which decreases np bioavailability and thus toxicity jacobson et al 2005 vandevoort and arai 2012 however 1 mg l ag dramatically increased the 15n n2 production during the incubation time p 0 05 with being responsible of positive effects of low ag concentration due to hormesis effect hormesis refers to the stimulation of growth by low concentration of toxins and other stressors studies also confirmed that sublethal concentration of ag nps or ag enhanced the activity of bacterial possible by improving their fitness and hinder antimicrobial applications samarajeewa et al 2017 stegemeier et al 2015 notably 10 mg l ag nps and ag clearly inhibited the release of 15n n2 compared to the control test p 0 05 whereas 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps had no evident effects p 0 0 5 although some studies report smaller nps to be more toxic than larger ones ellis et al 2016 pvp ag nps and ag2s nps with sizes smaller than that of ag nps exhibited a less pronounced inhibitory effect on 15n n2 production the above behavior was ascribed to the pvp coating hindering np cell contact thus causing less nanotoxicity of coated nps than that of in uncoated huynh et al 2014 sheng and liu 2017 kwok et al 2016 confirmed that the toxicity of ag nps is heavily dependent on coating materials with pvp ag nps being less toxic than ag nps similar results were obtained by pang et al 2016 and miao et al 2017 who indicated that pvp ag nps do not significantly inhibit dna fragmentation and exhibit lesser toxicities for microbial respiration in sediments than uncoated ag nps however a few studies have also shown that high concentrations of pvp ag nps inhibit the microbial activity of functional organisms in pure strains and sequencing batch reactors cornelis et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the toxicity decrease of coated nps was demonstrated to depend on coating type microbial structure physiochemical environment and exposure time angel et al 2013 chen et al 2014 implying that further investigations are required to clarify this point 3 3 effects of nps on n2o release n2o is a denitrification intermediate exhibiting significant greenhouse gas activity whereas 1 mg l nps had no obvious p 0 05 influence on the production of n2o in sediments fig 3 its emission was significantly enhanced by 1 mg l ag and inhibited by 10 mg l ag p 0 05 in agreement with the trend observed for 15n n2 release the above behavior was because that 1 mg l ag increased microbial viability and activity due to the hormesis effects yang et al 2013 hormesis effects would stimulate cell growth metabolism and antibody produced due to the resistance of microbes jiao et al 2014 besides it was possible that some denitrifiers with more tolerance would be improved by impressing other sensitive bacteria unfortunately the origins of the above hormesis effect are still unclear and require further investigations xiu et al 2012 yang et al 2013 while the high concentrations 10 mg l of ag would lead to more absorbed ag into cells which resulted in its interaction with cell proteins and dna thus negatively affecting cellular processes and microbial activity and probably resulting in cell death huynh et al 2014 the amount of n2o produced decreased for all 10 mg l nps p 0 05 fig 3 implying that high concentration of nps and ag 10 mg l decrease the accumulation of n2o in sediments during 8 h furthermore 10 mg l ag nps or ag synchronously decreased the production of both n2o and 15n n2 thus being highly toxic to denitrifiers and inhibiting the reduction of nitrite or and nitrous oxide conversely 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps did not obviously affect the production of 15n n2 but significantly inhibited n2o release by 48 7 and 37 4 respectively these differences were ascribed to the dependence of denitrifier response to nps on their type with the inhibition mechanisms for each stepwise reduction not necessarily being the same in each case yang et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 as further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 response of denitrifiers to nps nitrite and n2o reduction are key denitrification steps hou et al 2014 several studies have demonstrated that nirk nirs and nosz have a major influence on rates of n2o and n2 production henry et al 2006 morales et al 2010 the obtained results revealed that nirk nirs and nosz exhibited abundances of 2 80 0 23 107 2 77 0 22 108 and 1 21 0 11 108 copies g 1 dry weight in the control group fig 4 in agreement with previous studies kim et al 2016 yin et al 2014 however different abundance orders were reported in other works harter et al 2014 probably reflecting environmental and microbial structure differences notably the copy numbers of the above genes in 1 mg l nps were not significantly different p 0 05 from those in the control group fig 4 which explained the absence of variance observed for the accumulation of n2o and 15n n2 figs 2 and 3 in contrast compared to those of the control the copy numbers of nirk nirs and nosz were increased by 23 25 and 17 in the presence of 1 mg l ag respectively due to these ions exerting a stimulatory effect and thus facilitating the whole denitrification process besides the abundance of nirk declined in all 10 mg l groups with copy number decreases of 41 35 22 and 47 observed for ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and ag respectively fig 4a with no significant differences detected for nirs in all 10 mg l groups p 0 05 fig 4b although both nirk and nirs genes control nitrite reduction they exhibited different responses to nps due to coding structurally different periplasmic enzymes i e cu or cytochrome c containing ones respectively kim et al 2016 usually nirk is more sensitive to toxicants such as heavy metals and nps miao et al 2015 and other substances such as glucose and citric acid giles et al 2017 than nirs with the biosynthetic pathways of various riboswitches controlling gene expression being influenced by these agents to different extents sullivan et al 2013 moreover 10 mg l ag pvp ag and ag2s nps did not affect the abundance of nosz in sediments p 0 05 whereas ag decreased the abundance of nosz at the same concentration p 0 05 fig 4c thus our results showed that the sensitivities of the three investigated functional genes to ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and ag in sediments were in the order of nirk nosz nirs one third of all denitrifiers containing nirs or nirk genes significantly contribute to n2o production harter et al 2014 philippot et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 demonstrated the abundance of nosz to be positively correlated with n2o emission which implies that the decreased n2o release rates in 10 mg l np groups were possibly due to the decreased abundance of nirk and no obvious change of that of nirs and nosz the obtained results illustrated that when exposed to ag pvp ag and ag2s nps for 8 h nirk exhibited a smaller tolerance but probably played a more important role than nirs in nitrite reduction in sediments moreover 10 mg l ag decreased the abundance of nosz and thus inhibited the reduction of n2o to n2 hence the decrease of both n2o and 15n n2 emission by 10 mg l ag was described to its detrimental effects on the abundances of nirk and nosz the above results also confirmed that denitrification was strongly correlated with the abundance of functional genes in sediments in the short term harter et al 2014 however compared to the 10 mg l ag group no significant change of nosz abundance was observed in the presence of ag nps at the same concentration whereas the release of both n2o and 15n n2 was inhibited in the latter case probably due to the decrease of nirk abundance dramatically inhibiting the emission of n2o 68 7 relative to the original emission although nosz was not affected by 10 mg l ag nps the extremely low amount of produced n2o significantly decreased the amount of n2o reduced to n2 thus 10 mg l ag nps inhibited the emission of n2o by decreasing the abundance of nirk and thus hindered the release of 15n n2 the reduction of n2o to n2 is the final step of denitrification being crucial for the production of n2 in sediments importantly 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps did not affect the production of 15n n2 but significantly decreased n2o release rates this n2o production decrease was less than that induced by ag nps with the corresponding inhibition order being ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps the obtained results allowed us to suggest that normal denitrification induced 15n n2 formation in sediments could still be sustained when the n2o production decrease lied within a certain range hence the n2o production decrease in pvp coated np groups was probably too small to affect the reduction of n2o to n2 in agreement with the low toxicity of coated nps kwok et al 2016 pang et al 2016 whereas 10 mg l ag nps dramatically decreased n2o emission and thus directly influenced the final denitrification step another possible explanation is the existence of alternative n2 release pathways in denitrification as supported by the reported coupling of denitrification with processes such as anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in n cycling bonaglia et al 2014 however the coupled process was not calculated in this study and further researches should pay attention to the effects of nps on other n cycling process including coupled denitrification 3 5 effects of nps on functional community structure after removing low quality sequences a total of 2611212 valid reads for control and five exposure samples 1 and 10 mg l ag 10 mg l ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were retrieved from the illumina miseq sequencing platform it should notable that all 1 mg l nps groups were not sequenced due to the unchanged gaseous production and functional genes abundance the index of simpson shannon and chao were also listed in tables s6 8 which indicated the diversity and richness were different in three functional communities in the order of nirs nosz nirk to further explore responses of dominant denitrifiers on nps exposed on the genus level the bacteria with a relative sequence abundance of at least 1 were listed in table 2 paracoccus was the most abundant bacteria in the nirk carrying microbial community in all six groups rang from 20 52 to 43 92 followed by chelativorans mesorhizobium neorhizobium and nitrosospira the major bacteria were the same in the nirs and nosz type denitrifiers including paracoccus pseudomonas thauera and cupriavidus in which paracoccus was also the predominant bacteria ranging from 14 76 to 25 44 and from 7 70 to 18 18 respectively the obtained sequencing results indicated that the compositions of three functional communities were not affected in short exposure time fig s3 and table 2 even in the high concentration of ag nps or ag however the relative abundance of dominant bacteria was altered at different extents specifically 1 mg l ag significantly improved the amount of paracoccus in both nirk and nosz type communities p 0 05 from 31 89 to 43 92 and 13 70 to 18 18 respectively due to the low dose hormesis effects while 10 mg l ag and nps decreased the abundance of paracoccus therefore it could be concluded that paracoccus containing nirk s and nosz genes was the predominant functional bacteria in the used sediment and played a key role in denitrification chen et al 2014 furthermore paracoccus was sensitive to ag based nps and ag in the sediment with possible being responsible of gaseous production changed while the other denitrifiers including chelativorans containing nirk mesorhizobium containing nirk pseudomonas containing nirs and nosz were more tolerant to ag based nps and ag after short term exposure 3 6 possible toxicity mechanisms of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps the origin of the antimicrobial activity of ag containing nps is still debatable particularly the question of whether toxicity is caused by ag release from nps or is particle specific beddow et al 2017 colman et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 herein we showed that 10 mg l ag pvp ag and ag2s nps inhibited denitrification and decreased the abundance of functional genes to different extents considering that 1 mg l ag exerted a positive influence on denitrifier activity the negligible release of ag in all np groups could not inhibit denitrification with the observed inhibitory effect attributed to their intrinsic nanotoxicity compared to the direct destruction of cells by ag the indirect particle specific toxicity of nps was mitigatory angel et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 with the detrimental effects of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps on the abundance of functional genes being smaller than those of ag at the same dosage e g 10 mg l ag decreased the abundance of both nirk and nosz whereas the three nps decreased only the abundance of nirk moreover the inhibitory effect of ag nps on gas production and functional genes was stronger than that of pvp ag and ag2s nps probably because the coating cap enhanced electrostatic or steric repulsion and thus increased np stability and weakened particle specific cell toxicity resulting in decreased antimicrobial activity angel et al 2013 besides although sulfuration is the natural mechanism of ag np detoxification ag2s nps exhibited a certain inhibitory effect on denitrification due to their toxicity even though the above effect was the lowest among the tested nps due to the extreme stability of ag2s nps for example judy et al 2015 demonstrated that 1 mg kg pvp ag nps influenced microbial communities in soil whereas the minimum inhibitory concentration of ag2s nps equaled 10 mg kg with similar results obtained by choi and hu 2009 and suresh et al 2011 thus it was concluded that the inhibitory effects of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps on denitrification were caused by their nanotoxicity with the inhibition order of ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps reflecting the decreased toxicity of sulfurated ag nps and the importance of np morphology for determining their toxicity 4 conclusions herein we demonstrated that the extent of denitrification inhibition depends on np type ag ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and is positively correlated with np concentration 1 mg l nps had no effect on denitrifiers and functional communities whereas 1 mg l ag promoted denitrification by increasing the abundance of nirs nirk and nosz genes and the predominant denitrifier paracoccus due to exerting stimulatory effects moreover at 10 mg l both ag nps and ag influenced the gas n2o and 15n n2 release rates and decreased the abundance of predominant bacteria paracoccus in sediments during 8 h with the corresponding inhibitory mechanisms being possibly different in that ag nps exhibited nanotoxicity rather than ionic toxicity besides ag nps inhibited emission of 15n n2 by dramatically decreasing the amount of n2o rather than directly inhibiting the abundance of nosz finally 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps did not affect the production of 15n n2 and the composition of denitrifiers but decreased n2o emission and the abundance of nirk featuring decreased cytotoxicity as a result of being coated by pvp thus our results provide evidence that ag containing nps can suppress denitrification and microbial communities in sediments with pvp ag and ag2s nps posing a decreased threat to denitrifiers further studies should deal with the long term effects of other ag containing nps on denitrification in sediments and other biogenic element cycles acknowledgments we are grateful for the grants from the projects supported by the creative research

19617,the widespread use of commercial silver nanoparticles ag nps inevitably results in their increased release into natural waters and subsequent deposition in sediments requiring the environmental impact of such deposition to be closely investigated hence the effects of ag nps polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp ag nps and sliver sulfide nanoparticles ag2s nps on denitrification induced gas production n2o and 15n n2 and denitrifying microbes in freshwater sediments were investigated slurry experiments 8 h combined with a 15no3 addition technique were performed to determine the gaseous production the abundance of relative functional genes nirk nirs and nosz and the composition of functional community were determined through rt pcr and high throughput sequencing respectively the obtained results showed that the toxicity of nps on denitrification depended on their type ag ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and concentration e g all 1 mg l nps exhibited no effects on denitrification whereas evident hormesis effect induced acceleration was observed in the case of ag conversely 10 mg l ag and ag nps significantly inhibited the release rates of n2o and n2 by decreasing the abundance of functional genes nirk and or nirs and the predominant bacteria paracoccus pvp ag and ag2s nps had no effects on n2 release rates and the composition of denitrifiers however inhibited the emission of n2o by reducing the abundance of nirk suggesting that normal denitrification induced n2 formation in sediments could still be sustained when the n2o production decrease lied within a certain range further the inhibiting ability of ag containing nps was caused by their intrinsic nanotoxicity to functional microbes rather than by the general toxicity of ag besides ag2s nps as a main detoxification form of agnps were revealed to be intrinsically nanotoxic to denitrifiers albeit showing the lowest inhibitory effect among the three tested nps thus this study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of ag containing nps on denitrification in sediments depends on their morphology and type implying that the stability and toxicity of ag containing nps should be considered with caution graphical abstract image 1 keywords ag nanoparticles denitrification toxicity isotope labeling sediment 1 introduction ag nanoparticles ag nps exhibit antimicrobial activity and are thus widely used as broad spectrum antimicrobial agents gottschalk et al 2009 keller et al 2013 liu et al 2010 however their increasing usage unavoidably leads to release into aquatic systems such as freshwater estuaries and seawater jiang et al 2017 keller et al 2013 through direct or indirect ways including commercial product use degradation discharge from wastewater treatment plants and rainfall induced washout from landfills and soil antizar ladislao et al 2015 thus posing potential risks to natural water bodies and impacting microbial ecosystems yang et al 2013 after a series of events such as aggregation dissolution complexation transformation and sedimentation ag nps are assumed to be mainly deposited in sediments ellis et al 2016 garner and keller 2014 praetorius et al 2012 it has been predicted that concentrations of ag nps were 0 1 900 μg kg in sediments and even up to mg kg in heavily polluted places blaser et al 2008 fabrega et al 2011 gottschalk et al 2009 2013 previous studies have shown that the bioavailability and toxicity of ag nps and the ag ions released from them is decreased by reactions with phosphate chloride or sulfide ions as well as by complexation with other common ligands in artificial water and freshwater fabrega et al 2009 garner and keller 2014 jacobson et al 2005 hence when ag nps are deposited in complex systems such as sediments np property and reactivity changes can affect the microbial processes and ecosystem functions therein beddow et al 2017 recently the potential impact of ag nps on sediment systems has been extensively explored with the main focus being on the whole community structure biomass and microbial activity bao et al 2016 bradford et al 2009 moore et al 2016 mühling et al 2009 however there has been no intensive research dealing with the potential impacts of ag np deposition on nutrient cycles and functional microbe communities in sediments denitrification is a stepwise reduction process utilizing no3 as an electron acceptor and reducing it to n2o and finally to n2 jahangir et al 2017 seitzinger 2008 with this multistep process mainly genetically controlled by narg napa nitrate reduction nirk nirs nitrite reduction norb nitric oxide reduction and nosz nitrous oxide reduction genes harter et al 2016 philippot et al 2007 and it plays an important role in n cycling significantly influencing the removal of bioavailable nitrogen from natural ecosystems seitzinger et al 2006 yao et al 2016 previous works have shown the importance of functional gene abundance to denitrification with the involved microorganisms being sensitive to ag nps xu et al 2014 durenkamp et al 2016 harter et al 2016 vandevoort and arai 2012 for example both chen et al 2014 and vandevoort and arai 2012 found that ag nps remarkably affect the functional communities of denitrifying microbes and change the dominant bacteria in activated sludge and soil at inhibitory concentrations of 0 5 and 100 mg l respectively these results also indicated that several factors such as physiochemical conditions of environment microbial community structure and concentration of nps determined the toxicity of ag nps colman et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge the effects of ag nps on denitrification and functional bacterial community structures in sediments have not been reported yet moreover although the antimicrobial activity of nps e g zno cu and ag in pure bacterial cultures natural water activated sludge and biofilms is ascribed to metal ion release lok et al 2007 sheng and liu 2011 xiu et al 2012 yuan et al 2015 it is still not clear whether this mechanism is valid in the case of complex sediments sheng and liu 2017 zhang et al 2016 additionally several studies have indicated that the blockage of full nitrate reduction to n2 significantly affects the emission of n2o an important denitrification intermediate giles et al 2017 harter et al 2016 n2o is a well known greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance with the global warming potential about 300 time than that of co2 usepa 2014 hence a better understanding of the inhibitory effect of ag nps on denitrification and the potential toxicity mechanisms would help to further elucidate the effects of these nanoparticles on n cycling in complex ecosystems previous studies have documented that the physicochemical and biological properties of ag nps are determined by their size shape coating and initial chemistry ellis et al 2016 xiu et al 2012 with the coating type e g polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp citrate tween 80 polyvinyl alcohol pva etc reported to exhibit a particularly large influence sigg and lindauer 2015 yang et al 2011 notably coatings can exert a stabilizing effect on ag nps and enhance their electrostatic or steric repulsive interactions angel et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 to decrease their toxicity however a number of investigations revealed that coatings only influence the initial stage of dissolution and inhibitory activity decrease with their effects becoming less pronounced in the long term angel et al 2013 besides the deposited ag nps could spontaneously convert into ag2s nps in anaerobic environments within short time and sulfidation was regarded as the major natural detoxification mechanism of ag nps due to the extremely low solubility of ag2s reinsch et al 2012 however resent researches found that the stability of ag2s nps is often overestimated particularly in intricate systems doolette et al 2015 stegemeier et al 2015 for example the dissolution of ag2s nps under visible light irradiation is enhanced in the presence of fe3 li et al 2015 and the stability of coated ag2s nps is significantly reduced by aqueous chlorine li et al 2017 moreover judy et al 2015 revealed that ag2s nps inhibit the growth of plants and the abundance of microbial communities in soil considering that denitrification often taken place in anaerobic environments and ag2s nps were the major form of ag nps in anaerobic sediments and soils hashimoto et al 2017 the potential effects of ag2s nps on denitrification should be investigated in greater detail particularly in the case of complex environments such as sediments in view of the above we herein evaluated the effects of different types of ag containing nps ag nps pvp ag nps and ag2s nps on denitrification in sediments and determined the origin of their toxicity to denitrifiers the main objectives of our study were to i investigate the effect of ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and ag on denitrification in sediments ii determine if nps influence the production of n2 and n2o iii clarify potential mechanisms of np induced denitrification inhibition in sediments by monitoring the expression of denitrification responsible genes nirk nirs and nosz and the composition of functional genes communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the samples were collected at the zhushan bay 31 3794 n 120 0249 e of the taihu lake fig 1 in may 2017 taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china and has become one of the most severely polluted lakes high amounts of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage have been discharged into zhushan bay leading to severe pollution such as heavy metal and organic contaminants and deterioration of water quality tao et al 2012 considering the rapid development of nanotechnology and the antimicrobial of ag nps more and more ag nps would be released into this areas and result in the potential ecological risk to the local aquatic environment the average depth of water was 1 8 m and

were also determined and the obtained samples are presented in tables s2 and s3 more details methods were available in supplementary materials 2 2 np preparation and characterization the toxicity of three ag containing nps ag ag pvp and ag2s nps were investigated with ag np and pvp ag np powders purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and pvp coated ag2s nps referred to as simply ag2s nps synthesized as described by li et al 2016 briefly sulfur 7 1 mg was dissolved in ethanol 10 ml at 60 c and the obtained solution was dropwise added to a mixture of pvp 40 10 mg and aqueous agno3 50 ml 170 mg l in the dark after 5 h reaction at 95 c the aqueous solution was sonicated for 30 min to avoid agglomeration and obtain a uniform distribution of ag2s nps sadovnikov et al 2016 which were washed five times with sterile ultrapure deionized di water milli q millipore by 30 min centrifugation at 9384g li et al 2016 the obtained nanoparticles colloid solution was vacuum lyophilized to afford ag2s np powders for further experiments the average diameters of original ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were less than 100 nm fig s1 as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s4800

the identity and structure acanthite of ag2s nps fig s1 stock solutions 100 mg l of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were prepared by dispersing the corresponding powders in sterile di water upon 30 min sonication at 400 w miao et al 2017 the concentrations of released ag were evaluated by centrifuging stock solutions at 20 000 g for 30 min and analyzing the supernatants by icp ms with the fractions of ag released from ag pvp ag and ag2s nps being less than 0 80 0 14 and 0 10 respectively 2 3 np aggregation and dissolution 1 and10 mg l were selected in this study which may be significantly greater than model predictions however high concentration was often used to explore the possible toxicity mechanisms of nps and observations of no effect or minimal effects at high concentrations will also be applicable to low environmentally relevant concentrations fan et al 2017 moreover the incidental or accidental release of ag based nps to natural systems represents a potential risk the aggregation and dissolution of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were studied to better understand their behavior and toxicity mechanism in aqueous systems briefly filtered and deoxygenated water samples were placed into sediment free 20 ml gas tight brown vials and three np stock solutions were added to afford final np concentrations of 1 or 10 mg l then samples were placed in a rotary shaker 175 rpm 25 c being subsequently removed at certain time intervals 1 2 4 6 and 8 h for aggregation and dissolution analyses sigg and lindauer 2015 more details of this are given in the supplementary materials 2 4 exposure experiments the effects of different nps on denitrification in sediments were probed by slurry suspension methods featuring the addition of 15no3 hou et al 2014 risgaard petersen et al 2004 sieved and homogenized sediment samples were transferred into 20 ml gas tight brown vials suspended in overlying water collected from the sampling site no headspace sediment to water ratio 1 7 and deoxygenated using high purity he the vials were sealed with butyl rubber septa and al screw caps to avoid gas leakage and create an anaerobic environment prior to np and 15no3 addition all vials were pre incubated for 24 h at 25 c to remove residual oxygen a 200 mm stock solution of k15no3 55 15n shanghai research institute of chemical industry china was added to sample vials to afford a final concentration of 100 μm based on the background nitrate concentration in water fernandes et al 2016 hou et al 2014 with solutions of ag np pvp ag np ag2s np and agno3 simultaneously pulse injected to obtain concentrations of 0 control 1 and 10 mg l respectively except for 10 mg l agno3 all other samples were treated with 200 mm kno3 to achieve the nitrate concentration of the former sample solutions were purged with high purity he prior to the above addition and all operations were conducted in a glove box under n2 risgaard petersen et al 2004 six replicates were prepared for each group and incubated for 8 h upon shaking rotary shaker 175 rpm 25 c hou et al 2014 at the end of the experiment samples were spiked with 200 μl of 50 w zncl2 to inhibit the activity of denitrifying microbes and stop the incubation risgaard petersen et al 2004 after the exposure test half of the replicates were used to determine the concentrations of 29n2 and 30n2 with the other half used to monitor the production of n2o 29n2 and 30n2 were analyzed using membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden analytical uk with the lowest detectable concentration of n2 equaling 0 05 μm the above technique can be used for direct and operationally straightforward analysis of dissolved nitrogen gas 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 in water samples as has been shown by numerous studies yin et al 2014 the concentration of n2o during incubation was measured by carefully adding 5 ml of high purity he into each sample vial to replace the water phase and shaking the vials for 1 h to equilibrate n2o between gas and liquid phases subsequently the n2o concentration in the headspace was measured by gas chromatography gc agilent 7890 with the n2o detection limit equaling 0 1 ppb the release rates of n2 d 15 n 2 μmol15 n l

from each vial snap frozen in liquid n2 and stored at 80 c until dna extraction giles et al 2017 the abundance of denitrifying functional genes coding nitrite reductase nirk nirs and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were quantified by q pcr tib 8600 canada the nirk nirs genes are the first step to catalyze the reduction of soluble nitrite to gaseous product and the nosz is unique in being the only known gene to catalyse the final step in denitrification these three genes have been shown to be more sensitive to hazardous substances hou et al 2014 gui et al 2017 hence nirk nirs and nosz genes were selected to explore the reasons for the effects of ag based nps and ag on denitrification in this study the primers of nirk nirs and nosz and rt pcr conditions were listed in table 1 the reaction mixtures used for rt pcr comprised 10 μl of aceq qpcr sybr green master mix 0 4 μl each of primers f and r 10 μm and 1 μl of template dna with the thermal conditions listed in table 1 standard curves were established using three primer amplified gene fragments with r 2 amplification efficiency values of 0 997 85 0 0 998 89 7 and 0 998 91 4 obtained for nirk nirs and nosz respectively besides high throughput sequencing was performed to explore the microbial community composition of nirs type nirk type and nosz type denitrifiers in the sediment and as a further supplement for pcr results illumina miseq high throughput sequencing was performed at magigene biotech co ltd guangzhou china the amplicons with sequences shorter than 200 bps and of low quality quality score 25 were removed miao et al 2018 then the normalized samples were individually classified and analyzed by the rdp ribosomal database project database http rdp cme msu edu the specific methods and data analysis are available in the supplementary materials 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical significance of changes was determined by one way analysis of variance anova with the tukey s multiple range test spss 17 0 the p values below 0 05 were considered statistically significant all tests were performed in triplicate and the results were reported as mean standard deviation and significant differences are indicated by different letters shown above the error bars he et al 2016 yan et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation and dissolution of nps in overlying water since the size of ag containing nps and the concentration of released ag are important factors determining np toxicity miao et al 2017 xiu et al 2012 yang et al 2013 np aggregation and dissolution tests were conducted prior to exposure experiments in general the hdds of 1 mg l nps were almost stable within 8 h whereas distinct aggregation was observed for 10 mg l nps fig s2 throughout the test the np hdds in the 10 mg l group decreased in the order of ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps revealing the enhanced stability of pvp coated nps the concentrations of dissolved ag in 1 and 10 mg l groups were stably low at all exposure times with the fractions of released ag being less than 1 in all cases table s5 and thus being insignificant for exposure experiments these low release fractions were ascribed to limited np dissolution under oxygen free conditions zhang et al 2016 3 2 effects of nps on the release of 15n n2 29n2 and 30n2 compared to the control sample 1 mg l np groups exhibited similar performances during short term exposure p 0 05 fig 2 these results were consistent with those obtained in previous studies which revealed that 1 mg l ag nps and pvp ag nps did not significantly affect the production of 29n2 and 30n2 in sediments and soil due to having a limited influence on microbial activity particularly in more complex environments bradford et al 2009 chen et al 2014 vandevoort and arai 2012 however yang et al 2013 found that low concentrations of ag nps 1 mg l inhibited the activity of pseudomonas stutzeri with this discrepancy in toxicity mainly attributed to the variable bioavailability of nps in different environmental media when released into sediments nps tend to interact with other common sediment components e g clay minerals fe and mn containing compounds and normal organic matter which decreases np bioavailability and thus toxicity jacobson et al 2005 vandevoort and arai 2012 however 1 mg l ag dramatically increased the 15n n2 production during the incubation time p 0 05 with being responsible of positive effects of low ag concentration due to hormesis effect hormesis refers to the stimulation of growth by low concentration of toxins and other stressors studies also confirmed that sublethal concentration of ag nps or ag enhanced the activity of bacterial possible by improving their fitness and hinder antimicrobial applications samarajeewa et al 2017 stegemeier et al 2015 notably 10 mg l ag nps and ag clearly inhibited the release of 15n n2 compared to the control test p 0 05 whereas 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps had no evident effects p 0 0 5 although some studies report smaller nps to be more toxic than larger ones ellis et al 2016 pvp ag nps and ag2s nps with sizes smaller than that of ag nps exhibited a less pronounced inhibitory effect on 15n n2 production the above behavior was ascribed to the pvp coating hindering np cell contact thus causing less nanotoxicity of coated nps than that of in uncoated huynh et al 2014 sheng and liu 2017 kwok et al 2016 confirmed that the toxicity of ag nps is heavily dependent on coating materials with pvp ag nps being less toxic than ag nps similar results were obtained by pang et al 2016 and miao et al 2017 who indicated that pvp ag nps do not significantly inhibit dna fragmentation and exhibit lesser toxicities for microbial respiration in sediments than uncoated ag nps however a few studies have also shown that high concentrations of pvp ag nps inhibit the microbial activity of functional organisms in pure strains and sequencing batch reactors cornelis et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the toxicity decrease of coated nps was demonstrated to depend on coating type microbial structure physiochemical environment and exposure time angel et al 2013 chen et al 2014 implying that further investigations are required to clarify this point 3 3 effects of nps on n2o release n2o is a denitrification intermediate exhibiting significant greenhouse gas activity whereas 1 mg l nps had no obvious p 0 05 influence on the production of n2o in sediments fig 3 its emission was significantly enhanced by 1 mg l ag and inhibited by 10 mg l ag p 0 05 in agreement with the trend observed for 15n n2 release the above behavior was because that 1 mg l ag increased microbial viability and activity due to the hormesis effects yang et al 2013 hormesis effects would stimulate cell growth metabolism and antibody produced due to the resistance of microbes jiao et al 2014 besides it was possible that some denitrifiers with more tolerance would be improved by impressing other sensitive bacteria unfortunately the origins of the above hormesis effect are still unclear and require further investigations xiu et al 2012 yang et al 2013 while the high concentrations 10 mg l of ag would lead to more absorbed ag into cells which resulted in its interaction with cell proteins and dna thus negatively affecting cellular processes and microbial activity and probably resulting in cell death huynh et al 2014 the amount of n2o produced decreased for all 10 mg l nps p 0 05 fig 3 implying that high concentration of nps and ag 10 mg l decrease the accumulation of n2o in sediments during 8 h furthermore 10 mg l ag nps or ag synchronously decreased the production of both n2o and 15n n2 thus being highly toxic to denitrifiers and inhibiting the reduction of nitrite or and nitrous oxide conversely 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps did not obviously affect the production of 15n n2 but significantly inhibited n2o release by 48 7 and 37 4 respectively these differences were ascribed to the dependence of denitrifier response to nps on their type with the inhibition mechanisms for each stepwise reduction not necessarily being the same in each case yang et al 2013 zheng et al 2014 as further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 response of denitrifiers to nps nitrite and n2o reduction are key denitrification steps hou et al 2014 several studies have demonstrated that nirk nirs and nosz have a major influence on rates of n2o and n2 production henry et al 2006 morales et al 2010 the obtained results revealed that nirk nirs and nosz exhibited abundances of 2 80 0 23 107 2 77 0 22 108 and 1 21 0 11 108 copies g 1 dry weight in the control group fig 4 in agreement with previous studies kim et al 2016 yin et al 2014 however different abundance orders were reported in other works harter et al 2014 probably reflecting environmental and microbial structure differences notably the copy numbers of the above genes in 1 mg l nps were not significantly different p 0 05 from those in the control group fig 4 which explained the absence of variance observed for the accumulation of n2o and 15n n2 figs 2 and 3 in contrast compared to those of the control the copy numbers of nirk nirs and nosz were increased by 23 25 and 17 in the presence of 1 mg l ag respectively due to these ions exerting a stimulatory effect and thus facilitating the whole denitrification process besides the abundance of nirk declined in all 10 mg l groups with copy number decreases of 41 35 22 and 47 observed for ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and ag respectively fig 4a with no significant differences detected for nirs in all 10 mg l groups p 0 05 fig 4b although both nirk and nirs genes control nitrite reduction they exhibited different responses to nps due to coding structurally different periplasmic enzymes i e cu or cytochrome c containing ones respectively kim et al 2016 usually nirk is more sensitive to toxicants such as heavy metals and nps miao et al 2015 and other substances such as glucose and citric acid giles et al 2017 than nirs with the biosynthetic pathways of various riboswitches controlling gene expression being influenced by these agents to different extents sullivan et al 2013 moreover 10 mg l ag pvp ag and ag2s nps did not affect the abundance of nosz in sediments p 0 05 whereas ag decreased the abundance of nosz at the same concentration p 0 05 fig 4c thus our results showed that the sensitivities of the three investigated functional genes to ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and ag in sediments were in the order of nirk nosz nirs one third of all denitrifiers containing nirs or nirk genes significantly contribute to n2o production harter et al 2014 philippot et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 demonstrated the abundance of nosz to be positively correlated with n2o emission which implies that the decreased n2o release rates in 10 mg l np groups were possibly due to the decreased abundance of nirk and no obvious change of that of nirs and nosz the obtained results illustrated that when exposed to ag pvp ag and ag2s nps for 8 h nirk exhibited a smaller tolerance but probably played a more important role than nirs in nitrite reduction in sediments moreover 10 mg l ag decreased the abundance of nosz and thus inhibited the reduction of n2o to n2 hence the decrease of both n2o and 15n n2 emission by 10 mg l ag was described to its detrimental effects on the abundances of nirk and nosz the above results also confirmed that denitrification was strongly correlated with the abundance of functional genes in sediments in the short term harter et al 2014 however compared to the 10 mg l ag group no significant change of nosz abundance was observed in the presence of ag nps at the same concentration whereas the release of both n2o and 15n n2 was inhibited in the latter case probably due to the decrease of nirk abundance dramatically inhibiting the emission of n2o 68 7 relative to the original emission although nosz was not affected by 10 mg l ag nps the extremely low amount of produced n2o significantly decreased the amount of n2o reduced to n2 thus 10 mg l ag nps inhibited the emission of n2o by decreasing the abundance of nirk and thus hindered the release of 15n n2 the reduction of n2o to n2 is the final step of denitrification being crucial for the production of n2 in sediments importantly 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps did not affect the production of 15n n2 but significantly decreased n2o release rates this n2o production decrease was less than that induced by ag nps with the corresponding inhibition order being ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps the obtained results allowed us to suggest that normal denitrification induced 15n n2 formation in sediments could still be sustained when the n2o production decrease lied within a certain range hence the n2o production decrease in pvp coated np groups was probably too small to affect the reduction of n2o to n2 in agreement with the low toxicity of coated nps kwok et al 2016 pang et al 2016 whereas 10 mg l ag nps dramatically decreased n2o emission and thus directly influenced the final denitrification step another possible explanation is the existence of alternative n2 release pathways in denitrification as supported by the reported coupling of denitrification with processes such as anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in n cycling bonaglia et al 2014 however the coupled process was not calculated in this study and further researches should pay attention to the effects of nps on other n cycling process including coupled denitrification 3 5 effects of nps on functional community structure after removing low quality sequences a total of 2611212 valid reads for control and five exposure samples 1 and 10 mg l ag 10 mg l ag pvp ag and ag2s nps were retrieved from the illumina miseq sequencing platform it should notable that all 1 mg l nps groups were not sequenced due to the unchanged gaseous production and functional genes abundance the index of simpson shannon and chao were also listed in tables s6 8 which indicated the diversity and richness were different in three functional communities in the order of nirs nosz nirk to further explore responses of dominant denitrifiers on nps exposed on the genus level the bacteria with a relative sequence abundance of at least 1 were listed in table 2 paracoccus was the most abundant bacteria in the nirk carrying microbial community in all six groups rang from 20 52 to 43 92 followed by chelativorans mesorhizobium neorhizobium and nitrosospira the major bacteria were the same in the nirs and nosz type denitrifiers including paracoccus pseudomonas thauera and cupriavidus in which paracoccus was also the predominant bacteria ranging from 14 76 to 25 44 and from 7 70 to 18 18 respectively the obtained sequencing results indicated that the compositions of three functional communities were not affected in short exposure time fig s3 and table 2 even in the high concentration of ag nps or ag however the relative abundance of dominant bacteria was altered at different extents specifically 1 mg l ag significantly improved the amount of paracoccus in both nirk and nosz type communities p 0 05 from 31 89 to 43 92 and 13 70 to 18 18 respectively due to the low dose hormesis effects while 10 mg l ag and nps decreased the abundance of paracoccus therefore it could be concluded that paracoccus containing nirk s and nosz genes was the predominant functional bacteria in the used sediment and played a key role in denitrification chen et al 2014 furthermore paracoccus was sensitive to ag based nps and ag in the sediment with possible being responsible of gaseous production changed while the other denitrifiers including chelativorans containing nirk mesorhizobium containing nirk pseudomonas containing nirs and nosz were more tolerant to ag based nps and ag after short term exposure 3 6 possible toxicity mechanisms of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps the origin of the antimicrobial activity of ag containing nps is still debatable particularly the question of whether toxicity is caused by ag release from nps or is particle specific beddow et al 2017 colman et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 herein we showed that 10 mg l ag pvp ag and ag2s nps inhibited denitrification and decreased the abundance of functional genes to different extents considering that 1 mg l ag exerted a positive influence on denitrifier activity the negligible release of ag in all np groups could not inhibit denitrification with the observed inhibitory effect attributed to their intrinsic nanotoxicity compared to the direct destruction of cells by ag the indirect particle specific toxicity of nps was mitigatory angel et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 with the detrimental effects of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps on the abundance of functional genes being smaller than those of ag at the same dosage e g 10 mg l ag decreased the abundance of both nirk and nosz whereas the three nps decreased only the abundance of nirk moreover the inhibitory effect of ag nps on gas production and functional genes was stronger than that of pvp ag and ag2s nps probably because the coating cap enhanced electrostatic or steric repulsion and thus increased np stability and weakened particle specific cell toxicity resulting in decreased antimicrobial activity angel et al 2013 besides although sulfuration is the natural mechanism of ag np detoxification ag2s nps exhibited a certain inhibitory effect on denitrification due to their toxicity even though the above effect was the lowest among the tested nps due to the extreme stability of ag2s nps for example judy et al 2015 demonstrated that 1 mg kg pvp ag nps influenced microbial communities in soil whereas the minimum inhibitory concentration of ag2s nps equaled 10 mg kg with similar results obtained by choi and hu 2009 and suresh et al 2011 thus it was concluded that the inhibitory effects of ag pvp ag and ag2s nps on denitrification were caused by their nanotoxicity with the inhibition order of ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps reflecting the decreased toxicity of sulfurated ag nps and the importance of np morphology for determining their toxicity 4 conclusions herein we demonstrated that the extent of denitrification inhibition depends on np type ag ag nps pvp ag nps ag2s nps and is positively correlated with np concentration 1 mg l nps had no effect on denitrifiers and functional communities whereas 1 mg l ag promoted denitrification by increasing the abundance of nirs nirk and nosz genes and the predominant denitrifier paracoccus due to exerting stimulatory effects moreover at 10 mg l both ag nps and ag influenced the gas n2o and 15n n2 release rates and decreased the abundance of predominant bacteria paracoccus in sediments during 8 h with the corresponding inhibitory mechanisms being possibly different in that ag nps exhibited nanotoxicity rather than ionic toxicity besides ag nps inhibited emission of 15n n2 by dramatically decreasing the amount of n2o rather than directly inhibiting the abundance of nosz finally 10 mg l pvp ag and ag2s nps did not affect the production of 15n n2 and the composition of denitrifiers but decreased n2o emission and the abundance of nirk featuring decreased cytotoxicity as a result of being coated by pvp thus our results provide evidence that ag containing nps can suppress denitrification and microbial communities in sediments with pvp ag and ag2s nps posing a decreased threat to denitrifiers further studies should deal with the long term

19618,in this study we reported that the presence of functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes fcnt h would greatly enhance the degradation of atrazine atz a model contaminant in the fe iii mediated fenton like system efficient atz degradation 90 was achieved within 30 min in the presence of 20 mg l 1 fcnt h 2 0 mg l 1 fe iii and 170 mg l 1 h2o2 whereas negligible atz degradation occurred in fcnt h free system the structure and surface chemistry of fcnt h and other cnts were well characterized the formed active species were determined based on esr analysis and the mass balance of fe species during the reaction was monitored in particular a new method based on ferrozine complexation was proposed to track the formed fe ii the results indicated that atz was mainly degraded by the generated hydroxyl radical ho and fe iii fe ii cycling was still the rate limiting step besides a small fraction of fe iii reduced by fcnt h a new pathway was revealed for fast reduction of most fe iii i e reaction of fcnt h fe iii complexes with h2o2 comparison of different cnts mediated fe iii h2o2 systems indicated that such enhanced effect of cnts mainly resulted from the surface carboxyl group instead of hydroxyl and carbonyl group combined with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the electron density migration from fe iii to fcnt h possibly resulted in the fast reduction of fcnt h fe iii complexes by h2o2 this study enables better understanding the enhanced fe iii mediated fenton like reaction in the presence of mwcnts and thus will shed new light on how to develop more efficient similar fenton systems via fe iii complexation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe iii mediated fenton reaction atrazine multi walled nanotubes 1 introduction fenton and fenton like reactions are of great interest in water treatment owing to their high efficiency cost effectiveness and environmental benignity chen et al 2011 pignatello et al 2006 however some inherent drawbacks of the classical fenton reaction fe ii h2o2 such as a narrow ph range as well as excessive fe ii iii sludge still play adverse role in their widespread application the working ph range ph 2 0 3 5 is restricted by the hydrolysis of fe iii and the ph dependent activity of h2o2 and hydroxyl radical ho babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bokare and choi 2014 pignatello et al 2006 also a large amount of fe ii is required for efficient wastewater treatment which results in large amount of iron sludge to be disposed of bokare and choi 2014 pignatello et al 2006 in the past decades continuous efforts have focused on exploring new methods to address the above two issues bokare and choi 2014 mirzaei et al 2017 pignatello et al 2006 the fenton like systems catalyzed by non iron transition metal ions with multiple oxidation states e g cu co3 cr3 and ce3 have been employed to water treatment even at neutral phs bokare and choi 2014 however these metal ions are always of relative low activity and high toxicity bokare and choi 2014 in recent years heterogeneous fenton processes based on the iron containing catalysts e g ferrihydrite hematite and goethite have attracted increasing interests because they are capable of transforming the contaminants at ph values of 3 9 without production of massive iron residue munoz et al 2015 pouran et al 2014 however their demerits should also be highlighted that such fenton like reactions are at least one order of magnitude slower than the homogeneous ones yang et al 2013 where the slow reaction between fe iii and h2o2 is usually the rate determining step and and gallard 1999 1 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 k 2 7 10 3 s 1 hence how to enhance the cycling of fe iii fe ii is a key but challenging issue to improve the efficiency of fe iii mediated fenton like reactions introduction of chelating agents e g citrate succinate and oxalate could enhance the reaction of eq 1 by increasing the concentration of dissolved fe species at a wide ph range ph 3 8 pignatello et al 2006 sun and pignatello 1992 nevertheless the added organic chelating agents which are usually of poor biodegradability are undesirable for the quality of effluent as well as the cost effectiveness photo and electro fenton systems can effectively reduce fe iii to fe ii via photolysis of fe oh 2 and the cathodic reduction respectively de et al 2014 pignatello et al 2006 zepp et al 1992 in the presence of the chelating agents or some dyes ligand to metal charge transfer lmct or the intermolecular electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to fe iii can also favor fe iii reduction de et al 2014 zepp et al 1992 although these technologies can reduce the initial fe ii concentration input their applications are restricted partly due to the high cost self scavenging of ho as well as the negative effect of substrate on the light penetration bokare and choi 2014 on the other side direct addition of reducing agents e g hydroxylamine hydrochloride cysteine nitrilotriacetic acid and protocatechuic acid exhibits superior performance on the reduction of fe iii chen et al 2011 li et al 2016 qin et al 2015 sun et al 2013 subramanian et al subramanian and madras 2017 found that the degradation rate of methylene blue mb in the presence of thioglycolic acid tga was two order of magnitude higher than the classical fenton reaction at ph of 3 6 owing to the direct reduction of fe iii after complexing increasing the tga fe ii molar ratio could also result in an efficient mb removal at ph 7 the quinone intermediates generated from the decomposition of some aromatic compounds could also act as electron shuttles to transfer electrons from the target pollutants to fe iii in the fenton and related reactions chen and pignatello 1997 duesterberg and waite 2007 however a complete decomposition of the residual reducing agents is required to respond to the increased organic matter concentration and the induced high toxicity a promising alternative to soluble reducing agents is carbon materials since they are separable environmentally benign and capable of reducing fe iii without extra addition of toxic chemicals and energy choi et al 2002 qin et al 2017 seo et al 2015 in recent years enhancement of various carbon materials on the fenton and fenton like reactions have been reported fang et al 2014 huang et al 2003 navalon et al 2012 peng et al 2017 qin et al 2017 found that hydrothermal carbon favored the alachlor degradation in fe iii h2o2 through direct reduction of hydroxyl group complexed fe iii by the carbon centered free radicals peng et al assumed that either the electron transfer of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts or the promoted reaction between the adsorbed fe iii and adsorbed h2o2 might be responsible for the accelerated fe ii generation peng et al 2017 seo et al 2015 reported that both activated carbon and mwcnts were able to directly reduce fe iii by the carbonyl quinone groups on the surface to accelerate the removal of pollutants in fe iii h2o2 however such enhancement on fenton reactions is still far from satisfaction even in case of high dosage 1 0 g l 1 and a complete removal of target contaminants usually needed several hours navalon et al 2012 in this study we reported that the presence of functionalized mwcnts fcnt h only at 20 mg l 1 could greatly enhance the degradation of atrazine atz in the fe iii h2o2 system at the initial fe iii as low as 2 0 mg l 1 atz is a synthetic herbicide of potential risks to human health ding et al 2017 because of its relatively long half life and low biodegradability it is frequently detected in ground and surface water as 0 12 5 16 μg l 1 in beijing jing et al 2010 note that its maximum contaminant level in drinking water is 3 μg l 1 who 2009 also atz is commonly used as a model compound to indicate the generation of ho in fenton and related reactions where it can only be degraded by ho with the rate constant of 3 109 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 electron spin resonance esr spectrum was employed to directly determine the generated active species in the system moreover both the mass balance of iron species and selective trapping of fe ii by ferrozine were conducted to verify the generation mechanism of the active species in particular the relationship between the functional groups of mwcnts and the catalytic activity was discussed

laboratory with its characteristics summarized in table s1 2 2 preparation of cnt materials 2 2 1 the functionalized mwcnts two gram of pristine mwcnts denoted by pcnt were suspended in 150 ml concentrated hno3 solution in a 250 ml flask after being dispersed by ultrasound sonifier s450d branson u s a the mixed solution was refluxed at 130 5 c under magnetic stirring for 14 h then filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe membranes and washed with ultrapure water until the ph of the filtrate reached 6 2 then the collected solids were re dispersed in the ultrapure water and freeze dried freezone 2 5 labconco u s a for better dispersion of the particles and the as obtained product was labeled as fcnt h to clarify the effects of surface groups of mwcnts on the catalytic efficiency several mwcnts binding different amounts of surface groups at varying levels were prepared the first sample is denoted by fcnt l which was obtained by using 2 g of pcnt refluxed in 37 wt hno3 solution at 110 5 c for 5 h followed by filtration washing and freeze drying in addition two mwcnt samples binding carboxyl or hydroxyl groups were purchased and thermally treated to obtain cnt materials of different amounts of each group first both of them were refluxed in concentrated hcl solution 38 in mass at 70 c for 12 h to remove residual metal impurities on the surface after washing and freeze drying the obtained precipitates were ground and labeled as cnt cooh and cnt oh afterward the cnt cooh sample was thermally calcined at different temperatures 300 400 500 600 and 700 c typically 3 g of the cnt cooh sample was heated to the preset temperature at a rate of 3 c min 1 in argon atmosphere and then kept at the temperature for 4 h the products annealed at different temperatures were labeled as cnt cooh

collected for xps measurement 2 3 degradation experiments all the experiments were conducted in a 50 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring at 20 0 3 c maintained by a thermostat thd 5015 tianheng china reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding h2o2 170 mg l 1 mwcnts suspension 20 mg l 1 unless specified and fe iii solution 2 0 mg l 1 to the ph adjusted solution containing each target

aliquots were periodically sampled out with a syringe and then filtered through a membrane 0 22 μm to remove the solid catalysts for the recycling experiment the catalysts were collected by suction filtration and then simply washed by ethanol and ultrapure water text s1 for details methanol 30 μl was immediately added to the filtrates to quench the reaction for subsequent analysis 2 4 analytical methods atz concentration was determined using ultra high performance liquid chromatography uplc ultimate 3000 thermo germany with a symmetry c18 column 2 1 500 mm 1 9 μm particle size waters u s a and a uv detector at 221 nm the isocratic mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water methanol v v 50 50 at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 the sample injection volume was 10 μl the concentrations of other organic pollutants e g nb ba and 4 cp were also detected by uplc and the detailed operation methods were described in table s2 the concentrations of different iron species were determined based on a modified 1 10 phenanthroline method herrera et al 2010 briefly to determine the dissolved fe ii 1 ml of the filtrates was immediately mixed with 250 μl naf solution 357 mm and 50 μl 10 wt hcl solution then 100 μl saturated naac solution was used to buffer the ph value to ca 4 6 followed by the addition of 100 μl 1 10 phenanthroline solution 27 7 mm after being diluted to 2 5 ml the obtained solution containing fe ii 1 10 phenanthroline complex was measured at λ 510 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 beijing persee china for detection of the total dissolved iron 250 μl of naf solution was replaced with 300 μl hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution 1 44 m the dissolved fe iii concentration was calculated by subtracting the dissolved fe ii concentration from the total dissolved iron concentration the concentrations of total iron species including dissolved and surface bound iron species were measured by addition of the saturated naac solution and 1 10 phenanthroline prior to filtration he et al 2016 to better determine the generation of fe ii ferrozine was used as a reagent to selectively complex with fe ii the violet fe ii ferrozine complex was detected at λ 562 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer dmpo ho esr spectra was obtained with a esr a300 spectrometer bruker germany 2 5 characterization the specific surface area and pore distribution of the solid cnt were

hcl solutions and the detailed titration process were described in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fcnt h the structure characteristics of fcnt h including morphology crystal structure specific surface area and pore size distribution were compared with pcnt in fig s1 and table s3 hno3 treatment is capable of removing the amorphous carbon and metal catalyst residues introducing functional groups onto the surface and even cutting off the nanotubes gerber et al 2011 similar to pcnt the inner and outer diameter of fcnt h ranged from 5 to 13 nm and 15 27 nm respectively fig s1 a b in addition hno3 oxidation resulted in fcnt h of shorter length better cap opening and more oxygen contained groups verified by ftir spectra in fig s2 the diffraction peaks at 26 43 3 53 5 and 78 observed in the xrd patterns of fcnt h and pcnt was assigned to 002 100 004 and 110 crystal planes reflecting the typical hexagonal graphite structure of mwcnts li et al 2003 a more sharp 002 peak of fcnt h indicated less amorphous carbon on the surface than pcnt the type iv adsorption isotherms with h1 hysteresis loop for both pcnt and fcnt h at relative high pressure 0 4 p p0 0 98 indicated the presence of mesopores sing 2009 table s3 summarizes the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size of pcnt and fcnt h determined by bet method and bjh method respectively a slight increase of the specific surface area and average pore size was detected after hno3 treatment due to the opening of caps and tailored lengths whereas the pore volume decreased chiang et al 2011 3 2 degradation of atz in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h the degradation kinetic curves of atz in different systems are shown in fig 1 both the atz adsorption on fcnt h and degradation by h2o2 alone were negligible 1 8 about 15 of atz was removed by fe iii h2o2 within 30 min while fcnt h alone did not show any catalytic capacity for h2o2 to degrade atz 5 surprisingly the presence of 20 mg l 1 fcnt h dramatically enhanced the removal of atz by fe iii h2o2 92 within 30 min the atz degradation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h could be well represented by the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s3 implying the concentration of the active species be constant throughout the reaction process the apparent rate constant k obs in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was 23 times higher than that in fe iii h2o2 moreover the degradation efficiency was even 32 higher than the classical fenton system fe ii h2o2 also the degradation of other organic contaminants including mb 4 cp ba and nb were 99 4 100 100 and 85 2 within 15 min respectively fig s4 such satisfactory removal of all the selected pollutants suggested a highly efficient generation of non selective active species the performance of fe iii h2o2 cnt for atz degradation was systematically elucidated in terms of the effect of h2o2 concentration fcnt h fe iii mass ratio ph variation and temperature and the results are available in fig 2 and fig s5 as expected the degradation rate improved with increasing h2o2 concentration fe iii dosage and reaction temperature because of the promoted active species generation from the reaction between fe iii and h2o2 mirzaei et al 2017 when fe iii dosage was set as 2 0 mg l 1 the optimized mass ratio between fcnt h and fe iii dosage 10 1 could be available which depended upon the balance between promoting and scavenging active species by fcnt h the k obs of atz degradation was proportional to fcnt h and fe iii dosage when fcnt h fe iii was fixed at 10 1 fig 2 c the initial ph affected the degradation efficiency seriously with the fastest reaction achieved at ph 4 5 when the ph value was above 6 or below 2 atz degradation was very low because of the weakened complexation between fe iii and fcnt h vide infra more attractively the atz degradation rate in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was at least one order of magnitude higher than that in fe iii h2o2 under different conditions fig s5 further demonstrating the great potential of the system in degradation of organic pollutants in water cyclic runs were performed to evaluate the reusability of fcnt h for atz degradation in the background of ultrapure water and tap water respectively fig s6 to our satisfaction fcnt h maintained its constant catalytic activity for atz degradation even in the tap water 3 3 active species it is generally accepted that ho is the major active species in the fenton reaction though it is still controversial whether ferryl is involved here the effect of tba on the atz degradation was studied with dmpo trapped esr spectra performed to identify the active species tba is a typical ho scavenger because of its high reaction rate constant of 5 108 m 1 s 1 with ho acero et al 2000 the effect of tba concentration on the atz removal is depicted in fig 3 and fig s7 atz degradation was greatly inhibited with the increasing tba concentration and 500 mm tba could entirely inhibit the degradation in case of fe iii h2o2 the presence of 500 μm tba could also retard the atz degradation from 14 3 to 0 8 suggesting that ho was the major oxidant in both systems to further confirm the generation of ho in both systems esr spectroscopy was carried out with dmpo as a spin trap agent dmpo can trap ho in aqueous solution to form the dmpo ho adduct with esr signal composed of quartet lines with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 hyperfine constants αn 1 49 mt αh 1 49 mt and g value 2 0055 noda et al 1997 the results in fig 3 b verified that ho was generated in both systems moreover a slight dmpo ho2 signal at the side of the quartet lines in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was also detected noda et al 1997 it was reported that carbon materials were capable of activating h2o2 to produce free radicals fang et al 2014 here bq was used as a model pollutant to verify the formation of ho2 fig s8 no bq oxidation observed in the h2o2 fcnt h system indicated that ho2 was generated mainly from the reaction of eq 1 it should be noted that the role of ho2 in atz degradation was negligible since it was completely inhibited by the added tba the ho and ho2 generation combined with the accelerated decomposition of atz indicated a rapid cycling of fe iii fe ii since fcnt h exhibited no catalytic capacity for h2o2 fe iii should be the only catalyst responsible for h2o2 activation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h fe iii not only exists in the form of hydrated ferric ions but also binds the surface of fcnt h via complexation with surface groups qin et al 2017 given the fact of the slow atz degradation in fe iii h2o2 it was speculated that surface bound fe iii could be effectively recycled to produce ho during h2o2 activation to verify such speculation both the total dissolved fe species and the dissociative fe ii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h and fe iii h2o2 were determined as shown in fig s9 the total dissolved fe species and the dissolved fe ii in the presence of fcnt h were much less than that in fcnt h free for both systems their discrepancy of the two species mainly resulted from the adsorption of iron species on the surface of fcnt h obviously the concentrations of dissolved fe species changed inversely with the degradation efficiency of atz implying the bound iron species onto fcnt h be the veritable active sites for ho generation to further confirm the key role of the surface bound iron species on the h2o2 activation and ho generation we employed ca a strong complexing agent to compete for the fe species with fcnt h as seen from fig 4 the total dissolved iron species increased with the increase of the concentration of ca in the presence of 36 μm of ca almost all the fe species were dissolved due to the 1 1 stoichiometry for the reaction between fe iii and ca field et al 1974 moreover the increased total dissolved iron species accompanied a drop in the atz degradation rate though fcnt h was present at the same dosage fig s10 shows the effect of different dissolved iron species resulting from the ca addition on the formation of ho ss which was calculated from the pseudo first order kinetics of atz degradation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h fig s11 and text s4 a linear relationship r 2 0 923 observed clearly verified the pivotal role of surface bound fe iii on ho generation 3 4 mechanism in the classical fenton system ho is generated from the single electron transfer reaction between fe ii and h2o2 chen et al 2011 in the fe iii related fenton like reaction fe iii is firstly reduced to fe ii by h2o2 and the generated fe ii continues to react with h2o2 to produce ho as the following eqs and and gallard 1999 2 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh ho k 63 m 1 s 1 3 fe ii ho fe iii oh k 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 4 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o k 3 3 107 m 1 s 1 5 fe iii ho2 fe ii o2 h k 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 6 fe ii ho2 fe iii ho2 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 however no dissociative fe ii was detected in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h probably because of a rapid oxidation of fe ii and slow reduction of fe iii whatever the result is even insufficient to support the reduction of fe iii yao et al suggested that iron γ aminopyridine immobilized on activated carbon fibers would activate h2o2 to generate ho with the formation of fe iv instead of fe ii yao et al 2014 here we examined the evolution of different iron species including the dissociative fe ii and fe iii the surface bound fe ii and fe iii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h and fe iii fcnt h on the basis of a modified 1 10 phenanthroline method to avoid the hydrolysis and precipitation of fe iii the ph was set as 3 7 for both systems preliminary experiments in fe iii h2o2 suggested that all of iron species remain dissolved throughout the reactions as seen in fig 5 the concentrations of the iron species did not change greatly after the beginning of the reactions in both of the systems the surface bound fe species accounted for 43 7 of the total fe in the absence of h2o2 a small amount of fe ii 6 of the total fe was really generated suggesting that fe iii could be directly reduced to fe ii by fcnt h as expected fe ii in the presence of h2o2 was slightly lower than that in fe iii fcnt h due to the consumption by h2o2 interestingly the concentration of surface bound fe ii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h 3 75 was slightly higher than that in fe iii fcnt h 3 1 even though excess h2o2 would oxidize the generated fe ii rapidly the above result indicated that fe ii formation from the reduction of fe iii did not proceed via the formation of fe iv and there might be another pathway to generate fe ii from the reaction concerning h2o2 as suggested by eqs 4 6 fe iii can also be reduced by ho2 besides h2o2 if sufficient ho2 is generated since dmpo trapped epr spectra demonstrated the formation of ho2 the possibility of fe iii reduced by ho2 should not be ignored certainly more solid evidences are required to further confirm the reduction pathways of fe iii one main obstacle to reveal the reduction pathways of fe iii is the undistinguishable fe ii concentration in different systems due to its rapid oxidation by h2o2 if h2o2 oxidation could be slowed down efficient reduction of fe iii was expected to increase the concentration of the generated fe ii based on such speculation here we selected ferrozine to trap fe ii competing with h2o2 so that h2o2 oxidation could be slowed down and the concentration of generated fe ii could be approximately calculated from the products formed by the reaction between fe ii and ferrozine ferrozine is a specified agent for this experiment on account of three aspects 1 ferrozine complexes with fe ii rapidly so that it is capable of trapping the generated fe ii immediately 2 the formed violet fe ferrozine 3 2 complex is stable at ph 4 9 and can be conveniently detected by uv vis spectrophotometry at λ 562 nm molar adsorption coefficient 25424 m 1 cm 1 as determined in this study 3 the competition between ferrozine and fcnt h for fe iii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h could be ignored fig s12 gibbs 1976 as observed in fig 6 a a similar amount of fe ii 6 5 of the total fe species was detected in fe iii fcnt h verifying the direct reduction of fe iii by fcnt h fe ii concentration increased rapidly in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h and 75 2 of fe iii was reduced to fe ii which was immediately trapped by ferrozine within 30 min in fcnt h free only 8 of the total fe was identified as fe ii as suggested by stookey 1970 fe iii could also be reduced by ferrozine and 24 25 μg l 1 of fe ii was detected at the end of the reaction moreover the trapping of fe ii retarded the ho concentration seriously as well as the subsequent atz degradation fig s13 although some other factors were not considered such as the presence of the secondary reaction between ferrozine and fe iii as well as the possible change of the reaction balance induced by ferrozine we believe the concentrations of fe ii determined here are generally credible from the above results the direct reduction of fe iii by fcnt h could be verified and fe ii generated via this pathway only accounted for 8 6 of the total generated fe ii most of fe iii was reduced by h2o2 or the intermediates derived from h2o2 i e ho2 o2 to further distinguish the reduction pathways the effect of ho2 o2 scavengers i e tf and sod and h2o2 scavenger i e cat ding et al 2017 huang et al 2013 on the fe ii generation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was explored with the results described in fig 6 b and fig s14 only a mild inhibition was observed in the presence of tf and sod and fe ii was barely generated after trapping h2o2 by cat the results indicated that the reduction of fe iii to fe ii was mainly governed by h2o2 to the best of our knowledge the new reduction pathway was clearly demonstrated for the first time in the fenton like systems the formation of fe iii fcnt h was prerequisite for the reduction process it is meaningful to determine the relationship between the functional groups and the catalytic activity hence the performance of several cnt materials including fcnt l pcnt gcnt cnt cooh and cnt coohs calcined at different temperatures were compared boehm titration was used to quantify the functional groups i e carboxyl group lactone group and hydroxyl group the results are described in table s4 also the linear regression of the plot of k obs versus the amount of the specified groups was conducted fig 7 and fig s15 fig s15 reveals a poor linear regression of k obs versus the concentration of hydroxyl groups r 2 0 162 and lactone groups r 2 0 09 suggesting poor relationship between the catalytic activity and these two groups interestingly fig 7 shows the accelerated degradation of atz could be achieved in all of the fenton like systems with carboxylated mwcnts a good positive linear correlation between the carboxyl groups contents and k obs r 2 0 854 indicated that the carboxyl groups on the surface of fcnt h might be of great significance to complex with fe iii and then resulted in an efficient reduction by h2o2 generally the reduction of fe iii in aqueous solution by h2o2 can be divided into two steps 1a fe iii h2o2 feiii ho2 2 h k 3 1 10 3 1b feiii ho2 2 fe ii ho2 k 2 7 10 3 s 1 the equilibrium attains almost instantly after the addition of fe iii to the aqueous solution and the unimolecular decomposition of fe iii hydroperoxo complexes fe ooh is the rate limiting step of fe iii reduction with a very low rate constant of 2 7 10 3 s 1 and and gallard 1999 obviously the complexation of fe iii by fcnt h accelerated the homolysis cleavage of fe ooh to generate fe ii and ho2 complexation may affect the activity of reactants by changing the element chemical states jain et al 2017 here xps analysis on c 1s o 1s and fe 2p of fcnt h before and after fe iii complexation was carried out the presence of fe 2p peak directly verified the existence of fcnt h fe iii fig s16 in fig 8 the deconvolution of c 1s peak suggested the presence of hydroxyl group carbonyl group and carboxyl group which was consistent with fig s2 moreover after fe iii complexation a peak shift towards the lower binding energy was detected in both c 1s 288 9 ev and o 1s peaks 532 ev fig s17 implying the shift of electron density from fe iii to the carboxyl group on the surface of fcnt h jain et al 2017 the electron density migration possibly resulted from the electronegative characterization of the oxygen contained group and the electron withdrawing capacity of π electron depleted regions on the surface of fcnt h as induced by the oxidation treatment chen et al 2008 wang et al 2013 such migration would make the iron center more lewis acidic and shift the peroxide to fe iii charge transfer transition to lower energy kim et al 2001 kunishita et al 2008 on the other hand the ligands will directly affect the spin state and the local dielectric character of the fe iii center then affect the homolysis cleavage of fe ooh kunishita et al 2008 lehnert et al 2001 the high spin state dxy 1dxz 1dyz 1dx2 y2 1dz2 1 of fe iii as affected by the ligand field is expected to result in weaker σ bonding of fe o to be cleavable in the thermodynamic viewpoint dey and solomon 2010 yun et al 2013 besides the ligand field effect the ligands would drastically alter the cleavage of fe o due to the trans effect and steric effect lehnert et al 2001 moreover the steric shielding of the metal center by ligands would reduce the local dielectric character and then increase the redox potential of the complexes also favoring fe iii cu ii reduction through the homolysis of fe o cu o fisher and sligar 1985 kunishita et al 2008 based on the above discussion the mechanism of the accelerated atz degradation in the fenton like system with fcnt h is depicted in scheme 1 an efficient cycling of fe iii fe ii was responsible for ho generation and subsequent strongly enhanced atz degradation only 11 of fe ii generation resulted from the classical reactions in aqueous solution the direct reduction of fe iii by carbonyl groups and quinone groups on the fcnt h surface accounted for 9 of the generated fe ii above all 80 of fe ii was formed via faster reduction of fcnt h fe iii complexes by h2o2 4 conclusions in this study we found that in the presence of fcnt h at 20 mg l 1 a trace fe iii dosage 2 0 mg l 1 along with 170 mg l 1 h2o2 could result in 90 of atz decomposed within 30 min the ho generated from the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 was the dominant active species based on a new method to selectively complex fe ii by using ferrozine the fast fe iii fe ii cycling pathway was verified i e the surface bound fe iii could be effectively reduced by h2o2 the carboxyl groups on the surface of fcnt h played a vital role in fe iii complexation and subsequent fe iii reduction the electron migration from fe iii to fcnt h and the ligand spatial effects induced by the special coordination environment might contribute to such highly efficient fe iii fe ii cycling our findings may have important implications to address the inherent drawbacks of the classical fenton reaction mwcnts will complex with fe iii to enlarge the working ph range ca ph 3 5 and to decrease the dissolved iron species concentration 1 mg l 1 further

19618,in this study we reported that the presence of functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes fcnt h would greatly enhance the degradation of atrazine atz a model contaminant in the fe iii mediated fenton like system efficient atz degradation 90 was achieved within 30 min in the presence of 20 mg l 1 fcnt h 2 0 mg l 1 fe iii and 170 mg l 1 h2o2 whereas negligible atz degradation occurred in fcnt h free system the structure and surface chemistry of fcnt h and other cnts were well characterized the formed active species were determined based on esr analysis and the mass balance of fe species during the reaction was monitored in particular a new method based on ferrozine complexation was proposed to track the formed fe ii the results indicated that atz was mainly degraded by the generated hydroxyl radical ho and fe iii fe ii cycling was still the rate limiting step besides a small fraction of fe iii reduced by fcnt h a new pathway was revealed for fast reduction of most fe iii i e reaction of fcnt h fe iii complexes with h2o2 comparison of different cnts mediated fe iii h2o2 systems indicated that such enhanced effect of cnts mainly resulted from the surface carboxyl group instead of hydroxyl and carbonyl group combined with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the electron density migration from fe iii to fcnt h possibly resulted in the fast reduction of fcnt h fe iii complexes by h2o2 this study enables better understanding the enhanced fe iii mediated fenton like reaction in the presence of mwcnts and thus will shed new light on how to develop more efficient similar fenton systems via fe iii complexation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe iii mediated fenton reaction atrazine multi walled nanotubes 1 introduction fenton and fenton like reactions are of great interest in water treatment owing to their high efficiency cost effectiveness and environmental benignity chen et al 2011 pignatello et al 2006 however some inherent drawbacks of the classical fenton reaction fe ii h2o2 such as a narrow ph range as well as excessive fe ii iii sludge still play adverse role in their widespread application the working ph range ph 2 0 3 5 is restricted by the hydrolysis of fe iii and the ph dependent activity of h2o2 and hydroxyl radical ho babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bokare and choi 2014 pignatello et al 2006 also a large amount of fe ii is required for efficient wastewater treatment which results in large amount of iron sludge to be disposed of bokare and choi 2014 pignatello et al 2006 in the past decades continuous efforts have focused on exploring new methods to address the above two issues bokare and choi 2014 mirzaei et al 2017 pignatello et al 2006 the fenton like systems catalyzed by non iron transition metal ions with multiple oxidation states e g cu co3 cr3 and ce3 have been employed to water treatment even at neutral phs bokare and choi 2014 however these metal ions are always of relative low activity and high toxicity bokare and choi 2014 in recent years heterogeneous fenton processes based on the iron containing catalysts e g ferrihydrite hematite and goethite have attracted increasing interests because they are capable of transforming the contaminants at ph values of 3 9 without production of massive iron residue munoz et al 2015 pouran et al 2014 however their demerits should also be highlighted that such fenton like reactions are at least one order of magnitude slower than the homogeneous ones yang et al 2013 where the slow reaction between fe iii and h2o2 is usually the rate determining step and and gallard 1999 1 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 k 2 7 10 3 s 1 hence how to enhance the cycling of fe iii fe ii is a key but challenging issue to improve the efficiency of fe iii mediated fenton like reactions introduction of chelating agents e g citrate succinate and oxalate could enhance the reaction of eq 1 by increasing the concentration of dissolved fe species at a wide ph range ph 3 8 pignatello et al 2006 sun and pignatello 1992 nevertheless the added organic chelating agents which are usually of poor biodegradability are undesirable for the quality of effluent as well as the cost effectiveness photo and electro fenton systems can effectively reduce fe iii to fe ii via photolysis of fe oh 2 and the cathodic reduction respectively de et al 2014 pignatello et al 2006 zepp et al 1992 in the presence of the chelating agents or some dyes ligand to metal charge transfer lmct or the intermolecular electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to fe iii can also favor fe iii reduction de et al 2014 zepp et al 1992 although these technologies can reduce the initial fe ii concentration input their applications are restricted partly due to the high cost self scavenging of ho as well as the negative effect of substrate on the light penetration bokare and choi 2014 on the other side direct addition of reducing agents e g hydroxylamine hydrochloride cysteine nitrilotriacetic acid and protocatechuic acid exhibits superior performance on the reduction of fe iii chen et al 2011 li et al 2016 qin et al 2015 sun et al 2013 subramanian et al subramanian and madras 2017 found that the degradation rate of methylene blue mb in the presence of thioglycolic acid tga was two order of magnitude higher than the classical fenton reaction at ph of 3 6 owing to the direct reduction of fe iii after complexing increasing the tga fe ii molar ratio could also result in an efficient mb removal at ph 7 the quinone intermediates generated from the decomposition of some aromatic compounds could also act as electron shuttles to transfer electrons from the target pollutants to fe iii in the fenton and related reactions chen and pignatello 1997 duesterberg and waite 2007 however a complete decomposition of the residual reducing agents is required to respond to the increased organic matter concentration and the induced high toxicity a promising alternative to soluble reducing agents is carbon materials since they are separable environmentally benign and capable of reducing fe iii without extra addition of toxic chemicals and energy choi et al 2002 qin et al 2017 seo et al 2015 in recent years enhancement of various carbon materials on the fenton and fenton like reactions have been reported fang et al 2014 huang et al 2003 navalon et al 2012 peng et al 2017 qin et al 2017 found that hydrothermal carbon favored the alachlor degradation in fe iii h2o2 through direct reduction of hydroxyl group complexed fe iii by the carbon centered free radicals peng et al assumed that either the electron transfer of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts or the promoted reaction between the adsorbed fe iii and adsorbed h2o2 might be responsible for the accelerated fe ii generation peng et al 2017 seo et al 2015 reported that both activated carbon and mwcnts were able to directly reduce fe iii by the carbonyl quinone groups on the surface to accelerate the removal of pollutants in fe iii h2o2 however such enhancement on fenton reactions is still far from satisfaction even in case of high dosage 1 0 g l 1 and a complete removal of target contaminants usually needed several hours navalon et al 2012 in this study we reported that the presence of functionalized mwcnts fcnt h only at 20 mg l 1 could greatly enhance the degradation of atrazine atz in the fe iii h2o2 system at the initial fe iii as low as 2 0 mg l 1 atz is a synthetic herbicide of potential risks to human health ding et al 2017 because of its relatively long half life and low biodegradability it is frequently detected in ground and surface water as 0 12 5 16 μg l 1 in beijing jing et al 2010 note that its maximum contaminant level in drinking water is 3 μg l 1 who 2009 also atz is commonly used as a model compound to indicate the generation of ho in fenton and related reactions where it can only be degraded by ho with the rate constant of 3 109 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 electron spin resonance esr spectrum was employed to directly determine the generated active species in the system moreover both the mass balance of iron species and selective trapping of fe ii by ferrozine were conducted to verify the generation mechanism of the active species in particular the relationship between the functional groups of mwcnts and the catalytic activity was discussed

solution and the oxidation of fe ii solution both of the solutions were freshly prepared prior to use tap water used as the background to evaluate the stability of the catalysts was collected from the laboratory with its characteristics summarized in table s1 2 2 preparation of cnt materials 2 2 1 the functionalized mwcnts two gram of pristine mwcnts denoted by pcnt were suspended in 150 ml concentrated hno3 solution in a 250 ml flask after being dispersed by ultrasound sonifier s450d branson u s a the mixed solution was refluxed at 130 5 c under magnetic stirring for 14 h then filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe membranes and washed with ultrapure water until the ph of the filtrate reached 6 2 then the collected solids were re dispersed in the ultrapure water and freeze dried freezone 2 5 labconco u s a for better dispersion of the particles and the as obtained product was labeled as fcnt h to clarify the effects of surface groups of mwcnts on the catalytic efficiency several mwcnts binding different amounts of surface groups at varying levels were prepared the first sample is denoted by fcnt l which was obtained by using 2 g of pcnt refluxed in 37 wt hno3 solution at 110 5 c for 5 h followed by filtration washing and freeze drying in addition two mwcnt samples binding carboxyl or hydroxyl groups were purchased and thermally treated to obtain cnt materials of different amounts of each group first both of them were refluxed in concentrated hcl solution 38 in mass at 70 c for 12 h to remove residual metal impurities on the surface after washing and freeze drying the obtained precipitates were ground and labeled as cnt cooh and cnt oh afterward the cnt cooh sample was thermally calcined at different temperatures 300 400 500 600 and 700 c typically 3 g of the cnt cooh

mwcnts suspension the aqueous suspensions of different cnt samples were produced via direct sonication briefly 50 mg of the samples was added to 100 ml ultrapure water the mixture was dispersed by probe sonication for 30 min at an applied power of 400 w l 1 in an ice bath the suspensions are stable for 3 d to several weeks depending on the contents of hydrophilic groups to maintain homogeneity the stock suspensions were always sonicated for 10 min before use 2 2 3 fe iii loaded fcnt h briefly 50 mg fcnt h was dispersed in 35 ml ultrapure water at ph 3 7 followed by the addition of 15 ml fe

collected for xps measurement 2 3 degradation experiments all the experiments were conducted in a 50 ml conical flask under magnetic stirring at 20 0 3 c maintained by a thermostat thd 5015 tianheng china reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding h2o2 170 mg l 1 mwcnts suspension 20 mg l 1 unless specified and fe iii solution 2 0 mg l 1 to the ph adjusted solution containing each target

36 μm or ferrozine 200 μm was dosed to quench generated ho surface bound fe iii and the generated fe ii respectively the experimental conditions were also clarified in the figure captions reaction aliquots were periodically sampled out with a syringe and then filtered through a membrane 0 22 μm to remove the solid catalysts for the recycling experiment the catalysts were collected by suction filtration and then simply washed by ethanol and ultrapure water text s1 for details methanol 30 μl was immediately added to the filtrates to quench the reaction for subsequent analysis 2 4 analytical methods atz concentration was determined using ultra high performance liquid chromatography uplc ultimate 3000 thermo germany with a symmetry c18 column 2 1 500 mm 1 9 μm particle size waters u s a and a uv detector at 221 nm the isocratic mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water methanol v v 50 50 at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 the sample injection volume was 10 μl the concentrations of other organic pollutants e g nb ba and 4 cp were also detected by uplc and the detailed operation methods were described in table s2 the concentrations of different iron species were determined based on a modified 1 10 phenanthroline method herrera et al 2010 briefly to determine the dissolved fe ii 1 ml of the filtrates was immediately mixed with 250 μl naf solution 357 mm and 50 μl 10 wt hcl solution then 100 μl saturated naac solution was used to buffer the ph value to ca 4 6 followed by the addition of 100 μl 1 10 phenanthroline solution 27 7 mm after being diluted to 2 5 ml the obtained solution containing fe ii 1 10 phenanthroline complex was measured at λ 510 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 beijing persee china for detection of the total dissolved iron 250 μl of naf solution was replaced with 300 μl hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution 1 44 m the dissolved fe iii concentration was calculated by subtracting the dissolved fe ii concentration from the total dissolved iron concentration the concentrations of total iron species including dissolved and surface bound iron species were measured by addition of the saturated naac solution and 1 10 phenanthroline prior to filtration he et al 2016 to better determine the generation of fe ii ferrozine was used as a reagent to selectively complex with fe ii the violet fe ii ferrozine complex was detected at λ 562 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer dmpo ho esr spectra was obtained with a esr a300 spectrometer bruker germany 2 5 characterization the specific surface area and pore distribution of the solid cnt were

ftir spectrometer bruker germany to identify the surface groups of the catalysts boehm titration was used to determine the acidic functional groups on the carbon samples the carboxyl lactone and hydroxyl groups would be differentiated by neutralization with bases of various strengths i e nahco3 na2co3 and naoh boehm et al 1964 the pretreatment of the reagents the standardization of naoh and hcl solutions and the detailed titration process were described in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fcnt h the structure characteristics of fcnt h including morphology crystal structure specific surface area and pore size distribution were compared with pcnt in fig s1 and table s3 hno3 treatment is capable of removing the amorphous carbon and metal catalyst residues introducing functional groups onto the surface and even cutting off the nanotubes gerber et al 2011 similar to pcnt the inner and outer diameter of fcnt h ranged from 5 to 13 nm and 15 27 nm respectively fig s1 a b in addition hno3 oxidation resulted in fcnt h of shorter length better cap opening and more oxygen contained groups verified by ftir spectra in fig s2 the diffraction peaks at 26 43 3 53 5 and 78 observed in the xrd patterns of fcnt h and pcnt was assigned to 002 100 004 and 110 crystal planes reflecting the typical hexagonal graphite structure of mwcnts li et al 2003 a more sharp 002 peak of fcnt h indicated less amorphous carbon on the surface than pcnt the type iv adsorption isotherms with h1 hysteresis loop for both pcnt and fcnt h at relative high pressure 0 4 p p0 0 98 indicated the presence of mesopores sing 2009 table s3 summarizes the specific surface area pore volume and average pore size of pcnt and fcnt h determined by bet method and bjh method respectively a slight increase of the specific surface area and average pore size was detected after hno3 treatment due to the opening of caps and tailored lengths whereas the pore volume decreased chiang et al 2011 3 2 degradation of atz in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h the degradation kinetic curves of atz in different systems are shown in fig 1 both the atz adsorption on fcnt h and degradation by h2o2 alone were negligible 1 8 about 15 of atz was removed by fe iii h2o2 within 30 min while fcnt h alone did not show any catalytic capacity for h2o2 to degrade atz 5 surprisingly the presence of 20 mg l 1 fcnt h dramatically enhanced the removal of atz by fe iii h2o2 92 within 30 min the atz degradation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h could be well represented by the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s3 implying the concentration of the active species be constant throughout the reaction process the apparent rate constant k obs in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was 23 times higher than that in fe iii h2o2 moreover the degradation efficiency was even 32 higher than the classical fenton system fe ii h2o2 also the degradation of other organic contaminants including mb 4 cp ba and nb were 99 4 100 100 and 85 2 within 15 min respectively fig s4 such satisfactory removal of all the selected pollutants suggested a highly efficient generation of non selective active species the performance of fe iii h2o2 cnt for atz degradation was systematically elucidated in terms of the effect of h2o2 concentration fcnt h fe iii mass ratio ph variation and temperature and the results are available in fig 2 and fig s5 as expected the degradation rate improved with increasing h2o2 concentration fe iii dosage and reaction temperature because of the promoted active species generation from the reaction between fe iii and h2o2 mirzaei et al 2017 when fe iii dosage was set as 2 0 mg l 1 the optimized mass ratio between fcnt h and fe iii dosage 10 1 could be available which depended upon the balance between promoting and scavenging active species by fcnt h the k obs of atz degradation was proportional to fcnt h and fe iii dosage when fcnt h fe iii was fixed at 10 1 fig 2 c the initial ph affected the degradation efficiency seriously with the fastest reaction achieved at ph 4 5 when the ph value was above 6 or below 2 atz degradation was very low because of the weakened complexation between fe iii and fcnt h vide infra more attractively the atz degradation rate in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was at least one order of magnitude higher than that in fe iii h2o2 under different conditions fig s5 further demonstrating the great potential of the system in degradation of organic pollutants in water cyclic runs were performed to evaluate the reusability of fcnt h for atz degradation in the background of ultrapure water and tap water respectively fig s6 to our satisfaction fcnt h maintained its constant catalytic activity for atz degradation even in the tap water 3 3 active species it is generally accepted that ho is the major active species in the fenton reaction though it is still controversial whether ferryl is involved here the effect of tba on the atz degradation was studied with dmpo trapped esr spectra performed to identify the active species tba is a typical ho scavenger because of its high reaction rate constant of 5 108 m 1 s 1 with ho acero et al 2000 the effect of tba concentration on the atz removal is depicted in fig 3 and fig s7 atz degradation was greatly inhibited with the increasing tba concentration and 500 mm tba could entirely inhibit the degradation in case of fe iii h2o2 the presence of 500 μm tba could also retard the atz degradation from 14 3 to 0 8 suggesting that ho was the major oxidant in both systems to further confirm the generation of ho in both systems esr spectroscopy was carried out with dmpo as a spin trap agent dmpo can trap ho in aqueous solution to form the dmpo ho adduct with esr signal composed of quartet lines with a peak height ratio of 1 2 2 1 hyperfine constants αn 1 49 mt αh 1 49 mt and g value 2 0055 noda et al 1997 the results in fig 3 b verified that ho was generated in both systems moreover a slight dmpo ho2 signal at the side of the quartet lines in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was also detected noda et al 1997 it was reported that carbon materials were capable of activating h2o2 to produce free radicals fang et al 2014 here bq was used as a model pollutant to verify the formation of ho2 fig s8 no bq oxidation observed in the h2o2 fcnt h system indicated that ho2 was generated mainly from the reaction of eq 1 it should be noted that the role of ho2 in atz degradation was negligible since it was completely inhibited by the added tba the ho and ho2 generation combined with the accelerated decomposition of atz indicated a rapid cycling of fe iii fe ii since fcnt h exhibited no catalytic capacity for h2o2 fe iii should be the only catalyst responsible for h2o2 activation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h fe iii not only exists in the form of hydrated ferric ions but also binds the surface of fcnt h via complexation with surface groups qin et al 2017 given the fact of the slow atz degradation in fe iii h2o2 it was speculated that surface bound fe iii could be effectively recycled to produce ho during h2o2 activation to verify such speculation both the total dissolved fe species and the dissociative fe ii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h and fe iii h2o2 were determined as shown in fig s9 the total dissolved fe species and the dissolved fe ii in the presence of fcnt h were much less than that in fcnt h free for both systems their discrepancy of the two species mainly resulted from the adsorption of iron species on the surface of fcnt h obviously the concentrations of dissolved fe species changed inversely with the degradation efficiency of atz implying the bound iron species onto fcnt h be the veritable active sites for ho generation to further confirm the key role of the surface bound iron species on the h2o2 activation and ho generation we employed ca a strong complexing agent to compete for the fe species with fcnt h as seen from fig 4 the total dissolved iron species increased with the increase of the concentration of ca in the presence of 36 μm of ca almost all the fe species were dissolved due to the 1 1 stoichiometry for the reaction between fe iii and ca field et al 1974 moreover the increased total dissolved iron species accompanied a drop in the atz degradation rate though fcnt h was present at the same dosage fig s10 shows the effect of different dissolved iron species resulting from the ca addition on the formation of ho ss which was calculated from the pseudo first order kinetics of atz degradation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h fig s11 and text s4 a linear relationship r 2 0 923 observed clearly verified the pivotal role of surface bound fe iii on ho generation 3 4 mechanism in the classical fenton system ho is generated from the single electron transfer reaction between fe ii and h2o2 chen et al 2011 in the fe iii related fenton like reaction fe iii is firstly reduced to fe ii by h2o2 and the generated fe ii continues to react with h2o2 to produce ho as the following eqs and and gallard 1999 2 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh ho k 63 m 1 s 1 3 fe ii ho fe iii oh k 3 2 108 m 1 s 1 4 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o k 3 3 107 m 1 s 1 5 fe iii ho2 fe ii o2 h k 1 8 103 m 1 s 1 6 fe ii ho2 fe iii ho2 k 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 however no dissociative fe ii was detected in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h probably because of a rapid oxidation of fe ii and slow reduction of fe iii whatever the result is even insufficient to support the reduction of fe iii yao et al suggested that iron γ aminopyridine immobilized on activated carbon fibers would activate h2o2 to generate ho with the formation of fe iv instead of fe ii yao et al 2014 here we examined the evolution of different iron species including the dissociative fe ii and fe iii the surface bound fe ii and fe iii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h and fe iii fcnt h on the basis of a modified 1 10 phenanthroline method to avoid the hydrolysis and precipitation of fe iii the ph was set as 3 7 for both systems preliminary experiments in fe iii h2o2 suggested that all of iron species remain dissolved throughout the reactions as seen in fig 5 the concentrations of the iron species did not change greatly after the beginning of the reactions in both of the systems the surface bound fe species accounted for 43 7 of the total fe in the absence of h2o2 a small amount of fe ii 6 of the total fe was really generated suggesting that fe iii could be directly reduced to fe ii by fcnt h as expected fe ii in the presence of h2o2 was slightly lower than that in fe iii fcnt h due to the consumption by h2o2 interestingly the concentration of surface bound fe ii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h 3 75 was slightly higher than that in fe iii fcnt h 3 1 even though excess h2o2 would oxidize the generated fe ii rapidly the above result indicated that fe ii formation from the reduction of fe iii did not proceed via the formation of fe iv and there might be another pathway to generate fe ii from the reaction concerning h2o2 as suggested by eqs 4 6 fe iii can also be reduced by ho2 besides h2o2 if sufficient ho2 is generated since dmpo trapped epr spectra demonstrated the formation of ho2 the possibility of fe iii reduced by ho2 should not be ignored certainly more solid evidences are required to further confirm the reduction pathways of fe iii one main obstacle to reveal the reduction pathways of fe iii is the undistinguishable fe ii concentration in different systems due to its rapid oxidation by h2o2 if h2o2 oxidation could be slowed down efficient reduction of fe iii was expected to increase the concentration of the generated fe ii based on such speculation here we selected ferrozine to trap fe ii competing with h2o2 so that h2o2 oxidation could be slowed down and the concentration of generated fe ii could be approximately calculated from the products formed by the reaction between fe ii and ferrozine ferrozine is a specified agent for this experiment on account of three aspects 1 ferrozine complexes with fe ii rapidly so that it is capable of trapping the generated fe ii immediately 2 the formed violet fe ferrozine 3 2 complex is stable at ph 4 9 and can be conveniently detected by uv vis spectrophotometry at λ 562 nm molar adsorption coefficient 25424 m 1 cm 1 as determined in this study 3 the competition between ferrozine and fcnt h for fe iii in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h could be ignored fig s12 gibbs 1976 as observed in fig 6 a a similar amount of fe ii 6 5 of the total fe species was detected in fe iii fcnt h verifying the direct reduction of fe iii by fcnt h fe ii concentration increased rapidly in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h and 75 2 of fe iii was reduced to fe ii which was immediately trapped by ferrozine within 30 min in fcnt h free only 8 of the total fe was identified as fe ii as suggested by stookey 1970 fe iii could also be reduced by ferrozine and 24 25 μg l 1 of fe ii was detected at the end of the reaction moreover the trapping of fe ii retarded the ho concentration seriously as well as the subsequent atz degradation fig s13 although some other factors were not considered such as the presence of the secondary reaction between ferrozine and fe iii as well as the possible change of the reaction balance induced by ferrozine we believe the concentrations of fe ii determined here are generally credible from the above results the direct reduction of fe iii by fcnt h could be verified and fe ii generated via this pathway only accounted for 8 6 of the total generated fe ii most of fe iii was reduced by h2o2 or the intermediates derived from h2o2 i e ho2 o2 to further distinguish the reduction pathways the effect of ho2 o2 scavengers i e tf and sod and h2o2 scavenger i e cat ding et al 2017 huang et al 2013 on the fe ii generation in fe iii h2o2 fcnt h was explored with the results described in fig 6 b and fig s14 only a mild inhibition was observed in the presence of tf and sod and fe ii was barely generated after trapping h2o2 by cat the results indicated that the reduction of fe iii to fe ii was mainly governed by h2o2 to the best of our knowledge the new reduction pathway was clearly demonstrated for the first time in the fenton like systems the formation of fe iii fcnt h was prerequisite for the reduction process it is meaningful to determine the relationship between the functional groups and the catalytic activity hence the performance of several cnt materials including fcnt l pcnt gcnt cnt cooh and cnt coohs calcined at different temperatures were compared boehm titration was used to quantify the functional groups i e carboxyl group lactone group and hydroxyl group the results are described in table s4 also the linear regression of the plot of k obs versus the amount of the specified groups was conducted fig 7 and fig s15 fig s15 reveals a poor linear regression of k obs versus the concentration of hydroxyl groups r 2 0 162 and lactone groups r 2 0 09 suggesting poor relationship between the catalytic activity and these two groups interestingly fig 7 shows the accelerated degradation of atz could be achieved in all of the fenton like systems with carboxylated mwcnts a good positive linear correlation between the carboxyl groups contents and k obs r 2 0 854 indicated that the carboxyl groups on the surface of fcnt h might be of great significance to complex with fe iii and then resulted in an efficient reduction by h2o2 generally the reduction of fe iii in aqueous solution by h2o2 can be divided into two steps 1a fe iii h2o2 feiii ho2 2 h k 3 1 10 3 1b feiii ho2 2 fe ii ho2 k 2 7 10 3 s 1 the equilibrium attains almost instantly after the addition of fe iii to the aqueous solution and the unimolecular decomposition of fe iii hydroperoxo complexes fe ooh is the rate limiting step of fe iii reduction with a very low rate constant of 2 7 10 3 s 1 and and gallard 1999 obviously the complexation of fe iii by fcnt h accelerated the homolysis cleavage of fe ooh to generate fe ii and ho2 complexation may affect the activity of reactants by changing the element chemical states jain et al 2017 here xps analysis on c 1s o 1s and fe 2p of fcnt h before and after fe iii complexation was carried out the presence of fe 2p peak directly verified the existence of fcnt h fe iii fig s16 in fig 8 the deconvolution of c 1s peak suggested the presence of hydroxyl group carbonyl group and carboxyl group which was consistent with fig s2 moreover after fe iii complexation a peak shift towards the lower binding energy was detected in both c 1s 288 9 ev and o 1s peaks 532 ev fig s17 implying the shift of electron density from fe iii to the carboxyl group on the surface of fcnt h jain et al 2017 the electron density migration possibly resulted from the electronegative characterization of the oxygen contained group and the electron withdrawing capacity of π electron depleted regions on the surface of fcnt h as induced by the oxidation treatment chen et al 2008 wang et al 2013 such migration would make the iron center more lewis acidic and shift the peroxide to fe iii charge transfer transition to lower energy kim et al 2001 kunishita et al 2008 on the other hand the ligands will directly affect the spin state and the local dielectric character of the fe iii center then affect the homolysis cleavage of fe ooh kunishita et al 2008 lehnert et al 2001 the high spin state dxy 1dxz 1dyz 1dx2 y2 1dz2 1 of fe iii as affected by the ligand field is expected to result in weaker σ bonding of fe o to be cleavable in the thermodynamic viewpoint dey and solomon 2010 yun et al 2013 besides the ligand field effect the ligands would drastically alter the cleavage of fe o due to the trans effect and steric effect lehnert et al 2001 moreover the steric shielding of the metal center by ligands would reduce the local dielectric character and then increase the redox potential of the complexes also favoring fe iii cu ii reduction through the homolysis of fe o cu o fisher and sligar 1985 kunishita et al 2008 based on the above discussion the mechanism of the accelerated atz degradation in the fenton like system with fcnt h is depicted in scheme 1 an efficient cycling of fe iii fe ii was responsible for ho generation and subsequent strongly enhanced atz degradation only 11 of fe ii generation resulted from the classical reactions in aqueous solution the direct reduction of fe iii by carbonyl groups and quinone groups on the fcnt h surface accounted for 9 of the generated fe ii above all 80 of fe ii was formed via faster reduction of fcnt h fe iii complexes by h2o2 4 conclusions in this study we found that in the presence of fcnt h at 20 mg l 1 a trace fe iii dosage 2 0 mg l 1 along with 170 mg l 1 h2o2 could result in 90 of atz decomposed within 30 min the ho generated from the reaction between fe ii and h2o2 was the dominant active species based on a new method to selectively complex fe ii by using ferrozine the fast fe iii fe ii cycling pathway was verified i e the surface bound fe iii could be effectively reduced by h2o2 the carboxyl groups on the surface of fcnt h played a vital role in fe iii complexation and subsequent fe iii reduction the electron migration from fe iii to fcnt h and the ligand spatial effects induced by the special coordination environment might contribute to such highly efficient fe iii fe ii cycling our findings may have important implications to address the inherent drawbacks of the classical fenton reaction mwcnts will complex with fe iii to enlarge the working ph range ca ph 3 5 and to decrease the dissolved iron species concentration 1 mg l 1 further

sources occurrence composition and dynamics of antifouling paint particles apps were assessed in patos lagoon estuary ple southern brazil ten areas including boatyards a marina and artisanal fishing harbors were identified in the estuarine system as potential sources of apps the apps generated in these areas were highly heterogeneous considering the size shape and composition based on an estimate of antifouling paint usage and amount of boats in each studied area artisanal fishing harbors could be the main source of particles to ple however relatively high amounts of apps which ranged from 130 to 40 300 μg g 1 were detected in sediments collected in front of boatyards and a marina the uneven distribution of apps levels among the sediment samples were probably due to the presence of diffuse sources fishing harbors associated to hotspots boatyards and marina along the study area additionally data of settling experiment indicate that size shape and density of apps combined to local hydrodynamics appears to contribute to the mobility of these residues within the estuary in the main channel of ple smaller particles tend to be transported to adjacent coastal zone while particles tend to be deposited in the sediment surface of sheltered areas since different trace metals and booster biocides were detected in apps that were not correctly disposed these particles can be considered as an important source of contamination to aquatic environments the present data suggest that apps represent an environmental problem for aquatic systems in brazil since the country lacks legislation in addition to inefficient control mechanisms an improvement in boat maintenance processes are urgently needed to avoid this continuous release of apps into the aquatic systems graphical

attachment of marine biofouling almeida et al 2007 this biological settlement is recognized as promoting adverse effects for maritime navigation such as speed reduction and higher fuel consumption due to the friction increase periodical dry docking operations and consequently generation of toxic waste kotrikla 2009 several compounds have been used to formulate antifouling paints almeida et al 2007 castro et al 2011 and up to four different organic or organometallic biocides may be used simultaneously in commercial formulations to boost the toxicity of cupper cu and zinc zn okamura and mieno 2006 after application the biocides used in antifouling paints end up in the water column after gradual leaching from the coatings thus the antifouling efficiency is reduced over time requiring a new paint application singh and turner 2009a the removal of old antifouling paint coating leads to the production of antifouling paint particles apps and this activity usually happens on boat maintenance facilities and shipyards singh and turner 2009a turner et al 2008 considering the lack of residue management by shipyards the apps generated during the maintenance procedures often reach the adjacent aquatic environments kotrikla 2009 after reaching the water column their transport can be influenced by different hydrodynamic processes including deposition resuspension advection and bioturbation turner 2010 although apps may be a considerable contamination source of antifouling biocides to coastal environments eklund et al 2014 thomas et al 2003 turner 2013 their hydrodynamic and consequent spatial distribution are still unknown mainly due to the difficulties on identification of small paint fragments turner 2010 harris et al 1991 applied a numerical model for the tamar estuary england to simulate the dispersion of tributyltin tbt associated to apps however that simulation did not consider the particle size as well as the density of apps thus considering that the methods used for paint removal may produce apps with different size shape and density hasan et al 2014 singh and turner 2009b their transport within the aquatic environment needs to be further investigated the antifouling system convention afs issued by the international marine organization imo highlights the importance of appropriate antifouling waste management to decrease and prevent aquatic contamination imo 2008 however in many countries effective methods for waste disposal were not clearly established nor usually performed champ 2003 considering the lack of specific regulations in south america for correct disposal of apps the present study was undertaken to investigate whether apps represent an environmental problem apps were assessed by investigating sources occurrence chemical composition and environmental dynamics in patos lagoon estuary brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 study area patos lagoon pl southern brazil is the world largest choked lagoon kjerfve 1986 fig 1 it has 250 km in extension and is connected to atlantic ocean through a narrow inlet the pl hydrodynamics depends mainly on freshwater discharge and wind action möller et al 2001 1996 the estuary coves about 10 of pl total surface area fig 1 which however may change depending on the weather conditions during extreme meteorological conditions associated to la niña events seawater can reach up to 150 km into the lagoon due to the intense dry season associated to the sw winds möller and castaing 1999 on the other hand seawater penetration can be restricted to the entrance channel during an el niño event due to the intense rainy season associated to ne winds fernandes et al 2002 maritime traffic is intense in this region with boat maintenance facilities dedicated mainly to fishing and leisure boats in addition large shipyards were mainly engaged in the construction of oil platforms 2 1 1 appraisal of potential sources of antifouling paint particles aiming to identify the main sources of antifouling paint particles apps the study sites were selected based on previous studies reporting boat maintenance facilities such as boatyards and marinas costa et al 2016 costa and wallner kersanach 2013 within patos lagon estuary ple and prior visits 2013 2014 to confirm their suitability samples were also taken from artisanal fishing harbors with more than 100 registered fishermen kalikoski and vasconcellos 2013 each area was characterized regarding their type of work frequency of boat maintenance method of paint removal paint brands used and waste destination the data about the number of vessels repaired were used to identify areas acting as possible sources and to estimate their production of apps fig 1a 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 sediment samples sediment samples were collected in front of each site identified as potential source of apps and along the main navigation channel fig 1 all sediment samples were collected between september and december of 2014 using a stainless steel van veen dredge after collection the samples were transported to the laboratory frozen 20 c and freeze dried before the analyses 2 2 2 apps from boat hulls apps from four different paint brands were manually collected during the maintenance procedures at two different maintenance areas prior to sampling the antifouling paint used by each boat was identified by checking the logbook apps were collected from the floor selected by color and shape the apps were obtained by removing supermarine af ionex renner paint named p1 epoxy primer brand was not identified named p2 and w marine plus weg paint named p5 at santos boatyard and tritão international paint named p3 and micron premium international paint named p4 at yacht club of rio grande ycrg after sampling apps were sieved 180 μm and 1 mm and each fraction was stored for additional analyses only the paint p1 showed fractions between 1 mm and 180 μm but the amount was not sufficient to run the analyses 2 3 occurrence of apps the occurrence of apps in sediment samples was assessed according to takahashi et al 2012 sediment samples were weighted about 100 g and sieved through 500 μm pore size nylon by adding few milliliters of distilled water coarse remaining material on the sieve was transferred to petri dishes and dried during 24 h at 45 c this material was examined using a stereo microscope 5 apps were identified by color and shape among the sediment grains visible apps were retrieved from each sample and stored in petri dishes for additional analysis 2 4 booster biocides and metals in apps and sediments the occurrence of booster biocides irgarol diuron tcmtb and dcoit and metals mn ni cr pb cu sn and zn were investigated in the apps collected from boats hulls apps named p1 p3 p4 p5 and in sediment samples collected in front of source areas and pl navigation channel fig 1 2 4 1 metal analysis metal composition of apps and sediments was analyzed according to soroldoni et al 2017 about 0 2 g of dried apps and whole sediments were weighted followed by addition of 5 ml of concentrated hno3 65 14 4 mol l 1 sigma aldrich and 1 ml of concentrated hf 40 23 mol l 1 merck the digestion was performed in a microwave oven digests were diluted to 25 ml in ultrapure water with successive dilutions 5 2000 times depending on the sample previously to the determination of mn ni cr pb cu sn and zn the elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes using a spectrometer model spectro ciros cdd spectral analytical instruments kleve

analyses of blanks spiked matrices and elements determination in two certified reference materials crms of marine sediment pacs 2 and mess 2 all samples and crms were analyzed in triplicate the limits of quantification loq were 1 0 4 2 0 1 2 6 7 6 7 8 and 0 6 mg kg 1 to cr cu mn ni pb sn and zn respectively 2 4 2 organic booster biocides analysis booster biocides irgarol diuron tcmtb and dcoit were analyzed according to soroldoni et al 2017 an exact amount of dried apps 0 1 g and dried sediments 1 g were weighted in 25 ml glass vials extraction was performed by adding 10 ml of acetonitrile and spiked with 10 ng l 1 of atrazine d5 100 ng l 1 surrogate standard samples were mixed for 1 min sonicated ultrasonic bath 40 khz 132 w 50 c for 30 min and centrifuged 4000 rpm for 7 min the extracts obtained from each sample were pooled diluted to 50 ml with ultrapure water and cleaned up with solid phase extraction c18 cartridges analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate 2 2 ml the eluates were blow down to 0 2 ml under nitrogen flow transferred to a new vial and adjusted to 1 ml with methanol all apps and sediment extracts were analyzed in triplicate by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry lc esi ms ms alliance separations model 2695 waters milford usa using a waters x terra ms c18 column 3 0 50 mm 3 5 μm and mobile phase of 0 1

253 87 198 and 253 87 108 and dcoit 281 91 170 and 281 91 57 since low matrix effects were observed for all analytes in the sediment samples 14 to 3 economou et al 2009 the analytical curves were made in pure ethanol the recoveries based in spiked samples ranged from 70 to 119 with relative standard deviation rsd below 18 the samples recoveries obtained from the surrogate standard atrazine d5 were between 88 and 106 and rsd below 10 the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were 0 1 and 0 5 ng g 1 respectively for diuron irgarol and tcmtb and 0 5 and 1 5 ng g 1 respectively for dcoit 2 5 qualitative elemental composition apps samples too small to metal determination with icp oes i e the sediment samples and one boat hull sample named p2 were qualitatively analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive x ray spectrometry sem eds this powerful technique has been used to identify the elemental composition of a specific area since the intensity of x rays emitted by each element presents direct relationship with its concentration goldstein et al 2003 analyses were performed using a scanning electron microscope model jsm 6610 jeol peabody usa operated at 20 kv and 11 mm of working distance fragments were glued in a double sided carbon tape and sputter coated with a thin film of carbon qualitative elemental analysis was performed using the nss 3 thermo scientific software 2 6 apps dynamics 2 6 1 hydrodynamic transport currents measurements at hourly intervals by a sontek doppler current profiler adp 1 0 mhz were used to estimate the transport of apps at ple the adp is deployed in the center of the entrance channel at 15 m depth fig 1 the longitudinal current velocity for each adp cell was depth integrated according to miranda et al 2002 data corresponding to a wet season highest discharge period from 31st october to 30th november 2005 and dry season lowest discharge period from 1st april to 31st may 2006 were analyzed for the present study for each selected period data of the longitudinal velocity current representing the effect associated to the passage of cold fronts over the area were specifically used for the present analyses in this case the situation started when the water started to flush into the lagoon because of sw winds and finished when the cycle of the seaward flow forced by ne winds stopped river discharge data from the main tributaries were obtained at the data bank of the brazilian national water agency hidroweb ana gov br 2 6 2 settling velocity a settling test combined with hydrodynamics data were used to estimate apps dynamics in ple the settling velocity of apps was measured in graduated cylinders 1 l filled with artificial seawater with intermediate estuarine salinity 15 about 150 mg of each apps sample p1 p2 p3 and p4 were weighed gently dumped in the top of graduate cylinders and the time to reach the bottom 15 cm was recorded the position of apps was visually registered at initial time t0 and after 30 min 1 2 4 6 8 and 24 h the test was performed twice for each experimental condition with and without agitation on an orbital shaker at 30 rpm densities of each apps sample used in the settling test were calculated by monte carlo simulation test using win casino software v2 48 quebec canada the data obtained were expressed as the observed position of most apps added inside the cylinder 2 7 multivariate integration of environmental data the data of sediment concentration of apps metals and booster biocides were integrated to evaluate the associations among these variables as well as to reveal spatial distribution patterns in the study area the raw data was first square root transformed to downweight the effects of extreme values then factor analysis fa with principal component analysis pca as the extraction procedure with varimax normalised rotation was used to reduce the dimension of the original dataset into a matrix showing only the principal components the factors are linear combinations of groups of the original variables only factors explaining more than 10 of the variance on the original dataset were analyzed spatial patterns of distribution of the environmental variables were assessed by estimating the factor scores of each case to the centroid of cases for the original data using statistica software version 12 statsoft 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential sources of antifouling paint particles results indicated ten sites around patos lagoon estuary ple as potential sources of antifouling paint particles apps a barra rio grande fishing harbor b barra são josé do norte boatyard c santos boatyard d quatro irmãos boatyard e alemão boatyard f irmãos fernandes boatyard g yacht club rio grande h bosque fishing harbor i ilha dos marinheiros fishing harbor j ilha da torotama fishing harbor fig 1a and table 1 table 1 describes each area and provides information about the respective main trademarks of antifouling paint used antifouling coatings removal methods boat size and frequency of maintenance and adequacy of residue disposal rio grande shipyard despite being the biggest within ple was not considered as a potential source since it builds only oil platforms that do not routinely require antifouling coatings personal communication rio grande shipyard based on the frequency of boat maintenance and the amount of antifouling paint used in each source area fishing harbors seemed to act as one of the main potential sources of apps in ple table 1 and fig 1a a case study about the small scale fisheries in the pl produced by the food and agriculture organization fao confirmed the presence of about 2300 fishermen spread over 90 different communities along the shores of pl moreover since there are communities from 1 to 5 fishermen up to more than 100 fishermen as those visited in the present study the presence of boats is heterogeneous kalikoski and vasconcellos 2013 thus the removal processes of old paint coating producing apps is probably happening diffusely around most of the ple shore in addition to fishing harbors c d e and g are potential sources of apps to ple on the other hand in spite of more than 100 years of prior operation irmãos fernandes boatyard has not been applying antifouling paints since 2008 therefore it was in this study not considered a potential current source of apps table 1 considering the different trademarks of antifouling paint and methods used to remove old coatings the composition shape and size of apps introduced from different sources are also very heterogeneous the same heterogeneous pattern was described by singh and turner 2009b 2010 for apps collected from a maintenance facility in england the lack of control in the disposal of apps generated during the maintenance procedures was detected in all studied sites thus these areas act as important sources of apps to the aquatic environment and consequently sources of antifouling biocides in addition to other compounds present in the paint formulation 3 2 environmental occurrence 3 2 1 antifouling paint particles from sediment samples analysis performed in sediment samples showed that seven out of ten sites identified as potential sources b c d e f g and h presented apps levels ranging from 0 001 to 44 300 μg g 1 no apps 500 μm were detected in sediments from the navigation channel sites 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 fig 1b sediments collected nearby boatyards b c d e f and g showed the highest levels of contamination while apps were barely detectable at the fishing harbors apps were only detected at bosque h fishing harbors 0 001 μg g 1 therefore although fishing harbors were considered as one of the main potential sources of apps to pl the non detectable levels in sediment samples nearby these areas could indicate that the maintenance of fishing boats is not necessary restricted to the fishing harbors but might happen rather diffusely along the estuary shores in addition these relatively diffuse inputs can also be influenced by local dynamics as will be discussed later 3 2 2 metals and booster biocides in sediments all analyzed metals were detected in sediments table 2 cr cu mn sn and zn were the predominant elements along the navigation channel whilst ni and pb levels were closer to the background levels for sediments of ple niencheski et al 2002 high concentration of mn was found in site 6 located near the mouth of são gonçalo river one of the major tributaries rivers that flow to pl cu was found in all samples with concentration ranging from 53 1 8 to 71 5 2 mg kg 1 zn was detected above the background level 87 4 1 mg kg 1 niencheski et al 2002 in two samples site 3 96 0 3 mg kg 1 and site 4 120 2 mg kg 1 sn was found in all sediment samples from navigation channel ranging from 14 5 0 5 site 3 to 270 120 mg kg 1 site 5 detectable concentrations of some metals were also observed at those areas identified as potential sources of apps a to j high values of cu were found in samples from boatyards and marina b 60 19 mg kg 1 d 91 15 mg kg 1 and g 180 62 mg kg 1 in addition the highest values of zn were found in sediments from boatyards b f and g moreover pb was found at high concentration in sediments from the boatyards b and h among other metals investigated only mn showed high concentration in samples from boatyards e and f even so sediments from fishing harbors a i and j did not show the presence of investigated metals above the background levels for ple except for samples from site h that showed high concentration of pb 85 3 2 mg kg 1 table 2 this contamination might be associated to apps since this was the only fishing harbor site where apps were detected in sediments fig 1b these results indicate that fishing boats are cleaned at several placed happen diffusely along the shore sediments from some boat maintenance areas b c d f and g showed relatively high levels of metals mainly for cu mn sn and zn table 2 the presence of significant amounts of app in these sediments fig 1b may suggest that the metal enrichment could be somehow related in addition boat traffic and moored boats also contribute to the leachate of these metals from antifouling coatings some studies support this hypothesis detecting metal enriched sediments close to boat maintenance facilities kylin and haglun 2010 eklund et al 2014 turner 2013 regarding booster biocides table 2 dcoit sites 8 c f and g and irgarol sites 8 9 f and g were the most frequently detected compounds in sediment samples followed by diuron sites 9 and f and tcmtb sites 8 and g the marina site g table 1 was the most contaminated site showing 27 3 ng g 1 of dcoit in sediments sampled nearby the boat maintenance area the occurrence of these analytes in sediment layers of ship boat traffic areas is related to low water solubility associate to moderate to high log kow castro et al 2011 in fact a recent study detected relevant levels of these booster biocides in sediments sampled nearby marinas commercial harbors and boat maintenance sites from panama batista andrade et al 2018 although tcmtb was not detected in panama levels of irgarol and diuron were in the same order of magnitude as reported in the present study in addition high dcoit concentration 82 ng g 1 were also found associated to the occurrence of apps in sediments of panama thus considering dcoit as a pollutant of emerging concern chen and lam 2017 that even with short half lives can in some cases behave as a pseudo persistent contaminant due to its continuous inputs to the aquatic environment a systematic ecological risk assessment must be performed to prevent aquatic ecosystems from further potential deleterious effects resulting from its indiscriminate use 3 2 3 integrated analysis fa pca of apps metals and booster biocides in the sediments despite the difficulty of understanding and confirming the sources of metals and booster biocides in estuarine sediments since different anthropogenic pathways may act in this environment the integration of these data and concentrations of apps through multivariate analysis showed patterns of associations among them which provide insights about sources and spatial patterns of distribution of groups of contaminants in the study area three factors were extracted from the original dataset after the fa pca which together explained 71 9 of the variance in the original dataset table 3 factor 1 explained 38 of the variance and showed associations among metals cr cu mn ni and zn thus this analysis shows a closely related behavior of the metal concentrations in the study area suggesting that the metals are subjected to the same environmental processes e g the same sources and or same depositional areas the score analysis for factor 1 fig 2 shows that the highest levels of these metals were found mainly in the navigational channel sites 1 2 3 4 6 7 but also at sites representing sources of apps b and f therefore this analysis shows the contribution of sources of metals other than the boat maintenance facilities to the estuary metal contamination in ple can be attributed mainly to agriculture since the lagoon is the main receptor of fluvial waters flowing across extensive croplands in south brazil high levels of mn table 2 for example may be associated to fungicides such as maneb maneb is used as biocide in antifouling paint formulation thomas and brooks 2010 but it is also used in rice and onion cultures an important economic resource for the region garcia 2011 industrial effluents and domestic sewage from cities such as pelotas and rio grande are important contributors for the introduction of contaminants to pl as well niencheski et al 2000 mirlean et al 2003 medeiros et al 2005 the higher concentrations of metals in some boatyards as showed by the positive score of factor 1 for b and f also suggest that these are important sources of metals to the environment factor 2 explained 19 6 of the variance and showed associations between apps and two booster biocides irgarol and diuron this association shows that the presence of irgarol and diuron is directly related to the presence of the apps which suggests that apps can directly contribute to the contamination of the sediments with these booster biocides or apps are subjected to the same environmental processes as irgarol and diuron in the study area i e they have the same sources and or sinks according to the factor scores analysis fig 2 the sites which presented higher concentrations of apps related to higher concentrations of irgarol and or diuron were sites f and g i e close to the sources of apps site 9 also showed a high score due to irgarol and diuron levels in the sediment although apps were absent at this site factor 3 explained 14 4 of the variance and showed relationships among cu zn sn tcmtb and dcoit such association between metals and booster biocides strongly suggest that the origin of these contaminants is related to ship boat activities but the lack of association with apps suggests that apps are not the main contributor of these contaminants to the aquatic sediments within the study area cu and zn are often used as biocides thomas and brooks 2010 or organometallic co biocides e g cu and zn pyrithiones omae 2003 in antifouling paint formulations studies such as singh and turner 2009b and soroldoni et al 2017 found high levels of these metals in apps after paint removal however even in boatyards these metals may also came from other sources such as all sorts of navigation traffic oil waste and zn sacrificial anodes used in boats to prevent corrosion costa and wallner kersanach 2013 since the present data shows a lack of direct association between concentrations of apps and cu and zn tin as tbt was commonly used as antifouling biocide in paints before its prohibition and it is still today found in marine and estuarine sediments e g artifon et al 2016 castro et al 2012 sites 5 8 c and g showed higher scores for this factor suggesting a major influence of ship boat activities with a strong evidence of the role of antifouling paints on the sediment contamination in these sites although apps might not be the main contributor for the contamination of these sites with cu zn sn tcmtb and dcoit the spatial patterns of contamination revealed by the results of the factor scores analysis fig 2 showed a group of sites which do not present relevant sediment contamination sites a h i and j all of them fishing harbors showed negative scores for all three factors as discussed above maintenance activities of small fishing boats are widespread along the pl shores outside of boatyards and marinas which may explain the non detected levels of apps and booster biocides in sediments from fishing harbors 3 3 chemical composition of apps from boat hulls four different apps collected from boat hulls under maintenance had their chemical composition investigated table 4 the presence of three out of four investigated booster biocides in apps from p1 table 4 might indicate that apps derived from scraping of multiple layers which implies some chemical heterogeneity very high concentrations of cu and zn were found which was expected since these metals are routinely added to antifouling paints as toxicants high concentrations of pb were also observed this element has been used in primers which were applied on boat hulls before the antifouling paint however costa et al 2016 have identified pb in different brands of antifouling paint used in southern brazilian boatyards mn ni and cr were found in lower concentrations being normally present within apps composition singh and turner 2009b turner et al 2009 in addition high values of sn were found in two apps p1 and p5 table 4 since tin has never been added into paint formulations as an inorganic element ytreberg et al 2016 these levels might be related to old tbt based coatings tbt and tpt were extensively used in paint formulations up to 2008 when their use was forbidden in international ships yebra et al 2004 castro et al 2011 based on the levels detected in three different apps the antifouling paints used in the boat maintenance facilities investigated contain dcoit in their formulations the highest concentrations of dcoit were found in apps p5 scrapped from a hull painted with w marine plus weg paint which is one of the main antifouling paints used in santos boatyard table 1 dcoit has been reported as the main booster biocide used in leisure boats harino et al 2012 although dcoit has a rapid degradation rate in aquatic environments its half life increases significantly due to the protective effect within apps thomas et al 2003 this allows dcoit to be present in relevant concentrations since its supply is continually replenished these results confirmed the direct relationship between apps and the occurrence of dcoit in sediments as previously showed above and emphasize that apps are an important source of antifouling biocides to estuarine sediments 3 3 1 scanning electron microscopy of apps table 5 summarizes the elemental composition of apps obtained by qualitative analysis using sem eds technique from one boat hull named p2 and sediments these apps samples were too small for metal quantification by icp oes and were qualitatively analyzed by sem eds app p2 showed high relative percentage of fe 15 6 si 16 7 and p 19 0 instead of other elements silicon is used in the primer formulation as silica or siloxanes as well as in binder systems normally as silyl acrylate copolymer almeida et al 2007 although ti al s cu and zn were identified in all apps from sediments si and fe were the predominant elements ranging from 8 2 to 59 2 and from 9 1 to 53 8 for si and fe respectively table 5 these elements are frequently found in antifouling paint formulations and have different functions in these systems lambourne 2000 turner et al 2008 analyzed the composition by sem eds and have found high amount of si and ti in apps collected from a leisure boat maintenance facility of kingsbridge estuary england in plym estuary england singh and turner 2009b detected si ca mg al fe ti cu and zn in paint fragments from a large marine boat maintenance facility ti and fe oxides are mainly used as pigments yebra et al 2004 and al in primers to provide non slip properties almeida et al 2007 in addition metals detected in low percentage such as pb has been used as pigment drier and corrosion inhibitor lambourne 2000 however despite the efforts to phase out all leaded paints who 2010 some countries have no restrictions on its use in any type of paint gottesfeld 2015 in fact significant concentrations of pb were found in different antifouling paint brands used in southern brazil boatyards costa et al 2016 low content of cu and zn were detected in apps retrieved from sediment these levels might indicate that metals used as biocidal and found in high concentration in antifouling paints costa et al 2016 and apps table 3 may be less persistent than more insoluble pigments based on ti and al takahashi et al 2012 the high water solubility of these metals may also account for the lack of association in the fa pca between concentration of apps and concentrations of cu and zn in sediments from the estuary in contrast apps freshly removed from boats showed high relative concentration of cu and zn suggesting a continuous release when apps are in the sediments according to fay et al 2005 the water penetration into paint layer helps to release the most soluble molecules thus the higher solubility of toxic elements i e pb zn and cu confirms the role of apps as a direct source of these elements to water column and sediments the present results are of great environmental relevance since several studies suggest toxic effects on marine organisms caused by direct or indirect exposure to antifouling paint particles eklund et al 2014 gammon et al 2009 turner and hambling 2012 soroldoni et al 2017 3 4 environmental dynamics of apps 3 4 1 settling speed and aquatic transport the settling test performed using apps from four different commercial coatings p1 p2 p3 and p4 indicated that particle size density and stirring may affect the settling velocity density p1 3 1 p4 2 8 p3 2 5 and p2 2 3 g cm 3 seems to affect only particles bigger than 1 mm with and without stirring conditions since the densest settle faster than the least dense ones fig 3 a and c the exception was apps p2 that did not settle after 24 h therefore some particularity in apps p2 composition may be responsible for its different behavior during the settling test this app showed a hydrophobic behavior suggesting that this si p epoxy coating may influence its dynamics in water on the other hand density had little influence in the settling velocity for particles 180 μm without stirring since most of apps p1 p2 p3 and p4 remained in the top of the cylinder after 24 h fig 3b the agitation has apparently helped to break the water superficial tension for apps 180 μm which settled with a certain relationship with particle density p4 2 2 p2 2 3 p1 2 2 and p3 2 1 g cm3 fig 3d since each boat maintenance facility is likely to produce particles with different composition size and shape the present data on settling velocity showed that apps might have heterogeneous behaviors in the aquatic system even so apps distribution along the estuary and adjacent areas will be mainly controlled by pl hydrodynamics under strong hydrodynamic conditions however all types of apps may end up affected by longer range transportation processes and contaminating areas far away from their sources within a couple of hours apps generated within ple are subject to different hydrodynamic scenarios such as high and low river discharge and different ebb and flow conditions controlled by meteorological tides the transport analysis in ple was performed with the average depth of 2 m it was estimated that under a high discharge period with an average current velocity of 0 63 m s 1 24 h would be enough to transport apps in the water column as far as 58 km downstream considering that some sources areas are in the pl access channel apps may reach the coast within 10 h on the other hand during a low discharge period under flood conditions with current velocities of 0 48 m s 1 24 h would be enough to transport apps 41 km upstream therefore in periods of low discharge these apps would be spread over large areas within ple having a longer residence time especially when compared with high discharge periods the pl residence time is 5 days for high discharge periods with a freshwater discharge of 3000 m3 s 1 and will increase to 51 days during low discharge periods with a freshwater discharge about 340 m3 s 1 möller et al 1996 during high discharge periods the estuary acts as a river where particles and substances are quickly transported to the coastal zone under this condition none of apps generated at source sites a c d and e fig 1b would reach the sediment although the freshwater discharge is the main difference in these scenarios strong s sw winds can reduce or reverse ebb fluxes mainly during low river discharge periods in this case particles can stay longer in the estuary or can even reach inner parts of pl but again apps will probably not reach the sediments due to their low settling velocity associated to the high turbulence driven by strong currents in this area on the other hand deposition may occur in more protected areas such as source sites b f g and h fig 1b where the hydrodynamics is much lower however the overall transport of apps from the source areas to pl channel may happens in a very slow rate which explains the lack of apps bigger than 500 μm along sites 1 to 9 table 2 4 conclusions environmental occurrence dynamics and composition of antifouling paint particles apps were for the first time related in a latin american coastal area ten sites around patos lagoon estuary ple were identified as potential sources of apps to the environment composition shape density and size of apps are directly affected by the variety of paint brands and removal methods used although fishing harbors were considered among the largest apps generators the fishing boats maintenance is not concentrated in a single point thus diffuse sources around ple together with strong hydrodynamics of the system may explain the great heterogeneity in the apps spatial distribution even so results indicated that apps generated by boatyards and the marina around ple are being discarded in the estuarine environment since high levels of apps were detected in sediment samples mainly nearby sites f and g moreover apps composition showed the presence of metals cr cu mn ni pb sn and zn and booster biocides irgarol diuron dcoit and tcmtb used in antifouling paints in this regard the measured levels of dcoit denote a particular concern on that emerging pollutant which has also been found in coastal sediments in addition the occurrence of these analytes in sediment samples mainly from sites c f and g indicate apps acts increasing the persistence and as a significant and localized source of hazardous substances to aquatic environment impacted by boat maintenance activities laboratory experiments indicated that water stirring size density and shape of apps may affect their mobility therefore in front of boat maintenance facilities stronger current velocities may increase apps mobility transporting them away from original sources to other areas of pl and or adjacent coastal zone ebb conditions and thus enhancing the relevance of the problem even though the dispersion may decrease local concentration of apps and release of toxic compounds these particles can reach areas far from their source thus apps are an environment problem in areas with relevant ship boat activities since these residues have been overlooked and where specific regulations are either lacking or inefficient and or not properly implemented thus the present scenario is likely to be the same for other areas

sources occurrence composition and dynamics of antifouling paint particles apps were assessed in patos lagoon estuary ple southern brazil ten areas including boatyards a marina and artisanal fishing harbors were identified in the estuarine system as potential sources of apps the apps generated in these areas were highly heterogeneous considering the size shape and composition based on an estimate of antifouling paint usage and amount of boats in each studied area artisanal fishing harbors could be the main source of particles to ple however relatively high amounts of apps which ranged from 130 to 40 300 μg g 1 were detected in sediments collected in front of boatyards and a marina the uneven distribution of apps levels among the sediment samples were probably due to the presence of diffuse sources fishing harbors associated to hotspots boatyards and marina along the study area additionally data of settling experiment indicate that size shape and density of apps combined to local hydrodynamics appears to contribute to the mobility of these residues within the estuary in the main channel of ple smaller particles tend to be transported to adjacent coastal zone while particles tend to be deposited in the sediment surface of sheltered areas since different trace metals and booster biocides were detected in apps that were not correctly disposed these particles can be considered as an important source of contamination to aquatic environments the present data suggest that apps represent an environmental problem for aquatic systems in brazil since the country lacks legislation in addition to inefficient control mechanisms an improvement in boat maintenance processes are urgently needed to avoid this continuous release of apps into the aquatic systems graphical abstract image keywords antifouling boatyards booster biocides estuary fishing harbors metals 1 introduction antifouling paints are used as protective coatings on ship and boat hulls to prevent the attachment of marine biofouling almeida et al 2007 this biological settlement is recognized as promoting adverse effects for maritime navigation such as speed reduction and higher fuel consumption due to the friction increase periodical dry docking operations and consequently generation of toxic waste kotrikla 2009 several compounds have been used to formulate antifouling paints almeida et al 2007 castro et al 2011 and up to four different organic or organometallic biocides may be used simultaneously in commercial formulations to boost the toxicity of cupper cu and zinc zn okamura and mieno 2006 after application the biocides used in antifouling paints end up in the water column after gradual leaching from the coatings thus the antifouling efficiency is reduced over time requiring a new paint application singh and turner 2009a the removal of old antifouling paint coating leads to the production of antifouling paint particles apps and this activity usually happens on boat maintenance facilities and shipyards singh and turner 2009a turner et al 2008 considering the lack of residue management by shipyards the apps generated during the maintenance procedures often reach the adjacent aquatic environments kotrikla 2009 after reaching the water column their transport can be influenced by different hydrodynamic processes including deposition resuspension advection and bioturbation turner 2010 although apps may be a considerable contamination source of antifouling biocides to coastal environments eklund et al 2014 thomas et al 2003 turner 2013 their hydrodynamic and consequent spatial distribution are still unknown mainly due to the difficulties on identification of small paint fragments turner 2010 harris et al 1991 applied a numerical model for the tamar estuary england to simulate the dispersion of tributyltin tbt associated to apps however that simulation did not consider the particle size as well as the density of apps thus considering that the methods used for paint removal may produce apps with different size shape and density hasan et al 2014 singh and turner 2009b their transport within the aquatic environment needs to be further investigated the antifouling system convention afs issued by the international marine organization imo highlights the importance of appropriate antifouling waste management to decrease and prevent aquatic contamination imo 2008 however in many countries effective methods for waste disposal were not clearly established nor usually performed champ 2003 considering the lack of specific regulations in south america for correct disposal of apps the present study was undertaken to investigate whether apps represent an environmental problem apps were assessed by investigating sources occurrence chemical composition and environmental dynamics in patos lagoon estuary brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 study area patos lagoon pl southern brazil is the world largest choked lagoon kjerfve 1986 fig 1 it has 250 km in extension and is connected to atlantic ocean through a narrow inlet the pl hydrodynamics depends mainly on freshwater discharge and wind action möller et al 2001 1996 the estuary coves about 10 of pl total surface area fig 1 which however may change depending on the weather conditions during extreme meteorological conditions associated to la niña events seawater can reach up to 150 km into the lagoon due to the intense dry season associated to the sw winds möller and castaing 1999 on the other hand seawater penetration can be restricted to the entrance channel during an el niño event due to the intense rainy season associated to ne winds fernandes et al 2002 maritime traffic is intense in this region with boat maintenance facilities dedicated mainly to fishing and leisure boats in addition large shipyards were mainly engaged in the construction of oil platforms 2 1 1 appraisal of potential sources of antifouling paint particles aiming to identify the main sources of antifouling paint particles apps the study sites were selected based on previous studies reporting boat maintenance facilities such as boatyards and marinas costa et al 2016 costa and wallner kersanach 2013 within patos lagon estuary ple and prior visits 2013 2014 to confirm their suitability samples were also taken from artisanal fishing harbors with more than 100 registered fishermen kalikoski and vasconcellos 2013 each area was characterized regarding their type of work frequency of boat maintenance method of paint removal paint brands used and waste destination the data about the number of vessels repaired were used to identify areas acting as possible sources and to estimate their production of apps fig 1a 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 sediment samples sediment samples were collected in front of each site identified as potential source of apps and along the main navigation channel fig 1 all sediment samples were collected between september and december of 2014 using a stainless steel van veen dredge after collection the samples were transported to the laboratory frozen 20 c and freeze dried before the analyses 2 2 2 apps from boat hulls apps from four different paint brands were manually collected during the maintenance procedures at two different maintenance areas prior to sampling the antifouling paint used by each boat was identified by checking the logbook apps were collected from the floor selected by color and shape the apps were obtained by removing supermarine af ionex renner paint named p1 epoxy primer brand was not identified named p2 and w marine plus weg paint named p5 at santos boatyard and tritão international paint named p3 and micron premium international paint named p4 at yacht club of rio grande ycrg after sampling apps were sieved 180 μm and 1 mm and each fraction was stored for additional analyses only the paint p1 showed fractions between 1 mm and 180 μm but the amount was not sufficient to run the analyses 2 3 occurrence of apps the occurrence of apps in sediment samples was assessed according to takahashi et al 2012 sediment samples were weighted about 100 g and sieved through 500 μm pore size nylon by adding few milliliters of distilled water coarse remaining material on the sieve was transferred to petri dishes and dried during 24 h at 45 c this material was examined using a stereo microscope 5 apps were identified by color and shape among the sediment grains visible apps were retrieved from each sample and stored in petri dishes for additional analysis 2 4 booster biocides and metals in apps and sediments the occurrence of booster biocides irgarol diuron tcmtb and dcoit and metals mn ni cr pb cu sn and zn were investigated in the apps collected from boats hulls apps named p1 p3 p4 p5 and in sediment samples collected in front of source areas and pl navigation channel fig 1 2 4 1 metal analysis metal composition of apps and sediments was analyzed according to soroldoni et al 2017 about 0 2 g of dried apps and whole sediments were weighted followed by addition of 5 ml of concentrated hno3 65 14 4 mol l 1 sigma aldrich and 1 ml of concentrated hf 40 23 mol l 1 merck the digestion was performed in a microwave oven digests were diluted to 25 ml in ultrapure water with successive dilutions 5 2000 times depending on the sample previously to the determination of mn ni cr pb cu sn and zn the elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes using a spectrometer model spectro ciros cdd spectral analytical instruments kleve

analyses of blanks spiked matrices and elements determination in two certified reference materials crms of marine sediment pacs 2 and mess 2 all samples and crms were analyzed in triplicate the limits of quantification loq were 1 0 4 2 0 1 2 6 7 6 7 8 and 0 6 mg kg 1 to cr cu mn ni pb sn and zn respectively 2 4 2 organic booster biocides analysis booster biocides irgarol diuron tcmtb and dcoit were analyzed according to soroldoni et al 2017 an exact amount of dried apps 0 1 g and dried sediments 1 g were weighted in 25 ml glass vials extraction was performed by adding 10 ml of acetonitrile and spiked with 10 ng l 1 of atrazine d5 100 ng l 1 surrogate standard samples were mixed for 1 min sonicated ultrasonic bath 40 khz 132 w 50 c for 30 min and centrifuged 4000 rpm for 7 min the extracts obtained from each sample were pooled diluted to 50 ml with ultrapure water and cleaned up with solid phase extraction c18 cartridges analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate 2 2 ml the eluates were blow down to 0 2 ml under nitrogen flow transferred to a new vial and adjusted to 1 ml with methanol all apps and sediment extracts were analyzed in triplicate by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry lc esi ms ms alliance separations model 2695 waters milford usa using a waters x terra ms c18 column 3 0 50 mm 3 5 μm and mobile phase of 0 1 acetic acid in methanol at least two ions m z parent ion product ion were selected for multiple reaction monitoring mrm of diuron 232 91 72 and 232 91 160 tcmtb 238 76 180 and 238 76 136 irgarol 1051 253 87 198 and 253 87 108 and dcoit 281 91 170 and 281 91 57 since low matrix effects were observed for all analytes in the sediment samples 14 to 3 economou et al 2009 the analytical curves were made in pure ethanol the recoveries based in spiked samples ranged from 70 to 119 with relative standard deviation rsd below 18 the samples recoveries obtained from the surrogate standard atrazine d5 were between 88 and 106 and rsd below 10 the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were 0 1 and 0 5 ng g 1 respectively for diuron irgarol and tcmtb and 0 5 and 1 5 ng g 1 respectively for dcoit 2 5 qualitative elemental composition apps samples too small to metal determination with icp oes i e the sediment samples and one boat hull sample named p2 were qualitatively analyzed by scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive x ray spectrometry sem eds this powerful technique has been used to identify the elemental composition of a specific area since the intensity of x rays emitted by each element presents direct relationship with its concentration goldstein et al 2003 analyses were performed using a scanning electron microscope model jsm 6610 jeol peabody usa operated at 20 kv and 11 mm of working distance fragments were glued in a double sided carbon tape and sputter coated with a thin film of carbon qualitative elemental analysis was performed using the nss 3 thermo scientific software 2 6 apps dynamics 2 6 1 hydrodynamic transport currents measurements at hourly intervals by a sontek doppler current profiler adp 1 0 mhz were used to estimate the transport of apps at ple the adp is deployed in the center of the entrance channel at 15 m depth fig 1 the longitudinal current velocity for each adp cell was depth integrated according to miranda et al 2002 data corresponding to a wet season highest discharge period from 31st october to 30th november 2005 and dry season lowest discharge period from 1st april to 31st may 2006 were analyzed for the present study for each selected period data of the longitudinal velocity current representing the effect associated to the passage of cold fronts over the area were specifically used for the present analyses in this case the situation started when the water started to flush into the lagoon because of sw winds and finished when the cycle of the seaward flow forced by ne winds stopped river discharge data from the main tributaries were obtained at the data bank of the brazilian national water agency hidroweb ana gov br 2 6 2 settling velocity a settling test combined with hydrodynamics data were used to estimate apps dynamics in ple the settling velocity of apps was measured in graduated cylinders 1 l filled with artificial seawater with intermediate estuarine salinity 15 about 150 mg of each apps sample p1 p2 p3 and p4 were weighed gently dumped in the top of graduate cylinders and the time to reach the bottom 15 cm was recorded the position of apps was visually registered at initial time t0 and after 30 min 1 2 4 6 8 and 24 h the test was performed twice for each experimental condition with and without agitation on an orbital shaker at 30 rpm densities of each apps sample used in the settling test were calculated by monte carlo simulation test using win casino software v2 48 quebec canada the data obtained were expressed as the observed position of most apps added inside the cylinder 2 7 multivariate integration of environmental data the data of sediment concentration of apps metals and booster biocides were integrated to evaluate the associations among these variables as well as to reveal spatial distribution patterns in the study area the raw data was first square root transformed to downweight the effects of extreme values then factor analysis fa with principal component analysis pca as the extraction procedure with varimax normalised rotation was used to reduce the dimension of the original dataset into a matrix showing only the principal components the factors are linear combinations of groups of the original variables only factors explaining more than 10 of the variance on the original dataset were analyzed spatial patterns of distribution of the environmental variables were assessed by estimating the factor scores of each case to the centroid of cases for the original data using statistica software version 12 statsoft 3 results and discussion 3 1 potential sources of antifouling paint particles results indicated ten sites around patos lagoon estuary ple as potential sources of antifouling paint particles apps a barra rio grande fishing harbor b barra são josé do norte boatyard c santos boatyard d quatro irmãos boatyard e alemão boatyard f irmãos fernandes boatyard g yacht club rio grande h bosque fishing harbor i ilha dos marinheiros fishing harbor j ilha da torotama fishing harbor fig 1a and table 1 table 1 describes each area and provides information about the respective main trademarks of antifouling paint used antifouling coatings removal methods boat size and frequency of maintenance and adequacy of residue disposal rio grande shipyard despite being the biggest within ple was not considered as a potential source since it builds only oil platforms that do not routinely require antifouling coatings personal communication rio grande shipyard based on the frequency of boat maintenance and the amount of antifouling paint used in each source area fishing harbors seemed to act as one of the main potential sources of apps in ple table 1 and fig 1a a case study about the small scale fisheries in the pl produced by the food and agriculture organization fao confirmed the presence of about 2300 fishermen spread over 90 different communities along the shores of pl moreover since there are communities from 1 to 5 fishermen up to more than 100 fishermen as those visited in the present study the presence of boats is heterogeneous kalikoski and vasconcellos 2013 thus the removal processes of old paint coating producing apps is probably happening diffusely around most of the ple shore in addition to fishing harbors c d e and g are potential sources of apps to ple on the other hand in spite of more than 100 years of prior operation irmãos fernandes boatyard has not been applying antifouling paints since 2008 therefore it was in this study not considered a potential current source of apps table 1 considering the different trademarks of antifouling paint and methods used to remove old coatings the composition shape and size of apps introduced from different sources are also very heterogeneous the same heterogeneous pattern was described by singh and turner 2009b 2010 for apps collected from a maintenance facility in england the lack of control in the disposal of apps generated during the maintenance procedures was detected in all studied sites thus these areas act as important sources of apps to the aquatic environment and consequently sources of antifouling biocides in addition to other compounds present in the paint formulation 3 2 environmental occurrence 3 2 1 antifouling paint particles from sediment samples analysis performed in sediment samples showed that seven out of ten sites identified as potential sources b c d e f g and h presented apps levels ranging from 0 001 to 44 300 μg g 1 no apps 500 μm were detected in sediments from the navigation channel sites 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 fig 1b sediments collected nearby boatyards b c d e f and g showed the highest levels of contamination while apps were barely detectable at the fishing harbors apps were only detected at bosque h fishing harbors 0 001 μg g 1 therefore although fishing harbors were considered as one of the main potential sources of apps to pl the non detectable levels in sediment samples nearby these areas could indicate that the maintenance of fishing boats is not necessary restricted to the fishing harbors but might happen rather diffusely along the estuary shores in addition these relatively diffuse inputs can also be influenced by local dynamics as will be discussed later 3 2 2 metals and booster biocides in sediments all analyzed metals were detected in sediments table 2 cr cu mn sn and zn were the predominant elements along the navigation channel whilst ni and pb levels were closer to the background levels for sediments of ple niencheski et al 2002 high concentration of mn was found in site 6 located near the mouth of são gonçalo river one of the major tributaries rivers that flow to pl cu was found in all samples with concentration ranging from 53 1 8 to 71 5 2 mg kg 1 zn was detected above the background level 87 4 1 mg kg 1 niencheski et al 2002 in two samples site 3 96 0 3 mg kg 1 and site 4 120 2 mg kg 1 sn was found in all sediment samples from navigation channel ranging from 14 5 0 5 site 3 to 270 120 mg kg 1 site 5 detectable concentrations of some metals were also observed at those areas identified as potential sources of apps a to j high values of cu were found in samples from boatyards and marina b 60 19 mg kg 1 d 91 15 mg kg 1 and g 180 62 mg kg 1 in addition the highest values of zn were found in sediments from boatyards b f and g moreover pb was found at high concentration in sediments from the boatyards b and h among other metals investigated only mn showed high concentration in samples from boatyards e and f even so sediments from fishing harbors a i and j did not show the presence of investigated metals above the background levels for ple except for samples from site h that showed high concentration of pb 85 3 2 mg kg 1 table 2 this contamination might be associated to apps since this was the only fishing harbor site where apps were detected in sediments fig 1b these results indicate that fishing boats are cleaned at several placed happen diffusely along the shore sediments from some boat maintenance areas b c d f and g showed relatively high levels of metals mainly for cu mn sn and zn table 2 the presence of significant amounts of app in these sediments fig 1b may suggest that the metal enrichment could be somehow related in addition boat traffic and moored boats also contribute to the leachate of these metals from antifouling coatings some studies support this hypothesis detecting metal enriched sediments close to boat maintenance facilities kylin and haglun 2010 eklund et al 2014 turner 2013 regarding booster biocides table 2 dcoit sites 8 c f and g and irgarol sites 8 9 f and g were the most frequently detected compounds in sediment samples followed by diuron sites 9 and f and tcmtb sites 8 and g the marina site g table 1 was the most contaminated site showing 27 3 ng g 1 of dcoit in sediments sampled nearby the boat maintenance area the occurrence of these analytes in sediment layers of ship boat traffic areas is related to low water solubility associate to moderate to high log kow castro et al 2011 in fact a recent study detected relevant levels of these booster biocides in sediments sampled nearby marinas commercial harbors and boat maintenance sites from panama batista andrade et al 2018 although tcmtb was not detected in panama levels of irgarol and diuron were in the same order of magnitude as reported in the present study in addition high dcoit concentration 82 ng g 1 were also found associated to the occurrence of apps in sediments of panama thus considering dcoit as a pollutant of emerging concern chen and lam 2017 that even with short half lives can in some cases behave as a pseudo persistent contaminant due to its continuous inputs to the aquatic environment a systematic ecological risk assessment must be performed to prevent aquatic ecosystems from further potential deleterious effects resulting from its indiscriminate use 3 2 3 integrated analysis fa pca of apps metals and booster biocides in the sediments despite the difficulty of understanding and confirming the sources of metals and booster biocides in estuarine sediments since different anthropogenic pathways may act in this environment the integration of these data and concentrations of apps through multivariate analysis showed patterns of associations among them which provide insights about sources and spatial patterns of distribution of groups of contaminants in the study area three factors were extracted from the original dataset after the fa pca which together explained 71 9 of the variance in the original dataset table 3 factor 1 explained 38 of the variance and showed associations among metals cr cu mn ni and zn thus this analysis shows a closely related behavior of the metal concentrations in the study area suggesting that the metals are subjected to the same environmental processes e g the same sources and or same depositional areas the score analysis for factor 1 fig 2 shows that the highest levels of these metals were found mainly in the navigational channel sites 1 2 3 4 6 7 but also at sites representing sources of apps b and f therefore this analysis shows the contribution of sources of metals other than the boat maintenance facilities to the estuary metal contamination in ple can be attributed mainly to agriculture since the lagoon is the main receptor of fluvial waters flowing across extensive croplands in south brazil high levels of mn table 2 for example may be associated to fungicides such as maneb maneb is used as biocide in antifouling paint formulation thomas and brooks 2010 but it is also used in rice and onion cultures an important economic resource for the region garcia 2011 industrial effluents and domestic sewage from cities such as pelotas and rio grande are important contributors for the introduction of contaminants to pl as well niencheski et al 2000 mirlean et al 2003 medeiros et al 2005 the higher concentrations of metals in some boatyards as showed by the positive score of factor 1 for b and f also suggest that these are important sources of metals to the environment factor 2 explained 19 6 of the variance and showed associations between apps and two booster biocides irgarol and diuron this association shows that the presence of irgarol and diuron is directly related to the presence of the apps which suggests that apps can directly contribute to the contamination of the sediments with these booster biocides or apps are subjected to the same environmental processes as irgarol and diuron in the study area i e they have the same sources and or sinks according to the factor scores analysis fig 2 the sites which presented higher concentrations of apps related to higher concentrations of irgarol and or diuron were sites f and g i e close to the sources of apps site 9 also showed a high score due to irgarol and diuron levels in the sediment although apps were absent at this site factor 3 explained 14 4 of the variance and showed relationships among cu zn sn tcmtb and dcoit such association between metals and booster biocides strongly suggest that the origin of these contaminants is related to ship boat activities but the lack of association with apps suggests that apps are not the main contributor of these contaminants to the aquatic sediments within the study area cu and zn are often used as biocides thomas and brooks 2010 or organometallic co biocides e g cu and zn pyrithiones omae 2003 in antifouling paint formulations studies such as singh and turner 2009b and soroldoni et al 2017 found high levels of these metals in apps after paint removal however even in boatyards these metals may also came from other sources such as all sorts of navigation traffic oil waste and zn sacrificial anodes used in boats to prevent corrosion costa and wallner kersanach 2013 since the present data shows a lack of direct association between concentrations of apps and cu and zn tin as tbt was commonly used as antifouling biocide in paints before its prohibition and it is still today found in marine and estuarine sediments e g artifon et al 2016 castro et al 2012 sites 5 8 c and g showed higher scores for this factor suggesting a major influence of ship boat activities with a strong evidence of the role of antifouling paints on the sediment contamination in these sites although apps might not be the main contributor for the contamination of these sites with cu zn sn tcmtb and dcoit the spatial patterns of contamination revealed by the results of the factor scores analysis fig 2 showed a group of sites which do not present relevant sediment contamination sites a h i and j all of them fishing harbors showed negative scores for all three factors as discussed above maintenance activities of small fishing boats are widespread along the pl shores outside of boatyards and marinas which may explain the non detected levels of apps and booster biocides in sediments from fishing harbors 3 3 chemical composition of apps from boat hulls four different apps collected from boat hulls under maintenance had their chemical composition investigated table 4 the presence of three out of four investigated booster biocides in apps from p1 table 4 might indicate that apps derived from scraping of multiple layers which implies some chemical heterogeneity very high concentrations of cu and zn were found which was expected since these metals are routinely added to antifouling paints as toxicants high concentrations of pb were also observed this element has been used in primers which were applied on boat hulls before the antifouling paint however costa et al 2016 have identified pb in different brands of antifouling paint used in southern brazilian boatyards mn ni and cr were found in lower concentrations being normally present within apps composition singh and turner 2009b turner et al 2009 in addition high values of sn were found in two apps p1 and p5 table 4 since tin has never been added into paint formulations as an inorganic element ytreberg et al 2016 these levels might be related to old tbt based coatings tbt and tpt were extensively used in paint formulations up to 2008 when their use was forbidden in international ships yebra et al 2004 castro et al 2011 based on the levels detected in three different apps the antifouling paints used in the boat maintenance facilities investigated contain dcoit in their formulations the highest concentrations of dcoit were found in apps p5 scrapped from a hull painted with w marine plus weg paint which is one of the main antifouling paints used in santos boatyard table 1 dcoit has been reported as the main booster biocide used in leisure boats harino et al 2012 although dcoit has a rapid degradation rate in aquatic environments its half life increases significantly due to the protective effect within apps thomas et al 2003 this allows dcoit to be present in relevant concentrations since its supply is continually replenished these results confirmed the direct relationship between apps and the occurrence of dcoit in sediments as previously showed above and emphasize that apps are an important source of antifouling biocides to estuarine sediments 3 3 1 scanning electron microscopy of apps table 5 summarizes the elemental composition of apps obtained by qualitative analysis using sem eds technique from one boat hull named p2 and sediments these apps samples were too small for metal quantification by icp oes and were qualitatively analyzed by sem eds app p2 showed high relative percentage of fe 15 6 si 16 7 and p 19 0 instead of other elements silicon is used in the primer formulation as silica or siloxanes as well as in binder systems normally as silyl acrylate copolymer almeida et al 2007 although ti al s cu and zn were identified in all apps from sediments si and fe were the predominant elements ranging from 8 2 to 59 2 and from 9 1 to 53 8 for si and fe respectively table 5 these elements are frequently found in antifouling paint formulations and have different functions in these systems lambourne 2000 turner et al 2008 analyzed the composition by sem eds and have found high amount of si and ti in apps collected from a leisure boat maintenance facility of kingsbridge estuary england in plym estuary england singh and turner 2009b detected si ca mg al fe ti cu and zn in paint fragments from a large marine boat maintenance facility ti and fe oxides are mainly used as pigments yebra et al 2004 and al in primers to provide non slip properties almeida et al 2007 in addition metals detected in low percentage such as pb has been used as pigment drier and corrosion inhibitor lambourne 2000 however despite the efforts to phase out all leaded paints who 2010 some countries have no restrictions on its use in any type of paint gottesfeld 2015 in fact significant concentrations of pb were found in different antifouling paint brands used in southern brazil boatyards costa et al 2016 low content of cu and zn were detected in apps retrieved from sediment these levels might indicate that metals used as biocidal and found in high concentration in antifouling paints costa et al 2016 and apps table 3 may be less persistent than more insoluble pigments based on ti and al takahashi et al 2012 the high water solubility of these metals may also account for the lack of association in the fa pca between concentration of apps and concentrations of cu and zn in sediments from the estuary in contrast apps freshly removed from boats showed high relative concentration of cu and zn suggesting a continuous release when apps are in the sediments according to fay et al 2005 the water penetration into paint layer helps to release the most soluble molecules thus the higher solubility of toxic elements i e pb zn and cu confirms the role of apps as a direct source of these elements to water column and sediments the present results are of great environmental relevance since several studies suggest toxic effects on marine organisms caused by direct or indirect exposure to antifouling paint particles eklund et al 2014 gammon et al 2009 turner and hambling 2012 soroldoni et al 2017 3 4 environmental dynamics of apps 3 4 1 settling speed and aquatic transport the settling test performed using apps from four different commercial coatings p1 p2 p3 and p4 indicated that particle size density and stirring may affect the settling velocity density p1 3 1 p4 2 8 p3 2 5 and p2 2 3 g cm 3 seems to affect only particles bigger than 1 mm with and without stirring conditions since the densest settle faster than the least dense ones fig 3 a and c the exception was apps p2 that did not settle after 24 h therefore some particularity in apps p2 composition may be responsible for its different behavior during the settling test this app showed a hydrophobic behavior suggesting that this si p epoxy coating may influence its dynamics in water on the other hand density had little influence in the settling velocity for particles 180 μm without stirring since most of apps p1 p2 p3 and p4 remained in the top of the cylinder after 24 h fig 3b the agitation has apparently helped to break the water superficial tension for apps 180 μm which settled with a certain relationship with particle density p4 2 2 p2 2 3 p1 2 2 and p3 2 1 g cm3 fig 3d since each boat maintenance facility is likely to produce particles with different composition size and shape the present data on settling velocity showed that apps might have heterogeneous behaviors in the aquatic system even so apps distribution along the estuary and adjacent areas will be mainly controlled by pl hydrodynamics under strong hydrodynamic conditions however all types of apps may end up affected by longer range transportation processes and contaminating areas far away from their sources within a couple of hours apps generated within ple are subject to different hydrodynamic scenarios such as high and low river discharge and different ebb and flow conditions controlled by meteorological tides the transport analysis in ple was performed with the average depth of 2 m it was estimated that under a high discharge period with an average current velocity of 0 63 m s 1 24 h would be enough to transport apps in the water column as far as 58 km downstream considering that some sources areas are in the pl access channel apps may reach the coast within 10 h on the other hand during a low discharge period under flood conditions with current velocities of 0 48 m s 1 24 h would be enough to transport apps 41 km upstream therefore in periods of low discharge these apps would be spread over large areas within ple having a longer residence time especially when compared with high discharge periods the pl residence time is 5 days for high discharge periods with a freshwater discharge of 3000 m3 s 1 and will increase to 51 days during low discharge periods with a freshwater discharge about 340 m3 s 1 möller et al 1996 during high discharge periods the estuary acts as a river where particles and substances are quickly transported to the coastal zone under this condition none of apps generated at source sites a c d and e fig 1b would reach the sediment although the freshwater discharge is the main difference in these scenarios strong s sw winds can reduce or reverse ebb fluxes mainly during low river discharge periods in this case particles can stay longer in the estuary or can even reach inner parts of pl but again apps will probably not reach the sediments due to their low settling velocity associated to the high turbulence driven by strong currents in this area on the other hand deposition may occur in more protected areas such as source sites b f g and h fig 1b where the hydrodynamics is much lower however the overall transport of apps from the source areas to pl channel may happens in a very slow rate which explains the lack of apps bigger than 500 μm along sites 1 to 9 table 2 4 conclusions environmental occurrence dynamics and composition of antifouling paint particles apps were for the first time related in a latin american coastal area ten sites around patos lagoon estuary ple were identified as potential sources of apps to the environment composition shape density and size of apps are directly affected by the variety of paint brands and removal methods used although fishing harbors were considered among the largest apps generators the fishing boats maintenance is not concentrated in a single point thus diffuse sources around ple together with strong hydrodynamics of the system may explain the great heterogeneity in the apps spatial distribution even so results indicated that apps generated by boatyards and the marina around ple are being discarded in the estuarine environment since high levels of apps were detected in sediment samples mainly nearby sites f and g moreover apps composition showed the presence of metals cr cu mn ni pb sn and zn and booster biocides irgarol diuron dcoit and tcmtb used in antifouling paints in this regard the measured levels of dcoit denote a particular concern on that emerging pollutant which has also been found in coastal sediments in addition the occurrence of these analytes in sediment samples mainly from sites c f and g indicate apps acts increasing the persistence and as a significant and localized source of hazardous substances to aquatic environment impacted by boat maintenance activities laboratory experiments indicated that water stirring size density and shape of apps may affect their mobility therefore in front of boat maintenance facilities stronger current velocities may increase apps mobility transporting them away from original sources to other areas of pl and or adjacent coastal zone ebb conditions and thus enhancing the relevance of the problem even though the dispersion may decrease local concentration of apps and release of toxic compounds these particles can reach areas far from their source thus apps are an environment problem in areas with relevant ship boat activities since these residues have been overlooked and where specific regulations are either lacking or inefficient and or not properly implemented thus the present scenario is likely to be the same for other areas under the influence of fishing harbors and small and medium sized boat maintenance facilities acknowledgments the research was funded by cnpq project 481267 2013 1 and finep project no 01 11 0038 0
