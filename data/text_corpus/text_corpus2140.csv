10700,coconut palm is an important crop explored as a rich source of oil fiber milk and water in most tropical areas brazil is the fifth largest producer in the world and extensive coastal areas of northeastern brazil are planted with tall coconut however the sustainability of these coconut plantations can be affected by different abiotic stresses including drought mineral nutrition and salinity so the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of tall coconut cocos nucifera l adult plants in cultivated and semi extrativist areas on coast of ceará state in northeastern brazil the study was carried out in four areas irrigated rainfed foreiro coconut trees on coastland owned by the navy and temporarily rented to private individuals and preamar coconut trees in high tide areas owned by the navy the evaluations leaf gas exchanges na on leaf surfaces leaf concentrations of soluble carbohydrates n k p and na soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity were carried out in the dry and rainy seasons between 2015 and 2017 our results indicated that tall coconut palms were subjected to abiotic constraints in three of the four evaluated areas salinity and waterlogging were evident in preamar plants water deficit in rainfed plants and nutritional stress limited the crop yield in rainfed preamar and foreiro areas coconut plants that grew in foreiro area despite the proximity to the ocean were not subjected to salt stress and the higher moisture in lower soil layers significantly reduced the effect of the dry season on photosynthetic rates seawater spray caused accumulation of na on coconut leaf surfaces mainly in the areas close to the sea the repeated salinity stress and waterlogging in high tide area caused a permanent hindrance for carbon assimilation rate limiting the capacity of fruit production by plants current climatic changes leading to the elevation of sea level and intrusion of sea water enhance the general concern on how to maintain these coconut plantations as source of fiber and nutrition to future generations keywords cocos nucifera l tropical crops salt stress water stress mineral nutrition photosynthesis 1 introduction the coconut palm trees cocos nucifera l has as its origin centers the southeast and southern part of the asian continent according to genetic evidences and patterns of occurrence in the world gunn et al 2011 its dispersion occurred naturally carried by oceanic currents from southeast asia to the pacific and indian oceans and by human migration ribeiro et al 2010 considered as one of the main crops of the humid tropics coconut is cultivated by 11 million farmers worldwide naresh kumar 2011 and its commercial exploitation is evident in approximately 93 countries with an annual production of 60 3 million tons of fruit in about 12 3 million hectares faostat 2018 the top five producing countries are india philippines indonesia sri lanka and brazil these countries show the best climatic conditions for this crop including intense solar radiation and relatively high annual rainfall coconut palm trees have been growing in brazil for more than 450 years nowadays the species is distributed along the coast from the equator to the tropic of capricorn approximately 23 26 17 south of the equator with the majority of the plants located on the northeastern coast ribeiro et al 2010 the brazilian northeastern coastline presents favorable conditions to coconut cultivation such as sandy soils high solar radiation balance and precipitation above 1100 mm azevedo et al 2006 ribeiro et al 2010 in this region it is possible to find rainfed and irrigated areas cultivated with different types of coconut i e tall green dwarf and hybrids in addition large areas of coconut plantation can be found close to the beaches where the activity is considered as semi extractive tall coconut predominates in rainfed and beach areas being more rustic and tolerant to the adverse environmental factors especially to water deficit in relation to the hybrid and green dwarf types cintra et al 2009 ribeiro et al 2010 the coconut has a high water requirement cintra et al 2009 carr 2011 each plant of tall coconut may consume from 100 to 150 l per day in irrigated areas of northeast brazil crisostomo and naumov 2009 on the other hand in rainfed areas of this region the plants are subjected to many periods of water deficit throughout the year which affect their development and production however this species presents a variety of morphophysiological anatomical and metabolic changes in response to drought which includes accumulation of osmoregulatory compounds changes in leaf area and root system presence of stomata only on the abaxial leaf surface strong stomatal control thick cuticle hypodermic cell layer epicuticular wax deposition among others rillo et al 1972 rajagopal et al 2005 gomes and prado 2007 gomes et al 2010 solangi et al 2010 silva et al 2016 all these responses help plants to tolerate longer periods of water stress but their productivity is much lower than that observed in irrigated areas associated in many cases with the low supply of nutrients such as n p and k ferreira neto et al 2014 the large areas of coconut palms in the coastal areas are also subjected to seasonal water deficit but to a lesser degree in comparison to areas far from the coast due to the higher total annual precipitation and shallow water table however in these areas near to ocean the plants are subjected to the effects of salty spray or tidal elevation this may promote salt stress in the plants impacting plant production due to the osmotic stress that reduces the water absorption by the roots and specific ionic effects that interfere in the absorption of nutrients and cause toxicity taiz et al 2015 the high occurrence of coconut palm trees in the coastal regions around the world leads many to believe that coconut would be a halophyte a native plant of saline environments however experimental data obtained with seedlings and adult plants indicate that the coconut is a salt tolerant glycophyte with small reductions in growth and yield when irrigated with water of an electrical conductivity up to 5 0 ds m 1 marinho et al 2006 ferreira neto et al 2007 lima et al 2017 considering the different environments and systems of tall coconut cultivation in the coastal areas of northeastern brazil it is possible to infer that plants can be subjected to a combination of different abiotic constraints mittler 2006 such as water deficit salinity and nutritional deficiency our hypothesis is that physiological responses can be used as indicators of the sensitivity of these cropping systems allowing the identification of abiotic factors that contribute most to low crop yield it is worth mentioning that little is known about the ecophysiology of tall coconut palm under conditions of water and salt stresses imposed on adult plants in these environments because it is a crop with long life span 60 80 years the study of coconut ecophysiology becomes of great importance in understanding the maintenance of production under conditions of seasonal or intermittent stresses the analysis of ecophysiological responses may also provide insights into the future of these coconut plantations in the coastal areas which may be impacted by climate changes and sea level elevation renaud et al 2015 kheir et al 2019 so the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of adult plants of tall coconut palm trees cocos nucifera l in irrigated rainfed and semi extractive areas on the coast of the state of ceará in the northeastern region of brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization

between 30 and 40 years within their peak production stage aragão et al 1999 the other soil and plant samplings were carried out in two distinct seasons dry and rainy for two years in october 2015 may 2016 september 2016 and april 2017 all plant evaluations were performed on the leaf 14 counting from the apex located in the middle of the coconut canopy being considered as the reference leaf for mineral nutrition studies of coconut frémond et al 1966 ferreira et al 1997 for analysis whole leaves were collected with the aid of a metal stick 2 3 soil moisture and salinity at each evaluation

test as a prerequisite for analysis of variance by f test then the data were submitted to a two way analysis of variance the means were compared by the tukey s test p 0 05 using statistical software assistat silva and azevedo 2016 the pearson s correlation matrix and principal component analysis pca were performed using spss software v 16 to assess the adequacy of the sample the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were used for the correlation analyzes average soil moisture and salinity data up to 60 cm were used since they were available at all seasons and collection sites 3 results 3 1 profile of soil moisture and salinity the percentage of soil moisture in the irrigated area was around 6 0 in the 0 30 cm layer and 4 8 in the 90 120 cm layer with small differences between the dry and rainy seasons fig 2 on the other hand the soil of the rainfed area presented the lowest values of moisture content in the measurements performed in the dry season with averages around 0 6 in the whole soil profile fig 2a and c in the rainy season mean value of soil moisture content in this area was 3 6 and 7 2 respectively for 2016 and 2017 fig 2b and d the soil moisture content in the foreiro area in the dry seasons was lower than that of the irrigated area only in the superficial layer fig 2a or up to 60 cm depth fig 2c in the rainy seasons the moisture content in foreiro area was higher than in the irrigated area across the soil prolile fig 2b and d on the other hand there was a higher percentage of soil moisture in the preamar environment ranging from 14 2 25 8 along the soil profile in the dry season fig 2a and c and 22 3 27 3 in the rainy season fig 2b and d in general values of soil electrical conductivity ec1 1 showed slight variations in soil profile fig 3 the values of electrical conductivity of the soil of the preamar area stand out as the highest observed followed by the foreiro irrigated and rainfed areas fig 3 additional data collected on high and low tide show clear difference also in water salinity and water table depth in the preamar area on high tide the water depth is closer to the soil surface 34 7 2 1 cm and the salinity level of the water that reaches the roots of tall coconut plants is much higher 12 9 1 7 ds m 1 than the values observed during the low tide 64 7 2 4 cm and 1 1 0 1 ds m 1 respectively the foreiro area despite the proximity to sea bears little resemblance to preamar in terms of soil fig 3 and water salinity data not shown 3 2 concentrations of na on the leaf surfaces the accumulation of na on leaf surfaces varied according to the season and the growing environment table 2 but no influence of the interaction between factors was observed the na accumulation on leaf surfaces were higher in the dry season independent of the area and decreased in the rainy season because of frequent washing with rainwater data not shown the proximity to the sea resulted in higher values of na on the leaf surfaces with the highest averages verified in the preamar area fig 4 a 3 3 mineral and carbohydrates content in the leaves concentrations of n p k and na k ratio in leaf of tall coconut palm trees were significantly influenced by the growing environment but effect of the interaction between the factors were not significant table 2 the foreiro area presented low k concentration fig 4e while the preamar areas showed the lowest nutrient concentrations and the highest values of na k ratio fig 4b the highest levels of n fig 4c and p fig 4d were observed in the irrigated area and the highest levels of k fig 4e were observed in the irrigated and rainfed areas leaf concentrations of total soluble carbohydrate were significantly influenced by the growing environments and season table 2 the highest values of total soluble carbohydrates were observed in the measurement performed in the rainy season of 2016 with no difference among other periods data not shown the plants of irrigated area presented the lowest concentration of these solutes in the leaves fig 4f 3 4 leaf gas exchange parameters in the evaluations of the photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration and internal co2 concentration there was influence of the isolated factors growing area and season as well as of the interaction table 2 the plants in the irrigated area presented the high values and lowest variations of a fig 5 a gs b and e c the rainfed system as expected showed the highest variations and response to the water factor with the photosynthetic rate varying from 3 75 μmol m 2 s 1 in the dry season of 2016 to 11 83 μmol m 2 s 1 in the rainy season of 2017 fig 5a on the contrary it was verified that plants in the foreiro area despite not receiving irrigation presented similar results to those of irrigated area with lower values of a fig 5a and gs fig 5b only in the dry season of 2016 on the other hand the plants in the preamar showed lower values of a and gs but similar or higher values of ci fig 5d in relation to the other growing environments 3 5 pearson correlation matrix and pca pearson correction coefficients table 3 show that soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity correlated positively with each other these two soil variables showed high negative correlation with nutrient leaf concentration and leaf gas exchange and correlated positively with na accumulation on leaf surfaces and with na k ratio in leaves photosynthesis rates showed positive correlation with n leaf concentration and negative correlation with na accumulation on leaf surface and leaf na k ratio high positive correlations were also observed between gs a and e the pca allowed obtaining two main components with eigenvalue higher than 1 0 which explain about 65 of the evaluated data fig 6 the component 1 eigenvalue of 4 59 showed a strong association between ec 0 618 soil moisture 0 747 leaf na k ratio 0 911 and na accumulation on leaf surface 0 818 this component also showed a second group of variables with negative loadings n 0 704 k 0 726 p 0 485 leaf gas exchange also showed negative loadings ranged from 0 233 a to 0 143 e on the other hand component 2 eigenvalue of 1 91 basically shows the strong association between photosynthesis rate 0 867 stomatal conductance 0 968 and transpiration 0 919 4 discussion in our study the irrigated area is of course the reference system where plants are not subjected to substantial levels of abiotic constraints the soil of this area does not present problems of salinity fig 3 and sea water spray is not a relevant constraint fig 4 plants received fertilization according to the recommendations and as a consequence presented high levels of p k and n in the leaves fig 4 the water management irrigation depth and scheduling was satisfactory as indicated by the values of soil moisture fig 2 close to those observed for field capacity and by high values of leaf gas exchanges fig 5 the maintenance of soil moisture at suitable levels also favors the nutrient acquisition by mass flow and diffusion especially in fertile or fertilized soils marschner 2012 these conditions ensure adequate nutrition and high yields of irrigated coconut valicheski et al 2011 in consonance with above discussion the irrigated tall coconut produced during the two years of study on average 97 fruits plant 1 year 1 with estimated productivity of 6 7 t ha 1 information provided by cohibra company a high yield for this type of coconut fontes et al 2003 2015 on the other hand the average productivity in the rainfed system was 20 fruits plant 1 year 1 with estimated productivity of 1 3 t ha 1 for the other environments where the exploration is semi extractive production data are not available however according to cohibra company and farmers information crop yields are similar foreiro or much lower preamar in relation to rainfed area according to fontes et al 2003 the most part of coconut plantations in coastal areas of northeastern brazil do not produce more than 30 fruits plant 1 year 1 and these include basically semi extractives and rainfed plantations with tall coconut these low yields are due to several factors such as environment constraints pests diseases and inadequate or nonexistent crop management taking into account the environmental conditions important questions are raised what abiotic factors contribute most to the low productivity of tall coconut in these areas physiological responses can give us insights related to this first question the pearson correlation matrix and principal component analysis can give some important answers for these questions first soil electrical conductivity showed positive correlation with soil moisture table 3 with high levels of salinity observed in the site with high level of soil moisture these soil variables promoted decrease in the leaf concentration of n and k inhibited the leaf gas exchange and increased the leaf na k ratio there was also high positive correlation between soil variables and na accumulation on leaf surface this last correlation does not indicate a direct cause effect relationship between them since na on leaf surface is related to sea water spray but demonstrates that these problems are intensified by the proximity to the ocean in the preamar area pca shows the separation of two components fig 6 the first component summarizes the variables related to the preamar environment forming a group of variables with positive and strongly related loadings ec soil moisture leaf na k ratio and na on leaf surfaces in contrast to a group of variables with negative loadings related to mineral nutrition n k and p of plant this component also shows negative effects of soil variables on leaf gas exchange but with lower loadings variation of tidal height results in changes of soil moisture and salinity in the root zone in the preamar plants allowing the occurrence of transient stress due to both waterlogging and high salinity especially under high tide the semidiurnal character of the tides indicates that these stresses recur many times throughout the year in this area on the other hand during the rainy season there is an elevation of the water table which can intensify the stress due to saturation of soil but it can relieve salt stress since groundwater accumulated in the aquifers advance towards the sea and cause the salt dilution plants of preamar environment showed the lowest means of n and k fig 4 with contents representing less than half that required for adequate coconut nutrition the lowest levels of n in the leaf 14 of the preamar environment are consistent with the visual observations of leaf chlorosis and with data collected in the year 2017 that showed that the relative chlorophyll index in the tall coconut leaves of preamar area was about half of the value observed in foreiro plants data not shown these reductions in n and chlorophyll content may be indicative of the leaf senescence process which can be induced by the intermittent stresses associated with high salinity and waterlogging taiz et al 2015 ren et al 2016 medeiros et al 2018 the higher na k ratio in the preamar area is due to the accumulation of na data not shown and the reduction in k content fig 4e being an evidence of effect of the competition between these two ions on the membrane absorption sites of the root cells lacerda et al 2003 marschner 2012 the value of this ratio was higher than 1 0 being a strong indicator of toxicity level for glycophytes species tester and davenport 2003 as evidenced by the inhibition of photosynthesis in coconut plants in this area fig 5 plants of the preamar area showed lower rates of photosynthesis than the plants of the irrigated and foreiro areas in both dry and rainy seasons in addition the values observed in the plants of preamar area during the rainy season were similar or lower than those observed in the dry season with the highest mean values observed in the dry season of 2015 fig 5a the positive correlation observed for a x n and negative correlations observed for a x leaf na k ratio and a x soil moisture table 3 can explain largely the inhibition of photosynthesis observed in all evaluations in the preamar a relevant issue in this paper was the unusual observation of a negative correlation between soil moisture and leaf gas exchange table 3 fig 6 this result is explained by the waterlogging condition found in the preamar area that results in low rates of photosynthesis even during the rainy season indicating permanent damage to the photosynthetic apparatus as observed for other plant species ren et al 2016 for foreiro and rainfed environments seasonal water deficit conditions were observed in the 0 60 cm soil layer but the impacts on leaf gas exchange were temporary and less significant noteworthy leaf gas exchange data in plants of foreiro were similar to those of the irrigated area fig 5 except in the dry season of 2016 it is important to note that the year 2016 represented the end of a five years period of drought in the region marengo et al 2017 which resulted in the lowering of the water table even in coastal areas evidenced by low soil moisture content up to 60 cm depth in foreiro area fig 2 for the other periods the maintenance of high photosynthesis rate in this area is justified by the maintenance of high soil moisture and low salinity throughout the soil profile brazilian northeast coast has a sub humid tropical climate but most of its basin including its fresh water sources is inserted in the climatic domain of the semiarid this fact leads to the perception that the water flow upstream of the fluvial marine plain has an intermittent regime and the permanence of its drainage is directly influenced by rainy season the moisture content in the soil profile in the foreiro area largely explains the existence of large plantations of tall coconut near to the beaches since the high values in the sub surface layers throughout the year fig 2 favors the development of plants in this environment where the roots seek water from deeper soil layers especially during the dry season vincke and thiry 2008 it is worth noting that the tall coconut variety has a greater tolerance to water deficit cintra et al 2009 fontes et al 2015 which ensure their survival in these areas even in periods of moderate lowering of the water table levels areas that showed seasonal water deficit foreiro and rainfed presented 15 reduction in leaf n concentration as compared to irrigated area fig 4 indicating the occurrence of moderate nutritional stress although the seasonal water deficit affects the acquisition and transport of n the lack of fertilization during favorable periods of soil moisture is the most important factor impacting crop yield in these areas moreover in foreiro it is evident that there is no great water limitation indicating that the availability of nutrients is the decisive factor for fruit production of coconut plants the reduction in soil moisture up to 60 cm soil depth during the dry season in this area fig 2 may also limit nutrient uptake by mass flow and diffusion marschner 2012 considering that most of the absorbing roots of tall coconut are located in this soil layer lamanda et al 2008 in the rainfed area the leaf concentrations of p and k were not affected fig 4 with values within the adequate range according to saldanha et al 2014 in studies carried out by sobral 1990 it was verified that in tall coconut palm with low productivity the foliar analysis can detect high values of k being this accumulation a consequence of the reduction of the drains on the other hand this higher k accumulation in plants under water deficit conditions can also be justified at least in part by the increased demand for potassium contributing to the osmotic adjustment water absorption stomatal regulation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species wang et al 2013 silva et al 2017 2018 the reduction in a in plants under water deficit was clearly observed in the rainfed area fig 5 where the soil moisture reach value below the permanent wilting point obtained in laboratory 1 5 mpa the high correlation between gs and a table 3 fig 6 seem to indicate strong stomatal regulation in these coconut plants during the dry season passos et al 2005 gomes and prado 2007 silva et al 2017 being a fast and effective response to water loss control possibly modulated by the synthesis and distribution of abscisic acid davies et al 2002 gomes et al 2010 the second component of pca fig 6 showed a strong correlation between leaf gas exchange variables a g s and e indicating the stomatal limitation of the photosynthetic process however the inhibition in the carbon assimilation rate can be also related to non stomatal causes galmés et al 2007 taiz et al 2015 such as reduction of mesophilic conductance and biochemical limitations especially under severe stress conditions galmés et al 2007 in the present study the correlation of g s with ci table 3 was much weaker than between g s and a table 3 fig 6 in addition negative and positive correlations were observed respectively for ci x leaf n concentration and ci x leaf na k ratio these results seem to indicate the occurrence of non stomatal effects notably in the two most stressful environments i e preamar and rainfed however different from preamar area the increase in soil moisture in rainfed area fig 2 associated to the rainy season fig 1 allows the recovery of photosynthesis rate contributing to the seasonal production of fruits by tall coconut plants in this area these results also show the plasticity of tall coconut palms with adaptation mechanisms including changes in root system architecture for survival and production under severe seasonal water deficit gomes and prado 2007 lamanda et al 2008 the damage for carbon assimilation capacity of the plants under salt stress occurs mainly by the reduction of leaf area chlorophyll loss stomatal closure and effects on the photochemical and biochemical stages of photosynthesis sengar et al 2013 taiz et al 2015 the plants of the preamar area presented lesser number of leaflets per leaf table 1 low levels of n fig 4 that correlate with visual symptoms of chlorosis low values of a and gs and high internal concentration of co2 fig 5 these results indicate a severe stress situation caused by waterlogging fig 2 and high salinity fig 3 which acting intermittently through numerous times throughout the year cause permanent hindrance for plants functioning occurrence of dead plants in this environment are in line with this observation which shows the concern with the maintenance of these coconut palm plantations in the future due to the climatic changes that can result in the elevation of the oceans level renaud et al 2015 kheir et al 2019 the results of our work did not identify a significant correlation table 3 between net photosynthesis rate and carbohydrate concentration in the leaves as was also observed in citrus plants by ribeiro et al 2012 a study carried out with african mahogany under water stress showed a direct relationship between these two variables with significant reductions in the rate of photosynthesis and carbohydrate content albuquerque et al 2013 conversely coconut trees in areas with at least one stress factor water salinity and or nutritional were those with the highest total soluble carbohydrates fig 4 this supports the idea that this accumulation may be associated with the osmotic adjustment process necessary for the maintenance of the water absorption under water and salt stress conditions bai and rajagopal 2000 rajagopal et al 2005 gomes and prado 2007 lima et al 2017 another possibility is that the differences in the accumulation of carbohydrate in the leaves are related to the variations in size of sources and drains alves et al 2011 fruit production was much higher in the irrigated area so the carbohydrates produced in photosynthesis should be rapidly translocated to fruits ribeiro et al 2012 on the other hand the absence of strong drains in other environments could lead to the accumulation of carbohydrates in the leaves as observed in the rainfed preamar and foreiro areas 5 conclusions our results indicate different abiotic constraints acting on tall coconut plantations in all evaluated areas except in irrigated system salt stress and waterlogging affect plants in preamar area water deficit impacts on rainfed coconut and nutritional stress limits plant responses under rainfed preamar and foreiro foreiro area despite the proximity to ocean does not present problems of soil and water salinity and the higher soil moisture in subsurface layers of the soil profile significantly reduces the influence of the dry season on the rates of photosynthesis the sea spray causes accumulation of na on the coconut leaf surfaces in all environments highlighting those close to the sea pca and pearson correlation analysis indicate that the transient salinity and waterlogging stresses observed in the preamar area result in lower nitrogen and potassium concentrations in the leaves and a significant increase in the na k ratio these changes cause a permanent hindrance for carbon assimilation rate limiting the capacity of fruit production by plants current climatic changes leading to the elevation of sea level and intrusion of sea water enhance the general concern on how to maintain these tall coconut plantations as source of fiber and nutrition to future generations declaration of competing interest authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements acknowledgments are

10700,coconut palm is an important crop explored as a rich source of oil fiber milk and water in most tropical areas brazil is the fifth largest producer in the world and extensive coastal areas of northeastern brazil are planted with tall coconut however the sustainability of these coconut plantations can be affected by different abiotic stresses including drought mineral nutrition and salinity so the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of tall coconut cocos nucifera l adult plants in cultivated and semi extrativist areas on coast of ceará state in northeastern brazil the study was carried out in four areas irrigated rainfed foreiro coconut trees on coastland owned by the navy and temporarily rented to private individuals and preamar coconut trees in high tide areas owned by the navy the evaluations leaf gas exchanges na on leaf surfaces leaf concentrations of soluble carbohydrates n k p and na soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity were carried out in the dry and rainy seasons between 2015 and 2017 our results indicated that tall coconut palms were subjected to abiotic constraints in three of the four evaluated areas salinity and waterlogging were evident in preamar plants water deficit in rainfed plants and nutritional stress limited the crop yield in rainfed preamar and foreiro areas coconut plants that grew in foreiro area despite the proximity to the ocean were not subjected to salt stress and the higher moisture in lower soil layers significantly reduced the effect of the dry season on photosynthetic rates seawater spray caused accumulation of na on coconut leaf surfaces mainly in the areas close to the sea the repeated salinity stress and waterlogging in high tide area caused a permanent hindrance for carbon assimilation rate limiting the capacity of fruit production by plants current climatic changes leading to the elevation of sea level and intrusion of sea water enhance the general concern on how to maintain these coconut plantations as source of fiber and nutrition to future generations keywords cocos nucifera l tropical crops salt stress water stress mineral nutrition photosynthesis 1 introduction the coconut palm trees cocos nucifera l has as its origin centers the southeast and southern part of the asian continent according to genetic evidences and patterns of occurrence in the world gunn et al 2011 its dispersion occurred naturally carried by oceanic currents from southeast asia to the pacific and indian oceans and by human migration ribeiro et al 2010 considered as one of the main crops of the humid tropics coconut is cultivated by 11 million farmers worldwide naresh kumar 2011 and its commercial exploitation is evident in approximately 93 countries with an annual production of 60 3 million tons of fruit in about 12 3 million hectares faostat 2018 the top five producing countries are india philippines indonesia sri lanka and brazil these countries show the best climatic conditions for this crop including intense solar radiation and relatively high annual rainfall coconut palm trees have been growing in brazil for more than 450 years nowadays the species is distributed along the coast from the equator to the tropic of capricorn approximately 23 26 17 south of the equator with the majority of the plants located on the northeastern coast ribeiro et al 2010 the brazilian northeastern coastline presents favorable conditions to coconut cultivation such as sandy soils high solar radiation balance and precipitation above 1100 mm azevedo et al 2006 ribeiro et al 2010 in this region it is possible to find rainfed and irrigated areas cultivated with different types of coconut i e tall green dwarf and hybrids in addition large areas of coconut plantation can be found close to the beaches where the activity is considered as semi extractive tall coconut predominates in rainfed and beach areas being more rustic and tolerant to the adverse environmental factors especially to water deficit in relation to the hybrid and green dwarf types cintra et al 2009 ribeiro et al 2010 the coconut has a high water requirement cintra et al 2009 carr 2011 each plant of tall coconut may consume from 100 to 150 l per day in irrigated areas of northeast brazil crisostomo and naumov 2009 on the other hand in rainfed areas of this region the plants are subjected to many periods of water deficit throughout the year which affect their development and production however this species presents a variety of morphophysiological anatomical and metabolic changes in response to drought which includes accumulation of osmoregulatory compounds changes in leaf area and root system presence of stomata only on the abaxial leaf surface strong stomatal control thick cuticle hypodermic cell layer epicuticular wax deposition among others rillo et al 1972 rajagopal et al 2005 gomes and prado 2007 gomes et al 2010 solangi et al 2010 silva et al 2016 all these responses help plants to tolerate longer periods of water stress but their productivity is much lower than that observed in irrigated areas associated in many cases with the low supply of nutrients such as n p and k ferreira neto et al 2014 the large areas of coconut palms in the coastal areas are also subjected to seasonal water deficit but to a lesser degree in comparison to areas far from the coast due to the higher total annual precipitation and shallow water table however in these areas near to ocean the plants are subjected to the effects of salty spray or tidal elevation this may promote salt stress in the plants impacting plant production due to the osmotic stress that reduces the water absorption by the roots and specific ionic effects that interfere in the absorption of nutrients and cause toxicity taiz et al 2015 the high occurrence of coconut palm trees in the coastal regions around the world leads many to believe that coconut would be a halophyte a native plant of saline environments however experimental data obtained with seedlings and adult plants indicate that the coconut is a salt tolerant glycophyte with small reductions in growth and yield when irrigated with water of an electrical conductivity up to 5 0 ds m 1 marinho et al 2006 ferreira neto et al 2007 lima et al 2017 considering the different environments and systems of tall coconut cultivation in the coastal areas of northeastern brazil it is possible to infer that plants can be subjected to a combination of different abiotic constraints mittler 2006 such as water deficit salinity and nutritional deficiency our hypothesis is that physiological responses can be used as indicators of the sensitivity of these cropping systems allowing the identification of abiotic factors that contribute most to low crop yield it is worth mentioning that little is known about the ecophysiology of tall coconut palm under conditions of water and salt stresses imposed on adult plants in these environments because it is a crop with long life span 60 80 years the study of coconut ecophysiology becomes of great importance in understanding the maintenance of production under conditions of seasonal or intermittent stresses the analysis of ecophysiological responses may also provide insights into the future of these coconut plantations in the coastal areas which may be impacted by climate changes and sea level elevation renaud et al 2015 kheir et al 2019 so the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of adult plants of tall coconut palm trees cocos nucifera l in irrigated rainfed and semi extractive areas on the coast of the state of ceará in the northeastern region of brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization

between 30 and 40 years within their peak production stage aragão et al 1999 the other soil and plant samplings were carried out in two distinct seasons dry and rainy for two years in october 2015 may 2016 september 2016 and april 2017 all plant evaluations were performed on the leaf 14 counting from the apex located in the middle of the coconut canopy being considered as the reference leaf for mineral nutrition studies of coconut frémond et al 1966 ferreira et al 1997 for analysis whole leaves were collected with the aid of a metal stick 2 3 soil moisture and salinity at each evaluation

leaf gas exchange measurements were collected and immediately washed in distilled water using similar samples size and volume of water in the aqueous extract the na concentration was determined using a flame photometer model 910 m analyser according to malavolta et al 1997 and the amount accumulated on the leaf surface was estimated and expressed in mg kg 1 of leaf dry matter 2 6 mineral nutrients and soluble carbohydrates samples of six intact leaflets from the central part of the leaf 14 were collected eliminating the edges each sample was wrapped in aluminum foil and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen 196 c after freeze dried the samples were ground and used in the preparation of the extracts sulfuric acid for n nitric perchloric acid for p k and na and aqueous for soluble carbohydrates in these materials n p k and na concentrations were determined according to malavolta et al 1997 nitrogen was determined after distillation using a micro kjeldahl device model te0363 tecnal followed by titration na and k were determined using a flame photometer model 910 m analyser and a spectrophotometer model uv 1650pc shimadzu was used for p determination total soluble

test as a prerequisite for analysis of variance by f test then the data were submitted to a two way analysis of variance the means were compared by the tukey s test p 0 05 using statistical software assistat silva and azevedo 2016 the pearson s correlation matrix and principal component analysis pca were performed using spss software v 16 to assess the adequacy of the sample the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were used for the correlation analyzes average soil moisture and salinity data up to 60 cm were used since they were available at all seasons and collection sites 3 results 3 1 profile of soil moisture and salinity the percentage of soil moisture in the irrigated area was around 6 0 in the 0 30 cm layer and 4 8 in the 90 120 cm layer with small differences between the dry and rainy seasons fig 2 on the other hand the soil of the rainfed area presented the lowest values of moisture content in the measurements performed in the dry season with averages around 0 6 in the whole soil profile fig 2a and c in the rainy season mean value of soil moisture content in this area was 3 6 and 7 2 respectively for 2016 and 2017 fig 2b and d the soil moisture content in the foreiro area in the dry seasons was lower than that of the irrigated area only in the superficial layer fig 2a or up to 60 cm depth fig 2c in the rainy seasons the moisture content in foreiro area was higher than in the irrigated area across the soil prolile fig 2b and d on the other hand there was a higher percentage of soil moisture in the preamar environment ranging from 14 2 25 8 along the soil profile in the dry season fig 2a and c and 22 3 27 3 in the rainy season fig 2b and d in general values of soil electrical conductivity ec1 1 showed slight variations in soil profile fig 3 the values of electrical conductivity of the soil of the preamar area stand out as the highest observed followed by the foreiro irrigated and rainfed areas fig 3 additional data collected on high and low tide show clear difference also in water salinity and water table depth in the preamar area on high tide the water depth is closer to the soil surface 34 7 2 1 cm and the salinity level of the water that reaches the roots of tall coconut plants is much higher 12 9 1 7 ds m 1 than the values observed during the low tide 64 7 2 4 cm and 1 1 0 1 ds m 1 respectively the foreiro area despite the proximity to sea bears little resemblance to preamar in terms of soil fig 3 and water salinity data not shown 3 2 concentrations of na on the leaf surfaces the accumulation of na on leaf surfaces varied according to the season and the growing environment table 2 but no influence of the interaction between factors was observed the na accumulation on leaf surfaces were higher in the dry season independent of the area and decreased in the rainy season because of frequent washing with rainwater data not shown the proximity to the sea resulted in higher values of na on the leaf surfaces with the highest averages verified in the preamar area fig 4 a 3 3 mineral and carbohydrates content in the leaves concentrations of n p k and na k ratio in leaf of tall coconut palm trees were significantly influenced by the growing environment but effect of the interaction between the factors were not significant table 2 the foreiro area presented low k concentration fig 4e while the preamar areas showed the lowest nutrient concentrations and the highest values of na k ratio fig 4b the highest levels of n fig 4c and p fig 4d were observed in the irrigated area and the highest levels of k fig 4e were observed in the irrigated and rainfed areas leaf concentrations of total soluble carbohydrate were significantly influenced by the growing environments and season table 2 the highest values of total soluble carbohydrates were observed in the measurement performed in the rainy season of 2016 with no difference among other periods data not shown the plants of irrigated area presented the lowest concentration of these solutes in the leaves fig 4f 3 4 leaf gas exchange parameters in the evaluations of the photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance transpiration and internal co2 concentration there was influence of the isolated factors growing area and season as well as of the interaction table 2 the plants in the irrigated area presented the high values and lowest variations of a fig 5 a gs b and e c the rainfed system as expected showed the highest variations and response to the water factor with the photosynthetic rate varying from 3 75 μmol m 2 s 1 in the dry season of 2016 to 11 83 μmol m 2 s 1 in the rainy season of 2017 fig 5a on the contrary it was verified that plants in the foreiro area despite not receiving irrigation presented similar results to those of irrigated area with lower values of a fig 5a and gs fig 5b only in the dry season of 2016 on the other hand the plants in the preamar showed lower values of a and gs but similar or higher values of ci fig 5d in relation to the other growing environments 3 5 pearson correlation matrix and pca pearson correction coefficients table 3 show that soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity correlated positively with each other these two soil variables showed high negative correlation with nutrient leaf concentration and leaf gas exchange and correlated positively with na accumulation on leaf surfaces and with na k ratio in leaves photosynthesis rates showed positive correlation with n leaf concentration and negative correlation with na accumulation on leaf surface and leaf na k ratio high positive correlations were also observed between gs a and e the pca allowed obtaining two main components with eigenvalue higher than 1 0 which explain about 65 of the evaluated data fig 6 the component 1 eigenvalue of 4 59 showed a strong association between ec 0 618 soil moisture 0 747 leaf na k ratio 0 911 and na accumulation on leaf surface 0 818 this component also showed a second group of variables with negative loadings n 0 704 k 0 726 p 0 485 leaf gas exchange also showed negative loadings ranged from 0 233 a to 0 143 e on the other hand component 2 eigenvalue of 1 91 basically shows the strong association between photosynthesis rate 0 867 stomatal conductance 0 968 and transpiration 0 919 4 discussion in our study the irrigated area is of course the reference system where plants are not subjected to substantial levels of abiotic constraints the soil of this area does not present problems of salinity fig 3 and sea water spray is not a relevant constraint fig 4 plants received fertilization according to the recommendations and as a consequence presented high levels of p k and n in the leaves fig 4 the water management irrigation depth and scheduling was satisfactory as indicated by the values of soil moisture fig 2 close to those observed for field capacity and by high values of leaf gas exchanges fig 5 the maintenance of soil moisture at suitable levels also favors the nutrient acquisition by mass flow and diffusion especially in fertile or fertilized soils marschner 2012 these conditions ensure adequate nutrition and high yields of irrigated coconut valicheski et al 2011 in consonance with above discussion the irrigated tall coconut produced during the two years of study on average 97 fruits plant 1 year 1 with estimated productivity of 6 7 t ha 1 information provided by cohibra company a high yield for this type of coconut fontes et al 2003 2015 on the other hand the average productivity in the rainfed system was 20 fruits plant 1 year 1 with estimated productivity of 1 3 t ha 1 for the other environments where the exploration is semi extractive production data are not available however according to cohibra company and farmers information crop yields are similar foreiro or much lower preamar in relation to rainfed area according to fontes et al 2003 the most part of coconut plantations in coastal areas of northeastern brazil do not produce more than 30 fruits plant 1 year 1 and these include basically semi extractives and rainfed plantations with tall coconut these low yields are due to several factors such as environment constraints pests diseases and inadequate or nonexistent crop management taking into account the environmental conditions important questions are raised what abiotic factors contribute most to the low productivity of tall coconut in these areas physiological responses can give us insights related to this first question the pearson correlation matrix and principal component analysis can give some important answers for these questions first soil electrical conductivity showed positive correlation with soil moisture table 3 with high levels of salinity observed in the site with high level of soil moisture these soil variables promoted decrease in the leaf concentration of n and k inhibited the leaf gas exchange and increased the leaf na k ratio there was also high positive correlation between soil variables and na accumulation on leaf surface this last correlation does not indicate a direct cause effect relationship between them since na on leaf surface is related to sea water spray but demonstrates that these problems are intensified by the proximity to the ocean in the preamar area pca shows the separation of two components fig 6 the first component summarizes the variables related to the preamar environment forming a group of variables with positive and strongly related loadings ec soil moisture leaf na k ratio and na on leaf surfaces in contrast to a group of variables with negative loadings related to mineral nutrition n k and p of plant this component also shows negative effects of soil variables on leaf gas exchange but with lower loadings variation of tidal height results in changes of soil moisture and salinity in the root zone in the preamar plants allowing the occurrence of transient stress due to both waterlogging and high salinity especially under high tide the semidiurnal character of the tides indicates that these stresses recur many times throughout the year in this area on the other hand during the rainy season there is an elevation of the water table which can intensify the stress due to saturation of soil but it can relieve salt stress since groundwater accumulated in the aquifers advance towards the sea and cause the salt dilution plants of preamar environment showed the lowest means of n and k fig 4 with contents representing less than half that required for adequate coconut nutrition the lowest levels of n in the leaf 14 of the preamar environment are consistent with the visual observations of leaf chlorosis and with data collected in the year 2017 that showed that the relative chlorophyll index in the tall coconut leaves of preamar area was about half of the value observed in foreiro plants data not shown these reductions in n and chlorophyll content may be indicative of the leaf senescence process which can be induced by the intermittent stresses associated with high salinity and waterlogging taiz et al 2015 ren et al 2016 medeiros et al 2018 the higher na k ratio in the preamar area is due to the accumulation of na data not shown and the reduction in k content fig 4e being an evidence of effect of the competition between these two ions on the membrane absorption sites of the root cells lacerda et al 2003 marschner 2012 the value of this ratio was higher than 1 0 being a strong indicator of toxicity level for glycophytes species tester and davenport 2003 as evidenced by the inhibition of photosynthesis in coconut plants in this area fig 5 plants of the preamar area showed lower rates of photosynthesis than the plants of the irrigated and foreiro areas in both dry and rainy seasons in addition the values observed in the plants of preamar area during the rainy season were similar or lower than those observed in the dry season with the highest mean values observed in the dry season of 2015 fig 5a the positive correlation observed for a x n and negative correlations observed for a x leaf na k ratio and a x soil moisture table 3 can explain largely the inhibition of photosynthesis observed in all evaluations in the preamar a relevant issue in this paper was the unusual observation of a negative correlation between soil moisture and leaf gas exchange table 3 fig 6 this result is explained by the waterlogging condition found in the preamar area that results in low rates of photosynthesis even during the rainy season indicating permanent damage to the photosynthetic apparatus as observed for other plant species ren et al 2016 for foreiro and rainfed environments seasonal water deficit conditions were observed in the 0 60 cm soil layer but the impacts on leaf gas exchange were temporary and less significant noteworthy leaf gas exchange data in plants of foreiro were similar to those of the irrigated area fig 5 except in the dry season of 2016 it is important to note that the year 2016 represented the end of a five years period of drought in the region marengo et al 2017 which resulted in the lowering of the water table even in coastal areas evidenced by low soil moisture content up to 60 cm depth in foreiro area fig 2 for the other periods the maintenance of high photosynthesis rate in this area is justified by the maintenance of high soil moisture and low salinity throughout the soil profile brazilian northeast coast has a sub humid tropical climate but most of its basin including its fresh water sources is inserted in the climatic domain of the semiarid this fact leads to the perception that the water flow upstream of the fluvial marine plain has an intermittent regime and the permanence of its drainage is directly influenced by rainy season the moisture content in the soil profile in the foreiro area largely explains the existence of large plantations of tall coconut near to the beaches since the high values in the sub surface layers throughout the year fig 2 favors the development of plants in this environment where the roots seek water from deeper soil layers especially during the dry season vincke and thiry 2008 it is worth noting that the tall coconut variety has a greater tolerance to water deficit cintra et al 2009 fontes et al 2015 which ensure their survival in these areas even in periods of moderate lowering of the water table levels areas that showed seasonal water deficit foreiro and rainfed presented 15 reduction in leaf n concentration as compared to irrigated area fig 4 indicating the occurrence of moderate nutritional stress although the seasonal water deficit affects the acquisition and transport of n the lack of fertilization during favorable periods of soil moisture is the most important factor impacting crop yield in these areas moreover in foreiro it is evident that there is no great water limitation indicating that the availability of nutrients is the decisive factor for fruit production of coconut plants the reduction in soil moisture up to 60 cm soil depth during the dry season in this area fig 2 may also limit nutrient uptake by mass flow and diffusion marschner 2012 considering that most of the absorbing roots of tall coconut are located in this soil layer lamanda et al 2008 in the rainfed area the leaf concentrations of p and k were not affected fig 4 with values within the adequate range according to saldanha et al 2014 in studies carried out by sobral 1990 it was verified that in tall coconut palm with low productivity the foliar analysis can detect high values of k being this accumulation a consequence of the reduction of the drains on the other hand this higher k accumulation in plants under water deficit conditions can also be justified at least in part by the increased demand for potassium contributing to the osmotic adjustment water absorption stomatal regulation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species wang et al 2013 silva et al 2017 2018 the reduction in a in plants under water deficit was clearly observed in the rainfed area fig 5 where the soil moisture reach value below the permanent wilting point obtained in laboratory 1 5 mpa the high correlation between gs and a table 3 fig 6 seem to indicate strong stomatal regulation in these coconut plants during the dry season passos et al 2005 gomes and prado 2007 silva et al 2017 being a fast and effective response to water loss control possibly modulated by the synthesis and distribution of abscisic acid davies et al 2002 gomes et al 2010 the second component of pca fig 6 showed a strong correlation between leaf gas exchange variables a g s and e indicating the stomatal limitation of the photosynthetic process however the inhibition in the carbon assimilation rate can be also related to non stomatal causes galmés et al 2007 taiz et al 2015 such as reduction of mesophilic conductance and biochemical limitations especially under severe stress conditions galmés et al 2007 in the present study the correlation of g s with ci table 3 was much weaker than between g s and a table 3 fig 6 in addition negative and positive correlations were observed respectively for ci x leaf n concentration and ci x leaf na k ratio these results seem to indicate the occurrence of non stomatal effects notably in the two most stressful environments i e preamar and rainfed however different from preamar area the increase in soil moisture in rainfed area fig 2 associated to the rainy season fig 1 allows the recovery of photosynthesis rate contributing to the seasonal production of fruits by tall coconut plants in this area these results also show the plasticity of tall coconut palms with adaptation mechanisms including changes in root system architecture for survival and production under severe seasonal water deficit gomes and prado 2007 lamanda et al 2008 the damage for carbon assimilation capacity of the plants under salt stress occurs mainly by the reduction of leaf area chlorophyll loss stomatal closure and effects on the photochemical and biochemical stages of photosynthesis sengar et al 2013 taiz et al 2015 the plants of the preamar area presented lesser number of leaflets per leaf table 1 low levels of n fig 4 that correlate with visual symptoms of chlorosis low values of a and gs and high internal concentration of co2 fig 5 these results indicate a severe stress situation caused by waterlogging fig 2 and high salinity fig 3 which acting intermittently through numerous times throughout the year cause permanent hindrance for plants functioning occurrence of dead plants in this environment are in line with this observation which shows the concern with the maintenance of these coconut palm plantations in the future due to the climatic changes that can result in the elevation of the oceans level renaud et al 2015 kheir et al 2019 the results of our work did not identify a significant correlation table 3 between net photosynthesis rate and carbohydrate concentration in the leaves as was also observed in citrus plants by ribeiro et al 2012 a study carried out with african mahogany under water stress showed a direct relationship between these two variables with significant reductions in the rate of photosynthesis and carbohydrate content albuquerque et al 2013 conversely coconut trees in areas with at least one stress factor water salinity and or nutritional were those with the highest total soluble carbohydrates fig 4 this supports the idea that this accumulation may be associated with the osmotic adjustment process necessary for the maintenance of the water absorption under water and salt stress conditions bai and rajagopal 2000 rajagopal et al 2005 gomes and prado 2007 lima et al 2017 another possibility is that the differences in the accumulation of carbohydrate in the leaves are related to the variations in size of sources and drains alves et al 2011 fruit production was much higher in the irrigated area so the carbohydrates produced in photosynthesis should be rapidly translocated to fruits ribeiro et al 2012 on the other hand the absence of strong drains in other environments could lead to the accumulation of carbohydrates in the leaves as observed in the rainfed preamar and foreiro areas 5 conclusions our results indicate different abiotic constraints acting on tall coconut plantations in all evaluated areas except in irrigated system salt stress and waterlogging affect plants in preamar area water deficit impacts on rainfed coconut and nutritional stress limits plant responses under rainfed preamar and foreiro foreiro area despite the proximity to ocean does not present problems of soil and water salinity and the higher soil moisture in subsurface layers of the soil profile significantly reduces the influence of the dry season on the rates of photosynthesis the sea spray causes accumulation of na on the coconut leaf surfaces in all environments highlighting those close to the sea pca and pearson correlation analysis indicate that the transient salinity and waterlogging stresses observed in the preamar area result in lower nitrogen and potassium concentrations in the leaves and a significant increase in the na k ratio these changes cause a permanent hindrance for carbon assimilation rate limiting the capacity of fruit production by plants current climatic changes leading to the elevation of sea level and intrusion of sea water enhance the general concern on how to maintain these tall coconut plantations as source of fiber and nutrition to future generations declaration of competing interest authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements acknowledgments are

10701,drip irrigation di has been widely used for corn potato and soybean among other crops and its water saving effect has been confirmed by numerous studies however how di affects soil evaporation e crop transpiration t and total evapotranspiration et of wheat in arid regions and how much it can reduce e t and et under sufficient irrigation remain uncertain our study aimed to reveal the effect of di on wheat et by using contrast tests et and soil e were continuously measured in a wheat field with two treatments during 2017 2018 in northwest china by bowen ratio energy balance breb instruments and micro lysimeters simultaneously the two treatments were di and border irrigation bi and the irrigation scheduling for di and bi was based on the local irrigation scheduling in arid northwest china numerous soil e data were missing for rain and irrigation we used the classical shuttleworth wallace model to estimate e et by combining the model with the measured et we obtained the et e and t every day the results indicated that the total wheat et e and t under di were 340 50 and 290 mm in 2017 and 520 99 and 421 mm in 2018 respectively the et e and t under bi were 362 57 and 305 mm in 2017 and 542 99 and 443 mm in 2018 respectively compared to bi di reduced et e and t by 22 3 5 and 18 5 mm on average respectively the et under di was decreased by 4 6 during 2017 2018 the reduction in et under di was primarily caused by the reduction in crop t these changes were due to di significantly lowering the leaf area index by 24 and shortening the crop growth duration by one week our study revealed the effect of di on wheat et and provided new insight for understanding the effects of di on field hydrological and crop growth processes keywords drip irrigation border irrigation evapotranspiration shuttleworth wallace model 1 introduction a shortage of water resources has become a key issue restricting global development with progress and development in science and technology the global population has been increasing along with the demand for water resources and food how to produce more food with minimal water has become the focus of scientists worldwide batchelor et al 1996 deng et al 2006 kang et al 2017 at present drip irrigation di is widely used in arid regions worldwide such as northwest china israel the united states and australia due to its good water saving benefits the application of water saving irrigation technology is an important means of improving water use efficiency according to the china water statistical yearbook ministry of water resources china more than 5 million hectares of farmland in china use di the types of crops for which di has been adopted have been expanded from traditional high value cash crops such as cotton tomatoes grapes greenhouse fruits and vegetables to food crops such as corn potatoes and soybeans di has played an important role in alleviating water resource shortages and improving the efficiency of agricultural water use in arid areas kang et al 2017 many studies on the effect of di on crop water consumption have been conducted the research has mainly focused on three aspects the first is the effect of di on soil evaporation e many studies have confirmed that di can significantly reduce soil e araujo et al 1995 batchelor et al 1996 de pascale et al 2011 the main reason is that di uses a small irrigation amount and high irrigation frequency which can effectively reduce the volume of moist soil lower the average soil moisture content and reduce soil e the second aspect focuses on the effect of di on the transpiration t of crops under di pipes can transport water and nutrients to the root zone of each plant because the irrigation norm is usually small the water nutrients and air in the root zone of the crop can reach the best coupling ratio which provides an optimal root environment for the growth of crops therefore the biomass and yield of the crops under di are generally better than those under traditional border irrigation bi and furrow irrigation liao et al 2008 wang et al 2018 crop t may vary due to changes in leaf area and stomatal opening and research on this topic has not drawn a consistent conclusion the third aspect is the effect of di on the total evapotranspiration et of crops most plot experiments have shown that di can reduce the total crop water consumption by more than 25 compared with traditional bi shrivastava et al 1994 ma et al 2004 panigrahi et al 2008 singh et al 2009 however through a comparative observation of the flux in large corn fields during a five year period we demonstrated that when sufficiently irrigated corn fields that were drip irrigated showed a total water consumption nearly 10 lower than that in border irrigated corn fields meanwhile the t rate of corn plants did not decrease but slightly increased qin et al 2016 2019 these studies mainly focused on crops with wide row spacing such as corn cotton and tomatoes as for wheat fang et al 2018 proved that drip irrigation with higher irrigation frequency improved crop water use and yield under limited water supply however the basin irrigation method was more economic for winter wheat than drip irrigation jha et al 2019 found that compared with flood irrigation winter wheat achieved higher grain yield and water use efficiency under surface drip irrigation with suitable irrigation scheduling di can be applied to irrigate wheat fields with a high density however how di affects e t and total et of wheat in arid regions and how much it can reduce e t and et under sufficient irrigation are still unclear these questions form the scientific foundation for promoting di technology to answer these questions we conducted experiments to compare the flux under di and bi of spring wheat fields in arid northwest china we used two sets of identical bowen ratio energy balance breb instruments to measure the moisture and energy at fixed locations in drip irrigated and border irrigated spring wheat fields we also used micro lysimeters to measure soil e the shuttleworth wallace sw model was used to interpolate the missing soil e and crop t this study aimed to reveal the effect of di on wheat et soil e and crop t 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the two year experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station for efficient water use in agriculture of china agricultural university n 37 49 e 102 52 elevation 1586 m located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china the experimental site is located in a typical continental temperate arid climate zone with a mean annual precipitation of 164 mm an annual temperature of 8 an annual accumulated temperature 0 c of 3550 c an annual pan e of approximately 2000 mm and an annual sunshine duration of 3000 h the groundwater table in this area is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 2016 li et al 2018 the experimental object was spring wheat yongliang 4 and the planting method was machine drilling with a row distance of 15 cm in 2017 and 2018 the sowing date of spring wheat was 28 march and 21 march the harvest date was 21 july and 16 july and the corresponding total growth period was 116 days and 118 days for the two years respectively in this experiment two irrigation treatments di and bi were set up and the dimensions of each experimental field were 50 m 50 m for drip irrigation the emitter flow was 1 38 l h 1 at the work pressure of 0 1 mpa the emitter spacing was 0 3 m and the lateral spacing was 0 6 m the layout and field photos of the experiment are shown in fig 1 the irrigation schedule and the soil wetting proportion for spring wheat from 2017 to 2018 set up on the basis of local irrigation scheduling is shown in table 1 and there was no water deficit during the growing season the precipitation p irrigation amount i and diurnal variation in soil water content swc of drip irrigated spring wheat and border irrigated spring wheat during the observation period are shown in fig 2 2 2 measurements and data collection climatic parameters such as p and wind speed were measured with a standard automatic weather station at the experimental station while air temperature relative humidity and net radiation were observed by a breb system the diurnal variations in wind speed u air temperature ta relative humidity rh and net radiation rn of drip irrigated spring wheat and border irrigated spring wheat during the observation period from 2017 to 2018 are shown in fig 3 in this experiment the breb system consisted of one radiation meter model cnr4 two air temperature and humidity sensors model hmp155 five soil moisture sensors model cs616 two soil heat flux boards model hfp01 and a data collector model cr1000 two sets of identical breb systems were installed in the centre of the spring wheat field under di and bi in 2017 2018 notably the breb system was not put into use until 13 may 2017 throughout the growing season of spring wheat the radiation meter was 1 5 m above the wheat canopy and the two air temperature and humidity sensors were 0 5 m and 1 m above the canopy respectively the three probes moved as the wheat grew five soil moisture sensors were buried at depths of 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 100 cm both soil heat flux boards were 5 cm below the surface with these probes the breb system could monitor longwave radiation shortwave radiation air temperature and humidity at different heights soil temperature and humidity at different depths and soil heat flux all the data were recorded by a data collector with a collection frequency of 30 min in our study the et measured by the breb system was corrected by using the mutual restriction relationship among δt δe and rn g in combination with the energy transfer direction of λet and h perez et al 1999 where λet is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat flux δt and δe are the air temperature difference and the vapour pressure difference between the lower and the upper measurement levels respectively and rn g is the available energy after screening the data qualification rate under drip irrigation was 76 in 2017 and 82 in 2018 and that under border irrigation was 73 in 2017 and 72 in 2018 to verify the reliability of et values estimated by the breb system etbreb the daily average etbreb over 10 day periods was compared with the corresponding daily average et calculated by the water balance method etwb zhang et al 2008 as shown in fig 4 during 2017 2018 the regression equation between etbreb and etwb of the drip irrigated field was etbreb 0 96 etwb and that of the border irrigated field was etbreb 1 09 etwb the coefficients of determination r2 for the two fields were 0 66 and 0 52 the mean bias errors mbes were 0 02 mm d 1 and 0 66 mm d 1 the root mean square errors rmses were 0 97 mm d 1 and 1 33 mm d 1 and the indices of agreement ias were 0 92 and 0 86 respectively the above results indicated good agreement between etbreb and etwb therefore the breb system accurately estimated the et of spring wheat the soil water content swc estimated by the breb system was corrected according to the field measured value obtained by soil auger every 7 days setting six uniform distributed sampling points for each irrigation treatment daily soil e was measured by micro lysimeters made of polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes with a diameter of 10 cm and height of 20 cm the micro lysimeters were installed between wheat rows with 3 replicates set for each treatment and weighted at 19 30 every day the layout of the micro lysimeters is shown in fig 1 b in addition the micro lysimeters would be re installed after irrigation and rain 2 3 description of the et model the sw model can be expressed as

energy balance instruments and micro lysimeters in the observations of spring wheat field flux continuous et data could be obtained using the breb instruments however during precipitation and irrigation the micro lysimeters were unable to accurately measure soil e which caused approximately half of missing e data throughout the growth period in this study the sw model was used to estimate the et and e then the et measured by the breb system and the e measured by micro lysimeters were used to validate the et and e estimated by the sw model if the accuracy of the sw model was high the model was then used to estimate the ratio of e to t e t the missing soil e and t of the spring wheat plants were obtained by multiplying the e t by the breb measured et finally continuous soil e and t data of the spring wheat plants were used to compare di and bi the relationship between the simulated values and observed values is shown in table 3 fig 5 shows the seasonal variation in the et of drip irrigated spring wheat and border irrigated spring wheat estimated by the sw model and measured by the breb method as shown in the figure for both di fig 5a c and bi fig 5b d the patterns of variation shown by the sw model estimates and the breb measured et were almost identical for di fig 5a c the total et estimated by the sw model for 2017 and 2018 was 340 mm and 566 mm respectively with corresponding breb measured values of 340 mm and 520 mm the difference between the estimates obtained with the two methods was less than 8 for bi fig 5b d the model estimates for 2017 and 2018 were 376 mm and 592 mm respectively with corresponding measured values of 362 mm and 542 mm the model error was less than 8 fig 6 shows the scatter plots corresponding to fig 5 based on table 3 and fig 6a to d the sw model estimates were 0 3 4 and 5 higher than the average measured values of breb respectively the r2 values were 0 81 0 80 0 80 and 0 82 the mbes were 0 00 mm d 1 0 20 mm d 1 0 43 mm d 1 and 0 46 mm d 1 the rmses were 0 76 mm d 1 0 86 mm d 1 1 36 mm d 1 and 1 30 mm d 1 and the ias were 0 94 0 94 0 94 and 0 94 respectively the seasonal variation in soil e estimated by the sw model and measured by the micro lysimeters is shown in fig 7 as shown in the figure for both di fig 7a c and bi fig 7b d soil e started to increase from march to april and peaked in early may with the increases in radiation and temperature it then showed a slowly decreasing trend with the growth of the spring wheat canopy the pattern of variation simulated by the sw model was almost identical to the pattern of the measured values throughout the growth period fig 8 presents the scatter plots corresponding to fig 7 as shown in table 3 the e estimated by the sw model in fig 8a to d was 4 5 6 and 15 higher than the average measured values from the micro lysimeters respectively the statistical analysis showed that the r2 values were 0 74 0 72 0 76 and 0 74 the mbes were 0 03 mm d 1 0 05 mm d 1 0 06 mm d 1 and 0 17 mm d 1 the rmses were 0 16 mm d 1 0 19 mm d 1 0 32 mm d 1 and 0 37 mm d 1 and the ias were 0 91 0 91 0 93 and 0 91 respectively in summary as shown in table 3 and figs 5 8 the mbes of the et simulated by the sw model were no greater than 0 46 and the ias were greater than 0 94 the values of simulated e were no greater than 0 05 and the ias were greater than 0 91 therefore the sw model accurately estimated the et and e of the entire growth period of spring wheat it could be adopted to interpolate the missing values of soil e and et of spring wheat plants 3 2 comparison of soil evaporation between drip irrigation and border irrigation many previous studies have shown that di can effectively reduce soil e however whether di has the same effect on spring wheat with a high planting density is not clear in this study soil e was measured using micro lysimeters the missing soil e values were interpolated by multiplying the e et estimated with the sw model by the breb measured values and a continuous soil e dataset was obtained the patterns of variation in soil e under di and bi for the entire spring wheat growing season are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the soil e values under di edi were significantly lower than the corresponding bi ebi values in may and june the two values were more similar in july there was a significant difference between edi and ebi in 2017 fig 9b shows that the patterns of variation in edi and ebi were very similar and there was no significant difference in 2018 this might be related to the almost identical amounts of irrigation applied for the two treatments in 2018 the edi was 13 and 0 lower than the ebi in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 10 shows the scatter plots corresponding to fig 9 as shown in table 4 the r2 values of the two irrigation methods were 0 08 and 0 76 the mbes were 0 10 mm d 1 and 0 00 mm d 1 the rmses were 0 32 mm d 1 and 0 29 mm d 1 and the ias were 0 69 and 0 94 respectively for the entire dataset of 2017 and 2018 edi was on average 6 5 lower than ebi and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the combined data were 0 67 0 04 mm d 1 0 30 mm d 1 and 0 91 respectively during the observation period the edi in may june and july of 2017 was 12 mm 17 mm and 21 mm respectively while the ebi was 20 mm 18 mm and 19 mm the edi in april may june and july of 2018 was 32 mm 40 mm 16 mm and 11 mm respectively while the ebi was 34 mm 38 mm 17 mm and 10 mm the above analysis showed that the patterns of variation in soil e in spring wheat fields were similar between bi and di di reduced the soil e by 3 5 mm per year on average 3 3 comparison of transpiration of spring wheat plants between drip irrigation and border irrigation to reveal the effect of di on the t of spring wheat this study also compared the patterns of variation in t of spring wheat plants in the di and bi treatments as shown in fig 11 in 2017 the t of drip irrigated spring wheat tdi was significantly lower than that of border irrigated spring wheat tbi especially at the end of the spring wheat growing period in 2018 the patterns of variation were very similar tdi was slightly lower than tbi however there was no significant difference between the tdi and tbi as shown in the corresponding scatter plots in fig 12 and according to table 4 the tdi was 5 lower than the tbi in 2017 and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two types of irrigation were 0 34 0 21 mm d 1 1 41 mm d 1 and 0 81 respectively in 2018 the tdi was 5 lower than the tbi and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two were 0 96 0 21 mm d 1 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 99 respectively meanwhile for the entire dataset in 2017 and 2018 the tdi was on average 5 lower than the tbi the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the combined data were 0 84 0 21 mm d 1 0 99 mm d 1 and 0 95 respectively during the observation period the tdi in may june and july of 2017 was 89 mm 126 mm and 75 mm respectively while the tbi was 58 mm 142 mm and 105 mm the tdi in april may june and july of 2018 was 22 mm 137 mm 185 mm and 77 mm respectively while the tbi was 26 mm 143 mm 189 mm and 85 mm the above analysis showed that di reduced the t of the spring wheat plants by an average of 18 5 mm per year 3 4 comparison of evapotranspiration of spring wheat plants between drip irrigation and border irrigation this study also analysed the effect of di on the total et of crops fig 13 shows the pattern of variation in et for the di and bi treatments measured by the breb method similar to the results shown in figs 9 and 11 the etdi was significantly lower than the etbi at the end of the spring wheat growing period in 2017 in contrast the etdi was slightly lower than the etbi in 2018 in 2017 the measured etdi and etbi were 340 mm and 362 mm respectively with a difference of 22 mm between the two in 2018 etdi and etbi were 520 mm and 542 mm respectively with a difference of 22 mm between the two however there was no significant difference between the etdi and etbi the corresponding scatter plots are provided in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 and table 4 the etdi was 6 lower than the etbi in 2017 and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two were 0 09 0 31 mm d 1 1 53 mm d 1 and 0 75 respectively in 2018 the etdi was 4 lower than the etbi and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two were 0 81 0 21 mm d 1 1 34 mm d 1 and 0 95 respectively meanwhile for the entire dataset in 2017 and 2018 the etdi was 5 lower than the etbi on average and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the combined data were 0 70 0 25 mm d 1 1 42 mm d 1 and 0 92 respectively during the observation period the etdi in may june and july of 2017 was 103 mm 141 mm and 96 mm respectively while the etbi was 76 mm 163 mm and 123 mm the etdi in april may june and july of 2018 was 50 mm 202 mm 200 mm and 68 mm respectively while the etbi was 50 mm 200 mm 209 mm and 83 mm the above analysis showed that di reduced the et of spring wheat plants by an average of 22 mm per year 4 discussion 4 1 drip irrigation reduced soil evaporation by an average of 3 5 mm per year our research showed that di reduced soil e by an average of 3 5 mm per year in spring wheat fields the main reason that di reduced soil e was that di reduced the irrigation amount thus reducing the water evaporated during irrigation and the average moisture content of the soil with decreasing soil moisture content soil e can decrease breshears et al 1998 however there was little difference in soil e between di and bi when the irrigation amounts were similar di changed the infiltration form of soil moisture the moist area under di was almost elliptical and should have been much smaller than that under traditional bi nevertheless the experiment was carried out under sufficient irrigation conditions greatly increasing the soil wetting proportion and thus the soil e moreover the hardening of soil under bi hindered the e of water to some extent 4 2 drip irrigation reduced transpiration by an average of 18 5 mm per year our study also found that di reduced the t of spring wheat plants by an average of 18 5 mm per year over a two year period different conclusions have been reached about the effect of di on crop t studies have shown that di can accelerate crop growth qin et al 2016 while increasing the biomass and yield of crops singh et al 2009 mi et al 2013 jha et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and that multiple irrigations with a small amount of water can increase the lai of the crops lv et al 2014 however our experiment found that the lai of spring wheat plants under di was 24 lower than that of spring wheat plants under bi this may have been due to the low irrigation under di in the early stage of crop growth resulting in a significant reduction in the growth of spring wheat and therefore a reduced lai the lower lai reduced crop t nevertheless the yield of drip irrigated spring wheat increased the theoretical yield of spring wheat under di was 8845 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 10 559 kg ha 1 in 2018 and that under bi was 8479 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 8731 kg ha 1 in 2018 in 2017 2018 the theoretical yield under di was 12 6 higher than that under bi the distribution of photosynthetic products in different tissues and organs varies with aspects of irrigation during certain growth and developmental stages of crops in our study spring wheat transitioned from the jointing stage to the flowering stage in may during this period bi had a lower irrigation frequency and greater irrigation amount than di which did not increase the grain yield but promoted the vegetative growth of spring wheat similarly musick and porter 1990 found that irrigation in the early flowering stage of wheat increased straw yield but had little effect on grain yield in other words irrigation from the jointing stage to the flowering stage of spring wheat is of great significance for vegetative growth and reproductive growth additionally we found that di accelerated wheat growth and shortened the wheat growth duration by 1 week the crops did not mature until the threshold accumulated temperature was reached after the beginning of irrigation the temperature of the drip irrigated wheat field was always higher than that of the border irrigated field this should be due to the following two reasons first di was characterized by a smaller irrigation amount and higher irrigation frequency second the lai under di was much lower than that under bi which reduced the shaded area making the wheat field absorb more solar radiation this phenomenon was also observed in our maize experiment qin et al 2016 the shorter growth duration also lowered crop t additionally the lower lai and higher soil temperature increased soil e to some extent under di 4 3 drip irrigation reduced total evapotranspiration by an average of 22 mm per year our research showed that di reduced the total et of spring wheat plants by an average of 22 mm per year this result is consistent with the conclusion of wang et al 2018 but the value is still lower than that measured in some studies by other researchers sugita et al 2017 found that compared with bi di reduced the et of both corn and sugar beet by approximately 1 2 on the one hand the difference in the amount of irrigation between the di and bi in these previous studies was too large on the other hand the results of these studies largely came from experiments conducted in a small area the estimation of et was mainly based on the water balance approach and thus the representativeness of the results was largely uncertain in contrast we used flux comparison experiments conducted over large areas the reliability of the data was obviously better than that in the previous experiments for large areas of di despite the significantly increased soil e the total et was only 5 lower than that under traditional bi because of the lower lai of spring wheat plants 5 conclusion in this study the et e and t of spring wheat under di and bi were obtained in 2017 and 2018 by an approach combining large area fixed location field experiments and model estimations compared with bi di reduced the e t and et of spring wheat plants by an average of 3 5 mm 18 5 mm and 22 mm per year respectively the et under di was decreased by 4 6 during 2017 2018 the decline in et was significantly smaller than that observed in traditional small area experiments this conclusion provides an

10701,drip irrigation di has been widely used for corn potato and soybean among other crops and its water saving effect has been confirmed by numerous studies however how di affects soil evaporation e crop transpiration t and total evapotranspiration et of wheat in arid regions and how much it can reduce e t and et under sufficient irrigation remain uncertain our study aimed to reveal the effect of di on wheat et by using contrast tests et and soil e were continuously measured in a wheat field with two treatments during 2017 2018 in northwest china by bowen ratio energy balance breb instruments and micro lysimeters simultaneously the two treatments were di and border irrigation bi and the irrigation scheduling for di and bi was based on the local irrigation scheduling in arid northwest china numerous soil e data were missing for rain and irrigation we used the classical shuttleworth wallace model to estimate e et by combining the model with the measured et we obtained the et e and t every day the results indicated that the total wheat et e and t under di were 340 50 and 290 mm in 2017 and 520 99 and 421 mm in 2018 respectively the et e and t under bi were 362 57 and 305 mm in 2017 and 542 99 and 443 mm in 2018 respectively compared to bi di reduced et e and t by 22 3 5 and 18 5 mm on average respectively the et under di was decreased by 4 6 during 2017 2018 the reduction in et under di was primarily caused by the reduction in crop t these changes were due to di significantly lowering the leaf area index by 24 and shortening the crop growth duration by one week our study revealed the effect of di on wheat et and provided new insight for understanding the effects of di on field hydrological and crop growth processes keywords drip irrigation border irrigation evapotranspiration shuttleworth wallace model 1 introduction a shortage of water resources has become a key issue restricting global development with progress and development in science and technology the global population has been increasing along with the demand for water resources and food how to produce more food with minimal water has become the focus of scientists worldwide batchelor et al 1996 deng et al 2006 kang et al 2017 at present drip irrigation di is widely used in arid regions worldwide such as northwest china israel the united states and australia due to its good water saving benefits the application of water saving irrigation technology is an important means of improving water use efficiency according to the china water statistical yearbook ministry of water resources china more than 5 million hectares of farmland in china use di the types of crops for which di has been adopted have been expanded from traditional high value cash crops such as cotton tomatoes grapes greenhouse fruits and vegetables to food crops such as corn potatoes and soybeans di has played an important role in alleviating water resource shortages and improving the efficiency of agricultural water use in arid areas kang et al 2017 many studies on the effect of di on crop water consumption have been conducted the research has mainly focused on three aspects the first is the effect of di on soil evaporation e many studies have confirmed that di can significantly reduce soil e araujo et al 1995 batchelor et al 1996 de pascale et al 2011 the main reason is that di uses a small irrigation amount and high irrigation frequency which can effectively reduce the volume of moist soil lower the average soil moisture content and reduce soil e the second aspect focuses on the effect of di on the transpiration t of crops under di pipes can transport water and nutrients to the root zone of each plant because the irrigation norm is usually small the water nutrients and air in the root zone of the crop can reach the best coupling ratio which provides an optimal root environment for the growth of crops therefore the biomass and yield of the crops under di are generally better than those under traditional border irrigation bi and furrow irrigation liao et al 2008 wang et al 2018 crop t may vary due to changes in leaf area and stomatal opening and research on this topic has not drawn a consistent conclusion the third aspect is the effect of di on the total evapotranspiration et of crops most plot experiments have shown that di can reduce the total crop water consumption by more than 25 compared with traditional bi shrivastava et al 1994 ma et al 2004 panigrahi et al 2008 singh et al 2009 however through a comparative observation of the flux in large corn fields during a five year period we demonstrated that when sufficiently irrigated corn fields that were drip irrigated showed a total water consumption nearly 10 lower than that in border irrigated corn fields meanwhile the t rate of corn plants did not decrease but slightly increased qin et al 2016 2019 these studies mainly focused on crops with wide row spacing such as corn cotton and tomatoes as for wheat fang et al 2018 proved that drip irrigation with higher irrigation frequency improved crop water use and yield under limited water supply however the basin irrigation method was more economic for winter wheat than drip irrigation jha et al 2019 found that compared with flood irrigation winter wheat achieved higher grain yield and water use efficiency under surface drip irrigation with suitable irrigation scheduling di can be applied to irrigate wheat fields with a high density however how di affects e t and total et of wheat in arid regions and how much it can reduce e t and et under sufficient irrigation are still unclear these questions form the scientific foundation for promoting di technology to answer these questions we conducted experiments to compare the flux under di and bi of spring wheat fields in arid northwest china we used two sets of identical bowen ratio energy balance breb instruments to measure the moisture and energy at fixed locations in drip irrigated and border irrigated spring wheat fields we also used micro lysimeters to measure soil e the shuttleworth wallace sw model was used to interpolate the missing soil e and crop t this study aimed to reveal the effect of di on wheat et soil e and crop t 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and design the two year experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station for efficient water use in agriculture of china agricultural university n 37 49 e 102 52 elevation 1586 m located in wuwei city gansu province northwest china the experimental site is located in a typical continental temperate arid climate zone with a mean annual precipitation of 164 mm an annual temperature of 8 an annual accumulated temperature 0 c of 3550 c an annual pan e of approximately 2000 mm and an annual sunshine duration of 3000 h the groundwater table in this area is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 2016 li et al 2018 the experimental object was spring wheat yongliang 4 and the planting method was machine drilling with a row distance of 15 cm in 2017 and 2018 the sowing date of spring wheat was 28 march and 21 march the harvest date was 21 july and 16 july and the corresponding total growth period was 116 days and 118 days for the two years respectively in this experiment two irrigation treatments di and bi were set up and the dimensions of each experimental field were 50 m 50 m for drip irrigation the emitter flow was 1 38 l h 1 at the work pressure of 0 1 mpa the emitter spacing was 0 3 m and the lateral spacing was 0 6 m the layout and field photos of the experiment are shown in fig 1 the irrigation schedule and the soil wetting proportion for spring wheat from 2017 to 2018 set up on the basis of local irrigation scheduling is shown in table 1 and there was no water deficit during the growing season the precipitation p irrigation amount i and diurnal variation in soil water content swc of drip irrigated spring wheat and border irrigated spring wheat during the observation period are shown in fig 2 2 2 measurements and data collection climatic parameters such as p and wind speed were measured with a standard automatic weather station at the experimental station while air temperature relative humidity and net radiation were observed by a breb system the diurnal variations in wind speed u air temperature ta relative humidity rh and net radiation rn of drip irrigated spring wheat and border irrigated spring wheat during the observation period from 2017 to 2018 are shown in fig 3 in this experiment the breb system consisted of one radiation meter model cnr4 two air temperature and humidity sensors model hmp155 five soil moisture sensors model cs616 two soil heat flux boards model hfp01 and a data collector model cr1000 two sets of identical breb systems were installed in the centre of the spring wheat field under di and bi in 2017 2018 notably the breb system was not put into use until 13 may 2017 throughout the growing season of spring wheat the radiation meter was 1 5 m above the wheat canopy and the two air temperature and humidity sensors were 0 5 m and 1 m above the canopy respectively the three probes moved as the wheat grew five soil moisture sensors were buried at depths of 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 100 cm both soil heat flux boards were 5 cm below the surface with these probes the breb system could monitor longwave radiation shortwave radiation air temperature and humidity at different heights soil temperature and humidity at different depths and soil heat flux all the data were recorded by a data collector with a collection frequency of 30 min in our study the et measured by the breb system was corrected by using the mutual restriction relationship among δt δe and rn g in combination with the energy transfer direction of λet and h perez et al 1999 where λet is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat flux δt and δe are the air temperature difference and the vapour pressure difference between the lower and the upper measurement levels respectively and rn g is the available energy after screening the data qualification rate under drip irrigation was 76 in 2017 and 82 in 2018 and that under border irrigation was 73 in 2017 and 72 in 2018 to verify the reliability of et values estimated by the breb system etbreb the daily average etbreb over 10 day periods was compared with the corresponding daily average et calculated by the water balance method etwb zhang et al 2008 as shown in fig 4 during 2017 2018 the regression equation between etbreb and etwb of the drip irrigated field was etbreb 0 96 etwb and that of the border irrigated field was etbreb 1 09 etwb the coefficients of determination r2 for the two fields were 0 66 and 0 52 the mean bias errors mbes were 0 02 mm d 1 and 0 66 mm d 1 the root mean square errors rmses were 0 97 mm d 1 and 1 33 mm d 1 and the indices of agreement ias were 0 92 and 0 86 respectively the above results indicated good agreement between etbreb and etwb therefore the breb system accurately estimated the et of spring wheat the soil water content swc estimated by the breb system was corrected according to the field measured value obtained by soil auger every 7 days setting six uniform distributed sampling points for each irrigation treatment daily soil e was measured by micro lysimeters made of polyvinyl chloride pvc tubes with a diameter of 10 cm and height of 20 cm the micro lysimeters were installed between wheat rows with 3 replicates set for each treatment and weighted at 19 30 every day the layout of the micro lysimeters is shown in fig 1 b in addition the micro lysimeters would be re installed after irrigation and rain 2 3 description of the et model the sw model can be expressed as

energy balance instruments and micro lysimeters in the observations of spring wheat field flux continuous et data could be obtained using the breb instruments however during precipitation and irrigation the micro lysimeters were unable to accurately measure soil e which caused approximately half of missing e data throughout the growth period in this study the sw model was used to estimate the et and e then the et measured by the breb system and the e measured by micro lysimeters were used to validate the et and e estimated by the sw model if the accuracy of the sw model was high the model was then used to estimate the ratio of e to t e t the missing soil e and t of the spring wheat plants were obtained by multiplying the e t by the breb measured et finally continuous soil e and t data of the spring wheat plants were used to compare di and bi the relationship between the simulated values and observed values is shown in table 3 fig 5 shows the seasonal variation in the et of drip irrigated spring wheat and border irrigated spring wheat estimated by the sw model and measured by the breb method as shown in the figure for both di fig 5a c and bi fig 5b d the patterns of variation shown by the sw model estimates and the breb measured et were almost identical for di fig 5a c the total et estimated by the sw model for 2017 and 2018 was 340 mm and 566 mm respectively with corresponding breb measured values of 340 mm and 520 mm the difference between the estimates obtained with the two methods was less than 8 for bi fig 5b d the model estimates for 2017 and 2018 were 376 mm and 592 mm respectively with corresponding measured values of 362 mm and 542 mm the model error was less than 8 fig 6 shows the scatter plots corresponding to fig 5 based on table 3 and fig 6a to d the sw model estimates were 0 3 4 and 5 higher than the average measured values of breb respectively the r2 values were 0 81 0 80 0 80 and 0 82 the mbes were 0 00 mm d 1 0 20 mm d 1 0 43 mm d 1 and 0 46 mm d 1 the rmses were 0 76 mm d 1 0 86 mm d 1 1 36 mm d 1 and 1 30 mm d 1 and the ias were 0 94 0 94 0 94 and 0 94 respectively the seasonal variation in soil e estimated by the sw model and measured by the micro lysimeters is shown in fig 7 as shown in the figure for both di fig 7a c and bi fig 7b d soil e started to increase from march to april and peaked in early may with the increases in radiation and temperature it then showed a slowly decreasing trend with the growth of the spring wheat canopy the pattern of variation simulated by the sw model was almost identical to the pattern of the measured values throughout the growth period fig 8 presents the scatter plots corresponding to fig 7 as shown in table 3 the e estimated by the sw model in fig 8a to d was 4 5 6 and 15 higher than the average measured values from the micro lysimeters respectively the statistical analysis showed that the r2 values were 0 74 0 72 0 76 and 0 74 the mbes were 0 03 mm d 1 0 05 mm d 1 0 06 mm d 1 and 0 17 mm d 1 the rmses were 0 16 mm d 1 0 19 mm d 1 0 32 mm d 1 and 0 37 mm d 1 and the ias were 0 91 0 91 0 93 and 0 91 respectively in summary as shown in table 3 and figs 5 8 the mbes of the et simulated by the sw model were no greater than 0 46 and the ias were greater than 0 94 the values of simulated e were no greater than 0 05 and the ias were greater than 0 91 therefore the sw model accurately estimated the et and e of the entire growth period of spring wheat it could be adopted to interpolate the missing values of soil e and et of spring wheat plants 3 2 comparison of soil evaporation between drip irrigation and border irrigation many previous studies have shown that di can effectively reduce soil e however whether di has the same effect on spring wheat with a high planting density is not clear in this study soil e was measured using micro lysimeters the missing soil e values were interpolated by multiplying the e et estimated with the sw model by the breb measured values and a continuous soil e dataset was obtained the patterns of variation in soil e under di and bi for the entire spring wheat growing season are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the soil e values under di edi were significantly lower than the corresponding bi ebi values in may and june the two values were more similar in july there was a significant difference between edi and ebi in 2017 fig 9b shows that the patterns of variation in edi and ebi were very similar and there was no significant difference in 2018 this might be related to the almost identical amounts of irrigation applied for the two treatments in 2018 the edi was 13 and 0 lower than the ebi in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 10 shows the scatter plots corresponding to fig 9 as shown in table 4 the r2 values of the two irrigation methods were 0 08 and 0 76 the mbes were 0 10 mm d 1 and 0 00 mm d 1 the rmses were 0 32 mm d 1 and 0 29 mm d 1 and the ias were 0 69 and 0 94 respectively for the entire dataset of 2017 and 2018 edi was on average 6 5 lower than ebi and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the combined data were 0 67 0 04 mm d 1 0 30 mm d 1 and 0 91 respectively during the observation period the edi in may june and july of 2017 was 12 mm 17 mm and 21 mm respectively while the ebi was 20 mm 18 mm and 19 mm the edi in april may june and july of 2018 was 32 mm 40 mm 16 mm and 11 mm respectively while the ebi was 34 mm 38 mm 17 mm and 10 mm the above analysis showed that the patterns of variation in soil e in spring wheat fields were similar between bi and di di reduced the soil e by 3 5 mm per year on average 3 3 comparison of transpiration of spring wheat plants between drip irrigation and border irrigation to reveal the effect of di on the t of spring wheat this study also compared the patterns of variation in t of spring wheat plants in the di and bi treatments as shown in fig 11 in 2017 the t of drip irrigated spring wheat tdi was significantly lower than that of border irrigated spring wheat tbi especially at the end of the spring wheat growing period in 2018 the patterns of variation were very similar tdi was slightly lower than tbi however there was no significant difference between the tdi and tbi as shown in the corresponding scatter plots in fig 12 and according to table 4 the tdi was 5 lower than the tbi in 2017 and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two types of irrigation were 0 34 0 21 mm d 1 1 41 mm d 1 and 0 81 respectively in 2018 the tdi was 5 lower than the tbi and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two were 0 96 0 21 mm d 1 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 99 respectively meanwhile for the entire dataset in 2017 and 2018 the tdi was on average 5 lower than the tbi the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the combined data were 0 84 0 21 mm d 1 0 99 mm d 1 and 0 95 respectively during the observation period the tdi in may june and july of 2017 was 89 mm 126 mm and 75 mm respectively while the tbi was 58 mm 142 mm and 105 mm the tdi in april may june and july of 2018 was 22 mm 137 mm 185 mm and 77 mm respectively while the tbi was 26 mm 143 mm 189 mm and 85 mm the above analysis showed that di reduced the t of the spring wheat plants by an average of 18 5 mm per year 3 4 comparison of evapotranspiration of spring wheat plants between drip irrigation and border irrigation this study also analysed the effect of di on the total et of crops fig 13 shows the pattern of variation in et for the di and bi treatments measured by the breb method similar to the results shown in figs 9 and 11 the etdi was significantly lower than the etbi at the end of the spring wheat growing period in 2017 in contrast the etdi was slightly lower than the etbi in 2018 in 2017 the measured etdi and etbi were 340 mm and 362 mm respectively with a difference of 22 mm between the two in 2018 etdi and etbi were 520 mm and 542 mm respectively with a difference of 22 mm between the two however there was no significant difference between the etdi and etbi the corresponding scatter plots are provided in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 and table 4 the etdi was 6 lower than the etbi in 2017 and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two were 0 09 0 31 mm d 1 1 53 mm d 1 and 0 75 respectively in 2018 the etdi was 4 lower than the etbi and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the two were 0 81 0 21 mm d 1 1 34 mm d 1 and 0 95 respectively meanwhile for the entire dataset in 2017 and 2018 the etdi was 5 lower than the etbi on average and the r2 mbe rmse and ia of the combined data were 0 70 0 25 mm d 1 1 42 mm d 1 and 0 92 respectively during the observation period the etdi in may june and july of 2017 was 103 mm 141 mm and 96 mm respectively while the etbi was 76 mm 163 mm and 123 mm the etdi in april may june and july of 2018 was 50 mm 202 mm 200 mm and 68 mm respectively while the etbi was 50 mm 200 mm 209 mm and 83 mm the above analysis showed that di reduced the et of spring wheat plants by an average of 22 mm per year 4 discussion 4 1 drip irrigation reduced soil evaporation by an average of 3 5 mm per year our research showed that di reduced soil e by an average of 3 5 mm per year in spring wheat fields the main reason that di reduced soil e was that di reduced the irrigation amount thus reducing the water evaporated during irrigation and the average moisture content of the soil with decreasing soil moisture content soil e can decrease breshears et al 1998 however there was little difference in soil e between di and bi when the irrigation amounts were similar di changed the infiltration form of soil moisture the moist area under di was almost elliptical and should have been much smaller than that under traditional bi nevertheless the experiment was carried out under sufficient irrigation conditions greatly increasing the soil wetting proportion and thus the soil e moreover the hardening of soil under bi hindered the e of water to some extent 4 2 drip irrigation reduced transpiration by an average of 18 5 mm per year our study also found that di reduced the t of spring wheat plants by an average of 18 5 mm per year over a two year period different conclusions have been reached about the effect of di on crop t studies have shown that di can accelerate crop growth qin et al 2016 while increasing the biomass and yield of crops singh et al 2009 mi et al 2013 jha et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and that multiple irrigations with a small amount of water can increase the lai of the crops lv et al 2014 however our experiment found that the lai of spring wheat plants under di was 24 lower than that of spring wheat plants under bi this may have been due to the low irrigation under di in the early stage of crop growth resulting in a significant reduction in the growth of spring wheat and therefore a reduced lai the lower lai reduced crop t nevertheless the yield of drip irrigated spring wheat increased the theoretical yield of spring wheat under di was 8845 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 10 559 kg ha 1 in 2018 and that under bi was 8479 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 8731 kg ha 1 in 2018 in 2017 2018 the theoretical yield under di was 12 6 higher than that under bi the distribution of photosynthetic products in different tissues and organs varies with aspects of irrigation during certain growth and developmental stages of crops in our study spring wheat transitioned from the jointing stage to the flowering stage in may during this period bi had a lower irrigation frequency and greater irrigation amount than di which did not increase the grain yield but promoted the vegetative growth of spring wheat similarly musick and porter 1990 found that irrigation in the early flowering stage of wheat increased straw yield but had little effect on grain yield in other words irrigation from the jointing stage to the flowering stage of spring wheat is of great significance for vegetative growth and reproductive growth additionally we found that di accelerated wheat growth and shortened the wheat growth duration by 1 week the crops did not mature until the threshold accumulated temperature was reached after the beginning of irrigation the temperature of the drip irrigated wheat field was always higher than that of the border irrigated field this should be due to the following two reasons first di was characterized by a smaller irrigation amount and higher irrigation frequency second the lai under di was much lower than that under bi which reduced the shaded area making the wheat field absorb more solar radiation this phenomenon was also observed in our maize experiment qin et al 2016 the shorter growth duration also lowered crop t additionally the lower lai and higher soil temperature increased soil e to some extent under di 4 3 drip irrigation reduced total evapotranspiration by an average of 22 mm per year our research showed that di reduced the total et of spring wheat plants by an average of 22 mm per year this result is consistent with the conclusion of wang et al 2018 but the value is still lower than that measured in some studies by other researchers sugita et al 2017 found that compared with bi di reduced the et of both corn and sugar beet by approximately 1 2 on the one hand the difference in the amount of irrigation between the di and bi in these previous studies was too large on the other hand the results of these studies largely came from experiments conducted in a small area the estimation of et was mainly based on the water balance approach and thus the representativeness of the results was largely uncertain in contrast we used flux comparison experiments conducted over large areas the reliability of the data was obviously better than that in the previous experiments for large areas of di despite the significantly increased soil e the total et was only 5 lower than that under traditional bi because of the lower lai of spring wheat plants 5 conclusion in this study the et e and t of spring wheat under di and bi were obtained in 2017 and 2018 by an approach combining large area fixed location field experiments and model estimations compared with bi di reduced the e t and et of spring wheat plants by an average of 3 5 mm 18 5 mm and 22 mm per year respectively the et under di was decreased by 4 6 during 2017 2018 the decline in et was significantly smaller than that observed in traditional small area experiments this conclusion provides an

10702,much of the agricultural production in the ogallala aquifer region relies on groundwater for irrigation in addition to declining water levels weather and climate driven events affect crop yields and revenues crop insurance serves as a risk management tool to mitigate these perils here we seek to understand what long term crop insurance loss data can tell us about agricultural risk management in the ogallala we assess patterns and trends in crop insurance loss data from the u s department of agriculture risk management agency indemnities or insurance payments totaled 22 billion from 1989 2017 for the 161 counties that overlie the ogallala aquifer we focused on the top ten weather and climate driven causes of crop loss for the ogallala which comprised at least 92 of total indemnities drought hail and heat were the leading causes of crop loss for the region and varied over space and time for example drought is a significant cause of loss across all seasons while hail is more prevalent in the spring and summer spatially heterogeneous patterns emerged showing larger hail indemnities in the northern ogallala versus larger drought indemnities in the southern portion we performed a mann kendall trend analysis of county level annual loss cost values the ratio of indemnities to liabilities drought and excess moisture showed significant increasing loss cost trends in the western counties of the ogallala in contrast hail showed significant decreasing trends in the northern and eastern portions these results suggest the northern counties of the ogallala may perceive hail as a greater risk and may be better equipped to handle drought losses as compared with the southern ogallala crop insurance loss data play a role in integrating long term trends with near term management practices and providing relevant risk information in producers operational to tactical decision making processes keywords ogallala aquifer drought risk management agriculture weather crop insurance 1 introduction irrigation for agricultural production makes up 80 of the united states water consumption nationwide economic research service ers 2019 while farms with irrigation only represent 14 of all farm operations irrigated agriculture contributes over 152 billion in farm sales to the u s economy annually economic research service ers 2019 groundwater is a significant source of irrigation comprising 60 of all sources siebert et al 2010 as the largest aquifer in the u s the ogallala aquifer underlies more than 450 000 km2 of the great plains with more than 90 of aquifer s water extracted for agricultural purposes brauer et al 2017 supplying water to more than 35 billion in crops annually basso et al 2013 the ogallala aquifer is the lifeblood for this highly productive agricultural region providing food and fiber security as well as individual and community livelihoods water availability underpins both the biophysical and economic productivity of major commodity crops in the ogallala aquifer region cotterman et al 2018 araya et al 2019 continued use of the ogallala aquifer coupled with declining water tables has negatively impacted agricultural production especially in those areas that are largely reliant on groundwater for irrigation foster et al 2015 scanlon et al 2012 cotterman et al 2018 declining water levels and well capacities decreasing saturated thickness and negative changes in recoverable water storage have been observed these hydrologic changes threaten agricultural production and local economies foster et al 2015 steward and allen 2016 mcguire 2017 moreover groundwater storage has seen increased rates of depletion in the last 30 years scanlon et al 2012 in the central high plains current groundwater management practices are projected to force a reduction in irrigated corn acreage by 60 and irrigated wheat acreage by half in the next fifty years cotterman et al 2018 irrigation management practices and climate driven events such as drought drive water levels in the ogallala aquifer haacker et al 2019 specifically increasing drying in the region concomitant with more frequent and intense drought will likely exacerbate diminished agricultural production and aquifer drawdown during water limited times steiner et al 2017 haacker et al 2019 climate change is expected to result in a net decrease in overall recharge into the ogallala aquifer despite differing recharge amounts among the northern central and southern high plains areas meixner et al 2016 crop insurance is an important risk management tool used by producers to mitigate negative impacts of crop price declines and weather and climate related events however federal crop insurance may pose a barrier to water conservation or adaptation even under declining water levels due to existing federal irrigation policies basso et al 2013 deryugina and konar 2017 assessments of historic weather and climate driven agricultural losses especially insurance payments offer producers valuable insight that can be factored into their risk management decisions reyes and elias 2019 specifically changes in causes of crop loss e g drought hail over time and space can inform possible risk management strategies for frequent or recurring events or adaptation strategies based on producers risk tolerance e g kistner et al 2018 steele et al 2018 reyes and elias 2019 for example large indemnities for tart cherries in utah due to frost and freeze require producers to have access to increasing capital assets given continued production despite large losses steele et al 2018 in southern new mexico pecan producers may show lower tolerance to weather events since those with crop insurance may have access to groundwater and thus report other types of losses unrelated to irrigation supply steele et al 2018 given the increasing frequency and severity of drought cook et al 2015 and decreasing water availability in the ogallala aquifer region retrospective analyses of crop losses may inform producers decision making and risk management strategies climate change is also expected to increase federally subsidized insurance premiums and program costs by up to 22 even with some concurrent adaptation crane droesch et al 2019 here we seek to understand what long term crop insurance loss data can tell us about agricultural risk management in the ogallala aquifer region our overarching objective is to assess patterns and trends in causes of loss over space and time for the ogallala aquifer region to provide agricultural risk management information that is useful to regional agricultural decision makers first we visualize regional scale indemnities or insurance payments through time by cause of loss second we aggregate county level indemnities by state and cause of loss we also examine causes of loss by month and top crops at the region and state levels finally we compare county level aquifer characteristics with crop loss information including statistical trend analyses given the importance of agricultural production in this region and declining water levels of the aquifer historic trends and patterns in crop loss 1 informs risk management decisions and planning related to crop insurance at multiple administrative scales federal state and local 2 indicates high risk production areas and 3 strengthens our understanding of the contextual vulnerability of agricultural systems in using crop insurance as a proxy for agricultural impact from weather and climate driven causes of loss this work showcases linkages between biophysical and socio economic vulnerabilities in agricultural systems wallander et al 2013 and highlights the usefulness of long term historic trends for informing near term operational management decision brown et al 2017 2 crop insurance background the federal crop insurance program provides a financial safety net to farmers ranchers and landowners fig 1 the u s department of agriculture s risk management agency rma administers the program offering multiple insurance plans and coverage to mitigate both revenue and yield losses shields 2015 on average the federal government pays 62 of producers insurance premium thereby subsidizing much of their crop insurance shields 2015 the federal government acts as a reinsurer to private companies that offer policies with varying coverage to producers fig 1 during large scale losses due to drought for example the federal government covers private companies losses i e reinsurance since 2000 the number of acres enrolled in federal crop insurance has ranged between 290 and 300 million acres covering nearly 90 of the 340 million acres of total cultivated acres in the u s congressional budget office cbo 2017 corn cotton soybeans and wheat generally account for over 70 of acres enrolled in crop insurance shields 2015 federal crop insurance is available on a crop by crop and county by county basis depending on a variety of factors including risk and producer demand shields 2015 this unit structure can be described in three ways 1 a basic unit covering land in a single county with a specific tenant landlord 2 an optional unit that is a basic unit divided into smaller units using township sections and 3 an enterprise unit which covers all land for a single crop in a county for a producer regardless of tenant landlord structure shields 2015 there are three basic types of insurance policies yield based revenue based and index based insured crops that experience damage caused by either 1 weather or climate driven events e g drought hail or 2 financial market disruptions subsequently trigger insurance payouts given certain thresholds a producer receives an indemnity or insurance payment if their yield or revenue falls below historical or normal levels for example a 4 10 year average of a producers annual crop yield may be used to determine production history and thus thresholds for insurance payouts shields 2015 index based loss takes into account the whole farm revenue or area based yields independent of individual farmers yields shields 2015 these plans typically use indices of precipitation or vegetation trigger points for payments since 1989 major pieces of legislation that have affected federal crop insurance programs processes and policies include the agricultural risk protection act arpa 2000 and farm bills e g 1996 2002 2008 2014 premium subsidies have been increased through legislation four times since 1994 congressional budget office cbo 2018 arpa allowed rma to use data mining to review existing policies for anomalous claims government accountability office gao 2015 index based losses began in 2007 as rma piloted various programs such as the pasture rangeland and forage prf program motamed et al 2018 here we note that our study does not include prf losses since no explicit cause of crop loss is reported 3 methods 3 1 study area the high plains aquifer referred to in this paper as the ogallala aquifer its popular name which is based on the predominant sediment group is one of the world s largest aquifers spanning an area of over 455 000 km2 175 000 mi2 in the great plains of the united states qi 2010 while also underlying a major agricultural production region mcguire 2017 groundwater from the ogallala supplies almost one third of all irrigation in the united states and 98 of water from the ogallala is used for irrigation dennehy et al 2002 in this study we include counties with at least 25 of their respective area within the ogallala aquifer boundary n 161 to capture as many counties with agricultural production that may derive water from the ogallala aquifer fig 2 qi 2010 haacker et al 2019 the majority of the selected counties have reported an annual saturated thickness value of at least 9 m sometime between 1989 2017 indicating areas that have the potential to yield sufficient water for irrigation mcguire 2017 haacker et al 2019 although not all areas with sufficient aquifer saturated thickness are used for irrigated agriculture however we note that there are places with abundant water and low irrigation including the sand hills area lea county new mexico and the rosebud reservation in south dakota where factors such as local regulation soil quality and non agricultural land use limit irrigation additionally we acknowledge that although previous research has shown that at least 9 m of saturated thickness is an indicator of the aquifer s ability to provide enough water for irrigation given predominant hydraulic conductivity in the high plains hecox et al 2002 other factors may influence well yields and the capacity for wells in areas of sufficient saturated thickness to effectively irrigate crops 3 2 data 3 2 1 crop loss data we obtained crop insurance loss data from the u s department of agriculture risk management agency rma these contain information on the cause of crop loss e g drought hail etc crop affected amount paid to the producer indemnity value of the crops insured liability and insurance premium the spatio temporal resolution of the data are at county level and monthly time step the time period of analysis is from 1989 2017 we primarily focus on weather and climate driven causes of loss since they have a biophysical meaning for crop damage and are explicitly reported as such reyes and elias 2019 we are interested in biophysical manifestations of environmental impacts and require an explicit cause for crop loss and thus exclude revenue and index based insurance in our analyses we include most major commodities however these data do not necessarily represent all agricultural production but rather those insured under federal crop insurance and which have experienced losses moreover we do not distinguish between irrigated and non irrigated acreage for different causes of loss however specific rma policies for irrigated land with losses are reported as such i e failure of irrigation supply while there are programmatic and policy changes that influence long term trend analysis we minimize these by calculating annual county level loss cost see section 3 3 reyes and elias 2019 the scope of this study is on retrospective analyses of crop insurance loss data rather than forecasting indemnities drawbacks to such forecasts linking indemnities with environmental conditions include predicting future management decisions use of probabilistic climate forecasts and uncertain policy changes carriquiry and osgood 2012 3 2 2 aquifer characteristics and water use data we obtained water table elevation and saturated thickness data for the ogallala aquifer these were calculated as mean values by county according to haacker et al 2016 irrigation water use data were aggregated from 1990 to 2015 from the u s geological survey which has collected county level water use data every five years across multiple sectors dieter et al 2017 we calculated the change in total irrigation water use between 1990 and 2015 since this time period best matches the range of the crop loss data 1989 2017 3 3 data analysis we follow the methods of reyes and elias 2019 to present and transform data for visualization and analysis the relative fraction of indemnities is the relative contribution of different causes of loss to overall indemnities it is determined by dividing nominal indemnities for a specific cause of loss and dividing by the total indemnities for a given time period e g 1989 2017 and spatial aggregation unit e g county the relative fraction of indemnities by cause of loss is also calculated for the top crops in the region and for each month we use the loss cost to examine how indemnities have changed over time and also note that we do not explicitly evaluate how crop prices change over time and how those changes affect decision making related to crop choice or purchasing crop insurance loss cost is calculated as i n d e m n i t i e s l i a b i l i t i e s 100 for the appropriate spatio temporal resolution and cause of loss e g drought hail etc and is expressed in dollars to assess trends over time for indemnities it is necessary to normalize losses e g changnon and hewings 2001 smith and katz 2013 reyes and elias 2019 loss cost accounts for inter annual changes in specific commodity prices rma program policies and various socio economic conditions changnon and hewings 2001 barthel and neumayer 2012 moreover loss cost integrates across these socio economic and management conditions since we aggregate data at the monthly and annual time scale and use the loss cost for trend analyses rather than nominal indemnities e g smith and katz 2013 reyes and elias 2019 finally loss cost has been used extensively when examining crop insurance loss data including actuarial assessments of the rma program e g knight and coble 1999 woodard et al 2011 trends of hail losses over time e g chagnon and changnon 1990 1997 and regional trend analyses of causes of crop losses e g reyes and elias 2019 previous studies have used loss cost to analyze annual trends over time e g reyes and elias 2019 we use the mann kendall statistical test helsel and hirsch 2002 to assess monotonic trends on annual loss cost values the test is non parametric and indicates whether values tend to increase or decrease either linearly or nonlinearly with time i e monotonic change helsel and hirsch 2002 loss cost is appropriate for time series analysis because it accounts for current year value of crops insured reyes and elias 2019 we perform the mann kendall test on county level annual loss cost values from 1989 2017 for the top ten biophysical causes of loss for the ogallala aquifer region see section 3 2 the mann kendall tau represents strength and direction of monotonic trend 1 for very negative trends 1 for very positive trends we report tau values having a standard deviation greater than zero and having at least nine years of values from 1989 2017 e g reyes and elias 2019 significant county level loss cost trends are based on a p value threshold of 0 05 following reyes and elias 2019 4 results 4 1 crop losses through time total indemnities for the top ten weather and climate driven causes of crop loss in the region were 20 47 billion from 1989 2017 annual indemnities and liabilities typically feature drought hail and heat as top causes fig 3 the top cause of loss in a given year alternates between drought and hail however indemnities and liabilities post 1999 have larger proportions of crop loss due to drought than pre 1999 losses drought comprises more than half of indemnities and liabilities in 2002 2003 and 2005 more recently there was a threefold increase in indemnities and almost 8 fold increase in liabilities from 2011 to 2013 compared to any other year between 2011 2013 drought was the primary contribution to both indemnities and liabilities however between 2014 and 2017 hail has generally been on par or greater than drought with respect to relative fraction of annual indemnities and liabilities over time most major causes of loss in the ogallala display consistent annual loss cost with slight variations due to weather and climate driven events fig 3 most notable is a steady increase in lost cost due to failure in irrigation supply except for 2011 which also saw decreases in loss cost across other causes decreases in loss cost are due to either 1 decreasing indemnities relative to liabilities or 2 increasing liabilities relative to indemnities we also note that drought is considered a lack of water causing dry conditions that decrease soil moisture and thus plant water uptake crop losses due to drought are distinguished from those irrigated crops that do not receive sufficient water which are losses reported as failure of irrigation supply failure of irrigation supply refers to the lack of physical water availability and contrasts with failure of irrigation equipment which corresponds to crop losses due to irrigation hardware efficiency and conveyance losses 4 2 causes of loss by region and state 4 2 1 by region and state the top ten causes of loss aggregated over all counties in the ogallala aquifer region from 1989 2017 were drought hail heat hot wind wind excess wind freeze excess moisture precipitation cold winter cold wet weather and failure of irrigation supply fig 4 drought and hail are the largest causes of loss over the ogallala comprising 67 of all indemnities between 1989 2017 the remaining 8 of the top 10 causes of loss individually account for 7 or less of the total indemnities across the region a state by state view highlights regional differences for example hail replaces drought at the leading cause of loss in wyoming drought is a prominent cause of loss across the ogallala aquifer states and makes up more than half of indemnities in south dakota kansas and oklahoma hail is generally the second leading cause of loss across ogallala constituent states separately wind and hot wind account for 5 of the total indemnities across the region wind excess wind ranges from 2 in south dakota and kansas to 11 in wyoming for hot wind south dakota shows the lowest relative fraction 1 while texas features the largest percentage of indemnities due to this cause 9 cold related causes of loss such as cold winter and freeze feature prominently in separate states such as in wyoming 11 for freeze south dakota 11 for cold winter and oklahoma 9 for freeze failure of irrigation supply was a small portion of the total indemnities from 1989 to 2017 accounting for 1 of the total over the region and 0 4 on a statewide basis 4 2 2 by month the top three monthly causes of loss reflect seasonal and spatial differences in agricultural vulnerabilities over the ogallala region and constituent states fig 5 drought represents the largest annual cause of loss by indemnity across the ogallala region accounting for more than 50 of regional monthly indemnities except for the months of may june september and october drought is a top three monthly cause of loss in all ogallala states and months in the warm season months drought makes up at least half of monthly indemnities in most states especially in april june july and august throughout the cold season months drought is the leading monthly cause of loss especially for kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas drought makes up greater than 75 of state level indemnities in the month of december for kansas and oklahoma in contrast hail is generally prevalent during the warm season months especially in june and july northern ogallala states such as wyoming colorado and nebraska show hail comprising over half of indemnities for the month of june only in wyoming is hail a leading annual cause of loss hail is also a top three cause of loss in all ogallala states during the month of june we note that crop loss due to hail does not mean there is more hail during this time but that crops might be more at a more vulnerable stage warm season causes of loss such as hail and heat reflect crop growth cycles and seasonal vulnerabilities especially during the months of june july and august heat is a top cause of loss in july and august across the region comprising a larger proportion of loss in kansas texas and oklahoma hot wind appears a top three cause of monthly loss for the southern ogallala states of oklahoma new mexico and texas during the warm season months wind excess wind is a top three cause of loss across states during the cool season months and april cold winter makes up over half of monthly aggregated indemnities especially in january and february for south dakota and nebraska high latitude states that grow winter wheat in contrast freeze is most prevalent as a top three monthly cause of loss during the shoulder seasons or transitions from warm to cool seasons april september and october we include frost and mycotoxin because of their importance as a top monthly cause of loss despite these two causes not being in the top ten regional causes of loss fig 4 frost is only a top three monthly cause in wyoming during september mycotoxin emerges as a top cause in isolated months and locations october in kansas september october in oklahoma and september in new mexico 4 2 3 by crop the top three crops reporting losses and subsequent insurance payments between 1989 2017 for the ogallala aquifer were cotton wheat and corn fig 6 these three crops comprised 82 of indemnities for the time period of analysis in some states the relative importance of various crops is significantly larger as compared to the ogallala wide relative fraction cotton makes up 29 of ogallala wide indemnities but is more than twice the relative indemnities by crop for texas 71 similarly wheat comprises 27 of regional scale indemnities but is 2 7 times larger for state level indemnities for oklahoma 73 other states with larger relative fraction of indemnities for wheat compared to ogallala wide fraction include all states except nebraska and texas other crops important to the region include grain sorghum and soybeans some crops only report 1 or less of regional indemnities however their relative contribution to indemnities by state indicates their importance at that spatial unit for example while dry beans make up 1 of regional ogallala indemnities they make up 12 of aggregated indemnities for wyoming 2 for colorado and 3 for nebraska similarly sunflowers comprise 1 of regional indemnities yet 7 of state indemnities for wyoming peanuts make up 1 for the ogallala as well as 1 of state indemnities in new mexico and texas potatoes comprised 2 of aggregated indemnities in new mexico 4 3 causes of loss by county 4 3 1 crop loss and aquifer characteristics there is a wide range of county level indemnities 1989 2017 across the ogallala aquifer with some two orders of magnitude larger than the smallest amount fig 7 a in general indemnities increase from north to south with highest county indemnities in the southern texas high plains the leading causes of crop loss at the county level are mostly limited to drought and hail figs 7b and c other top causes include heat wind excess moisture and failure of irrigation supply not shown the largest percent of drought indemnities occur in central and southern areas of the ogallala aquifer region including the far eastern counties of the region fig 7b in contrast the northern reaches of the ogallala aquifer region feature major portion of county indemnities as hail especially in nebraska and the texas llano estacado fig 7c most changes in water table elevation between 1989 and 2016 are negative fig 7d significant decreases in water table elevation are located in the central and southern portions of the ogallala including southwest kansas the oklahoma panhandle and the northern texas panhandle the counties that have reported a mean saturated thickness value of 9 m or more bolded county boundaries fig 7d indicate the potential to yield sufficient water for irrigation see section 3 1 these counties are mainly located in the central ogallala colorado and kansas and eastern new mexico we also present changes in saturated thickness a hydrogeological measure of vertical thickness of saturated materials i e water filled pores and thus groundwater availability fig 7e as a percent of 1989 values 2016 values show mainly saturated thickness decreases in the southern half of the ogallala aquifer southwest kansas northeast new mexico and texas there are slight decreases in eastern colorado and adjacent counties in northwestern kansas total change in irrigation water shows a mix of both increases and decreases across the ogallala aquifer fig 7f however the majority of increases occur in the northern reaches of the aquifer in nebraska and some portions of eastern kansas and the llano estacado in texas 4 3 2 trend analysis 4 3 2 1 overview we present county level trends of annual loss cost values from 1989 2017 by the top ten causes of loss for the ogallala fig 8 in general hot dry causes drought heat failure of irrigation supply hot wind show a greater number of significant increasing trends rather than decreasing trends across the ogallala counties hail cold winter cold wet weather and wind excess wind show more significant decreasing trends than increasing ones the greatest number of significant county level trends occurs with hail 36 followed by excess moisture 29 4 3 2 2 hot dry the majority of county level trends for drought show increasing loss cost values significant increasing trends of loss cost are located in the western portions of the region while significant decreasing trends are located in the eastern portions of the ogallala there are also four times as many significant increasing trends 16 as there are decreasing ones 4 heat as compared to drought shows more balance between significant increasing 10 and decreasing 9 trends in general significant increasing loss cost trends in heat are observed in the north and northwestern counties and far southern texas counties of the ogallala while significant decreasing trends are located throughout the ogallala with a concentration in the eastern fringes of the region eastern nebraska and kansas 4 3 2 3 failure of irrigation supply the fewest county level trends are reported by failure of irrigation supply despite very few trends there are quite a number of significant ones showing increasing loss cost values 4 moreover the percentage of counties with significant trends compared to all counties showing trends non significant and significant is the largest of all the causes of loss 4 3 2 4 hail hail features the most significant trends across ogallala counties 36 with more than 75 of them decreasing trends with most of those in nebraska 22 28 of the eight counties that show significant increasing trends five are located in the llano estacado of texas 4 3 2 5 excess moisture significant trends in excess moisture are the 2nd leading number across ogallala counties with the majority 70 increasing trends located mostly in the western counties of the region increasing and significant loss cost trends of excess moisture are prevalent across counties along the western and southern reaches of the ogallala aquifer region including western nebraska eastern colorado western kansas the oklahoma panhandle and northern texas nine of the 20 counties with increasing significant trends are in texas significant decreasing trends due to excess moisture are primarily located in the eastern portions of the ogallala and in the states of nebraska 8 and kansas 1 4 3 2 6 cold wet there are eight significant loss cost trends for freeze with six increasing and two decreasing trends cold winter features ten significant loss trends with four increasing and six decreasing trends the latter are located in nebraska 4 and kansas 2 there are nine significant trends for cold wet weather with two increasing trends and six decreasing ones the former are located in oklahoma cimarron and texas counties and the latter located in nebraska and kansas 4 3 2 7 wind related there are almost three times as many significant increasing trends 11 as compared with decreasing trends 4 for hot wind in contrast there are twice as many counties showing decreasing trends than increasing ones for wind excess wind the majority of significant decreasing trends occur in eastern nebraska 5 discussion 5 1 drought water scarcity and irrigation in agricultural risk drought as the leading cause of crop loss annually and as a percentage of aggregated losses from 1989 2017 closely mirrors nationwide trends wallander et al 2013 reyes and elias 2019 the significant increases in annual indemnities objective 1 and contributions of hot and dry causes of crop loss between 2011 and 2014 can be attributed to the 2012 great plains drought fig 6 hoerling et al 2013 this relationship was particularly notable during 2011 and 2012 when more than 75 of indemnities were due to drought heat or hot wind fig 6 the decrease in loss cost in 2011 may indicate higher production risk illustrated by the much larger liabilities relative to indemnities in contrast decreases in loss cost can also suggest more hedging against certain disasters and crop loss due to larger liabilities reyes and elias 2019 these historic changes in indemnities and loss cost related to the 2012 drought has informed producer decision making around current and future drought conditions programmatic outreach related to crop insurance signup deadlines and future programmatic costs the federal government may encounter given more frequent and intense drought in this region coble et al 2000 cook et al 2015 failure of irrigation supply only makes up 1 of regional aggregated indemnities from 1989 2017 fig 4 yet shows the largest increases in annual loss cost over time suggesting higher indemnities relative to liabilities over time or relatively flat indemnities with decreasing liabilities fig 3 even if crops fail farmers may continue to water their crops to satisfy insurance payout requirements resulting in increased irrigation use notwithstanding drought conditions or actual plant water uptake deryugina and konar 2017 producers who purchase crop insurance have also been shown to use more water due to increasing acreage planted and or because of making shifts in crop mixes and rotations deryugina and konar 2017 claassen et al 2017 in this region farmers anecdotally refer to the cost of pumping additional acre inches of water as a kind of insurance in terms of how doing so alleviates their constant justified concern about the potential negative impacts of underwatering a kremen personal communication july 26 2019 this attitude and practice can be reinforced when crop yield and quantity do not appear to suffer due to overwatering i e producing a water surplus gibson et al 2019 in these situations federal crop insurance may be a maladaptation since management changes in irrigation and or crop types may be disincentivized basso et al 2013 subsequently agricultural production systems are less resilient to future extreme weather events that may decrease water availability müller et al 2017 this has negative impacts on both financial and natural capital ironically leading to higher vulnerability to weather and climate driven events such as drought and hail continuous evolution and adaptive management of irrigation systems by producers may limit actual crop failure due to irrigation supply through use of more drought resistant crops and lower value practices for example hornbeck and keskin 2012 especially in areas where there is less aquifer drawdown such as in the northern ogallala producers may face different management challenges such as district mandated pumping limits and improving their irrigation scheduling and soil practices to deal with abundant water i e water surplus that can contribute to water quality issues such as nitrogen leaching di and cameron 2002 there is a tendency for producers to maximize individual profit by using their full water allocation to maximize social benefits lauer et al 2018 increases in loss cost in counties in eastern colorado and nebraska may suggest relatively flat indemnities and with decreasing liabilities given water availability fig 8 in the central and southern portions of the ogallala adaptive management strategies may be more prevalent due to higher proportions of indemnities due to drought less irrigation water available and a declining water table fig 7 foster et al 2014 in kansas farmers in the state s first local enhanced management area reduced their water use by 31 over a five year period without impacting yields and with a majority reporting higher net profits deines et al 2019 this was achieved by farmers making minor changes such as shifting production goals from maximizing yields to maximizing profits shifting to less water intensive crops and integrating soil moisture probes irrigation scheduling and other adaptive management strategies deines et al 2019 in addition a combination of both drought tolerant crops and areal based indices for crop insurance providing a more complete coverage may mitigate drought impacts and provide a pathway towards sustainable agriculture in this region lybbert and carter 2015 a major limitation of our study is how the landscape is partitioned between irrigated and non irrigated land because our primary focus was on exposing crop insurance loss data over different spatio temporal scales and assessing trends using loss cost we do not explicitly link our results with specific irrigation use despite this our results provide some indication of irrigation use and the resulting crop failure from lack of irrigation e g fig 6 our paper provides a foundation for future directions linking crop insurance loss data with additional management variables such as irrigation as well as other landscape variables that may further characterize the relationship between groundwater management and insurance use 5 2 characterizing hot spots of high production risk areas our county level analyses objective 3 serve to effectively determine hot spots of production risk which we define in this work as areas impacted by multiple stressors related to past weather and climate change giorgi 2006 de sherbinin 2014 using counties as the spatial unit of analysis for hot spots may provide better informed risk management as this geographic scale is more familiar to producers and extension professionals elias et al 2018 moreover high resolution analysis e g county scale monthly can show targeted areas for adaptation where consistent types of losses may indicate production areas with greater exposure to specific adverse conditions government accountability office gao 2015 agricultural production reliant on groundwater for irrigation may be most at risk in counties that attribute greater than 40 of county level indemnities to drought fig 7 these hot spots indicate counties that may be most vulnerable under extreme drought conditions and long term declines in groundwater levels for example we note these hot spots experience impacts exacerbated by human activities and that this methodology could be expanded to include populations with limited adaptive ability with physical changes and include both natural and human impacts in identifying hot spots de sherbinin 2014 trend analyses of county level loss cost from 1989 to 2017 reveal spatially explicit patterns and may pinpoint hot spots of higher drought risk such as in the western ogallala counties fig 8 for example four counties show increasing loss cost trends in both drought and heat highlighting the combined impact of increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability in these areas most significant trends in failure of irrigation supply are increasing and located in the northern portion of the ogallala aquifer in eastern colorado and nebraska suggesting higher production risk areas that may require changes in water management large indemnities in counties of the texas high plains are primarily attributed to high value crops such as cotton which comprise more than 70 of texas indemnities figs 5 6a significant decreases in aquifer saturated thickness especially in far eastern new mexico and the southern portion of the texas panhandle mcguire 2017 suggest depleted water resources in these cotton growing areas but also continued weather and climate driven losses due to drought hot wind and hail figs 5 8 many of these counties feature significant increasing trends of drought heat excess moisture and hail many of the climate stressors that impact the very crops grown in this area steiner et al 2018 interestingly these areas also correspond with water table decreases and saturated thickness shrinkage figs 6d and e results of both changes in aquifer characteristics and trends of indemnities concur with other observational trends of decreases in streamflow and increases in low flow days indicating diminished water availability kustu et al 2010 this information may ultimately aid producers by providing spatially explicit county level information on historic crop vulnerability for future agricultural risk management cimarron and texas counties in the oklahoma panhandle are the 5th and 1 st in oklahoma respectively in agricultural market products sold for many of the primary crops affected by weather and climate driven events in this state fig 6 these counties feature increasing significant trends of loss cost for both cold wet weather and excess moisture fig 8 this suggests either 1 increasing indemnities due to cold wet weather and excessive rainfall or 2 increasing liabilities to hedge against these specific losses increasing use of center pivot irrigation as an adaptation to drought and less strict groundwater regulation may buffer against dry times wenger et al 2017 thus producers anticipate and hedge against other major causes of crop loss such as cold wet weather and excess rainfall given the overall increase in loss cost due to failure of irrigation supply over the ogallala fig 5 and decline of aquifer levels counties in the oklahoma panhandle may be more vulnerable as compared to other areas in the ogallala region to increasing dry conditions and drought the appearance of mycotoxin as a top cause of crop loss during summer months for oklahoma supports the importance of spatio temporal resolution in analyzing cause of loss data objective 2 reyes and elias 2019 almost three quarters of losses in oklahoma are from wheat and the state experiences mycotoxin as a top cause of loss especially in august and september figs 5 6 this is no surprise given that drought is a modulator of this plant disease especially for cereal crops marroquín cardona et al 2014 medina et al 2015 increasing severity and frequency of drought may affect how this disease affects crops not only in oklahoma but across the ogallala aquifer region despite its state level significance our results present finer scale information that is more decision relevant capturing mycotoxin s importance at specific months and areal units we cannot speculate on the actual trends of mycotoxin over time and space however these results suggest the relative importance of this disease as compared to other biophysical causes of crop loss through indemnities given that climate change is expected to exacerbate environmental conditions more conductive to mycotoxin in central north america marroquín cardona et al 2014 producers may use this knowledge in their agricultural risk management strategies and data driven decision making 5 3 spatially heterogeneous regions of risk county level crop loss in nebraska potentially indicates a decreased vulnerability to drought due to 1 relatively larger indemnities from hail and 2 more available water in the northern portions as compared to the southern portions of the ogallala figs 7d f some parts of nebraska have experienced a net transfer of water from the surface to groundwater due to surface water use for irrigation this contributes to a rise in the water table due to continuing irrigation as evidenced by minimal changes in water table and possibly fewer indemnities attributed to drought fig 7 areas with increases in total irrigation are especially prominent in the sand hills area of nebraska where there is high recharge and water very close to land surface elevation these counties also coincide with fewer changes in saturated thickness fig 7 especially in the platte river valley there is less decline of groundwater storage as compared to the southern reaches of the ogallala aquifer due to capture of groundwater discharge and increased recharge from surface water irrigation scanlon et al 2012 due to underlying geology these areas may be more buffered against drought losses given available water for irrigation and thus show a larger proportion of crop losses to hail fig 3c while producers in the northern portion of the ogallala may continue to irrigate during drought hail is a weather event that cannot easily be mitigated against while it is beyond this paper s scope to fully examine past hail events we note many nebraska counties feature decreasing loss trends of hail indicating increasing liabilities due to hail with level indemnities fig 8 this could support the idea that certain areas are insuring more due to perceived risk niles et al 2019 even if losses remain static over time moreover counties in nebraska report a larger proportion of their indemnities due to hail as compared with other ogallala counties fig 4 in contrast some hail events resulting in crop loss may not be reflected in these data due to private insurance coverage and or less perceived risk of hail damage more hail is generally experienced in the northern portion of the ogallala aquifer region cintineo et al 2012 an increase of crop insurance coverage may be warranted given an upward trend of hail events for the past hundred years especially in nebraska changnon and changnon 2000 decreasing loss cost trends across nebraska suggest increasing liabilities over time meaning producers are using crop insurance to hedge against hail damages conversely areas in the southern ogallala aquifer especially the texas llano estacado have experienced a larger proportion of crop losses due to drought fig 7 large indemnities reported for wheat and cotton in the southern ogallala also demonstrate increased susceptibility to drought due to how these particular crops are managed in the southern ogallala states fig 6 colaizzi et al 2009 the total percent of crop irrigated is much higher for corn than for either wheat or cotton in the southern ogallala explaining the former s relatively smaller indemnities colaizzi et al 2009 moreover these areas have seen major decreases in water table elevation and saturated thickness changes compounding issues around water availability while these areas may consistently experience losses due to drought our trend analysis shows other types of crop loss may become more prevalent fig 8 for example many texas counties show increasing loss cost trends of excess moisture potentially indicating larger indemnities with similar liabilities or similar indemnities and smaller liabilities over time it is plausible that these areas are more familiar with drought impacts and may be less prepared for excess moisture events supporting increasing loss cost trends whereby producers may opt to insure the same value of crop but experience more loss over time aggregation of crop loss data affects both visualization and analysis reyes and elias 2019 for example the top ten causes of loss for all of the ogallala counties feature some variation when aggregated by state fig 4 while drought is typically the top cause across ogallala states hail is the number one cause in wyoming beyond the top two causes of loss drought and hail cold winter south dakota freeze wyoming wind excess wind wyoming and heat kansas are some examples of state level cause of loss contributions that are greater than the regional ogallala relative contribution we also note that the relative fraction of various loss causes by state is also an artifact of the counties representing each state of the ogallala fig 2 while the relative fraction of hail for south dakota and texas seem similar 0 2 texas has 40 counties in the ogallala versus three for south dakota hail may be relatively important for those three counties in south dakota given the relative fraction in comparison to other states an understanding of both past patterns and trends may assist producers farm advisors and the farming industry in being prepared for and responsive to weather events leading to crop loss for example hail represents a large proportion of total indemnities 30 80 in the northern ogallala region fig 7c however trend analysis at the county level reveals a significant decline in hail in many of the northern counties but drought heat and failure of irrigation supply have increasing trends in those counties fig 8 armed with this knowledge the agricultural community could conceptualize alternate ways of saving water such as deficit irrigation drip irrigation and olla irrigation lal 2015 the agricultural support industry could conceive of ways to manage extreme heat including alternate cultivars shade cloth misters and shifting planting dates or seasons when hail damage occurs it results in varied levels of defoliation and producers must decide to either remove the damaged stand and replant or be content with the likely reduced yield if a producer must replant then producers will need to rapidly plant an early adapted variety to reach maturity in the shortened growing season before fall frost risk having these supplies at the ready may aid in rapid adaptation 5 4 implications for agricultural risk management changes in annual metrics of causes of crop loss objective 1 and monthly frequency of top loss events objective 2 provide agricultural decision makers insight on expected types of loss as well as information for risk management strategies for example drought and hail are the leading causes of loss for the ogallala as a region however hail as a cause of loss may be more prevalent during the summer months fig 5 few significant trends for freeze and cold winter fig 8 may be related to asynchronous shifting seasons whereby temperatures may allow for planting and crop growth but freeze events and timing remain the same cleland et al 2007 even absent long term trends in causes of loss fig 8 agricultural advisors and farmers still rely heavily on recent experiences and loss marx et al 2007 coles and scott 2009 moreover perceived adaptation and or farmer needs are positively correlated with weather variability indicating the usefulness of assessing past crop losses niles et al 2019 near term memory of losses due to drought and hail are important to producers in their medium to long term adaptation and uptake of crop insurance in addition to other operational and tactical management strategies taylor et al 1988 prokopy et al 2013 brown et al 2017 insights on losses are valuable for not only producers but those who support and serve the farm sector including local farm service agency staff crop consultants groundwater management district managers and extension professionals linking producers past experiences with possible use of climate forecasts remains a major research gap yet demonstrates how crop insurance loss data can link weather and climate in decision making and decision support mase and prokopy 2013 6 conclusions spatio temporal patterns and trends in the relative contribution of different causes of crop loss provide an integrated assessment of weather and climate driven impacts on agriculture indemnities broken out by causes of loss represent an indicator of both biophysical and socio economic conditions surrounding agricultural losses and may be meaningful when considering the contextual vulnerability of these production systems steele et al 2018 for example large proportions of indemnities due to hail coupled with decreasing loss cost trends may indicate increased hedging i e higher liabilities with similar indemnities over time our analysis revealed spatially divergent risks as a function of existing landscape characteristics climatic factors weather events and decision making processes like management specifically northern producers of the ogallala may perceive hail as a greater risk due to fewer drought indemnities and increased water availability in contrast southern producers report drought as a large proportion of indemnities suggesting continued vulnerability to decreased water availability now and into the future crop insurance loss data play a role in integrating long term trends with near term management practices and providing relevant risk information in producers operational to tactical decision making processes examining specific reasons for crop loss contributes to better understanding of effective policy levers and design so that producers can retain profits and enact conservation goals lauer et al 2018 while questions on what policies are acceptable to both ogallala producers and communities persist federal crop insurance remains an important

10702,much of the agricultural production in the ogallala aquifer region relies on groundwater for irrigation in addition to declining water levels weather and climate driven events affect crop yields and revenues crop insurance serves as a risk management tool to mitigate these perils here we seek to understand what long term crop insurance loss data can tell us about agricultural risk management in the ogallala we assess patterns and trends in crop insurance loss data from the u s department of agriculture risk management agency indemnities or insurance payments totaled 22 billion from 1989 2017 for the 161 counties that overlie the ogallala aquifer we focused on the top ten weather and climate driven causes of crop loss for the ogallala which comprised at least 92 of total indemnities drought hail and heat were the leading causes of crop loss for the region and varied over space and time for example drought is a significant cause of loss across all seasons while hail is more prevalent in the spring and summer spatially heterogeneous patterns emerged showing larger hail indemnities in the northern ogallala versus larger drought indemnities in the southern portion we performed a mann kendall trend analysis of county level annual loss cost values the ratio of indemnities to liabilities drought and excess moisture showed significant increasing loss cost trends in the western counties of the ogallala in contrast hail showed significant decreasing trends in the northern and eastern portions these results suggest the northern counties of the ogallala may perceive hail as a greater risk and may be better equipped to handle drought losses as compared with the southern ogallala crop insurance loss data play a role in integrating long term trends with near term management practices and providing relevant risk information in producers operational to tactical decision making processes keywords ogallala aquifer drought risk management agriculture weather crop

recharge into the ogallala aquifer despite differing recharge amounts among the northern central and southern high plains areas meixner et al 2016 crop insurance is an important risk management tool used by producers to mitigate negative impacts of crop price declines and weather and climate related events however federal crop insurance may pose a barrier to water conservation or adaptation even

and elias 2019 for example large indemnities for tart cherries in utah due to frost and freeze require producers to have access to increasing capital assets given continued production despite large losses steele et al 2018 in southern new mexico pecan producers may show lower tolerance to weather events since those with crop insurance may have access to groundwater and thus report other types of losses unrelated to irrigation supply steele et al 2018 given the increasing frequency and severity of drought cook et al 2015 and decreasing water availability in the ogallala aquifer region retrospective analyses of crop losses may inform producers decision making and risk management strategies climate change is also expected to increase federally subsidized insurance premiums and program costs by up to 22 even with some concurrent adaptation crane droesch et al 2019 here we seek to understand what long term crop insurance loss data can tell us about agricultural risk management in the ogallala aquifer region our overarching objective is to assess patterns and trends in causes of loss over space and time for the ogallala aquifer region to provide agricultural risk management information that is useful to regional agricultural decision makers first we visualize regional scale indemnities or insurance payments through time by cause of loss second we aggregate county level indemnities by state and cause of loss we also examine causes of loss by month and top crops at the region and state levels finally we compare county level aquifer characteristics with crop loss information including statistical trend analyses given the importance of agricultural production in this region and declining water levels of the aquifer historic trends and patterns in crop loss 1 informs risk management decisions and planning related to crop insurance at multiple administrative scales federal state and local 2 indicates high risk production areas and 3 strengthens our understanding of the contextual vulnerability of agricultural systems in using crop insurance as a proxy for agricultural impact from weather and climate driven causes of loss this work showcases linkages between biophysical and socio economic vulnerabilities in agricultural systems wallander et al 2013 and highlights the usefulness of long term historic trends for informing near term operational management decision brown et al 2017 2 crop insurance background the federal crop insurance program provides a financial safety net to farmers ranchers and landowners fig 1 the u s department of agriculture s risk management agency rma administers the program offering multiple insurance plans and coverage to mitigate both revenue and yield losses shields 2015 on average the federal government pays 62 of producers insurance premium thereby subsidizing much of their crop insurance shields 2015 the federal government acts as a reinsurer to private companies that offer policies with varying coverage to producers fig 1 during large scale losses due to drought for example the federal government covers private companies losses i e reinsurance since 2000 the number of acres enrolled in federal crop insurance has ranged between 290 and 300 million acres covering nearly 90 of the 340 million acres of total cultivated acres in the u s congressional budget office cbo 2017 corn cotton soybeans and wheat generally account for over 70 of acres enrolled in crop insurance shields 2015 federal crop insurance is available on a crop by crop and county by county basis depending on a variety of factors including risk and producer demand shields 2015 this unit structure can be described in three ways 1 a basic unit covering land in a single county with a specific tenant landlord 2 an optional unit that is a basic unit divided into smaller units using township sections and 3 an enterprise unit which covers all land for a single crop in a county for a producer regardless of tenant landlord structure shields 2015 there are three basic types of insurance policies yield based revenue based and index based insured crops that experience damage caused by either 1 weather or climate driven events e g drought hail or 2 financial market disruptions subsequently trigger insurance payouts given certain thresholds a producer receives an indemnity or insurance payment if their yield or revenue falls below historical or normal levels for example a 4 10 year average of a producers annual crop yield may be used to determine production history and thus thresholds for insurance payouts shields 2015 index based loss takes into account the whole farm revenue or area based yields independent of individual farmers yields shields 2015 these plans typically use indices of precipitation or vegetation trigger points for payments since 1989 major pieces of legislation that have affected federal crop insurance programs processes and policies include the agricultural risk protection act arpa 2000 and farm bills e g 1996 2002 2008 2014 premium subsidies have been increased through legislation four times since 1994 congressional budget office cbo 2018 arpa allowed rma to use data mining to review existing policies for anomalous claims government accountability office gao 2015 index based losses began in 2007 as rma piloted various programs such as the pasture rangeland and forage prf program motamed et al 2018 here we note that our study does not include prf losses since no explicit cause of crop loss is reported 3 methods 3 1 study area the high plains aquifer referred to in this paper as the ogallala aquifer its popular name which is based on the predominant sediment group is one of the world s largest aquifers spanning an area of over 455 000 km2 175 000 mi2 in the great plains of the united states qi 2010 while also underlying a major agricultural production region mcguire 2017 groundwater from the ogallala supplies almost one third of all irrigation in the united states and 98 of water from the ogallala is used for irrigation dennehy et al 2002 in this study we include counties with at least 25 of their respective area within the ogallala aquifer boundary n 161 to capture as many counties with agricultural production that may derive water from the ogallala aquifer fig 2 qi 2010 haacker et al 2019 the majority of the selected counties have reported an annual saturated thickness value of at least 9 m sometime between 1989 2017 indicating areas that have the potential to yield sufficient water for irrigation mcguire 2017 haacker et al 2019 although not all areas with sufficient aquifer saturated thickness are used for irrigated agriculture however we note that there are places with abundant water and low irrigation including the sand hills area lea county new mexico and the rosebud reservation in south dakota where factors such as local regulation soil quality and non agricultural land use limit irrigation additionally we acknowledge that although previous research has shown that at least 9 m of saturated thickness is an indicator of the aquifer s ability to provide enough water for irrigation given predominant hydraulic conductivity in the high plains hecox et al 2002 other factors may influence well yields and the capacity for wells in areas of sufficient saturated thickness to effectively irrigate crops 3 2 data 3 2 1 crop loss data we obtained crop insurance loss data from the u s department of agriculture risk management agency rma these contain information on the cause of crop loss e g drought hail etc crop affected amount paid to the producer indemnity value of the crops insured liability and insurance premium the spatio temporal resolution of the data are at county level and monthly time step the time period of analysis is from 1989 2017 we primarily focus on weather and climate driven causes of loss since they have a biophysical meaning for crop damage and are explicitly reported as such reyes and elias 2019 we are interested in biophysical manifestations of environmental impacts and require an explicit cause for crop loss and thus exclude revenue and index based insurance in our analyses we include most major commodities however these data do not necessarily represent all agricultural production but rather those insured under federal crop insurance and which have experienced losses moreover we do not distinguish between irrigated and non irrigated acreage for different causes of loss however specific rma policies for irrigated land with losses are reported as such i e failure of irrigation supply while there are programmatic and policy changes that influence long term trend analysis we minimize these by calculating annual county level loss cost see section 3 3 reyes and elias 2019 the scope of this study is on retrospective analyses of crop insurance loss data rather than forecasting indemnities drawbacks to such forecasts linking indemnities with environmental conditions include predicting future management decisions use of probabilistic climate forecasts and uncertain policy changes carriquiry and osgood 2012 3 2 2 aquifer characteristics and water use data we obtained water table elevation and saturated thickness data for the ogallala aquifer these were calculated as mean values by county according to haacker et al 2016 irrigation water use data were aggregated from 1990 to 2015 from the u s geological survey which has collected county level water use data every five years across multiple sectors dieter et al 2017 we calculated the change in total irrigation water use between 1990 and 2015 since this time period best matches the range of the crop loss data 1989 2017 3 3 data analysis we follow the methods of reyes and elias 2019 to present and transform data for visualization and analysis the relative fraction of indemnities is the relative contribution of different causes of loss to overall indemnities it is determined by dividing nominal indemnities for a specific cause of loss and dividing by the total indemnities for a given time period e g 1989 2017 and spatial aggregation unit e g county the relative fraction of indemnities by cause of loss is also calculated for the top crops in the region and for each month we use the loss cost to examine how indemnities have changed over time and also note that we do not explicitly evaluate how crop prices change over time and how those changes affect decision making related to crop choice or purchasing crop insurance loss cost is calculated as i n d e m n i t i e s l i a b i l i t i e s 100 for the appropriate spatio temporal resolution and cause of loss e g drought hail etc and is expressed in dollars to assess trends over time for indemnities it is necessary to normalize losses e g changnon and hewings 2001 smith and katz 2013 reyes and elias 2019 loss cost accounts for inter annual changes in specific commodity prices rma program policies and various socio economic conditions changnon and hewings 2001 barthel and neumayer 2012 moreover loss cost integrates across these socio economic and management conditions since we aggregate data at the monthly and annual time scale and use the loss cost for trend analyses rather than nominal indemnities e g smith and katz 2013 reyes and elias 2019 finally loss cost has been used extensively when examining crop insurance loss data including actuarial assessments of the rma program e g knight and coble 1999 woodard et al 2011 trends of hail losses over time e g chagnon and changnon 1990 1997 and regional trend analyses of causes of crop losses e g reyes and elias 2019 previous studies have used loss cost to analyze annual trends over time e g reyes and elias 2019 we use the mann kendall statistical test helsel and hirsch 2002 to assess monotonic trends on annual loss cost values the test is non parametric and indicates whether values tend to increase or decrease either linearly or nonlinearly with time i e monotonic change helsel and hirsch 2002 loss cost is appropriate for time series analysis because it accounts for current year value of crops insured reyes and elias 2019 we perform the mann kendall test on county level annual loss cost values from 1989 2017 for the top ten biophysical causes of loss for the ogallala aquifer region see section 3 2 the mann kendall tau represents strength and direction of monotonic trend 1 for very negative trends 1 for very positive trends we report tau values having a standard deviation greater than zero and having at least nine years of values from 1989 2017 e g reyes and elias 2019 significant county level loss cost trends are based on a p value threshold of 0 05 following reyes and elias 2019 4 results 4 1 crop losses through time total indemnities for the top ten weather and climate driven causes of crop loss in the region were 20 47 billion from 1989 2017 annual indemnities and liabilities typically feature drought hail and heat as top causes fig 3 the top cause of loss in a given year alternates between drought and hail however indemnities and liabilities post 1999 have larger proportions of crop loss due to drought than pre 1999 losses drought comprises more than half of indemnities and liabilities in 2002 2003 and 2005 more recently there was a threefold increase in indemnities and almost 8 fold increase in liabilities from 2011 to 2013 compared to any other year between 2011 2013 drought was the primary contribution to both indemnities and liabilities however between 2014 and 2017 hail has generally been on par or greater than drought with respect to relative fraction of annual indemnities and liabilities over time most major causes of loss in the ogallala display consistent annual loss cost with slight variations due to weather and climate driven events fig 3 most notable is a steady increase in lost cost due to failure in irrigation supply except for 2011 which also saw decreases in loss cost across other causes decreases in loss cost are due to either 1 decreasing indemnities relative to liabilities or 2 increasing liabilities relative to indemnities we also note that drought is considered a lack of water causing dry conditions that decrease soil moisture and thus plant water uptake crop losses due to drought are distinguished from those irrigated crops that do not receive sufficient water which are losses reported as failure of irrigation supply failure of irrigation supply refers to the lack of physical water availability and contrasts with failure of irrigation equipment which corresponds to crop losses due to irrigation hardware efficiency and conveyance losses 4 2 causes of loss by region and state 4 2 1 by region and state the top ten causes of loss aggregated over all counties in the ogallala aquifer region from 1989 2017 were drought hail heat hot wind wind excess wind freeze excess moisture precipitation cold winter cold wet weather and failure of irrigation supply fig 4 drought and hail are the largest causes of loss over the ogallala comprising 67 of all indemnities between 1989 2017 the remaining 8 of the top 10 causes of loss individually account for 7 or less of the total indemnities across the region a state by state view highlights regional differences for example hail replaces drought at the leading cause of loss in wyoming drought is a prominent cause of loss across the ogallala aquifer states and makes up more than half of indemnities in south dakota kansas and oklahoma hail is generally the second leading cause of loss across ogallala constituent states separately wind and hot wind account for 5 of the total indemnities across the region wind excess wind ranges from 2 in south dakota and kansas to 11 in wyoming for hot wind south dakota shows the lowest relative fraction 1 while texas features the largest percentage of indemnities due to this cause 9 cold related causes of loss such as cold winter and freeze feature prominently in separate states such as in wyoming 11 for freeze south dakota 11 for cold winter and oklahoma 9 for freeze failure of irrigation supply was a small portion of the total indemnities from 1989 to 2017 accounting for 1 of the total over the region and 0 4 on a statewide basis 4 2 2 by month the top three monthly causes of loss reflect seasonal and spatial differences in agricultural vulnerabilities over the ogallala region and constituent states fig 5 drought represents the largest annual cause of loss by indemnity across the ogallala region accounting for more than 50 of regional monthly indemnities except for the months of may june september and october drought is a top three monthly cause of loss in all ogallala states and months in the warm season months drought makes up at least half of monthly indemnities in most states especially in april june july and august throughout the cold season months drought is the leading monthly cause of loss especially for kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas drought makes up greater than 75 of state level indemnities in the month of december for kansas and oklahoma in contrast hail is generally prevalent during the warm season months especially in june and july northern ogallala states such as wyoming colorado and nebraska show hail comprising over half of indemnities for the month of june only in wyoming is hail a leading annual cause of loss hail is also a top three cause of loss in all ogallala states during the month of june we note that crop loss due to hail does not mean there is more hail during this time but that crops might be more at a more vulnerable stage warm season causes of loss such as hail and heat reflect crop growth cycles and seasonal vulnerabilities especially during the months of june july and august heat is a top cause of loss in july and august across the region comprising a larger proportion of loss in kansas texas and oklahoma hot wind appears a top three cause of monthly loss for the southern ogallala states of oklahoma new mexico and texas during the warm season months wind excess wind is a top three cause of loss across states during the cool season months and april cold winter makes up over half of monthly aggregated indemnities especially in january and february for south dakota and nebraska high latitude states that grow winter wheat in contrast freeze is most prevalent as a top three monthly cause of loss during the shoulder seasons or transitions from warm to cool seasons april september and october we include frost and mycotoxin because of their importance as a top monthly cause of loss despite these two causes not being in the top ten regional causes of loss fig 4 frost is only a top three monthly cause in wyoming during september mycotoxin emerges as a top cause in isolated months and locations october in kansas september october in oklahoma and september in new mexico 4 2 3 by crop the top three crops reporting losses and subsequent insurance payments between 1989 2017 for the ogallala aquifer were cotton wheat and corn fig 6 these three crops comprised 82 of indemnities for the time period of analysis in some states the relative importance of various crops is significantly larger as compared to the ogallala wide relative fraction cotton makes up 29 of ogallala wide indemnities but is more than twice the relative indemnities by crop for texas 71 similarly wheat comprises 27 of regional scale indemnities but is 2 7 times larger for state level indemnities for oklahoma 73 other states with larger relative fraction of indemnities for wheat compared to ogallala wide fraction include all states except nebraska and texas other crops important to the region include grain sorghum and soybeans some crops only report 1 or less of regional indemnities however their relative contribution to indemnities by state indicates their importance at that spatial unit for example while dry beans make up 1 of regional ogallala indemnities they make up 12 of aggregated indemnities for wyoming 2 for colorado and 3 for nebraska similarly sunflowers comprise 1 of regional indemnities yet 7 of state indemnities for wyoming peanuts make up 1 for the ogallala as well as 1 of state indemnities in new mexico and texas potatoes comprised 2 of aggregated indemnities in new mexico 4 3 causes of loss by county 4 3 1 crop loss and aquifer characteristics there is a wide range of county level indemnities 1989 2017 across the ogallala aquifer with some two orders of magnitude larger than the smallest amount fig 7 a in general indemnities increase from north to south with highest county indemnities in the southern texas high plains the leading causes of crop loss at the county level are mostly limited to drought and hail figs 7b and c other top causes include heat wind excess moisture and failure of irrigation supply not shown the largest percent of drought indemnities occur in central and southern areas of the ogallala aquifer region including the far eastern counties of the region fig 7b in contrast the northern reaches of the ogallala aquifer region feature major portion of county indemnities as hail especially in nebraska and the texas llano estacado fig 7c most changes in water table elevation between 1989 and 2016 are negative fig 7d significant decreases in water table elevation are located in the central and southern portions of the ogallala including southwest kansas the oklahoma panhandle and the northern texas panhandle the counties that have reported a mean saturated thickness value of 9 m or more bolded county boundaries fig 7d indicate the potential to yield sufficient water for irrigation see section 3 1 these counties are mainly located in the central ogallala colorado and kansas and eastern new mexico we also present changes in saturated thickness a hydrogeological measure of vertical thickness of saturated materials i e water filled pores and thus groundwater availability fig 7e as a percent of 1989 values 2016 values show mainly saturated thickness decreases in the southern half of the ogallala aquifer southwest kansas northeast new mexico and texas there are slight decreases in eastern colorado and adjacent counties in northwestern kansas total change in irrigation water shows a mix of both increases and decreases across the ogallala aquifer fig 7f however the majority of increases occur in the northern reaches of the aquifer in nebraska and some portions of eastern kansas and the llano estacado in texas 4 3 2 trend analysis 4 3 2 1 overview we present county level trends of annual loss cost values from 1989 2017 by the top ten causes of loss for the ogallala fig 8 in general hot dry causes drought heat failure of irrigation supply hot wind show a greater number of significant increasing trends rather than decreasing trends across the ogallala counties hail cold winter cold wet weather and wind excess wind show more significant decreasing trends than increasing ones the greatest number of significant county level trends occurs with hail 36 followed by excess moisture 29 4 3 2 2 hot dry the majority of county level trends for drought show increasing loss cost values significant increasing trends of loss cost are located in the western portions of the region while significant decreasing trends are located in the eastern portions of the ogallala there are also four times as many significant increasing trends 16 as there are decreasing ones 4 heat as compared to drought shows more balance between significant increasing 10 and decreasing 9 trends in general significant increasing loss cost trends in heat are observed in the north and northwestern counties and far southern texas counties of the ogallala while significant decreasing trends are located throughout the ogallala with a concentration in the eastern fringes of the region eastern nebraska and kansas 4 3 2 3 failure of irrigation supply the fewest county level trends are reported by failure of irrigation supply despite very few trends there are quite a number of significant ones showing increasing loss cost values 4 moreover the percentage of counties with significant trends compared to all counties showing trends non significant and significant is the largest of all the causes of loss 4 3 2 4 hail hail features the most significant trends across ogallala counties 36 with more than 75 of them decreasing trends with most of those in nebraska 22 28 of the eight counties that show significant increasing trends five are located in the llano estacado of texas 4 3 2 5 excess moisture significant trends in excess moisture are the 2nd leading number across ogallala counties with the majority 70 increasing trends located mostly in the western counties of the region increasing and significant loss cost trends of excess moisture are prevalent across counties along the western and southern reaches of the ogallala aquifer region including western nebraska eastern colorado western kansas the oklahoma panhandle and northern texas nine of the 20 counties with increasing significant trends are in texas significant decreasing trends due to excess moisture are primarily located in the eastern portions of the ogallala and in the states of nebraska 8 and kansas 1 4 3 2 6 cold wet there are eight significant loss cost trends for freeze with six increasing and two decreasing trends cold winter features ten significant loss trends with four increasing and six decreasing trends the latter are located in nebraska 4 and kansas 2 there are nine significant trends for cold wet weather with two increasing trends and six decreasing ones the former are located in oklahoma cimarron and texas counties and the latter located in nebraska and kansas 4 3 2 7 wind related there are almost three times as many significant increasing trends 11 as compared with decreasing trends 4 for hot wind in contrast there are twice as many counties showing decreasing trends than increasing ones for wind excess wind the majority of significant decreasing trends occur in eastern nebraska 5 discussion 5 1 drought water scarcity and irrigation in agricultural risk drought as the leading cause of crop loss annually and as a percentage of aggregated losses from 1989 2017 closely mirrors nationwide trends wallander et al 2013 reyes and elias 2019 the significant increases in annual indemnities objective 1 and contributions of hot and dry causes of crop loss between 2011 and 2014 can be attributed to the 2012 great plains drought fig 6 hoerling et al 2013 this relationship was particularly notable during 2011 and 2012 when more than 75 of indemnities were due to drought heat or hot wind fig 6 the decrease in loss cost in 2011 may indicate higher production risk illustrated by the much larger liabilities relative to indemnities in contrast decreases in loss cost can also suggest more hedging against certain disasters and crop loss due to larger liabilities reyes and elias 2019 these historic changes in indemnities and loss cost related to the 2012 drought has informed producer decision making around current and future drought conditions programmatic outreach related to crop insurance signup deadlines and future programmatic costs the federal government may encounter given more frequent and intense drought in this region coble et al 2000 cook et al 2015 failure of irrigation supply only makes up 1 of regional aggregated indemnities from 1989 2017 fig 4 yet shows the largest increases in annual loss cost over time suggesting higher indemnities relative to liabilities over time or relatively flat indemnities with decreasing liabilities fig 3 even if crops fail farmers may continue to water their crops to satisfy insurance payout requirements resulting in increased irrigation use notwithstanding drought conditions or actual plant water uptake deryugina and konar 2017 producers who purchase crop insurance have also been shown to use more water due to increasing acreage planted and or because of making shifts in crop mixes and rotations deryugina and konar 2017 claassen et al 2017 in this region farmers anecdotally refer to the cost of pumping additional acre inches of water as a kind of insurance in terms of how doing so alleviates their constant justified concern about the potential negative impacts of underwatering a kremen personal communication july 26 2019 this attitude and practice can be reinforced when crop yield and quantity do not appear to suffer due to overwatering i e producing a water surplus gibson et al 2019 in these situations federal crop insurance may be a maladaptation since management changes in irrigation and or crop types may be disincentivized basso et al 2013 subsequently agricultural production systems are less resilient to future extreme weather events that may decrease water availability müller et al 2017 this has negative impacts on both financial and natural capital ironically leading to higher vulnerability to weather and climate driven events such as drought and hail continuous evolution and adaptive management of irrigation systems by producers may limit actual crop failure due to irrigation supply through use of more drought resistant crops and lower value practices for example hornbeck and keskin 2012 especially in areas where there is less aquifer drawdown such as in the northern ogallala producers may face different management challenges such as district mandated pumping limits and improving their irrigation scheduling and soil practices to deal with abundant water i e water surplus that can contribute to water quality issues such as nitrogen leaching di and cameron 2002 there is a tendency for producers to maximize individual profit by using their full water allocation to maximize social benefits lauer et al 2018 increases in loss cost in counties in eastern colorado and nebraska may suggest relatively flat indemnities and with decreasing liabilities given water availability fig 8 in the central and southern portions of the ogallala adaptive management strategies may be more prevalent due to higher proportions of indemnities due to drought less irrigation water available and a declining water table fig 7 foster et al 2014 in kansas farmers in the state s first local enhanced management area reduced their water use by 31 over a five year period without impacting yields and with a majority reporting higher net profits deines et al 2019 this was achieved by farmers making minor changes such as shifting production goals from maximizing yields to maximizing profits shifting to less water intensive crops and integrating soil moisture probes irrigation scheduling and other adaptive management strategies deines et al 2019 in addition a combination of both drought tolerant crops and areal based indices for crop insurance providing a more complete coverage may mitigate drought impacts and provide a pathway towards sustainable agriculture in this region lybbert and carter 2015 a major limitation of our study is how the landscape is partitioned between irrigated and non irrigated land because our primary focus was on exposing crop insurance loss data over different spatio temporal scales and assessing trends using loss cost we do not explicitly link our results with specific irrigation use despite this our results provide some indication of irrigation use and the resulting crop failure from lack of irrigation e g fig 6 our paper provides a foundation for future directions linking crop insurance loss data with additional management variables such as irrigation as well as other landscape variables that may further characterize the relationship between groundwater management and insurance use 5 2 characterizing hot spots of high production risk areas our county level analyses objective 3 serve to effectively determine hot spots of production risk which we define in this work as areas impacted by multiple stressors related to past weather and climate change giorgi 2006 de sherbinin 2014 using counties as the spatial unit of analysis for hot spots may provide better informed risk management as this geographic scale is more familiar to producers and extension professionals elias et al 2018 moreover high resolution analysis e g county scale monthly can show targeted areas for adaptation where consistent types of losses may indicate production areas with greater exposure to specific adverse conditions government accountability office gao 2015 agricultural production reliant on groundwater for irrigation may be most at risk in counties that attribute greater than 40 of county level indemnities to drought fig 7 these hot spots indicate counties that may be most vulnerable under extreme drought conditions and long term declines in groundwater levels for example we note these hot spots experience impacts exacerbated by human activities and that this methodology could be expanded to include populations with limited adaptive ability with physical changes and include both natural and human impacts in identifying hot spots de sherbinin 2014 trend analyses of county level loss cost from 1989 to 2017 reveal spatially explicit patterns and may pinpoint hot spots of higher drought risk such as in the western ogallala counties fig 8 for example four counties show increasing loss cost trends in both drought and heat highlighting the combined impact of increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability in these areas most significant trends in failure of irrigation supply are increasing and located in the northern portion of the ogallala aquifer in eastern colorado and nebraska suggesting higher production risk areas that may require changes in water management large indemnities in counties of the texas high plains are primarily attributed to high value crops such as cotton which comprise more than 70 of texas indemnities figs 5 6a significant decreases in aquifer saturated thickness especially in far eastern new mexico and the southern portion of the texas panhandle mcguire 2017 suggest depleted water resources in these cotton growing areas but also continued weather and climate driven losses due to drought hot wind and hail figs 5 8 many of these counties feature significant increasing trends of drought heat excess moisture and hail many of the climate stressors that impact the very crops grown in this area steiner et al 2018 interestingly these areas also correspond with water table decreases and saturated thickness shrinkage figs 6d and e results of both changes in aquifer characteristics and trends of indemnities concur with other observational trends of decreases in streamflow and increases in low flow days indicating diminished water availability kustu et al 2010 this information may ultimately aid producers by providing spatially explicit county level information on historic crop vulnerability for future agricultural risk management cimarron and texas counties in the oklahoma panhandle are the 5th and 1 st in oklahoma respectively in agricultural market products sold for many of the primary crops affected by weather and climate driven events in this state fig 6 these counties feature increasing significant trends of loss cost for both cold wet weather and excess moisture fig 8 this suggests either 1 increasing indemnities due to cold wet weather and excessive rainfall or 2 increasing liabilities to hedge against these specific losses increasing use of center pivot irrigation as an adaptation to drought and less strict groundwater regulation may buffer against dry times wenger et al 2017 thus producers anticipate and hedge against other major causes of crop loss such as cold wet weather and excess rainfall given the overall increase in loss cost due to failure of irrigation supply over the ogallala fig 5 and decline of aquifer levels counties in the oklahoma panhandle may be more vulnerable as compared to other areas in the ogallala region to increasing dry conditions and drought the appearance of mycotoxin as a top cause of crop loss during summer months for oklahoma supports the importance of spatio temporal resolution in analyzing cause of loss data objective 2 reyes and elias 2019 almost three quarters of losses in oklahoma are from wheat and the state experiences mycotoxin as a top cause of loss especially in august and september figs 5 6 this is no surprise given that drought is a modulator of this plant disease especially for cereal crops marroquín cardona et al 2014 medina et al 2015 increasing severity and frequency of drought may affect how this disease affects crops not only in oklahoma but across the ogallala aquifer region despite its state level significance our results present finer scale information that is more decision relevant capturing mycotoxin s importance at specific months and areal units we cannot speculate on the actual trends of mycotoxin over time and space however these results suggest the relative importance of this disease as compared to other biophysical causes of crop loss through indemnities given that climate change is expected to exacerbate environmental conditions more conductive to mycotoxin in central north america marroquín cardona et al 2014 producers may use this knowledge in their agricultural risk management strategies and data driven decision making 5 3 spatially heterogeneous regions of risk county level crop loss in nebraska potentially indicates a decreased vulnerability to drought due to 1 relatively larger indemnities from hail and 2 more available water in the northern portions as compared to the southern portions of the ogallala figs 7d f some parts of nebraska have experienced a net transfer of water from the surface to groundwater due to surface water use for irrigation this contributes to a rise in the water table due to continuing irrigation as evidenced by minimal changes in water table and possibly fewer indemnities attributed to drought fig 7 areas with increases in total irrigation are especially prominent in the sand hills area of nebraska where there is high recharge and water very close to land surface elevation these counties also coincide with fewer changes in saturated thickness fig 7 especially in the platte river valley there is less decline of groundwater storage as compared to the southern reaches of the ogallala aquifer due to capture of groundwater discharge and increased recharge from surface water irrigation scanlon et al 2012 due to underlying geology these areas may be more buffered against drought losses given available water for irrigation and thus show a larger proportion of crop losses to hail fig 3c while producers in the northern portion of the ogallala may continue to irrigate during drought hail is a weather event that cannot easily be mitigated against while it is beyond this paper s scope to fully examine past hail events we note many nebraska counties feature decreasing loss trends of hail indicating increasing liabilities due to hail with level indemnities fig 8 this could support the idea that certain areas are insuring more due to perceived risk niles et al 2019 even if losses remain static over time moreover counties in nebraska report a larger proportion of their indemnities due to hail as compared with other ogallala counties fig 4 in contrast some hail events resulting in crop loss may not be reflected in these data due to private insurance coverage and or less perceived risk of hail damage more hail is generally experienced in the northern portion of the ogallala aquifer region cintineo et al 2012 an increase of crop insurance coverage may be warranted given an upward trend of hail events for the past hundred years especially in nebraska changnon and changnon 2000 decreasing loss cost trends across nebraska suggest increasing liabilities over time meaning producers are using crop insurance to hedge against hail damages conversely areas in the southern ogallala aquifer especially the texas llano estacado have experienced a larger proportion of crop losses due to drought fig 7 large indemnities reported for wheat and cotton in the southern ogallala also demonstrate increased susceptibility to drought due to how these particular crops are managed in the southern ogallala states fig 6 colaizzi et al 2009 the total percent of crop irrigated is much higher for corn than for either wheat or cotton in the southern ogallala explaining the former s relatively smaller indemnities colaizzi et al 2009 moreover these areas have seen major decreases in water table elevation and saturated thickness changes compounding issues around water availability while these areas may consistently experience losses due to drought our trend analysis shows other types of crop loss may become more prevalent fig 8 for example many texas counties show increasing loss cost trends of excess moisture potentially indicating larger indemnities with similar liabilities or similar indemnities and smaller liabilities over time it is plausible that these areas are more familiar with drought impacts and may be less prepared for excess moisture events supporting increasing loss cost trends whereby producers may opt to insure the same value of crop but experience more loss over time aggregation of crop loss data affects both visualization and analysis reyes and elias 2019 for example the top ten causes of loss for all of the ogallala counties feature some variation when aggregated by state fig 4 while drought is typically the top cause across ogallala states hail is the number one cause in wyoming beyond the top two causes of loss drought and hail cold winter south dakota freeze wyoming wind excess wind wyoming and heat kansas are some examples of state level cause of loss contributions that are greater than the regional ogallala relative contribution we also note that the relative fraction of various loss causes by state is also an artifact of the counties representing each state of the ogallala fig 2 while the relative fraction of hail for south dakota and texas seem similar 0 2 texas has 40 counties in the ogallala versus three for south dakota hail may be relatively important for those three counties in south dakota given the relative fraction in comparison to other states an understanding of both past patterns and trends may assist producers farm advisors and the farming industry in being prepared for and responsive to weather events leading to crop loss for example hail represents a large proportion of total indemnities 30 80 in the northern ogallala region fig 7c however trend analysis at the county level reveals a significant decline in hail in many of the northern counties but drought heat and failure of irrigation supply have increasing trends in those counties fig 8 armed with this knowledge the agricultural community could conceptualize alternate ways of saving water such as deficit irrigation drip irrigation and olla irrigation lal 2015 the agricultural support industry could conceive of ways to manage extreme heat including alternate cultivars shade cloth misters and shifting planting dates or seasons when hail damage occurs it results in varied levels of defoliation and producers must decide to either remove the damaged stand and replant or be content with the likely reduced yield if a producer must replant then producers will need to rapidly plant an early adapted variety to reach maturity in the shortened growing season before fall frost risk having these supplies at the ready may aid in rapid adaptation 5 4 implications for agricultural risk management changes in annual metrics of causes of crop loss objective 1 and monthly frequency of top loss events objective 2 provide agricultural decision makers insight on expected types of loss as well as information for risk management strategies for example drought and hail are the leading causes of loss for the ogallala as a region however hail as a cause of loss may be more prevalent during the summer months fig 5 few significant trends for freeze and cold winter fig 8 may be related to asynchronous shifting seasons whereby temperatures may allow for planting and crop growth but freeze events and timing remain the same cleland et al 2007 even absent long term trends in causes of loss fig 8 agricultural advisors and farmers still rely heavily on recent experiences and loss marx et al 2007 coles and scott 2009 moreover perceived adaptation and or farmer needs are positively correlated with weather variability indicating the usefulness of assessing past crop losses niles et al 2019 near term memory of losses due to drought and hail are important to producers in their medium to long term adaptation and uptake of crop insurance in addition to other operational and tactical management strategies taylor et al 1988 prokopy et al 2013 brown et al 2017 insights on losses are valuable for not only producers but those who support and serve the farm sector including local farm service agency staff crop consultants groundwater management district managers and extension professionals linking producers past experiences with possible use of climate forecasts remains a major research gap yet demonstrates how crop insurance loss data can link weather and climate in decision making and decision support mase and prokopy 2013 6 conclusions spatio temporal patterns and trends in the relative contribution of different causes of crop loss provide an integrated assessment of weather and climate driven impacts on agriculture indemnities broken out by causes of loss represent an indicator of both biophysical and socio economic conditions surrounding agricultural losses and may be meaningful when considering the contextual vulnerability of these production systems steele et al 2018 for example large proportions of indemnities due to hail coupled with decreasing loss cost trends may indicate increased hedging i e higher liabilities with similar indemnities over time our analysis revealed spatially divergent risks as a function of existing landscape characteristics climatic factors weather events and decision making processes like management specifically northern producers of the ogallala may perceive hail as a greater risk due to fewer drought indemnities and increased water availability in contrast southern producers report drought as a large proportion of indemnities suggesting continued vulnerability to decreased water availability now and into the future crop insurance loss data play a role in integrating long term trends with near term management practices and providing relevant risk information in producers operational to tactical decision making processes examining specific reasons for crop loss contributes to better understanding of effective policy levers and design so that producers can retain profits and enact conservation goals lauer et al 2018 while questions on what policies are acceptable to both ogallala producers and communities persist federal crop insurance remains an important

10703,groundwater models are often used to assess the impact of climate or management strategies on groundwater resources in arid and semiarid regions of the world however these models do not account for crop growth and crop yield and thus cannot be used for evaluating long term impacts of climate and management strategies on water use efficiency and farm profitability of agricultural systems while managing the aquifers sustainably this study presented a linkage between dssat an agronomic model and modflow a groundwater flow model the linkage between these two models occurred on an annual basis with rates of irrigation and deep percolation from an ensemble of field scale dssat simulations converted to pumping rates and recharge rates for the modflow simulation modflow simulated groundwater head which can be used to update saturated thickness and thereby well capacities for each pumping well in the model domain simulated well capacities were then used to constrain irrigation applications in the dssat simulations during the following growing season python scripts were used to convert output from one model to input files for the other model the dssat modflow modeling system was applied to the ogallala aquifer underlying finney county kansas a region experiencing significant groundwater depletion due to irrigation practices and was tested against observed water table elevation and crop yield over a decadal period well capacity decreased by 50 for many pumping wells in the county a no irrigation scenario for this same time period resulted in average water table elevation increasing by 2 m but also a 70 decline in crop yield additional work is needed to balance groundwater conservation with crop yield the dssat modflow modeling system can be used in regions worldwide to assess changes in irrigation technologies crop selection and climate change adaptation strategies keywords groundwater modeling dssat modflow irrigation integrated modeling 1 introduction excessive groundwater depletion occurs in various regions of the world konikow and kendy 2005 principally due to intensive use of groundwater for irrigation in arid and semi arid regions according to a recent global study using hydrologic models total global groundwater depletion had increased from 126 km3 yr 1 in 1960 to 283 km3 yr 1 in 2000 wada et al 2010 in the first 8 years of the 21st century total groundwater consumption was more than 1100 km3 approximately one fourth the entire depletion experienced during the 20th century konikow 2011 groundwater depletion has led to decreasing well yields increased pumping costs land subsidence and associated damage to infrastructure wetland degradation reduction in groundwater discharge to streams and seawater intrusion in coastal areas aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 konikow and kendy 2005 motagh et al 2008 varela ortega et al 2011 werner 2010 zhang et al 2014 although groundwater sustainability i e the use of groundwater without causing a decrease in groundwater storage may not be possible for many arid and semi arid regions land and water management strategies can be pursued to minimize groundwater depletion while maintaining adequate crop yield for local populations and export often numerical models are used to explore the impact of various management strategies on groundwater storage and crop yield these modeling approaches can be classified into three broad modeling groups 1 groundwater based 2 agronomic based and 3 linked agronomic groundwater based models groundwater based approaches use numerical groundwater flow models to simulate groundwater head groundwater flow and groundwater storage under a variety of management scenarios examples include ebraheem et al 2003 dawoud et al 2005 mao et al 2005 and mylopoulos et al 2007 who used process based groundwater flow models to investigate the impact of groundwater management options on groundwater storage and conservation in southwest egypt the nile river valley northern china and northern greece respectively models used in these studies include modflow harbaugh 2005 a finite difference groundwater flow model and triwaco dawoud et al 2005 a finite element groundwater flow model management strategies include reduction in pumping new irrigation canals irrigation patterns and increase in irrigation efficiency modflow with the farm process mf fmp schmid et al 2006 which includes routines for plant consumptive use of water was employed by hanson et al 2010 to evaluate sources of irrigation water for central valley california a recent study wada et al 2012 linked global scale hydrological land surface prc globwb and groundwater modflow models to simulate changes in global groundwater storage due to climate and groundwater pumping these groundwater based approaches while successfully simulating groundwater energy and flow in aquifers neglect the effect of groundwater management strategies on crop yield in contrast agronomic based approaches simulate the effect of the interactions between genetics weather and management e g irrigation management on crop growth but do not account for the impact of groundwater availability on irrigation capacity and associated crop yield yang et al 2006 used the dssat crop growth model jones et al 2003 to optimize water use during the stages of leaf and ear growth of wheat to minimize groundwater depletion in the north china plains while kisekka et al 2015 used dssat to assess effects of various irrigation management strategies on maize in western kansas other agronomic models that have been used to explore irrigation impact on crop yield include epic williams et al 1989 the simdualkc model rolim et al 2006 rosa and paredes 2011 wu et al 2015 aquacrop raes et al 2009 and apsim keating et al 2003 these models typically are applied to one dimensional soil profiles to represent field scale dynamics a third approach links two or more single domain models to form an integrated agronomic hydrologic modeling system integrated modeling is a straightforward method to join important features of a system from different scientific disciplines haacker et al 2019 the developers of these integrated models strive to assess impacts of water management strategies on both groundwater storage and crop yield the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 simulates land surface hydrology and crop yield for a collection of hydrologic response units hrus within a watershed and has manual irrigation or auto irrigation routines tied to both surface water sources and groundwater however groundwater flow in the aquifer and groundwater discharge to streams is simulated using simplistic flow and lagging equations without consideration of aquifer heterogeneity or regional groundwater flow patterns cai et al 2003 and bulatewicz et al 2010 developed specialized hydrologic agronomic economic modeling systems for irrigated river basins with the latter using the epic model for crop yield simulation and the analytical element model strack 1989 for groundwater flow xu et al 2012 linked modflow with swap soil water atmosphere plant to provide a modeling system that estimates recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes in groundwater systems but did not apply it to groundwater management scenarios varela ortega et al 2011 applied a linked weap economic model to the upper guadiana basin in central spain to analyze effects of water and agricultural policies however the modeling system did not use process based groundwater flow hadded et al 2013 developed the decision support system weap water evaluation and planning modflow for groundwater management in tunisia with weap passing water use to modflow to simulate pumping and groundwater levels pokhrel et al 2015 modified a global land surface model lsm to include groundwater dynamics groundwater pumping irrigation and crop growth to simulate groundwater depletion at the global scale and also for specific aquifers in the usa more recently bailey et al 2016 published a linked swat modflow but the modeling system has not yet been applied to groundwater management scenarios in irrigated regions typically the modeling systems in this third approach are designed for large river basin global spatial and temporal scales without consideration of field scale crop yield strategies and conditions e g soil depth to water table pumping depth etc there is a need for a modeling framework that addresses field scale cropping conditions while accounting for groundwater availability in space and time throughout the aquifer system to assess groundwater storage and crop yield simultaneously over time under various management strategies groundwater pumping should be dependent on crop water demand and applied irrigation depths and timing should be constrained by available groundwater volumes and actual pumping rates i e well capacity the objective of this paper is to present a linked agronomic hydrological modeling system that can be used to evaluate alternative management strategies conducive to both groundwater management and crop production sustainability in groundwater based irrigated regions the modeling framework links the dssat model with modflow with one dssat simulation for each cultivated field within the modflow aquifer modeling domain linkage occurs on an annual basis with dssat simulated irrigation depths and deep percolation converted to pumping rates and recharge for modflow respectively for the following season saturated thickness simulated by modflow constrains pumping rates irrigation depths and timing for each pumping well the scheme is demonstrated for finney county kansas a portion of the ogallala aquifer region experiencing severe groundwater depletion due to extensive groundwater pumping for irrigation whereas this paper focuses on the presentation of the model and a demonstration example future studies can focus on assessing and quantifying the impact of conservation strategies on both groundwater storage and crop yield 2 development of dssat modflow modeling system 2 1 model overview 2 1 1 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat is a software application program that comprises crop simulation models for over 40 crops dssat is supported by data base management programs for soil weather crop management and experimental data and by utilities and application programs the crop simulation models simulate growth development and yield as a function of the soil plant atmosphere dynamics dssat and its crop simulation models have been used for many applications ranging from on farm and precision management to regional assessments of the impact of climate variability and climate change the crop models require daily weather data soil surface and profile information and detailed crop management as input e g irrigation schedules crop genetic information is defined in a crop species file that is provided by dssat and cultivar or variety information that is provided by the user simulations are initiated either at planting or prior to planting through the simulation of a bare fallow period the simulations are conducted at a daily time step and in some cases at an hourly time step depending on the process and the crop model at the end of the day the plant and soil water nitrogen and carbon balances are updated as well as the crop s vegetative and reproductive development stage dssat integrates the effects of soil crop cultivar weather and management options and allows users to ask what if question by conducting virtual simulation experiments dssat also provides for evaluation of crop model outputs with experimental data thus allowing users to compare simulated outcomes with observed results this is critical prior to any application of a crop model especially if real world decisions or recommendations are based on modeled results crop model evaluation is accomplished by inputting the user s minimum data running the model and comparing outputs with observed data dssat includes improved application programs for seasonal spatial sequence and crop rotation analyses that assess the economic risks and environmental impacts associated with irrigation fertilizer and nutrient management climate variability climate change soil carbon sequestration and precision management hoogenboom et al 2019 2 1 2 modflow the modflow harbaugh 2005 is a physically based spatially distributed groundwater flow model that solves the groundwater flow equation for spatial and time dependent groundwater hydraulic head using the finite difference method it can be used to simulate groundwater flow in both confined and unconfined aquifers the aquifer model domain is discretized into cells laterally and vertically with uniform properties of the aquifer e g hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield within a grid cell the modflow can be run for steady state or transient conditions with the latter simulating groundwater head for each grid cell at each time step of the simulation period the time domain is divided into stress periods with each stress period divided into time steps a stress period is a length of simulation time over which all groundwater stresses e g recharge pumping remain constant 2 2 dssat modflow modeling system the linked dssat modflow modeling system developed in this study is based on a simulation loop that passes data between dssat and modflow on an annual basis this system therefore assumes that crop growth is not dependent on the position of the water table as there is no feedback between modflow and dssat during the growing season the current version of the model therefore may not be applicable regions with shallow water tables the linkage process and annual simulation loop are summarized in the schematic shown in fig 1 for a selected model domain one dssat model is run for each cultivated field according to field boundaries to calculate total cultivated area soil type daily weather data and cultivar type mapping dssat output to modflow and vice versa is explained in the following sub sections 2 2 1 step 1 ensemble of dssat simulations the dssat model is used to simulate crop yield and water use the spatial module utility with a batch file is used to simulate the ensemble of dssat field simulations within the model domain the batch file contains a list of all main gsx input files see figure s1 in supplementary information for example with one gsx input file for each crop type within the model domain within each gsx file weather data soil type cultivar type planting schedule and irrigation method are specified for each field of that crop type see figure s2 in supplementary information for example within each simulation dssat calculates the applied irrigation depths amount mm throughout the growing season for each field 2 2 2 step 2 linkage phase 1 dssat modflow phase 1 in the linkage process converts dssat output to modflow input using a python script pumped groundwater volumes are mapped to modflow s grid cells rows and columns see gray cells on the modflow grid in fig 1 using the intersected portion of each field in each grid cell and then written to a text file for modflow s well package which lists the rate and corresponding layer row and column of each pumping cell active during the current growing season as irrigation occurs only for a fraction of days during the growing season consequently most daily pumping rates are 0 for the case of a field containing multiple irrigation wells water use is proportionally distributed to each irrigation well according to the ratio of authorized withdrawal quantity of each singe well recharge volumes for each grid cell are written to a text file for modflow s recharge package total recharge includes precipitation recharge and irrigation return recharge as dssat simulations account for precipitation precipitation recharge is estimated only for cells that do not contain a cultivated field or for cultivated field cells during the non growing season precipitation recharge can be estimated using a number of techniques for the application shown in this paper section 3 precipitation recharge is computed using a power function liu et al 2011 for cells that partially or fully contain a cultivated field recharge from irrigation events is assumed to be equal to the daily deep percolation from the bottom of the soil profile as simulated by dssat the depth of deep percolation is multiplied by the field area to provide a daily volumetric flow rate and then mapped to the intersected grid cells the volume of recharge for each cell is then divided by the cell area occupied by the field to provide a total rate with precipitation recharge in the rest of cell area in l t for inclusion in modflow s recharge package 2 2 3 step 3 modflow simulation following the conclusion of annual dssat runs and the conversion of irrigation depths and deep percolation to pumping rates and recharge the modflow simulation is run for the year to simulate groundwater hydraulic head i e water table elevation for unconfined aquifers for each finite difference grid cell daily stress periods are used to account for daily pumping rates and recharge provided by dssat the groundwater head values at the end of the year are used to compute saturated thickness i e groundwater head bedrock elevation which is used to update well capacity for each pumping well as discussed in step 4 the final groundwater head values at the end of the year are used as initial conditions for the simulation of the following year 2 2 4 step 4 linkage phase 2 modflow dssat phase 2 of the linkage process has two main purposes 1 compute a new well capacity for each pumping well and 2 update irrigation parameters in the dssat simulations that rely on the well capacity the impact of groundwater decline expressed in the form of well capacity on grain yield and a producer s irrigation decisions were demonstrated in araya et al 2018 and rouhi rad et al 2019 respectively in this study well capacity is defined as the maximum rate at which the well can reasonably operate given the local saturated thickness of the aquifer well capacity qt l3 t is updated see fig 1 using the following relationship for unconfined aquifers harman 1966 1 q t q i n i t s t s i n i t 2 where q i n i t and s i n i t are the pumping rate l3 t and aquifer saturated thickness l at some designated time t 0 and s t is the aquifer saturated thickness l after t years saturated thickness st is calculated for each grid cell as the difference between the modflow simulated groundwater head approximately equivalent to the water table in unconfined aquifers and the bedrock elevation with the latter often specified as the bottom of the lowest layer in the modflow model the ifreq irrigation frequency and iramt irrigation application depth parameters control irrigation application in dssat simulations the ifreq parameter relates to the minimum number of days between irrigation events which is equal to the time days required to irrigate the field and iramt mm is the irrigation management depth these parameters are listed in the gsx input files of dssat the values for these two parameters are constrained by the rate at which the groundwater can be extracted from the aquifer i e the well capacity of the pumping well supplying the groundwater as well as the amount of area irrigated in this way the updated well capacity of each pumping well as provided by modflow is used to constrain the irrigation capacity simulated by dssat for each irrigated field in the model domain to update ifreq for each field an assumption is made that 2 54 cm 1 inch of water is supplied to the entire field the time required to apply irrigation is then calculated by dividing the volume of water applied to the field by the well capacity qt for the pumping well that provides water to the field if ifreq is calculated to be longer than 14 days which is assumed to be the longest time for a single irrigation event then ifreq is set to 14 days and instead the depth of irrigation iramt is re calculated to provide a depth 2 54 cm 1 0 inch 2 2 5 step 5 multiple year simulation multiple year simulations are feasible through a batch file see figure s3 in supplementary information for one year example that contains a series of command lines for looping simulations under the environment of dos os 2 or microsoft windows command lines in the batch are divided into blocks in terms of year since the linked model exchange information annually which is user friendly to prepare a batch file for the simulations of the linked model 2 3 model capabilities and limitations although not performed in this current study the dssat modflow modeling system as explained in section 2 2 can be used to explore alternative groundwater conservation strategies in irrigated areas with both crop yield on a field by field basis and water table elevation and saturated thickness on a cell by cell basis tracked each year in the simulation period the model can also be run under varying climate patterns to investigate the impact of climate on management scenarios the variation of water table elevation and simulated crop yields are dynamically linked together through pumping rates and irrigation application timing and depth which is conducive to making comprehensive sustainable groundwater use plans currently the linked model does not simulate water movement in the vadose zone i e between the bottom of the soil layer and the top of water table in the current system deep percolation from the bottom of the soil profile as simulated by dssat and precipitation based recharge as simulated by a power function are assumed to reach the water table instantaneously future versions of the modeling system could use the uzf unsaturated zone flow package of modflow to route the near surface percolation water to the water table 3 application of dssat modflow finney county kansas 3 1 study region the ogallala aquifer also often referred to as the high plains aquifer underlies approximately 45 000 km2 and portions of south dakota wyoming nebraska colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas fig 2 providing water for about one fifth of all irrigated cropland in the usa and 30 of total crop and animal production in the usa guru and horne 2001 rosenberg et al 1999 the composition of aquifer material includes poorly sorted clay silt sand and gravel while the composition of bedrock unit is siltstone shale loosely to moderately cemented clay and silt chalk limestone dolomite conglomerate claystone gypsum anhydrite and bedded salt the elevation of the aquifer bedrock is from 366 m 1200 ft to 1829 m 6000 ft above ngvd 29 gutentag et al 1984 approximately 88 of the water pumped from the ogallala aquifer is used for irrigated agriculture in comparison with 60 of agricultural irrigation that is dependent on groundwater overall in the usa gollehon and winston 2013 scanlon et al 2012 the agricultural area makes up 41 of total land area in the ogallala aquifer region oar which contain 53 row crops 33 small grains and 14 pasture alfalfa and fallow lands furthermore the agricultural land use supplies a large percentage of the total crop and animal production for the united states including 19 of wheat 19 of cotton 15 of corn 3 of sorghum and about 18 of cattle and swine production usgs high plains aquifer wlms 2020 n d due to excessive pumping for irrigation the rate of groundwater depletion has increased from 2 6 km3 yr 1 during 1900 2000 to 12 5 km3 yr 1 during 2003 2013 famiglietti 2014 with 6 of the amount of groundwater storage decreased from the predevelopment period 1950s during the 20th century mcguire et al 2003 the change in water table elevation from predevelopment to 2015 ranges from a decline of 78 m 256 ft to a rise in 26 m 85 ft with an average of 5 m 16 ft decline mcguire 2014 declines occur primarily in eastern colorado southwest kansas oklahoma and texas and rises in central nebraska saturated thickness ranges from 305 m 1000 ft in central nebraska to 15 m 50 ft in large regions of eastern colorado western kansas and west texas according to haacker et al 2016 current rates of decline in parts of the southern and central high plains regions may result in a near complete depletion of groundwater in the next 20 30 years and an associated cessation of irrigation finney county kansas see fig 2 for county outline is selected as the study area for the dssat modflow application fig 2 due to its high dependence on groundwater for irrigation roughly 97 of the total groundwater withdrawals and a resulting 15 meter 50 feet average decline in water table elevation in the majority of the county since 1950 groundwater is used to irrigate 105 218 ha 260 000 acres using 1629 irrigation wells fig 3 a shows a map of average water table elevation m during the 1997 2007 period obtained by interpolating between 522 observation wells in the county water table elevation values for the wells were obtained from the kansas geological survey s kgs water well levels database wizard and the kgs water well completion records database wwc5 about 10 of the point values were not involved in interpolation for calculating the interpolation error the ordinary kriging method under geostatistical analyst extension in arcmap was used to make the interpolated surface of water table elevation maps for different years fig 3b shows an average saturated thickness m during 1997 2007 period saturated thickness was calculated as the difference between the water table elevation and the bedrock elevation the bedrock elevation raster was derived from the well log data of drilled wells of wwc5 using the ordinary kriging method fig 3c shows a change in saturated thickness between 1997 and 2007 with negative values indicating an increase in water table elevation as seen in fig 3c the southern part of the county has experienced the highest water table decline with some areas up to 30 m 99 ft over the time period due to an initially high saturated thickness and an imbalance between pumping and recharge 3 2 dssat modflow model setup 3 2 1 initial data processing the fields and associated irrigation pumping wells in finney county used for the dssat modflow model application are shown in fig 4 the spatial extent of each field was delineated using the national agricultural imagery program naip aerial photo for 2015 resulting in rectangular and circular croplands within the county only fields with groundwater irrigation were included in the modeling system these were identified using information from the state of kansas water information management and analysis system wimas and the public land survey system plss with the latter dividing the land into sections and quarter sections if one or more irrigation wells are in a quarter section then the parcel is classified as irrigated land if there are no wells in the quarter section but the quarter section includes a center pivot and an irrigation well is located within a certain radial distance from the field then the parcel is also considered as irrigated using this method 1332 groundwater irrigated field and 1629 irrigation pumping wells were located within the county see fig 4 authorized groundwater withdrawal quantity for each parcel obtained from wimas was used to determine the number of fields serviced by each pumping well with the well s authorized quantity proportionally partitioned to the fields according to field spatial area 3 2 2 ensemble of dssat simulations the dssat model was previously calibrated and tested for the study area using experimental data with cultivar parameters and associated calibrated values provided for corn wheat and grain sorghum in araya et al 2017 one dssat simulation was run for each of the 1332 fields shown in fig 4 according to properties of fields e g soil type crop type soil water content etc planting management e g planting schedule irrigation method etc weather information cultivar type etc all input information were organized into files according to dssat input file format including soil input file sol daily weather data wth cultivar input file cul spatial execution file gsx operations and management were summarized in the mgmtevents out as mentioned in section 3 2 1 all croplands in the same quarter section are considered as a whole parcel field to determine dominant soil and crop type in 2015 for the groundwater based irrigated parcels the soil survey geographic database ssurgo and usda s cropland data layer cdl were utilized respectively the zonal statistics tool in arcmap was applied to determine dominant soil and crop type in 2015 for each irrigated field since the ssurgo maps include a vast variety of soil types and to facilitate the dssat simulation the dominant soil types of fields were merged into the seven specific soil groups including beeler silt loam las clay loam manter fine sandy loam richfield silt loam satanta loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand six major crops such as corn winter wheat soybeans sorghum and triticale on 564 484 28 206 and 50 fields respectively in finney county fig 4 were simulated with the dssat model historical weather data for 2000 2007 period was collected from a weather station

parameters such as dew point temperature dewp wind velocity wind photosynthetic active radiation par respectively jones and singels 2008 tsuji et al 1994 see figure s4 in supplementary information 3 2 3 modflow model the calibrated modflow model for southwest kansas groundwater management district no 3 gmd3 developed by the kansas geological survey kgs liu et al 2011 was used for linkage with the dssat model the domain area of the modflow model is 161 km by 241 km 100 miles by 150 miles with a rectangular expanse that contains gmd3 and extends approximately 9 7 km 6 miles to the north east south and west fig 5 a the dimensions of each grid cell are 1 61 km by 1 61 km 1 mile by 1 mile the kgs modflow model contains two main phases i e a steady state simulation for the predevelopment period 1944 1946 and a transient simulation for the periods between 1947 and 2007 time varying specified head and time varying flux boundaries were applied along the northern and southern side of the model domain and the western and eastern edges of the model area respectively the top of the permian and cretaceous bedrock was considered as a no flow boundary for the lower boundary of the model while land surface was treated as the upper boundary of the model hydraulic conductivity k and specific yield sy were dynamically updated through the observed water levels to take into account the influence of the decline in water table during transient periods therefore the calibrated model was divided into six periods including predevelopment predevelopment 1966 1967 1976 1977 1986 1987 1996 and 1997 2007 fig 5b and c show cell by cell values of k and sy used in the aquifer during the 1997 2007 simulation period the pumped volumes from the ogallala aquifer for the model were obtained from reported water use records during 2000 2007 period liu et al 2011 recharge to the water table occurs through precipitation recharge and irrigation return deep percolation precipitation recharge was computed by a power function relationship and irrigation return recharge was calculated depending on the irrigation method the model simulated stream aquifer interaction using the stream package str with 18 segments and 764 reaches in the three major streams i e arkansas river cimarron river and crooked creek depending on stream stage calculated by the manning equation with the assumption of a rectangular channel the stress period of the original kgs model is monthly whereas the dssat simulations provide daily based irrigation depths that are converted to daily pumping rates as pumping simulated by the well package is a stress for modflow the modflow model was converted to daily stress periods requiring changes to the discretization file dis the recharge package file rch the time variant specified head package file chd and the stream package file str the well package and recharge package input files were updated through the phase 1 python code see fig 1 using depths of applied irrigation and deep percolation simulated by dssat for each cultivated field 3 2 4 linked dssat modflow model for finney county kansas the linked dssat modflow modeling system for finney county follows the data flow shown in fig 1 following 1332 dssat simulations for the first year with one simulation for each field the dssat simulated irrigation depths were converted to daily pumping rates for the 1629 pumping wells and mapped to the modflow well package similarly recharge rates from precipitation and from dssat simulated deep percolation were converted to daily recharge rates for each grid cell the modflow model was then run for that year providing updated water table elevation and saturated thickness for each grid cell within the county boundary the modflow model for the entire gmd3 was run with pumping rates only modified for the grid cells within the finney county boundary updated saturated thickness was used to update well capacity using eq 1 to do so the initial well capacity qinit for each pumping well and the initial saturated thickness sinit for each grid cell must be specified based on the kgs water well completion records database wwc5 the well capacity value was available for only 503 irrigation wells in finney county since the well capacity was measured during the 1975 1978 period for the majority of these irrigation wells this period was selected to create an interpolated surface raster of well capacity in finney county with the available values the geostatistical analyst extension in arcmap was used to make the interpolated surface using ordinary kriging by creating the interpolated surface of well capacity the well capacity values were estimated for all irrigation pumping wells in the county during 1975 1978 which was considered as qinit results are shown in fig 6 a with well capacity ranging from 1499 to 16 566 m3 d 1 275 to 3039 gal min 1 sinit values for the 1975 1978 period were calculated using water table elevation measurements from the kgs water well level database wizard measurements from 1975 to 1978 were interpolated annually in the same way as for the qinit values using the lithologic log information of the drilled wells in finney county as obtained from wwc5 the approximate location of the aquifer s base was located and the bed rock elevation was estimated at 2281 borehole locations subsequently an interpolated surface of bed rock elevation was created for the county by using the same interpolation method the saturated thickness raster was created by subtracting the bed rock elevation raster from the water table elevation raster the mean saturated thickness raster considered as sinit was created in arcmap for the period of 1975 1978 as the initial saturated thickness fig 6b the simulation was made for the 2000 2007 period with simulation results compared against observed groundwater levels and estimated county wide crop yield for corn sorghum winter wheat and soybeans a scenario without pumping was also simulated to quantify the influence of pumping on groundwater levels in the county 3 2 5 scenario analysis a simple model application was performed to demonstrate the use of the dssat modflow modeling system an end member analysis was performed for assessing the effects of 1 pumping at the current rates of 2000 2007 and 2 cessation of all pumping for the 2000 2007 time period crop yield for both scenarios were also assessed future studies can use the dssat modflow system to explore and quantify the effects of irrigation technology and management practices 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 water table elevation the comparison between observed and simulated water table elevation wte for both the original modflow model and the linked dssat modflow model is shown in fig 7 a and b respectively as seen in the figures the points for both models are scattered along the 1 1 line with no apparent pattern for either model and average errors for the original modflow and the linked model are 8 5 m 28 ft and 8 8 m 29 ft respectively fig 7c shows the results from both models plotted against each other showing a strong similarity in groundwater head output from the two models with nsce of 0 98 and scaled rmse of 0 01837 1 837 this is an especially important result as this indicates that the dssat modflow modeling system is able to provide pumping rates comparable to the reported pumping rates used in the original modflow model therefore dssat can be used as a pumping rate simulator for modflow models in groundwater irrigated regions fig 8 a shows the cell by cell wte values m in the end of 2007 due to continuous pumping for the 2000 2007 periods with high water tables in the northern and western edges of the county fig 8b shows the same plot for the scenario without pumping and fig 8c shows the difference in wte between the two scenarios i e groundwater drawdown for the latter as expected large differences occur in the regions of densely located irrigation well see fig 4 3 3 2 crop yield estimates of county wide observed and simulated crop yield for 2002 and 2007 are presented in fig 9 for corn sorghum winter wheat and soybean results are shown for the county based measurements and the linked dssat modflow model with results from measurements and the linked model using a method calculating a weighted average of crop yield using the area of each field in 2002 simulated yield for the crops are extremely high 12 052 kg ha 1 and 9200 kg ha 1 for sorghum and winter wheat respectively compared to the measured values 2349 kg ha 1 and 2137 kg ha 1 for sorghum and winter wheat respectively possibly due to uncertainty in the weather data input into the dssat simulations in addition measured values include fields for the entire county whereas model results are only for groundwater irrigated fields other fields may not have as high of crop yield due to dependence on surface water or reliance on rainfall in the case of dryland farming thereby decreasing the overall average crop yield also it could be due to the reason that the modeled crop yield does not account for pest weed pressure furthermore for sorghum and winter wheat which show a large difference between simulated and measured values the reason could be an inadequate calibration for southwest kansas in general simulated yields will be difficult to match county average yields for sorghum and winter wheat because these crops are either not irrigated or under deficit irrigation so there exists a wide standard deviation around the mean yield in 2007 the measured value for corn 13 980 kg ha 1 is a little higher than the simulated value 13 677 kg ha 1 and the measured and simulated values for soybean are 3120 kg ha 1 and 4092 kg ha 1 respectively 3 3 3 well capacity and saturated thickness well capacity should be tracked through time to determine feasibility of future pumping in the region the relationship between well capacity m3 d 1 for each pumping well and groundwater saturated thickness in the local area of the pumping well i e the grid cell in which the pumping well resides is shown in fig 10 there is one trend line for each pumping well showing the decrease in well capacity during the 2000 2007 time periods due to decrease in saturated thickness each segment trends to 0 with several wells reaching 0 well capacity due to a complete depletion of groundwater in the local area around the pumping well for areas with a large saturated thickness 76 m well capacities are not significantly sensitive to the change in saturated thickness whereas areas with small saturated thickness 18 m exhibit a strong sensitivity of well capacity to saturated thickness similarly well capacity is sensitive to saturated thickness for wells with high pumping rates 8000 m3 d 1 not for wells with low pumping rates the trend in well capacity of course could be reversed if pumping ceases 3 3 4 percent change in well capacity the percent change in well capacity for each pumping well during the 2000 2007 period in finney county is shown in fig 11 well capacity changes spatially in terms of crop type which dictates pumping rates and aquifer characteristics which dictate saturated thickness dark and light blue dots represent wells that increased capacity due to replenishment of groundwater however the majority of finney county experiences a decline in well capacity the highest changes in well capacity 60 occurred in the north region of the finney county in which corn and winter wheat were grown see fig 4 due to low well capacity and small initial saturated thickness see figs 3b and 6 moderate changes in well capacity 20 40 and high changes 40 occurs in the southern area again related to initial well capacity and initial saturated thickness 3 3 5 results of pumping vs no pumping considering all cell by cell results from finney county average water table elevation gradually depletes during the 2000 2007 period this is shown in fig 12 which shows the pre development water table elevation wte the elevation of the bedrock and the wte with full irrigation i e the baseline model used in this study fig 12a the average crop yields kg ha 1 are also shown for this scenario fig 12b results from the second scenario in which no groundwater pumping occurs during the 1997 2007 period are also shown along with average crop yield as seen from the results no irrigation during the decadal period increases average wte from 846 m to 848 m 2775 ft to 2782 ft with the change in wte ranging from a decline of 2 m 6 ft to a rise of 9 m 29 ft however this increase is at the expense of crop yields which are decreased from 16 238 kg ha 1 corn 4277 kg ha 1 soybean 13 071 kg ha 1 sorghum and 11 892 kg ha 1 winter wheat for the full irrigation scenario to 2705 kg ha 1 corn 1632 kg ha 1 soybean 4405 kg ha 1 sorghum and 1851 kg ha 1 winter wheat for the non irrigation scenario with a decrease of crop yields by 83 62 66 84 for corn soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively therefore management strategies are sought that balance between conserving groundwater and maintaining crop yield for future decades i e that can decrease the gap between the full pumping and no pumping scenarios while also preserving adequate crop yield for the local economy such strategies may include implementing irrigation technology to increase irrigation efficiency optimized irrigation scheduling and crop selection the linked dssat modflow model presented in this paper can assist in assessing the influence of these management strategies the influence of future climate patterns on these impacts can also be estimated using the linked model 4 summary and conclusion this study presents a linked dssat modflow modeling framework and applied it to the ogallala aquifer within finney county kansas a region experiencing significant groundwater depletion due to irrigation practices the linkage between the models occurs on an annual time step with irrigation depths and deep percolation from an ensemble of field scale dssat simulations dssat version 4 7 converted to pumping rates and recharge for the modflow simulation modflow 2000 the modflow simulates groundwater head which can be used to update saturated thickness and thereby well capacities for each pumping well in the model domain well capacities are then used to constrain irrigation application in the dssat simulations during the following growing season python scripts are used to pass information between the two models and prepare input files batch files for dssat are used to run the ensemble of simulations for each year model results are tested against water table elevation and crop yield this paper focuses on the presentation and demonstration of the dssat modflow modeling system whereas future studies can focus on assessing future conditions under changes in climate and management practices the dssat modflow modeling system can be a valuable tool in assessing groundwater conservation strategies in groundwater irrigated regions since it tracks jointly groundwater resources groundwater head saturated thickness pumping conditions well capacity and crop yield therefore any strategy used to conserve groundwater can also be assessed in terms of resulting crop yield to determine feasibility for local economies the model can be used to assess changes in irrigation technology crop selection and climate change in addition in areas where pumping rates are not readily available the dssat portion of the linked model can be used to estimate pumping rates based on dssat s crop growth routines and associated irrigation depths conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national institute of

10703,groundwater models are often used to assess the impact of climate or management strategies on groundwater resources in arid and semiarid regions of the world however these models do not account for crop growth and crop yield and thus cannot be used for evaluating long term impacts of climate and management strategies on water use efficiency and farm profitability of agricultural systems while managing the aquifers sustainably this study presented a linkage between dssat an agronomic model and modflow a groundwater flow model the linkage between these two models occurred on an annual basis with rates of irrigation and deep percolation from an ensemble of field scale dssat simulations converted to pumping rates and recharge rates for the modflow simulation modflow simulated groundwater head which can be used to update saturated thickness and thereby well capacities for each pumping well in the model domain simulated well capacities were then used to constrain irrigation applications in the dssat simulations during the following growing season python scripts were used to convert output from one model to input files for the other model the dssat modflow modeling system was applied to the ogallala aquifer underlying finney county kansas a region experiencing significant groundwater depletion due to irrigation practices and was tested against observed water table elevation and crop yield over a decadal period well capacity decreased by 50 for many pumping wells in the county a no irrigation scenario for this same time period resulted in average water table elevation increasing by 2 m but also a 70 decline in crop yield additional work is needed to balance groundwater conservation with crop yield the dssat modflow modeling system can be used in regions worldwide to assess changes in irrigation technologies crop selection and climate change adaptation strategies keywords groundwater modeling dssat modflow irrigation integrated modeling 1 introduction excessive groundwater depletion occurs in various regions of the world konikow and kendy 2005 principally due to intensive use of groundwater for irrigation in arid and semi arid regions according to a recent global study using hydrologic models total global groundwater depletion had increased from 126 km3 yr 1 in 1960 to 283 km3 yr 1 in 2000 wada et al 2010 in the first 8 years of the 21st century total groundwater consumption was more than 1100 km3 approximately one fourth the entire depletion experienced during the 20th century konikow 2011 groundwater depletion has led to decreasing well yields increased pumping costs land subsidence and associated damage to infrastructure wetland degradation reduction in groundwater discharge to streams and seawater intrusion in coastal areas aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 konikow and kendy 2005 motagh et al 2008 varela ortega et al 2011 werner 2010 zhang et al 2014 although groundwater sustainability i e the use of groundwater without causing a decrease in groundwater storage may not be possible for many arid and semi arid regions land and water management strategies can be pursued to minimize groundwater depletion while maintaining adequate crop yield for local populations and export often numerical models are used to explore the impact of various management strategies on groundwater storage and crop yield these modeling approaches can be classified into three broad modeling groups 1 groundwater based 2 agronomic based and 3 linked agronomic groundwater based models groundwater based approaches use numerical groundwater flow models to simulate groundwater head groundwater flow and groundwater storage under a variety of management scenarios examples include ebraheem et al 2003 dawoud et al 2005 mao et al 2005 and mylopoulos et al 2007 who used process based groundwater flow models to investigate the impact of groundwater management options on groundwater storage and conservation in southwest egypt the nile river valley northern china and northern greece respectively models used in these studies include modflow harbaugh 2005 a finite difference groundwater flow model and triwaco dawoud et al 2005 a finite element groundwater flow model management strategies include reduction in pumping new irrigation canals irrigation patterns and increase in irrigation efficiency modflow with the farm process mf fmp schmid et al 2006 which includes routines for plant consumptive use of water was employed by hanson et al 2010 to evaluate sources of irrigation water for central valley california a recent study wada et al 2012 linked global scale hydrological land surface prc globwb and groundwater modflow models to simulate changes in global groundwater storage due to climate and groundwater pumping these groundwater based approaches while successfully simulating groundwater energy and flow in aquifers neglect the effect of groundwater management strategies on crop yield in contrast agronomic based approaches simulate the effect of the interactions between genetics weather and management e g irrigation management on crop growth but do not account for the impact of groundwater availability on irrigation capacity and associated crop yield yang et al 2006 used the dssat crop growth model jones et al 2003 to optimize water use during the stages of leaf and ear growth of wheat to minimize groundwater depletion in the north china plains while kisekka et al 2015 used dssat to assess effects of various irrigation management strategies on maize in western kansas other agronomic models that have been used to explore irrigation impact on crop yield include epic williams et al 1989 the simdualkc model rolim et al 2006 rosa and paredes 2011 wu et al 2015 aquacrop raes et al 2009 and apsim keating et al 2003 these models typically are applied to one dimensional soil profiles to represent field scale dynamics a third approach links two or more single domain models to form an integrated agronomic hydrologic modeling system integrated modeling is a straightforward method to join important features of a system from different scientific disciplines haacker et al 2019 the developers of these integrated models strive to assess impacts of water management strategies on both groundwater storage and crop yield the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 simulates land surface hydrology and crop yield for a collection of hydrologic response units hrus within a watershed and has manual irrigation or auto irrigation routines tied to both surface water sources and groundwater however groundwater flow in the aquifer and groundwater discharge to streams is simulated using simplistic flow and lagging equations without consideration of aquifer heterogeneity or regional groundwater flow patterns cai et al 2003 and bulatewicz et al 2010 developed specialized hydrologic agronomic economic modeling systems for irrigated river basins with the latter using the epic model for crop yield simulation and the analytical element model strack 1989 for groundwater flow xu et al 2012 linked modflow with swap soil water atmosphere plant to provide a modeling system that estimates recharge and evapotranspiration fluxes in groundwater systems but did not apply it to groundwater management scenarios varela ortega et al 2011 applied a linked weap economic model to the upper guadiana basin in central spain to analyze effects of water and agricultural policies however the modeling system did not use process based groundwater flow hadded et al 2013 developed the decision support system weap water evaluation and planning modflow for groundwater management in tunisia with weap passing water use to modflow to simulate pumping and groundwater levels pokhrel et al 2015 modified a global land surface model lsm to include groundwater dynamics groundwater pumping irrigation and crop growth to simulate groundwater depletion at the global scale and also for specific aquifers in the usa more recently bailey et al 2016 published a linked swat modflow but the modeling system has not yet been applied to groundwater management scenarios in irrigated regions typically the modeling systems in this third approach are designed for large river basin global spatial and temporal scales without consideration of field scale crop yield strategies and conditions e g soil depth to water table pumping depth etc there is a need for a modeling framework that addresses field scale cropping conditions while accounting for groundwater availability in space and time throughout the aquifer system to assess groundwater storage and crop yield simultaneously over time under various management strategies groundwater pumping should be dependent on crop water demand and applied irrigation depths and timing should be constrained by available groundwater volumes and actual pumping rates i e well capacity the objective of this paper is to present a linked agronomic hydrological modeling system that can be used to evaluate alternative management strategies conducive to both groundwater management and crop production sustainability in groundwater based irrigated regions the modeling framework links the dssat model with modflow with one dssat simulation for each cultivated field within the modflow aquifer modeling domain linkage occurs on an annual basis with dssat simulated irrigation depths and deep percolation converted to pumping rates and recharge for modflow respectively for the following season saturated thickness simulated by modflow constrains pumping rates irrigation depths and timing for each pumping well the scheme is demonstrated for finney county kansas a portion of the ogallala aquifer region experiencing severe groundwater depletion due to extensive groundwater pumping for irrigation whereas this paper focuses on the presentation of the model and a demonstration example future studies can focus on assessing and quantifying the impact of conservation strategies on both groundwater storage and crop yield 2 development of dssat modflow modeling system 2 1 model overview 2 1 1 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat is a software application program that comprises crop simulation models for over 40 crops dssat is supported by data base management programs for soil weather crop management and experimental data and by utilities and application programs the crop simulation models simulate growth development and yield as a function of the soil plant atmosphere dynamics dssat and its crop simulation models have been used for many applications ranging from on farm and precision management to regional assessments of the impact of climate variability and climate change the crop models require daily weather data soil surface and profile information and detailed crop management as input e g irrigation schedules crop genetic information is defined in a crop species file that is provided by dssat and cultivar or variety information that is provided by the user simulations are initiated either at planting or prior to planting through the simulation of a bare fallow period the simulations are conducted at a daily time step and in some cases at an hourly time step depending on the process and the crop model at the end of the day the plant and soil water nitrogen and carbon balances are updated as well as the crop s vegetative and reproductive development stage dssat integrates the effects of soil crop cultivar weather and management options and allows users to ask what if question by conducting virtual simulation experiments dssat also provides for evaluation of crop model outputs with experimental data thus allowing users to compare simulated outcomes with observed results this is critical prior to any application of a crop model especially if real world decisions or recommendations are based on modeled results crop model evaluation is accomplished by inputting the user s minimum data running the model and comparing outputs with observed data dssat includes improved application programs for seasonal spatial sequence and crop rotation analyses that assess the economic risks and environmental impacts associated with irrigation fertilizer and nutrient management climate variability climate change soil carbon sequestration and precision management hoogenboom et al 2019 2 1 2 modflow the modflow harbaugh 2005 is a physically based spatially distributed groundwater flow model that solves the groundwater flow equation for spatial and time dependent groundwater hydraulic head using the finite difference method it can be used to simulate groundwater flow in both confined and unconfined aquifers the aquifer model domain is discretized into cells laterally and vertically with uniform properties of the aquifer e g hydraulic conductivity specific storage and specific yield within a grid cell the modflow can be run for steady state or transient conditions with the latter simulating groundwater head for each grid cell at each time step of the simulation period the time domain is divided into stress periods with each stress period divided into time steps a stress period is a length of simulation time over which all groundwater stresses e g recharge pumping remain constant 2 2 dssat modflow modeling system the linked dssat modflow modeling system developed in this study is based on a simulation loop that passes data between dssat and modflow on an annual basis this system therefore assumes that crop growth is not dependent on the position of the water table as there is no feedback between modflow and dssat during the growing season the current version of the model therefore may not be applicable regions with shallow water tables the linkage process and annual simulation loop are summarized in the schematic shown in fig 1 for a selected model domain one dssat model is run for each cultivated field according to field boundaries to calculate total cultivated area soil type daily weather data and cultivar type mapping dssat output to modflow and vice versa is explained in the following sub sections 2 2 1 step 1 ensemble of dssat simulations the dssat model is used to simulate crop yield and water use the spatial module utility with a batch file is used to simulate the ensemble of dssat field simulations within the model domain the batch file contains a list of all main gsx input files see figure s1 in supplementary information for example with one gsx input file for each crop type within the model domain within each gsx file weather data soil type cultivar type planting schedule and irrigation method are specified for each field of that crop type see figure s2 in supplementary information for example within each simulation dssat calculates the applied irrigation depths amount mm throughout the growing season for each field 2 2 2 step 2 linkage phase 1 dssat modflow phase 1 in the linkage process converts dssat output to modflow input using a python script pumped groundwater volumes are mapped to modflow s grid cells rows and columns see gray cells on the modflow grid in fig 1 using the intersected portion of each field in each grid cell and then written to a text file for modflow s well package which lists the rate and corresponding layer row and column of each pumping cell active during the current growing season as irrigation occurs only for a fraction of days during the growing season consequently most daily pumping rates are 0 for the case of a field containing multiple irrigation wells water use is proportionally distributed to each irrigation well according to the ratio of authorized withdrawal quantity of each singe well recharge volumes for each grid cell are written to a text file for modflow s recharge package total recharge includes precipitation recharge and irrigation return recharge as dssat simulations account for precipitation precipitation recharge is estimated only for cells that do not contain a cultivated field or for cultivated field cells during the non growing season precipitation recharge can be estimated using a number of techniques for the application shown in this paper section 3 precipitation recharge is computed using a power function liu et al 2011 for cells that partially or fully contain a cultivated field recharge from irrigation events is assumed to be equal to the daily deep percolation from the bottom of the soil profile as simulated by dssat the depth of deep percolation is multiplied by the field area to provide a daily volumetric flow rate and then mapped to the intersected grid cells the volume of recharge for each cell is then divided by the cell area occupied by the field to provide a total rate with precipitation recharge in the rest of cell area in l t for inclusion in modflow s recharge package 2 2 3 step 3 modflow simulation following the conclusion of annual dssat runs and the conversion of irrigation depths and deep percolation to pumping rates and recharge the modflow simulation is run for the year to simulate groundwater hydraulic head i e water table elevation for unconfined aquifers for each finite difference grid cell daily stress periods are used to account for daily pumping rates and recharge provided by dssat the groundwater head values at the end of the year are used to compute saturated thickness i e groundwater head bedrock elevation which is used to update well capacity for each pumping well as discussed in step 4 the final groundwater head values at the end of the year are used as initial conditions for the simulation of the following year 2 2 4 step 4 linkage phase 2 modflow dssat phase 2 of the linkage process has two main purposes 1 compute a new well capacity for each pumping well and 2 update irrigation parameters in the dssat simulations that rely on the well capacity the impact of groundwater decline expressed in the form of well capacity on grain yield and a producer s irrigation decisions were demonstrated in araya et al 2018 and rouhi rad et al 2019 respectively in this study well capacity is defined as the maximum rate at which the well can reasonably operate given the local saturated thickness of the aquifer well capacity qt l3 t is updated see fig 1 using the following relationship for unconfined aquifers harman 1966 1 q t q i n i t s t s i n i t 2 where q i n i t and s i n i t are the pumping rate l3 t and aquifer saturated thickness l at some designated time t 0 and s t is the aquifer saturated thickness l after t years saturated thickness st is calculated for each grid cell as the difference between the modflow simulated groundwater head approximately equivalent to the water table in unconfined aquifers and the bedrock elevation with the latter often specified as the bottom of the lowest layer in the modflow model the ifreq irrigation frequency and iramt irrigation application depth parameters control irrigation application in dssat simulations the ifreq parameter relates to the minimum number of days between irrigation events which is equal to the time days required to irrigate the field and iramt mm is the irrigation management depth these parameters are listed in the gsx input files of dssat the values for these two parameters are constrained by the rate at which the groundwater can be extracted from the aquifer i e the well capacity of the pumping well supplying the groundwater as well as the amount of area irrigated in this way the updated well capacity of each pumping well as provided by modflow is used to constrain the irrigation capacity simulated by dssat for each irrigated field in the model domain to update ifreq for each field an assumption is made that 2 54 cm 1 inch of water is supplied to the entire field the time required to apply irrigation is then calculated by dividing the volume of water applied to the field by the well capacity qt for the pumping well that provides water to the field if ifreq is calculated to be longer than 14 days which is assumed to be the longest time for a single irrigation event then ifreq is set to 14 days and instead the depth of irrigation iramt is re calculated to provide a depth 2 54 cm 1 0 inch 2 2 5 step 5 multiple year simulation multiple year simulations are feasible through a batch file see figure s3 in supplementary information for one year example that contains a series of command lines for looping simulations under the environment of dos os 2 or microsoft windows command lines in the batch are divided into blocks in terms of year since the linked model exchange information annually which is user friendly to prepare a batch file for the simulations of the linked model 2 3 model capabilities and limitations although not performed in this current study the dssat modflow modeling system as explained in section 2 2 can be used to explore alternative groundwater conservation strategies in irrigated areas with both crop yield on a field by field basis and water table elevation and saturated thickness on a cell by cell basis tracked each year in the simulation period the model can also be run under varying climate patterns to investigate the impact of climate on management scenarios the variation of water table elevation and simulated crop yields are dynamically linked together through pumping rates and irrigation application timing and depth which is conducive to making comprehensive sustainable groundwater use plans currently the linked model does not simulate water movement in the vadose zone i e between the bottom of the soil layer and the top of water table in the current system deep percolation from the bottom of the soil profile as simulated by dssat and precipitation based recharge as simulated by a power function are assumed to reach the water table instantaneously future versions of the modeling system could use the uzf unsaturated zone flow package of modflow to route the near surface percolation water to the water table 3 application of dssat modflow finney county kansas 3 1 study region the ogallala aquifer also often referred to as the high plains aquifer underlies approximately 45 000 km2 and portions of south dakota wyoming nebraska colorado kansas oklahoma new mexico and texas fig 2 providing water for about one fifth of all irrigated cropland in the usa and 30 of total crop and animal production in the usa guru and horne 2001 rosenberg et al 1999 the composition of aquifer material includes poorly sorted clay silt sand and gravel while the composition of bedrock unit is siltstone shale loosely to moderately cemented clay and silt chalk limestone dolomite conglomerate claystone gypsum anhydrite and bedded salt the elevation of the aquifer bedrock is from 366 m 1200 ft to 1829 m 6000 ft above ngvd 29 gutentag et al 1984 approximately 88 of the water pumped from the ogallala aquifer is used for irrigated agriculture in comparison with 60 of agricultural irrigation that is dependent on groundwater overall in the usa gollehon and winston 2013 scanlon et al 2012 the agricultural area makes up 41 of total land area in the ogallala aquifer region oar which contain 53 row crops 33 small grains and 14 pasture alfalfa and fallow lands furthermore the agricultural land use supplies a large percentage of the total crop and animal production for the united states including 19 of wheat 19 of cotton 15 of corn 3 of sorghum and about 18 of cattle and swine production usgs high plains aquifer wlms 2020 n d due to excessive pumping for irrigation the rate of groundwater depletion has increased from 2 6 km3 yr 1 during 1900 2000 to 12 5 km3 yr 1 during 2003 2013 famiglietti 2014 with 6 of the amount of groundwater storage decreased from the predevelopment period 1950s during the 20th century mcguire et al 2003 the change in water table elevation from predevelopment to 2015 ranges from a decline of 78 m 256 ft to a rise in 26 m 85 ft with an average of 5 m 16 ft decline mcguire 2014 declines occur primarily in eastern colorado southwest kansas oklahoma and texas and rises in central nebraska saturated thickness ranges from 305 m 1000 ft in central nebraska to 15 m 50 ft in large regions of eastern colorado western kansas and west texas according to haacker et al 2016 current rates of decline in parts of the southern and central high plains regions may result in a near complete depletion of groundwater in the next 20 30 years and an associated cessation of irrigation finney county kansas see fig 2 for county outline is selected as the study area for the dssat modflow application fig 2 due to its high dependence on groundwater for irrigation roughly 97 of the total groundwater withdrawals and a resulting 15 meter 50 feet average decline in water table elevation in the majority of the county since 1950 groundwater is used to irrigate 105 218 ha 260 000 acres using 1629 irrigation wells fig 3 a shows a map of average water table elevation m during the 1997 2007 period obtained by interpolating between 522 observation wells in the county water table elevation values for the wells were obtained from the kansas geological survey s kgs water well levels database wizard and the kgs water well completion records database wwc5 about 10 of the point values were not involved in interpolation for calculating the interpolation error the ordinary kriging method under geostatistical analyst extension in arcmap was used to make the interpolated surface of water table elevation maps for different years fig 3b shows an average saturated thickness m during 1997 2007 period saturated thickness was calculated as the difference between the water table elevation and the bedrock elevation the bedrock elevation raster was derived from the well log data of drilled wells of wwc5 using the ordinary kriging method fig 3c shows a change in saturated thickness between 1997 and 2007 with negative values indicating an increase in water table elevation as seen in fig 3c the southern part of the county has experienced the highest water table decline with some areas up to 30 m 99 ft over the time period due to an initially high saturated thickness and an imbalance between pumping and recharge 3 2 dssat modflow model setup 3 2 1 initial data processing the fields and associated irrigation pumping wells in finney county used for the dssat modflow model application are shown in fig 4 the spatial extent of each field was delineated using the national agricultural imagery program naip aerial photo for 2015 resulting in rectangular and circular croplands within the county only fields with groundwater irrigation were included in the modeling system these were identified using information from the state of kansas water information management and analysis system wimas and the public land survey system plss with the latter dividing the land into sections and quarter sections if one or more irrigation wells are in a quarter section then the parcel is classified as irrigated land if there are no wells in the quarter section but the quarter section includes a center pivot and an irrigation well is located within a certain radial distance from the field then the parcel is also considered as irrigated using this method 1332 groundwater irrigated field and 1629 irrigation pumping wells were located within the county see fig 4 authorized groundwater withdrawal quantity for each parcel obtained from wimas was used to determine the number of fields serviced by each pumping well with the well s authorized quantity proportionally partitioned to the fields according to field spatial area 3 2 2 ensemble of dssat simulations the dssat model was previously calibrated and tested for the study area using experimental data with cultivar parameters and associated calibrated values provided for corn wheat and grain sorghum in araya et al 2017 one dssat simulation was run for each of the 1332 fields shown in fig 4 according to properties of fields e g soil type crop type soil water content etc planting management e g planting schedule irrigation method etc weather information cultivar type etc all input information were organized into files according to dssat input file format including soil input file sol daily weather data wth cultivar input file cul spatial execution file gsx operations and management were summarized in the mgmtevents out as mentioned in section 3 2 1 all croplands in the same quarter section are considered as a whole parcel field to determine dominant soil and crop type in 2015 for the groundwater based irrigated parcels the soil survey geographic database ssurgo and usda s cropland data layer cdl were utilized respectively the zonal statistics tool in arcmap was applied to determine dominant soil and crop type in 2015 for each irrigated field since the ssurgo maps include a vast variety of soil types and to facilitate the dssat simulation the dominant soil types of fields were merged into the seven specific soil groups including beeler silt loam las clay loam manter fine sandy loam richfield silt loam satanta loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand six major crops such as corn winter wheat soybeans sorghum and triticale on 564 484 28 206 and 50 fields respectively in finney county fig 4 were simulated with the dssat model historical weather data for 2000 2007 period was collected from a weather station

3 modflow model the calibrated modflow model for southwest kansas groundwater management district no 3 gmd3 developed by the kansas geological survey kgs liu et al 2011 was used for linkage with the dssat model the domain area of the modflow model is 161 km by 241 km 100 miles by 150 miles with a rectangular expanse that contains gmd3 and extends approximately 9 7 km 6 miles to the north east south and west fig 5 a the dimensions of each grid cell are 1 61 km by 1 61 km 1 mile by 1 mile the kgs modflow model contains two main phases i e a steady state simulation for the predevelopment period 1944 1946 and a transient simulation for the periods between 1947 and 2007 time varying specified head and time varying flux boundaries were applied along the northern and southern side of the model domain and the western and eastern edges of the model area respectively the top of the permian and cretaceous bedrock was considered as a no flow boundary for the lower boundary of the model while land surface was treated as the upper boundary of the model hydraulic conductivity k and specific yield sy were dynamically updated through the observed water levels to take into account the influence of the decline in water table during transient periods therefore the calibrated model was divided into six periods including predevelopment predevelopment 1966 1967 1976 1977 1986 1987 1996 and 1997 2007 fig 5b and c show cell by cell values of k and sy used in the aquifer during the 1997 2007 simulation period the pumped volumes from the ogallala aquifer for the model were obtained from reported water use records during 2000 2007 period liu et al 2011 recharge to the water table occurs through precipitation recharge and irrigation return deep percolation precipitation recharge was computed by a power function relationship and irrigation return recharge was calculated depending on the irrigation method the model simulated stream aquifer interaction using the stream package str with 18 segments and 764 reaches in the three major streams i e arkansas river cimarron river and crooked creek depending on stream stage calculated by the manning equation with the assumption of a rectangular channel the stress period of the original kgs model is monthly whereas the dssat simulations provide daily based irrigation depths that are converted to daily pumping rates as pumping simulated by the well package is a stress for modflow the modflow model was converted to daily stress periods requiring changes to the discretization file dis the recharge package file rch the time variant specified head package file chd and the stream package file str the well package and recharge package input files were updated through the phase 1 python code see fig 1 using depths of applied irrigation and deep percolation simulated by dssat for each cultivated field 3 2 4 linked dssat modflow model for finney county kansas the linked dssat modflow modeling system for finney county follows the data flow shown in fig 1 following 1332 dssat simulations for the first year with one simulation for each field the dssat simulated irrigation depths were converted to daily pumping rates for the 1629 pumping wells and mapped to the modflow well package similarly recharge rates from precipitation and from dssat simulated deep percolation were converted to daily recharge rates for each grid cell the modflow model was then run for that year providing updated water table elevation and saturated thickness for each grid cell within the county boundary the modflow model for the entire gmd3 was run with pumping rates only modified for the grid cells within the finney county boundary updated saturated thickness was used to update well capacity using eq 1 to do so the initial well capacity qinit for each pumping well and the initial saturated thickness sinit for each grid cell must be specified based on the kgs water well completion records database wwc5 the well capacity value was available for only 503 irrigation wells in finney county since the well capacity was measured during the 1975 1978 period for the majority of these irrigation wells this period was selected to create an interpolated surface raster of well capacity in finney county with the available values the geostatistical analyst extension in arcmap was used to make the interpolated surface using ordinary kriging by creating the interpolated surface of well capacity the well capacity values were estimated for all irrigation pumping wells in the county during 1975 1978 which was considered as qinit results are shown in fig 6 a with well capacity ranging from 1499 to 16 566 m3 d 1 275 to 3039 gal min 1 sinit values for the 1975 1978 period were calculated using water table elevation measurements from the kgs water well level database wizard measurements from 1975 to 1978 were interpolated annually in the same way as for the qinit values using the lithologic log information of the drilled wells in finney county as obtained from wwc5 the approximate location of the aquifer s base was located and the bed rock elevation was estimated at 2281 borehole locations subsequently an interpolated surface of bed rock elevation was created for the county by using the same interpolation method the saturated thickness raster was created by subtracting the bed rock elevation raster from the water table elevation raster the mean saturated thickness raster considered as sinit was created in arcmap for the period of 1975 1978 as the initial saturated thickness fig 6b the simulation was made for the 2000 2007 period with simulation results compared against observed groundwater levels and estimated county wide crop yield for corn sorghum winter wheat and soybeans a scenario without pumping was also simulated to quantify the influence of pumping on groundwater levels in the county 3 2 5 scenario analysis a simple model application was performed to demonstrate the use of the dssat modflow modeling system an end member analysis was performed for assessing the effects of 1 pumping at the current rates of 2000 2007 and 2 cessation of all pumping for the 2000 2007 time period crop yield for both scenarios were also assessed future studies can use the dssat modflow system to explore and quantify the effects of irrigation technology and management practices 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 water table elevation the comparison between observed and simulated water table elevation wte for both the original modflow model and the linked dssat modflow model is shown in fig 7 a and b respectively as seen in the figures the points for both models are scattered along the 1 1 line with no apparent pattern for either model and average errors for the original modflow and the linked model are 8 5 m 28 ft and 8 8 m 29 ft respectively fig 7c shows the results from both models plotted against each other showing a strong similarity in groundwater head output from the two models with nsce of 0 98 and scaled rmse of 0 01837 1 837 this is an especially important result as this indicates that the dssat modflow modeling system is able to provide pumping rates comparable to the reported pumping rates used in the original modflow model therefore dssat can be used as a pumping rate simulator for modflow models in groundwater irrigated regions fig 8 a shows the cell by cell wte values m in the end of 2007 due to continuous pumping for the 2000 2007 periods with high water tables in the northern and western edges of the county fig 8b shows the same plot for the scenario without pumping and fig 8c shows the difference in wte between the two scenarios i e groundwater drawdown for the latter as expected large differences occur in the regions of densely located irrigation well see fig 4 3 3 2 crop yield estimates of county wide observed and simulated crop yield for 2002 and 2007 are presented in fig 9 for corn sorghum winter wheat and soybean results are shown for the county based measurements and the linked dssat modflow model with results from measurements and the linked model using a method calculating a weighted average of crop yield using the area of each field in 2002 simulated yield for the crops are extremely high 12 052 kg ha 1 and 9200 kg ha 1 for sorghum and winter wheat respectively compared to the measured values 2349 kg ha 1 and 2137 kg ha 1 for sorghum and winter wheat respectively possibly due to uncertainty in the weather data input into the dssat simulations in addition measured values include fields for the entire county whereas model results are only for groundwater irrigated fields other fields may not have as high of crop yield due to dependence on surface water or reliance on rainfall in the case of dryland farming thereby decreasing the overall average crop yield also it could be due to the reason that the modeled crop yield does not account for pest weed pressure furthermore for sorghum and winter wheat which show a large difference between simulated and measured values the reason could be an inadequate calibration for southwest kansas in general simulated yields will be difficult to match county average yields for sorghum and winter wheat because these crops are either not irrigated or under deficit irrigation so there exists a wide standard deviation around the mean yield in 2007 the measured value for corn 13 980 kg ha 1 is a little higher than the simulated value 13 677 kg ha 1 and the measured and simulated values for soybean are 3120 kg ha 1 and 4092 kg ha 1 respectively 3 3 3 well capacity and saturated thickness well capacity should be tracked through time to determine feasibility of future pumping in the region the relationship between well capacity m3 d 1 for each pumping well and groundwater saturated thickness in the local area of the pumping well i e the grid cell in which the pumping well resides is shown in fig 10 there is one trend line for each pumping well showing the decrease in well capacity during the 2000 2007 time periods due to decrease in saturated thickness each segment trends to 0 with several wells reaching 0 well capacity due to a complete depletion of groundwater in the local area around the pumping well for areas with a large saturated thickness 76 m well capacities are not significantly sensitive to the change in saturated thickness whereas areas with small saturated thickness 18 m exhibit a strong sensitivity of well capacity to saturated thickness similarly well capacity is sensitive to saturated thickness for wells with high pumping rates 8000 m3 d 1 not for wells with low pumping rates the trend in well capacity of course could be reversed if pumping ceases 3 3 4 percent change in well capacity the percent change in well capacity for each pumping well during the 2000 2007 period in finney county is shown in fig 11 well capacity changes spatially in terms of crop type which dictates pumping rates and aquifer characteristics which dictate saturated thickness dark and light blue dots represent wells that increased capacity due to replenishment of groundwater however the majority of finney county experiences a decline in well capacity the highest changes in well capacity 60 occurred in the north region of the finney county in which corn and winter wheat were grown see fig 4 due to low well capacity and small initial saturated thickness see figs 3b and 6 moderate changes in well capacity 20 40 and high changes 40 occurs in the southern area again related to initial well capacity and initial saturated thickness 3 3 5 results of pumping vs no pumping considering all cell by cell results from finney county average water table elevation gradually depletes during the 2000 2007 period this is shown in fig 12 which shows the pre development water table elevation wte the elevation of the bedrock and the wte with full irrigation i e the baseline model used in this study fig 12a the average crop yields kg ha 1 are also shown for this scenario fig 12b results from the second scenario in which no groundwater pumping occurs during the 1997 2007 period are also shown along with average crop yield as seen from the results no irrigation during the decadal period increases average wte from 846 m to 848 m 2775 ft to 2782 ft with the change in wte ranging from a decline of 2 m 6 ft to a rise of 9 m 29 ft however this increase is at the expense of crop yields which are decreased from 16 238 kg ha 1 corn 4277 kg ha 1 soybean 13 071 kg ha 1 sorghum and 11 892 kg ha 1 winter wheat for the full irrigation scenario to 2705 kg ha 1 corn 1632 kg ha 1 soybean 4405 kg ha 1 sorghum and 1851 kg ha 1 winter wheat for the non irrigation scenario with a decrease of crop yields by 83 62 66 84 for corn soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively therefore management strategies are sought that balance between conserving groundwater and maintaining crop yield for future decades i e that can decrease the gap between the full pumping and no pumping scenarios while also preserving adequate crop yield for the local economy such strategies may include implementing irrigation technology to increase irrigation efficiency optimized irrigation scheduling and crop selection the linked dssat modflow model presented in this paper can assist in assessing the influence of these management strategies the influence of future climate patterns on these impacts can also be estimated using the linked model 4 summary and conclusion this study presents a linked dssat modflow modeling framework and applied it to the ogallala aquifer within finney county kansas a region experiencing significant groundwater depletion due to irrigation practices the linkage between the models occurs on an annual time step with irrigation depths and deep percolation from an ensemble of field scale dssat simulations dssat version 4 7 converted to pumping rates and recharge for the modflow simulation modflow 2000 the modflow simulates groundwater head which can be used to update saturated thickness and thereby well capacities for each pumping well in the model domain well capacities are then used to constrain irrigation application in the dssat simulations during the following growing season python scripts are used to pass information between the two models and prepare input files batch files for dssat are used to run the ensemble of simulations for each year model results are tested against water table elevation and crop yield this paper focuses on the presentation and demonstration of the dssat modflow modeling system whereas future studies can focus on assessing future conditions under changes in climate and management practices the dssat modflow modeling system can be a valuable tool in assessing groundwater conservation strategies in groundwater irrigated regions since it tracks jointly groundwater resources groundwater head saturated thickness pumping conditions well capacity and crop yield therefore any strategy used to conserve groundwater can also be assessed in terms of resulting crop yield to determine feasibility for local economies the model can be used to assess changes in irrigation technology crop selection and climate change in addition in areas where pumping rates are not readily available the dssat portion of the linked model can be used to estimate pumping rates based on dssat s crop growth routines and associated irrigation depths conflict of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national institute of

10704,wheat triticale and common bean are planted in both irrigated and rainfed conditions and may suffer the effects of water stress in both situations the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of water stress on the physical and chemical qualities of wheat triticum aestivum triticale triticosecale wittmack and common bean phaseolus vulgaris l grains the experiment was conducted at the embrapa cerrados experimental station in planaltina df brazil the experimental design was in randomized blocks with four replications the treatments were composed of four water regimes 187 mm 304 mm 410 mm 535 mm applied to common bean brs realce two wheat genotypes cpac 0544 and brs 404 and triticale brs ulisses the physical quality of grains was evaluated by the weight of a thousand grains wtg and color of the grains represented by the luminosity l chroma c and hue angle h the chemical quality was determined by protein carbohydrate lipid ash macro and microminerals contents water stress reduced grain yield of all species however it did not reduce the weight of one thousand grains of the wheat genotype brs 404 showing the potential of this cultivar though it did lead to reduced wtg in common bean triticale and the wheat genotype cpac 0544 there was also a reduction of luminosity l in the grains for both studied wheat genotypes and chroma c and hue angle h for triticale water deficit also affected protein carbohydrate lipid and ash contents with an increase in the protein content and a reduction in the carbohydrate and ash contents in common bean in general water stress reduced macro and micromineral contents in the grains caused an undesirable change in the physical quality of the grains and affected the chemical quality of the grains keywords grain quality phaseolus vulgaris triticum aestivum triticosecale wittmack water availability 1 introduction in the last decades there has been a significant reduction in precipitation and rise in temperature due to climate change with a direct effect on the characteristics and components of yield and grain quality of crops worldwide alexander 2016 among the factors that compromise the production of grains and contribute to low yield we highlight the absence of crops that are tolerant to water deficit and to non uniform precipitation with the occurrence of prolonged dry spells known as veranicos in the cerrado region in the critical phase of crop development lopes and guimarães guilherne 2016 therefore it is necessary to obtain crops that under conditions of low water availability maintain high productive potential without losing their nutritional quality among the species with prominence in the world production scenario are the common bean phaseolus vulgaris l and wheat triticum aestivum l common bean is a legume consumed worldwide as an important source of protein fiber starch and minerals such as nitrogen and potassium castro guerrero et al 2016 and has high potential for reducing malnutrition in poor populations chekanai et al 2018 wheat is the second most cultivated crop in the world with a production area estimated of approximately 200 million hectares zorb et al 2018 wheat consumption accounts for 19 of the calories in the global human diet since the grain is rich in carbohydrates whilst also having a higher protein content than other cereals such as rice maize and rye liu et al 2018 zorb et al 2018 triticale triticosecale wittmack is a man made cereal resulting from the cross between wheat and rye which has been gaining importance in human consumption and as animal feed species and genotypes with tolerance to water deficit can be identified using a combination of parameters including grain yield water use efficiency ratio between productivity and amount of water applied over the crop cycle and productivity components number of grains per square meter number of ears per square meter which can be positively or negatively correlated with crop yield i e bastos et al 2011 fried et al 2019 mahajan et al 2018 meena et al 2019 sousa et al 2018 water stress affects not only grain yield but also the quality of the grains quality in turn is related to both nutritional composition and their functional properties including the flavor color and aroma of the product halford et al 2014 color in particular which is quantified in seeds using chroma hue and luminosity garg et al 2016 represents an important parameter for both consumers and industry and may also reflect underlying alterations in grain composition caused by water deficit clydesdale 1991 deman 1999 jha 2010 the variation in nutritional composition of the grains due to different growing conditions is important information that is required in programs such as those for human nutrition and the food industry in addition there is an increase demand for products with higher protein fiber and mineral contents xiong et al 2017 whilst wheat and common bean are excellent sources of protein and carbohydrates edaphic and environmental factors such as nutrient deficiency soil acidity and drought reduce the productivity and grain quality beebe et al 2014 gooding et al 2003 therefore the determination of protein carbohydrate minerals and other qualitative components in grains grown under different conditions is crucial for the management of nutrition and human health lourenço et al 2010 we hypothesized that reduced water availability in addition to leading to reduced productivity would negatively affect the physical quality of the grains and abundance of mineral elements as well as impacting on the abundance of lipids proteins carbohydrates and ash given their differential susceptibility to water deficit we also anticipated differences in the impact of the water regimes on the different species and genotypes here we aimed to evaluate the effect of different water regimes applied in field conditions on the physical and chemical qualities of common bean triticale and wheat grains 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and conduction of the experiment the experiment was conducted at the embrapa cerrados experimental station in planaltina df brazil latitude 15 35 30 s longitude 47 42 30 w between june and october 2017 the climate of the region according to the köppen classification is of the aw type alvares et al 2013 with dry winters and rainy summers the annual average precipitation is 1400 mm and the annual average temperature is 21 3 c the long term temperature and rainfall data from the last twenty years 1997 2016 are shown in fig 1 and illustrate the annual dry season during the months of may to september temperature and rainfall data from the study period are in good agreement with long term patterns fig 1 the soil is classified as clayey oxisol typic haplustox soil survey staff 1998 red latosol according to the brazilian soil classification santos et al 2013 and has the following characteristics in the 0 20 cm layer ph water 5

replications the treatments were composed of four water regimes wr 187 mm 304 mm 410 mm 535 mm applied to common bean cultivar brs realce triticale brs ulisses and two wheat genotypes cpac 0544 and brs 404 the wheat genotype cpac 0544 is recommended for cultivation under irrigated conditions and the cultivar brs 404 for dry conditions the crops were sown manually in the second week of june of 2017 under a no tillage system the line spacing and the sowing density used were of 0 5 m and 15 seeds m 1 for the common bean 0 20 m between rows and density of 90 seeds m 1 for the triticale and for the two wheat genotypes the fertilization was done in the furrows with a dose of 400 kg ha 1 with the formula 04 30 16 topdressing nitrogen fertilization was carried out 30 days after planting at a dose of 100 kg ha 1 n in the form of urea in order to avoid the competition of invasive plants manual weeding was carried out the different water regimes were obtained using a sprinkler irrigator bar 40 m wide connected to a spool with adjustable speed ten sprinklers were installed on each side of the irrigation bar irrigation was uniform 112 mm during the first 35 days after emergence aed of the seedlings after this period the line source methodology was adapted hanks et al 1976 using sprinklers with decreasing water flows from the central area to the end of the bar the sprinklers were overlapped in order to promote a decreasing gradient of water from the central area to the edge of the bar four plots were established each one was 1 0 m distant from each other and each plot corresponded to a water regime each water regime consisted of an experimental unit of 4 0 m in length formed by 8 lines with line spacing of 0 50 cm for common bean and 0 20 cm for the other crops respectively over the stress treatment 13 irrigations were carried out and the accumulated uniform irrigation plus the variable irrigations gave a total of 187 304 410 535 mm for the four water regimes the irrigations at the highest level were carried out as described in the irrigation monitoring program in the cerrado embrapa 2011 through replacement of evapotranspiration using agrometeorological indicators of the region the soil type and the date of full emergence of plants although our experiment had three different species each with different demands for water we used wheat as a reference crop understanding that common bean and triticale have a similar water consumption to wheat irrigation frequency was carried out approximately every 5 days according to climatic conditions and crop phenological phase to calculate the amount of the applied water depth in each irrigation two rows of parallel collectors to the irrigation line were set up to measure the volume of water applied common bean was manually harvested 88 days after emergence dae as lodging occurred which made mechanical harvesting of this species unfeasible triticale and wheat were harvested at 105 dae with a mechanical harvester grain yield was evaluated through sampling of four central lines of the plot with 1 0 m in length data were transformed to kg ha 1 and grain moisture content was corrected to 13 0 2 2 physical quality of grains after harvest the grains were stored at room temperature for 10 days the physical quality was evaluated by quantifying the weight of a thousand grains wtg and analyzing the color represented by luminosity l chroma c and hue angle h variables all analyzes were carried out at the food analysis laboratory of the university of brasília and at the laboratory of analytical chemistry of the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa cerrados the weight of one thousand grains wtg was determined according to the method described by brasil 1992 from each plot 100 grains were manually counted and then weighed in a semi analytical scale the result was multiplied by 10 the color evaluation of grains was carried out in a colorquest xe spectrophotometer hunterlab reston united states obtaining values of the coordinates l measurable in terms of white to black intensity a measurable in terms of intensity from red to green and b measurable in terms of yellow and blue intensity of the hunter system with the values of the coordinates a and b it was possible to obtain the hue angle h eq 1 and chroma c eq 2 francis 1975 mclellan et al 1995 1 h arctan g b a 2 c a 2 b 2 2 3 chemical composition of grains the moisture content of the grains was determined according to asae 2000 1 g of each sample was weighed and placed in a porcelain crucible the triticale and wheat grains were placed in an oven with forced air circulation at 130 c for 19 h the common bean was kept at 103 c for 72 h after being removed from the oven the grains were placed in a desiccator until reaching room temperature then weighed on a precision analytical scale moisture was used to express the percentage of the other constituents on a dry basis the chemical composition of the grains was evaluated through the macromolecule contents proteins lipids carbohydrates and ash in addition the macro and micromineral contents were determined the determination of protein content of the grains was performed according to aoac 2005 method 991 22 in the calculation of protein content conversion factors equivalent to 6 25 for common bean and 5 60 for triticale and wheat were used the lipid content was determined by the am 5 04 extraction method aocs 2005 using ankom technology s xt15 extractor ankom technology new york united states determination of the ash content was performed by the method 945 45 aoac 2005 by calcination at 600 c for approximately 4 h carbohydrate content was determined by difference subtracting from 100 the values found for protein content lipid content and ash content according to method 986 25 aoac 2005 protein lipid ash and carbohydrate contents were expressed on a dry basis the macrominerals analysed were calcium ca magnesium mg potassium k phosphorus p and sulfur s the microminerals analysed were iron fe manganese mn copper cu zinc zn and boron b for the determination of the macromineral ca mg k p and s and micromineral fe mn cu zn and b contents the grain samples were dried and ground subsequently 20 mg of each sample were weighed digested in perchloric acid solution and hydrated at a 2 1 ratio at 250 c and diluted to 50 ml with high purity deionized water according to ficco et al 2009 the nutrient content was then determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometer icp oes thermo cientific 7000 the elements were analyzed in optical plasma icp oes which has a radiation detection system that allows to determine in a single sample a large number

variance anova and the comparison of means was carried out using the tukey test at 5 probability using statistical software sas version 9 sas sas stat 2001 a pearson correlation analysis was performed between the variables representing chemical and physical grain qualities and productivity individually for each species or cultivar using the software r version 3 4 0 r core team 2018 and the data presented using correlograms 3 results 3 1 grain yield and physical quality grain yield under different water regimes is shown in table 1 yields of up to 5295 kg ha 1 were observed for beans 6343 kg ha 1 for triticale and 3979 and 3360 kg ha 1 for cpac 0544 and brs 404 wheat genotypes however water stress reduced grain yield of all species reductions of 92 14 92 87 92 05 and 89 40 were observed for common bean triticale and wheat genotypes cpac 0544 and brs 404 respectively when comparing the average values obtained in the highest and lowest water regime it is also important to highlight that there was no significant difference p 0 05 in grain yield of cpac 0544 and brs 404 wheat genotypes when comparing 410 and 535 mm water regimes water stress significantly affected the weight of one thousand grains wtg of the common bean triticale and the wheat genotype cpac 0544 and most importantly for the wheat genotype brs 404 there were no significant differences between the water regimes table 1 significant reductions in wtg were observed when comparing the highest and the lowest water regime of 38 2 31 1 and 26 5 in common bean triticale and in wheat genotype cpac 0544 respectively whereas for the wheat genotype brs404 the observed reduction was only 18 3 table 1 regarding the variables related to grain color water stress significantly affected p 0 05 the luminosity l in the two wheat genotypes whereas the chroma c and the hue angle h were only significantly affected in the triticale table 1 the highest values of luminosity were observed for both studied wheat genotypes in the wr 535 mm however in the wheat genotype cpac 0544 luminosity differed between the 304 mm and 187 mm wrs and in the wheat genotype brs 404 luminosity differed between 535 mm and 187 mm wrs table 1 furthermore the lighter the grains the higher the luminosity of the grains meaning that under water stress conditions the grains of both studied wheat genotypes became darker 3 2 chemical composition of grains 3 2 1 protein and carbohydrate content the protein content ranged from 23 51 to 29 60 for common bean grains 13 76 15 77 for triticale 14 04 16 23 for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 and from 15 20 to 16 91 for the wheat genotype brs 404 table 2 the reduction in water availability had a significant impact for the common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 whilst there were no significant differences in the protein content of the grains for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 specifically there was an increase in protein content in the common bean in the most severe water regime 187 mm whereas for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 the highest protein contents were observed in the intermediate water regimes 304 and 410 mm the carbohydrate content represented the largest fraction of the grains in the four studied cultures table 2 the reduction in water availability had a significant effect on the common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 whilst there were no significant differences for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 table 2 the opposite pattern occurred for carbohydrate content when compared to the protein content results as there was a decrease in carbohydrate content as water regime decreased for the common bean and for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 in the intermediate wr 304 mm and 410 mm had the lowest carbohydrate content 3 2 2 lipid content and ash content the results for lipid content showed no significant differences for common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 and significant differences were observed for triticale and wheat genotype brs404 under the different wrs for triticale the reduction in water availability from 410 mm to 187 mm decreased the lipid content in the grains of this culture by 43 and the increase in wr from 410 mm to 535 mm decreased lipid contents by 38 and the intermediate wr presented the highest lipid content 3 26 for the wr of 304 mm and 3 36 for the 410 mm wr for the brs 404 wheat cultivar water stress promoted an increase in lipid content in which the highest values were observed in the two lower wrs 3 03 for the 187 mm wr and 3 46 for the 304 mm wr the water regimes significantly influenced the ash content only in the common bean grains table 2 the highest ash content 3 56 was observed for the greatest water regime 535 mm and the reduction of water availability from 535 mm to 187 mm decreased the ash content by up to 24 15 table 2 3 2 3 macro and micromineral contents the results of the effects of the different water regimes on the macro and micromineral contents on the grains are shown in tables 3 and 4 the common bean in general presents the highest values of all five macronutrients analyzed in this study p ca mg k and s compared to the other studied cultivars indicating a rich content cultivar in addition for micronutrients common bean together with wheat genotype brs404 showed the highest values for b cu fe but showed very low values for mn compared to the other studied cultivars and zn was the only micronutrients that presented similar values for all cultivars in general a reduction of macronutrients and micronutrients in grain contents was observed as the plants were submitted to the lower water regimes and below we will describe for each studied cultivar the impact of the different water regimes on the macronutrients and micronutrients for the common bean crop the wr did not significantly affect the macronutrients table 3 but significantly reduced the concentrations of the micronutrients except mn table 4 the concentrations were reduced from 54 80 to 10 84 mg kg 1 for b 5 47 to 3 04 mg kg 1 for cu 86 49 to 48 39 mg kg 1 for fe and 33 69 to 29 25 mg kg 1for zn in conclusion these reductions correspond to 80 2 44 4 44 1 and 13 17 for b cu fe and zn respectively in triticale the wr influenced significantly the contents of the macronutrients p ca mg table 3 and the micronutrients mn and zn table 4 a reduction in macronutrients was observed as the plants were submitted to lower water regimes 2 76 to 2 00 to g kg 1 for p 0 30 to 0 22 g kg 1 for ca and 1 04 to 0 54 g kg 1 for mg in the micronutrients analysis water stress increased mn from 16 74 to 22 37 mg kg 1 and reduced zn from 41 97 to 26 42 mg kg 1 in the wheat genotype cpac 0544 water regime did not affect most of micro and macronutrients the decrease in the water regime only reduced two of the macronutrients analyzed p and s table 3 and among micronutrients only the zn contents significantly decreased in the lower water regime wr 187 mm table 4 in the wheat genotype brs 404 the wr significantly influenced p 0 05 most of the macronutrients analyzed contents of p mg k and s table 3 for the micronutrients only zn was significantly influenced p 0 05 table 4 the contents of p mg k s and zn were reduced as water regime was reduced from 3 30 to 2 43 g kg 1 1 13 to 0 85 g kg 1 2 45 to 2 29 g kg 1 1 49 to 1 26 g kg 1 and 42 81 to 25 74 mg kg 1 respectively it is noteworthy that the contents of the micromineral b were below the level of detection in the triticale and wheat genotypes brs 404 and cpac 0544 in all wrs studied 3 2 4 pearson correlation the pearson correlations for the variables representing physical and chemical quality and grain yield are presented in the correlograms in fig 2 wheat brs 404 fig 2a wheat cpac 0544 fig 2b common bean fig 2c and triticale fig 2d for wheat brs 404 the greatest correlation occurred between ca and mg 0 89 p 0 01 followed by p and zn 0 83 p 0 01 zn and cu 0 82 p 0 01 s and zn 0 77 p 0 01 s and p 0 73 p 0 01 s and hue angle 0 72 p 0 01 and grain yield and cu 0 7 p 0 01 the concentration of protein was negatively correlated with almost all variables with the exceptions of s zn fe and mn in general lipids and ash were negatively correlated with almost all other variables whilst carbohydrates showed the opposite trend for wheat cpac 0544 fig 2b the greatest correlation was also between ca and mg 0 96 p 0 01 whilst other significant positive correlations greater than 0 7 were between p and mg 0 92 p 0 01 p and ca 0 91 p 0 01 p and k 0 85 p 0 01 p and zn 0 84 p 0 01 and between grain yield and thousand grain weight 0 86 p 0 01 as for brs 404 fig 2a we observed a strong negative correlation between carbohydrates and proteins 0 93 p 0 01 again protein concentration was negatively correlated with almost all studied variables a different pattern for common bean fig 2c was observed when compared to wheat brs 404 and cpac 0544 in this case carbohydrates lipids and ash were negatively correlated with almost all the other variables protein concentration was positively correlated with almost all other variables except carbohydrates 0 98 p 0 01 lipids 0 26 not significant and ash 0 39 not significant the greatest correlation was between grain yield and thousand grain weight 0 95 p 0 01 triticale presented similar correlations to those detected for wheat fig 2d the greatest correlation was between ca and mg 0 97 p 0 01 and protein concentration was again negatively correlated with most other variables significant positive correlations greater than 0 7 were observed between zn and mg 0 86 p 0 01 p and zn 0 85 p 0 01 and grain yield and thousand grain weight 0 8 p 0 01 whilst strong negative correlations were observed between protein and carbohydrates 0 92 p 0 01 thousand grain weight and mn 0 88 p 0 01 and grain yield and mn 0 76 p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield and physical quality under extreme stress conditions plants will anticipate their cycle enter into early senescence reduce the photosynthetic period and consequently prevent the complete filling of the grains resulting in a negative effect on productivity and grain weight muchero et al 2013 chen et al 2015 chacon et al 2017 in the present study we observed that water stress significantly reduced grain yield with around 90 decreases for all species under the lowest water regime a reduction of 535 mm to 410 mm also significantly reduced productivity in common bean and triticale but not in either of the wheat genotypes suggesting greater tolerance to lower water availability for this cultivar water stress also significantly affected grain weight in common bean triticale and wheat genotype cpac 0544 table 1 with common bean having the greater reduction of 38 2 i e 30 for common bean chacon et al 2017 our results agree with similar experiments also carried out under cerrado conditions where quinoa amaranth and millet had grain yield and or biomass affected by different water regimes jayme oliveira et al 2017 however and most importantly grain weight of one of our study cultivars the wheat genotype brs 404 was not affected this genotype has undergone a breeding process for cultivation under dry conditions and our results support use of this genotype for cultivation under conditions of reduced water availability for many crops color of grains good genetic stability excellent stress resistance and high yield are required in general there are four main factors that cause different segregation ratios of grain colors 1 gene dose effect 2 gene interaction 3 genetic background and 4 grain development and environmental conditions guo et al 2012 today consistency of grain quality during drought periods is a major challenge for cultivar development due to the prospects of climatic changes and the demands of the population growth ignjatovic micic et al 2015 to our knowledge this is the first work that evaluates the effect of water stress on the color change of crop grains of economic importance it is important to note that our results showed no differences in color of the grains reduction in chroma and h hue angle in both studied wheat genotypes and common bean however there was a significant reduction in triticale the triticale grains were greyish as indicated by the low values of c and reddish as indicated by the reduction in h values in the low wr i e jacomino et al 2003 furthermore we recommend future studies to evaluate if changes in grain color due to water stress will affect the quality of processed products 4 2 chemical composition of grains 4 2 1 protein and carbohydrate content protein contained in grains is one of the most important nutrients for human health as a key component of cells fluids and body tissues leser 2013 although the protein content in legumes is a genetic characteristic environmental factors such as water stress can increase bayat et al 2010 or decrease their contents khamssi 2011 due to reduced n partitioning and fixation singh 2007 under water stress conditions carbon fixation decreases by the partial closure of the stomata whereas the remobilization of the nitrogen from the leaves to the grains does not decrease leading to decreased grain weight but increasing the protein percentage souza et al 2004 however this dilution effect is dependent on the studied cultivar i e ghanbari et al 2014 our results showed that water stress that led to large decreases in yield also promoted a considerable increase in the protein content in the common bean grains in low wr 23 51 29 60 table 2 and also in wheat genotype cpac 0544 in intermediate wr 14 04 16 23 table 2 whilst different wr did not result in significant differences in the protein content of the grains for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 table 2 in the literature differences among genotypes are observed for example a study by noorka et al 2009 when evaluating ten wheat genotypes observed that the reduction of water availability in wheat increased the protein content in the grains ranging from 12 47 to 13 92 depending on the genotype though unfortunately neither of the wheat genotypes we studied here were analyzed in addition the pinto bean had the highest grain protein content 23 21 under water stress conditions and the lowest content 21 87 in the control treatment ardakani et al 2013 carbohydrates are important nutrients for the human body representing the main source of energy for maintenance therefore it is important to maintain the nutritional value of the grain independent of the biotic or abiotic stress the plant went through during its life cycle one of the main causes of reduced productivity due to drought is the lower grain starch content which is the main form of carbohydrate storage in cereals thitisaksakul et al 2012 as water availability is required for photosynthesis decreased carbohydrate is often found during water stress flagella et al 2010 in part because water deficiency also stimulates the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves which in turn reduces carbon assimilation gao et al 2016 the increase in protein content in the grains under water stress conditions is associated with a decrease in the starch content of the grains due to a decrease in starch synthesis jalilian et al 2005 mohammadzadeh et al 2011 our study showed that carbohydrate content in the evaluated cultures presented different results in relation to the water regime and varied inversely to the protein content in addition correlation analyses revealed a strong negative relationship between carbohydrates and proteins in all four cultivars fig 2 similar to that observed in wheat genotypes subjected to heat stress where a reduction in carbohydrate and increase in protein was also observed gare et al 2018 in common bean water stress caused an increase in protein content see above and a reduction in carbohydrate content under the lowest wr table 2 in wheat genotype cpac 0544 both stress 187 mm and excess water 535 mm increased the carbohydrate concentration whilst a significant decrease in carbohydrate content occurred in the intermediate wr 304 and 410 mm the opposite to that observed for protein content see above table 2 in triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 neither the carbohydrates nor the protein fraction varied with different wr 4 2 2 lipid content and ash content water deficit causes metabolic changes in plants such as stimulation of lipolytic and peroxidative activities as well as inhibition of lipid biosynthesis which is associated with a lower content of membrane lipids labusch et al 2013 for some plant families such as brassicaceae the occurrence of drought during the maturation period affects the accumulation of oil in the seeds martínez ballesta et al 2013 drought also reduces the accumulation of lipids in peas chaiyadee et al 2013 sunflower esmaeilian et al 2012 maize ali et al 2013 lupine carvalho et al 2004 and in wheat zhao et al 2009 noorka et al 2012 however these changes are strictly dependent on the crop species and the genotypes wang and frei 2011 our results showed no significant differences for lipid content in common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 whilst significant differences were observed for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 under different wr in contrast to the literature our results indicate an increase in lipid content in decreasing water regime from 535 mm to 304 mm amongst the chemical components analyzed in this study ash content was less influenced by water regimes and only in common bean grains were significant differences observed according to the brazilian table of food composition nepa unicamp 2011 the average ash content of raw common bean is 3 71 g 100 g 1 we observed that only under the higher water regimes the values were close to this reference the increase of the inorganic residue in conditions of greater water availability can occur due to the increase of the translocation of mineral nutrients of the roots to the grains in contrast when there is low water availability in the soil all ions become less mobile due to the replacement of water by air in the pore spaces between the soil particles increasing the tortuosity and the retention of ions by the colloids of the soil and reducing root absorption ferreira et al 2008 4 2 3 macro and micromineral contents minerals required in the human diet are divided into macro and microminerals gharibzahedi and jafari 2017 macro and microminerals are inorganic elements widely distributed in nature and are essential for proper growth and development of the organism paiva et al 2017 mineral deficiencies in diets can impair physical development and contribute to the onset of infections hussain et al 2010 vegetable sources such as grains can provide sufficient amounts of minerals in diets though importantly grains produced under unfavorable conditions such as low levels of nutrients in the soil or other environmental stresses such as low water availability may contain lower levels of these elements our results indicate in general a reduction in macronutrients and micronutrients in grains under low wr which is most likely due to decreased nutrient uptake from the soil bista et al 2018 tadayyon et al 2018 waraich et al 2011 reduced water availability may decrease nutrient uptake by the roots through several mechanisms firstly supply of the nutrient in the soil may be reduced by mineralization bista et al 2018 sanaullah et al 2012 secondly mass flow and diffusion of nutrients in the soil may be decreased under these conditions bista et al 2018 finally uptake kinetics of the roots may be directly affected bista et al 2018 bassirirad 2000 whilst remobilization of certain elements from leaves can occur during nutrient deficiency k s p mg cu mo fe and zn other elements cannot be readily remobilized and transported to the grains ca mn ni and b the macrominerals that were significantly affected were ca mg and p for triticale mg k p and s for the wheat genotype brs 404 p and s for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 drought did not affect the macrominerals in common bean and this crop presented the highest values of macrominerals analyzed in this study p ca mg k and s compared to the other studied cultivars indicating a rich content cultivar on the other hand four macrominerals ca p mg and k that were reduced by drought in three of the study cultivars are important for nerve and muscle function and inadequate concentrations can cause a cow to lose the ability to rise to her feet causing downer cow syndrome goff 2004 the microminerals that were significantly affected were b cu fe and zn for common bean mn and zn for triticale and zn for both studied wheat genotypes table 4 zn and fe are two minerals that are strongly influenced by the environmental conditions of plant cultivation and are the most deficient in the human diet paiva et al 2017 beleggia et al 2018 fe is a micronutrient necessary for the human body because it is an important component of hemoglobin of many enzymes and of the immune system tian et al 2018 and zn plays an important role in the structure of many enzymes gharibzahedi and jafari 2017 both zn and fe were affected by drought in common bean and zn was affected in all studied cultivars these nutrients are typically the most absent from the human diet and therefore the cultivation of these crops in conditions of water stress will tend to aggravate the situation furthermore increased concentrations of mn in brs 404 cpac0544 and triticale were associated with decreases in almost all other variables whilst positive correlations were observed in the case of common bean whilst mn is an essential micronutrient high concentrations may result in toxicity and reduced concentrations of n p and k in wheat have previously been reported in response to increased mn application rengel 2015 dinkpa et al 2018 potentially explaining negative correlations between concentration of this element and other variables future studies with the purpose of evaluating the effect of water stress on other qualitative variables of the grains such as hardness and cooking time and in the case of common bean a sensorial analysis of processed products are fundamental to complement the information obtained in the present work 5 conclusion in general water stress conditions negatively affected the yield physical quality chemical composition and nutritional quality of the grains but to differing degrees in the species and genotypes studied however wheat genotype brs 404 stood out as the physical qualities of the grain were unaffected by stress conditions common bean also appears well suited for planting under conditions of low water availability as despite a reduction in grain weight macromineral concentrations were maintained and protein concentration increased overall the study highlights the potential impact of reduced water availability on characteristics that are important to both producers and consumers but also indicates species and genotypes that are minimally affected by these conditions funding this research did not receive any

10704,wheat triticale and common bean are planted in both irrigated and rainfed conditions and may suffer the effects of water stress in both situations the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of water stress on the physical and chemical qualities of wheat triticum aestivum triticale triticosecale wittmack and common bean phaseolus vulgaris l grains the experiment was conducted at the embrapa cerrados experimental station in planaltina df brazil the experimental design was in randomized blocks with four replications the treatments were composed of four water regimes 187 mm 304 mm 410 mm 535 mm applied to common bean brs realce two wheat genotypes cpac 0544 and brs 404 and triticale brs ulisses the physical quality of grains was evaluated by the weight of a thousand grains wtg and color of the grains represented by the luminosity l chroma c and hue angle h the chemical quality was determined by protein carbohydrate lipid ash macro and microminerals contents water stress reduced grain yield of all species however it did not reduce the weight of one thousand grains of the wheat genotype brs 404 showing the potential of this cultivar though it did lead to reduced wtg in common bean triticale and the wheat genotype cpac 0544 there was also a reduction of luminosity l in the grains for both studied wheat genotypes and chroma c and hue angle h for triticale water deficit also affected protein carbohydrate lipid and ash contents with an increase in the protein content and a reduction in the carbohydrate and ash contents in common bean in general water stress reduced macro and micromineral contents in the grains caused an undesirable change in the physical quality of the grains and affected the chemical quality of the grains keywords grain quality phaseolus vulgaris triticum aestivum triticosecale wittmack water availability 1 introduction in the last decades there has been a significant reduction in precipitation and rise in temperature due to climate change with a direct effect on the characteristics and components of yield and grain quality of crops worldwide alexander 2016 among the factors that compromise the production of grains and contribute to low yield we highlight the absence of crops that are tolerant to water deficit and to non uniform precipitation with the occurrence of prolonged dry spells known as veranicos in the cerrado region in the critical phase of crop development lopes and guimarães guilherne 2016 therefore it is necessary to obtain crops that under conditions of low water availability maintain high productive potential without losing their nutritional quality among the species with prominence in the world production scenario are the common bean phaseolus vulgaris l and wheat triticum aestivum l common bean is a legume consumed worldwide as an important source of protein fiber starch and minerals such as nitrogen and potassium castro guerrero et al 2016 and has high potential for reducing malnutrition in poor populations chekanai et al 2018 wheat is the second most cultivated crop in the world with a production area estimated of approximately 200 million hectares zorb et al 2018 wheat consumption accounts for 19 of the calories in the global human diet since the grain is rich in carbohydrates whilst also having a higher protein content than other cereals such as rice maize and rye liu et al 2018 zorb et al 2018 triticale triticosecale wittmack is a man made cereal resulting from the cross between wheat and rye which has been gaining importance in human consumption and as animal feed species and genotypes with tolerance to water deficit can be identified using a combination of parameters including grain yield water use efficiency ratio between productivity and amount of water applied over the crop cycle and productivity components number of grains per square meter number of ears per square meter which can be positively or negatively correlated with crop yield i e bastos et al 2011 fried et al 2019 mahajan et al 2018 meena et al 2019 sousa et al 2018 water stress affects not only grain yield but also the quality of the grains quality in turn is related to both nutritional composition and their functional properties including the flavor color and aroma of the product halford et al 2014 color in particular which is quantified in seeds using chroma hue and luminosity garg et al 2016 represents an important parameter for both consumers and industry and may also reflect underlying alterations in grain composition caused by water deficit clydesdale 1991 deman 1999 jha 2010 the variation in nutritional composition of the grains due to different growing conditions is important information that is required in programs such as those for human nutrition and the food industry in addition there is an increase demand for products with higher protein fiber and mineral contents xiong et al 2017 whilst wheat and common bean are excellent sources of protein and carbohydrates edaphic and environmental factors such as nutrient deficiency soil acidity and drought reduce the productivity and grain quality beebe et al 2014 gooding et al 2003 therefore the determination of protein carbohydrate minerals and other qualitative components in grains grown under different conditions is crucial for the management of nutrition and human health lourenço et al 2010 we hypothesized that reduced water availability in addition to leading to reduced productivity would negatively affect the physical quality of the grains and abundance of mineral elements as well as impacting on the abundance of lipids proteins carbohydrates and ash given their differential susceptibility to water deficit we also anticipated differences in the impact of the water regimes on the different species and genotypes here we aimed to evaluate the effect of different water regimes applied in field conditions on the physical and chemical qualities of common bean triticale and wheat grains 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and conduction of the experiment the experiment was conducted at the embrapa cerrados experimental station in planaltina df brazil latitude

replications the treatments were composed of four water regimes wr 187 mm 304 mm 410 mm 535 mm applied to common bean cultivar brs realce triticale brs ulisses and two wheat genotypes cpac 0544 and brs 404 the wheat genotype cpac 0544 is recommended for cultivation under irrigated conditions and the cultivar brs 404 for dry conditions the crops were sown manually in the second week of june of 2017 under a no tillage system the line spacing and the sowing density used were of 0 5 m and 15 seeds m 1 for the common bean 0 20 m between rows and density of 90 seeds m 1 for the triticale and for the two wheat genotypes the fertilization was done in the furrows with a dose of 400 kg ha 1 with the formula 04 30 16 topdressing nitrogen fertilization was carried out 30 days after planting at a dose of 100 kg ha 1 n in the form of urea in order to avoid the competition of invasive plants manual weeding was carried out the different water regimes were obtained using a sprinkler irrigator bar 40 m wide connected to a spool with adjustable speed ten sprinklers were installed on each side of the irrigation bar irrigation was uniform 112 mm during the first 35 days after emergence aed of the seedlings after this period the line source methodology was adapted hanks et al 1976 using sprinklers with decreasing water flows from the central area to the end of the bar the sprinklers were overlapped in order to promote a decreasing gradient of water from the central area to the edge of the bar four plots were established each one was 1 0 m distant from each other and each plot corresponded to a water regime each water regime consisted of an experimental unit of 4 0 m in length formed by 8 lines with line spacing of 0 50 cm for common bean and 0 20 cm for the other crops respectively over the stress treatment 13 irrigations were carried out and the accumulated uniform irrigation plus the variable irrigations gave a total of 187 304 410 535 mm for the four water regimes the irrigations at the highest level were carried out as described in the irrigation monitoring program in the cerrado embrapa 2011 through replacement of evapotranspiration using agrometeorological indicators of the region the soil type and the date of full emergence of plants although our experiment had three different species each with different demands for water we used wheat as a reference crop understanding that common bean and triticale have a similar water consumption to wheat irrigation frequency was carried out approximately every 5 days according to climatic conditions and crop phenological phase to calculate the amount of the applied water depth in each irrigation two rows of parallel collectors to the irrigation line were set up to measure the volume of water applied common bean was manually harvested 88 days after emergence dae as lodging occurred which made mechanical harvesting of this species unfeasible triticale and wheat were harvested at 105 dae with a mechanical harvester grain yield was evaluated through sampling of four central lines of the plot with 1 0 m in length data were transformed to kg ha 1 and grain moisture content was corrected to 13 0 2 2 physical quality of grains after harvest the grains were stored at room temperature for 10 days the physical quality was evaluated by quantifying the weight of a thousand grains wtg and analyzing the color represented by luminosity l chroma c and hue angle h variables all analyzes were carried out at the food analysis laboratory of the university of brasília and at the laboratory of analytical chemistry of the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa cerrados the weight of one thousand grains wtg was determined according to the method described by brasil 1992 from each plot 100 grains were manually counted and then weighed in a semi analytical scale the result was multiplied by 10 the color evaluation of grains was carried out in a colorquest xe spectrophotometer hunterlab reston united states obtaining values of the coordinates l measurable in terms of white to black intensity a measurable in terms of intensity from red to green and b

et al 1995 1 h arctan g b a 2 c a 2 b 2 2 3 chemical composition of grains the moisture content of the grains was determined according to asae 2000 1 g of each sample was weighed and placed in a porcelain crucible the triticale and wheat grains were placed in an oven with forced air circulation at 130 c for 19 h the common bean was kept at 103 c for 72 h after being removed from the oven the grains were placed in a desiccator until reaching room temperature then weighed on a precision analytical scale moisture was used to express the percentage of the other constituents on a dry basis the chemical composition of the grains was evaluated through the macromolecule contents proteins lipids carbohydrates and ash in addition the macro and micromineral contents were determined the determination of protein content of the grains was performed according to aoac 2005 method 991 22 in the calculation of protein content conversion factors equivalent to 6 25 for common bean and 5 60 for triticale and wheat were used the lipid content was determined by the am 5 04 extraction method aocs 2005 using ankom technology s xt15 extractor ankom technology new york united states determination of the ash content was performed by the method 945 45 aoac 2005 by calcination at 600 c for approximately 4 h carbohydrate content was determined by difference subtracting from 100 the

between the variables representing chemical and physical grain qualities and productivity individually for each species or cultivar using the software r version 3 4 0 r core team 2018 and the data presented using correlograms 3 results 3 1 grain yield and physical quality grain yield under different water regimes is shown in table 1 yields of up to 5295 kg ha 1 were observed for beans 6343 kg ha 1 for triticale and 3979 and 3360 kg ha 1 for cpac 0544 and brs 404 wheat genotypes however water stress reduced grain yield of all species reductions of 92 14 92 87 92 05 and 89 40 were observed for common bean triticale and wheat genotypes cpac 0544 and brs 404 respectively when comparing the average values obtained in the highest and lowest water regime it is also important to highlight that there was no significant difference p 0 05 in grain yield of cpac 0544 and brs 404 wheat genotypes when comparing 410 and 535 mm water regimes water stress significantly affected the weight of one thousand grains wtg of the common bean triticale and the wheat genotype cpac 0544 and most importantly for the wheat genotype brs 404 there were no significant differences between the water regimes table 1 significant reductions in wtg were observed when comparing the highest and the lowest water regime of 38 2 31 1 and 26 5 in common bean triticale and in wheat genotype cpac 0544 respectively whereas for the wheat genotype brs404 the observed reduction was only 18 3 table 1 regarding the variables related to grain color water stress significantly affected p 0 05 the luminosity l in the two wheat genotypes whereas the chroma c and the hue angle h were only significantly affected in the triticale table 1 the highest values of luminosity were observed for both studied wheat genotypes in the wr 535 mm however in the wheat genotype cpac 0544 luminosity differed between the 304 mm and 187 mm wrs and in the wheat genotype brs 404 luminosity differed between 535 mm and 187 mm wrs table 1 furthermore the lighter the grains the higher the luminosity of the grains meaning that under water stress conditions the grains of both studied wheat genotypes became darker 3 2 chemical composition of grains 3 2 1 protein and carbohydrate content the protein content ranged from 23 51 to 29 60 for common bean grains 13 76 15 77 for triticale 14 04 16 23 for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 and from 15 20 to 16 91 for the wheat genotype brs 404 table 2 the reduction in water availability had a significant impact for the common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 whilst there were no significant differences in the protein content of the grains for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 specifically there was an increase in protein content in the common bean in the most severe water regime 187 mm whereas for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 the highest protein contents were observed in the intermediate water regimes 304 and 410 mm the carbohydrate content represented the largest fraction of the grains in the four studied cultures table 2 the reduction in water availability had a significant effect on the common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 whilst there were no significant differences for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 table 2 the opposite pattern occurred for carbohydrate content when compared to the protein content results as there was a decrease in carbohydrate content as water regime decreased for the common bean and for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 in the intermediate wr 304 mm and 410 mm had the lowest carbohydrate content 3 2 2 lipid content and ash content the results for lipid content showed no significant differences for common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 and significant differences were observed for triticale and wheat genotype brs404 under the different wrs for triticale the reduction in water availability from 410 mm to 187 mm decreased the lipid content in the grains of this culture by 43 and the increase in wr from 410 mm to 535 mm decreased lipid contents by 38 and the intermediate wr presented the highest lipid content 3 26 for the wr of 304 mm and 3 36 for the 410 mm wr for the brs 404 wheat cultivar water stress promoted an increase in lipid content in which the highest values were observed in the two lower wrs 3 03 for the 187 mm wr and 3 46 for the 304 mm wr the water regimes significantly influenced the ash content only in the common bean grains table 2 the highest ash content 3 56 was observed for the greatest water regime 535 mm and the reduction of water availability from 535 mm to 187 mm decreased the ash content by up to 24 15 table 2 3 2 3 macro and micromineral contents the results of the effects of the different water regimes on the macro and micromineral contents on the grains are shown in tables 3 and 4 the common bean in general presents the highest values of all five macronutrients analyzed in this study p ca mg k and s compared to the other studied cultivars indicating a rich content cultivar in addition for micronutrients common bean together with wheat genotype brs404 showed the highest values for b cu fe but showed very low values for mn compared to the other studied cultivars and zn was the only micronutrients that presented similar values for all cultivars in general a reduction of macronutrients and micronutrients in grain contents was observed as the plants were submitted to the lower water regimes and below we will describe for each studied cultivar the impact of the different water regimes on the macronutrients and micronutrients for the common bean crop the wr did not significantly affect the macronutrients table 3 but significantly reduced the concentrations of the micronutrients except mn table 4 the concentrations were reduced from 54 80 to 10 84 mg kg 1 for b 5 47 to 3 04 mg kg 1 for cu 86 49 to 48 39 mg kg 1 for fe and 33 69 to 29 25 mg kg 1for zn in conclusion these reductions correspond to 80 2 44 4 44 1 and 13 17 for b cu fe and zn respectively in triticale the wr influenced significantly the contents of the macronutrients p ca mg table 3 and the micronutrients mn and zn table 4 a reduction in macronutrients was observed as the plants were submitted to lower water regimes 2 76 to 2 00 to g kg 1 for p 0 30 to 0 22 g kg 1 for ca and 1 04 to 0 54 g kg 1 for mg in the micronutrients analysis water stress increased mn from 16 74 to 22 37 mg kg 1 and reduced zn from 41 97 to 26 42 mg kg 1 in the wheat genotype cpac 0544 water regime did not affect most of micro and macronutrients the decrease in the water regime only reduced two of the macronutrients analyzed p and s table 3 and among micronutrients only the zn contents significantly decreased in the lower water regime wr 187 mm table 4 in the wheat genotype brs 404 the wr significantly influenced p 0 05 most of the macronutrients analyzed contents of p mg k and s table 3 for the micronutrients only zn was significantly influenced p 0 05 table 4 the contents of p mg k s and zn were reduced as water regime was reduced from 3 30 to 2 43 g kg 1 1 13 to 0 85 g kg 1 2 45 to 2 29 g kg 1 1 49 to 1 26 g kg 1 and 42 81 to 25 74 mg kg 1 respectively it is noteworthy that the contents of the micromineral b were below the level of detection in the triticale and wheat genotypes brs 404 and cpac 0544 in all wrs studied 3 2 4 pearson correlation the pearson correlations for the variables representing physical and chemical quality and grain yield are presented in the correlograms in fig 2 wheat brs 404 fig 2a wheat cpac 0544 fig 2b common bean fig 2c and

hue angle 0 72 p 0 01 and grain yield and cu 0 7 p 0 01 the concentration of protein was negatively correlated with almost all variables with the exceptions of s zn fe and mn in general lipids and ash were negatively correlated with almost all other variables whilst carbohydrates showed the opposite trend for wheat cpac 0544 fig 2b the greatest correlation was also between ca and mg 0 96 p 0 01 whilst other significant positive correlations greater than 0 7 were between p and mg 0 92 p 0 01 p and ca 0 91 p 0 01 p and k 0 85 p 0 01 p and zn 0 84 p 0 01 and between grain yield and thousand grain weight 0 86 p 0 01 as for brs 404 fig 2a we observed a strong negative correlation between carbohydrates and proteins 0 93 p 0 01 again protein concentration was negatively correlated with almost all studied variables a different pattern for common bean fig 2c was observed when compared to wheat brs 404 and cpac 0544 in this case carbohydrates lipids and ash were negatively correlated

significant the greatest correlation was between grain yield and thousand grain weight 0 95 p 0 01 triticale presented similar correlations to those detected for wheat fig 2d the greatest correlation was between ca and mg 0 97 p 0 01 and protein concentration was again negatively correlated with most other variables significant positive correlations greater than 0 7 were observed between zn and mg 0 86 p 0 01 p and zn 0 85 p 0 01 and grain yield and thousand grain weight 0 8 p 0 01 whilst strong negative correlations were observed between protein and carbohydrates 0 92 p 0 01 thousand grain

senescence reduce the photosynthetic period and consequently prevent the complete filling of the grains resulting in a negative effect on productivity and grain weight muchero et al 2013 chen et al 2015 chacon et al 2017 in the present study we observed that water stress significantly reduced grain yield with around 90 decreases for all species under the lowest water regime a reduction of 535 mm to 410 mm also significantly reduced productivity in common bean and triticale but not in either of the wheat genotypes suggesting greater tolerance to lower water availability for this cultivar water stress also significantly affected grain weight in common bean triticale and wheat genotype cpac 0544 table 1 with common bean having the greater reduction of 38 2 i e 30 for common bean chacon et al 2017 our results agree with similar experiments also carried out under cerrado conditions where quinoa amaranth and millet had grain yield and or biomass affected by different water regimes jayme oliveira et al 2017 however and most importantly grain weight of one of our study cultivars the wheat genotype brs 404 was not affected this genotype has undergone a breeding process for cultivation under dry conditions and our results support use of this genotype for cultivation under conditions of reduced water availability for many crops color of grains good genetic stability excellent stress resistance and high yield are required in general there are four main factors that cause different segregation ratios of grain colors 1 gene dose effect 2 gene interaction 3 genetic background and 4 grain development and environmental conditions guo et al 2012 today consistency of grain quality during drought periods is a major challenge for cultivar development due to the prospects of climatic changes and the demands of the population growth ignjatovic micic et al 2015 to our knowledge this is the first work that evaluates the effect of water stress on the color change of crop grains of economic importance it is important to note that our results showed no differences in color of the grains reduction in chroma and h hue angle in both studied wheat genotypes and common bean however there was a significant reduction in triticale the triticale grains were greyish as indicated by the low values of c and reddish as indicated by the reduction in h values in the low wr i e jacomino et al 2003 furthermore we recommend future studies to evaluate if changes in grain color due to water stress will affect the quality of processed products 4 2 chemical composition of grains 4 2 1 protein and carbohydrate content protein contained in grains is one of the most important nutrients for human health as a key component of cells fluids and body tissues leser 2013 although the protein content in legumes is a genetic characteristic environmental factors such as water stress can increase bayat et al 2010 or decrease their contents khamssi 2011 due to reduced n partitioning and fixation singh 2007 under water stress conditions carbon fixation decreases by the partial closure of the stomata whereas the remobilization of the nitrogen from the leaves to the grains does not decrease leading to decreased grain weight but increasing the protein percentage souza et al 2004 however this dilution effect is dependent on the studied cultivar i e ghanbari et al 2014 our results showed that water stress that led to large decreases in yield also promoted a considerable increase in the protein content in the common bean grains in low wr 23 51 29 60 table 2 and also in wheat genotype cpac 0544 in intermediate wr 14 04 16 23 table 2 whilst different wr did not result in significant differences in the protein content of the grains for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 table 2 in the literature differences among genotypes are observed for example a study by noorka et al 2009 when evaluating ten wheat genotypes observed that the reduction of water availability in wheat increased the protein content in the grains ranging from 12 47 to 13 92 depending on the genotype though unfortunately neither of the wheat genotypes we studied here were analyzed in addition the pinto bean had the highest grain protein content 23 21 under water stress conditions and the lowest content 21 87 in the control treatment ardakani et al 2013 carbohydrates are important nutrients for the human body representing the main source of energy for maintenance therefore it is important to maintain the nutritional value of the grain independent of the biotic or abiotic stress the plant went through during its life cycle one of the main causes of reduced productivity due to drought is the lower grain starch content which is the main form of carbohydrate storage in cereals thitisaksakul et al 2012 as water availability is required for photosynthesis decreased carbohydrate is often found during water stress flagella et al 2010 in part because water deficiency also stimulates the degradation of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves which in turn reduces carbon assimilation gao et al 2016 the increase in protein content in the grains under water stress conditions is associated with a decrease in the starch content of the grains due to a decrease in starch synthesis jalilian et al 2005 mohammadzadeh et al 2011 our study showed that carbohydrate content in the evaluated cultures presented different results in relation to the water regime and varied inversely to the protein content in addition correlation analyses revealed a strong negative relationship between carbohydrates and proteins in all four cultivars fig 2 similar to that observed in wheat genotypes subjected to heat stress where a reduction in carbohydrate and increase in protein was also observed gare et al 2018 in common bean water stress caused an increase in protein content see above and a reduction in carbohydrate content under the lowest wr table 2 in wheat genotype cpac 0544 both stress 187 mm and excess water 535 mm increased the carbohydrate concentration whilst a significant decrease in carbohydrate content occurred in the intermediate wr 304 and 410 mm the opposite to that observed for protein content see above table 2 in triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 neither the carbohydrates nor the protein fraction varied with different wr 4 2 2 lipid content and ash content water deficit causes metabolic changes in plants such as stimulation of lipolytic and peroxidative activities as well as inhibition of lipid biosynthesis which is associated with a lower content of membrane lipids labusch et al 2013 for some plant families such as brassicaceae the occurrence of drought during the maturation period affects the accumulation of oil in the seeds martínez ballesta et al 2013 drought also reduces the accumulation of lipids in peas chaiyadee et al 2013 sunflower esmaeilian et al 2012 maize ali et al 2013 lupine carvalho et al 2004 and in wheat zhao et al 2009 noorka et al 2012 however these changes are strictly dependent on the crop species and the genotypes wang and frei 2011 our results showed no significant differences for lipid content in common bean and wheat genotype cpac 0544 whilst significant differences were observed for triticale and wheat genotype brs 404 under different wr in contrast to the literature our results indicate an increase in lipid content in decreasing water regime from 535 mm to 304 mm amongst the chemical components analyzed in this study ash content was less influenced by water regimes and only in common bean grains were significant differences observed according to the brazilian table of food composition nepa unicamp 2011 the average ash content of raw common bean is 3 71 g 100 g 1 we observed that only under the higher water regimes the values were close to this reference the increase of the inorganic residue in conditions of greater water availability can occur due to the increase of the translocation of mineral nutrients of the roots to the grains in contrast when there is low water availability in the soil all ions become less mobile due to the replacement of water by air in the pore spaces between the soil particles increasing the tortuosity and the retention of ions by the colloids of the soil and reducing root absorption ferreira et al 2008 4 2 3 macro and micromineral contents minerals required in the human diet are divided into macro and microminerals gharibzahedi and jafari 2017 macro and microminerals are inorganic elements widely distributed in nature and are essential for proper growth and development of the organism paiva et al 2017 mineral deficiencies in diets can impair physical development and contribute to the onset of infections hussain et al 2010 vegetable sources such as grains can provide sufficient amounts of minerals in diets though importantly grains produced under unfavorable conditions such as low levels of nutrients in the soil or other environmental stresses such as low water availability may contain lower levels of these elements our results indicate in general a reduction in macronutrients and micronutrients in grains under low wr which is most likely due to decreased nutrient uptake from the soil bista et al 2018 tadayyon et al 2018 waraich et al 2011 reduced water availability may decrease nutrient uptake by the roots through several mechanisms firstly supply of the nutrient in the soil may be reduced by mineralization bista et al 2018 sanaullah et al 2012 secondly mass flow and diffusion of nutrients in the soil may be decreased under these conditions bista et al 2018 finally uptake kinetics of the roots may be directly affected bista et al 2018 bassirirad 2000 whilst remobilization of certain elements from leaves can occur during nutrient deficiency k s p mg cu mo fe and zn other elements cannot be readily remobilized and transported to the grains ca mn ni and b the macrominerals that were significantly affected were ca mg and p for triticale mg k p and s for the wheat genotype brs 404 p and s for the wheat genotype cpac 0544 drought did not affect the macrominerals in common bean and this crop presented the highest values of macrominerals analyzed in this study p ca mg k and s compared to the other studied cultivars indicating a rich content cultivar on the other hand four macrominerals ca p mg and k that were reduced by drought in three of the study cultivars are important for nerve and muscle function and inadequate concentrations can cause a cow to lose the ability to rise to her feet causing downer cow syndrome goff 2004 the microminerals that were significantly affected were b cu fe and zn for common bean mn and zn for triticale and zn for both studied wheat genotypes table 4 zn and fe are two minerals that are strongly influenced by the environmental conditions of plant cultivation and are the most deficient in the human diet paiva et al 2017 beleggia et al 2018 fe is a micronutrient necessary for the human body because it is an important component of hemoglobin of many enzymes and of the immune system tian et al 2018 and zn plays an important role in the structure of many enzymes gharibzahedi and jafari 2017 both zn and fe were affected by drought in common bean and zn was affected in all studied cultivars these nutrients are typically the most absent from the human diet and therefore the cultivation of these crops in conditions of water stress will tend to aggravate the situation furthermore increased concentrations of mn in brs 404 cpac0544 and triticale were associated with decreases in almost all other variables whilst positive correlations were observed in the case of common bean whilst mn is an essential micronutrient high concentrations may result in toxicity and reduced concentrations of n p and k in wheat have previously been reported in response to increased mn application rengel 2015 dinkpa et al 2018 potentially explaining negative correlations between concentration of this element and other variables future studies with the purpose of evaluating the effect of water stress on other qualitative variables of the grains such as hardness and cooking time and in the case of common bean a sensorial analysis of processed products are fundamental to complement the information obtained in the present work 5 conclusion in general water stress conditions negatively affected the yield physical quality chemical composition and nutritional quality of the grains but to differing degrees in the species and genotypes studied however wheat genotype brs 404 stood out as the physical qualities of the grain were unaffected by stress conditions common bean also appears well suited for planting under conditions of low water availability as despite a reduction in grain weight macromineral concentrations were maintained and protein concentration increased overall the study highlights the potential impact of reduced water availability on characteristics that are important to both producers and consumers but also indicates species and genotypes that are minimally affected by these conditions funding this research did not receive any
