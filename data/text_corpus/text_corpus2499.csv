12495,the self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfd mbr is an evolution of the conventional ultrafiltration based mbr where filtration occurs through a cake layer dynamic membrane dm supported by a filtration net the effluent quality levels that may be achieved through this technology are comparable to those of conventional mbr and suitable for effluent reuse as shown in previous research in addition sfd mbr are more sustainable both in terms of investment costs filtration net materials are cheaper than uf membranes and operation indeed the typical operating pressure of these systems is below 100 mbar thus compatible with gravity driven operation nevertheless as all membrane based processes also sfd mbr require periodic maintenance cleaning of the supports holding the filtering layers in order to ensure high and constant effluent quality and steady operation in this paper different strategies for continuous or temporized cyclic dm maintenance aimed at limiting the frequency of on site manual cleaning interventions are compared in particular five tests were performed at the bench scale adopting the same process conditions except for the type of dm maintenance strategy continuous fine bubble air scouring of the membrane surface was compared with two intermittent cyclic procedures based on backwash with permeate with and without simultaneous air scouring and mass air load supply with two cycles of different durations respectively the results have confirmed the overall high performance of this technology under all the tested conditions with cod removal efficiencies always exceeding 86 effluent turbidity values normally well below 5 ntu and often much lower complete nitrification and partial nitrogen removal furthermore the comparison among the different dm maintenance strategies has shown that the mass air load supply is the most efficient approach towards sustainable operation in particular shorter mass air load cycles provided the best performance in limiting the manual cleaning needs which under this condition were as low as once every 3 weeks the key finding of this study is the demonstration of cyclic air mass load as an effective preventive cleaning strategy allowing good performance of a bench scale sfd mbr strongly reducing the manual maintenance requirements more experiments are required to confirm these results in larger scale installations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dynamic membrane wastewater sfd mbr filtration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfd mbr is an evolution of the conventional ultrafiltration based mbr where filtration nets are used as filtering supports to favor the spontaneous accumulation of a sludge layer cake or dynamic membrane dm which becomes the main filtration medium 1 with an effluent quality similar to conventional mbr the advantages of sfd mbr are higher productivity fluxes up to hundreds l m 2 h 1 lower energy requirements transmembrane pressure tmp below few hundreds mbar suitable to gravity driven operation cheaper support materials nylon or polyethylene nets 1 2 these characteristics make the sfd mbr a simpler and more robust technology with respect to higher pressure membrane systems possibly suited for decentralized applications even solar powered and water reclamation in remote areas besides being the main filtration medium the dm contributes to the effectiveness of wastewater treatment through the metabolic activity of the microbial consortia composing the cake layer indeed the latter is made of different microbial groups and its composition varies according to process and environmental conditions such as wastewater composition operating parameters hydrodynamics etc 3 5 a number of studies have been published in recent years on the optimization of sfd mbr operating conditions and on the effects of biological process parameters as for example mixing regimes reactor temperature sludge retention time etc on dm development and characteristics inter alia 6 12 other researchers have reported on the role of supporting materials on dm formation and stability 13 18 the composition of the filtering layers has also been investigated both from the structural microbiological and biochemical viewpoints 19 24 moreover the understanding of fouling mechanisms and the optimization of fouling control strategies are critical for the steady operation of mbr and micro ultrafiltration processes in general and have been thoroughly investigated 25 27 in the case of sfd mbr the optimization of operation requires accurate control of the sludge layers that tend to accumulate on the filtration support indeed excessive accumulation and thick cake layers limit filtration and cause rapid tmp increase whereas insufficient build up of biomass layers lowers the system s performance in terms of permeate quality and may result in losses of solid and colloidal matter from the reactor 28 to the best of the authors knowledge the different possible approaches to dynamic membrane maintenance in order to extend the operation of sfd mbr were not investigated and compared so far this paper aims at contributing to the understanding of how sfd mbr operation can be optimized for achieving long term operation without losses of dm efficiency and consequent need of process interruptions main objective is to show the overall reliability and sustainability of this technology under given conditions surface filtration processes cause the accumulation of solid materials at the interface between the two phases in this sense to avoid the need of frequent manual cleaning of the filtering surfaces the development and maintenance of dm relies on tools and strategies to automatically limit their growth thickness increase or favoring their periodic renewal results from several experimental campaigns are presented where different approaches were adopted towards cake layer control and maintenance of steady operation tests were carried out at the bench scale and using mostly the same equipment and experimental conditions except for the dm maintenance approach in order to compare the performance of similar sfd mbr systems in terms of effluent quality and operation sustainability three different strategies were adopted to limit cake accumulation and avoid or slow down the tendency to tmp increase and the consequent need of manual cleaning of the filtration modules the standard benchmarking procedure was continuous air scouring of the filtering surfaces through fine bubble air diffusers placed immediately below the filtration modules as optimized in previous experiments 29 this was compared for efficacy with two different approaches the first one consisted in temporized periodic backwash of the filtration modules with a limited volume of the produced permeate the second one involved the cyclic supply of a massive air load for cleaning the modules with a much larger volume and pressure with respect to the fine bubble diffusers used for the continuous air scouring of the benchmark configuration process effectiveness under the different testing conditions was evaluated in terms of effluent quality turbidity and other physical and chemical parameters and sustainability pressure increase rates and frequency of on site manual cleaning of the supports temporary increase of effluent turbidity was expected every time the filtration module was manually cleaned and restored to its initial configuration clean filtration net the permeate quality rapidly increased with the build up of the dm and this behavior was common for all the maintenance approaches tested the results provide interesting insights on the most appropriate strategy to maintain sustainable long term operation and good permeate quality in sfd mbr that should then be further verified at a larger scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a completely mixed and aerated bioreactor having 14 l operating volume was set up and equipped with two submerged filtration modules where nylon nets pore size 50 μm nitex sefar ag heiden switzerland were used to support the growth of dynamic membranes fig 1 each module was composed of two square filtering frames having a surface of 6 6 cm each therefore the total filtering surface of each module was about 0 0072 m2 the permeate was extracted through each module with a peristaltic pump nike nk m pro injecta s r l rieti italy and all the experiments were run with a net flowrate of about 0 52 l h 1 including the suction breaks due to the temporized dm maintenance as described below the plant feed and permeate extraction were synchronized by maintaining constant the reactor operating volume through a level control connected to the feed pump sludge mixing was provided by an air pump with an average flowrate of 4 l min 1 m2k3 schego germany equipped with a fine bubble diffuser placed at the bottom of the reactor which also ensured a concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the range 2 4 mgo2 l 1 for biological oxidation processes the sludge retention time srt of the biological system was always maintained at 15 days by purging the reactor s mixed liquor every two days to obtain a weekly discharge volume of 6 5 l in all the experimental runs the sfd mbr performances were evaluated after 15 days from start up i e after 1 srt or after complete biomass turnover in order to skip the biological system s transient growth phase and evaluate the bioprocesses only when in equilibrium conditions the tmp was monitored in continuous through a couple of pressure transducers one per each module val co s r l s ilario di nerviano italy these were connected to a datalogger sysman progetti e servizi s r l italy and pressure data were recorded every 5 min when the tmp values exceeded about 200 mbar negative pressure the modules were removed from the reactor and manually cleaned on site through tap water jet rinsing of the filtering surface the tmp increase rates and the module cleaning frequencies were always recorded as these parameters were chosen as indicators of treatment sustainability 2 2 dm maintenance approaches in order to compare different dm maintenance approaches the two filtration modules placed in the reactor were operated according to different modes in the different testing periods as described in the following previous work has shown that a slight and continuous air supply through fine bubble diffusers can be used for scouring the filtering surfaces and prevent excess cake accumulation in sfd mbr 2 29 32 therefore in the benchmark configuration called p1 an additional air pump m2k3 schego germany equipped with a fine bubble diffuser placed immediately below the filtration module was operated in continuous with a flowrate of 0 15 l min 1 in order to maintain the dm in its maturity stage 29 microbubbles rising parallel and close to the surface of the two filtering frames allowed to maintain the filtration flux to slow down the tmp increase and consequently to reduce the frequency of on site module cleaning operation under these conditions was carried out with 4 h cycles where permeate extraction was maintained for 229 min and then interrupted for a 11 min pause also called relaxation phase same suction interruption time adopted in the other membrane maintenance strategies as described in the following this resulted in a flux of 74 6 l m 2 h 1 a hydraulic retention time hrt of 13 0 h and a volumetric loading rate vlr of 0 81 gcod lreact days 1 table 1 two alternative approaches were compared to the benchmark configuration and tested with the same objective of maintaining steady filtration with constant average permeate quality and limiting the tmp increase both of them were based on the idea of favoring a periodical dm renewal instead of dm conservation as in the benchmark by replacing or integrating the continuous fine bubble scouring with intermittent temporized actions aimed at regularly removing the dm at least partly thus cyclically promoting the development of a new one the first strategy called p2 was based on backwash and consisted in 4 h cycles with 229 min of continuous permeate suction and interruption of filtration for 11 min 3 min break 5 min backwash and another 3 min pause the permeate was collected in a vessel and used for backwash by pumping it countercurrent through the module with a peristaltic pump seko pr18 www seko com seko s p a rieti italy at a flowrate of 14 4 l h 1 i e more than one order of magnitude higher than the filtration flowrate the aim was to detach the cake layers from the supports and recover the system s permeability each backwash cycle implied 1 2 l of permeate returning into the reactor every 4 h resulting in a higher hrt of 19 2 h with respect to the benchmark the influent cod concentration was increased as described below to maintain a vlr similar to those of non backwashed experiments in order to evaluate the performance of the backwashed system with and without air scouring in a first test called p2 a the fine bubble air scouring was maintained also during the backwash while in a second test called p2 b the air scouring was switched off completely i e also during permeate suction the second approach called p3 consisted in periodically providing a sudden mass air load through a dedicated air blower lp 100h yasunaga japan and a pipe placed just below the modules without any air diffuser an air flow more than two orders of magnitude higher than the one used for surface scouring was adopted for this purpose same as for p2 also in this case the aim was to cyclically remove the cake layer from the support through the turbulence resulting from the mass air load a first test p3 a was performed with 4 h cycles composed of a filtration period of 200 min followed by a 40 minute suction break 10 min pause 20 min mass air load supply and another 10 min pause the resulting hrt was 14 4 h and the vlr was 0 75 gcod lreact d 1 in a second test p3 b the 4 h cycle was split into 229 min of continuous filtration and 11 min of interruption 3 min break 5 min mass air load supply and 3 min pause with an identical time schedule of p1 thus resulting in the same hrt and vlr values table 1 reports the main operating conditions of the experiments carried out with the different dm maintenance strategies the hrt and the vlr of each experiment were calculated by considering the different net flowrates of the two membrane modules depending on the operation mode indeed interruptions of filtration and backwash affected the net flowrate and the hrt and vlr were calculated accordingly the relatively high hrt values are due to the minimum operating reactor volume required for hosting the filtering modules in larger installations the ratio between filtering surfaces and reactor volume may be more favorable allowing for lower hrt values 2 3 municipal wastewater characteristics and bioprocess loading conditions real pre settled municipal wastewater was collected once or twice per week at a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp stored at 4 c and used to feed all the experimental runs table 2 reports the main average characteristics of the municipal wastewater in order to obtain relatively stable operating conditions of the biological processes a volumetric loading rate vlr of 0 8 gcod lreact d 1 was targeted to this aim the feed cod was maintained at an average value of about 450 mgcod l 1 either by diluting the wastewater with tap water or by adding a solution of sodium acetate yeast extract and peptone 50 25 25 as cod respectively in the experiments with backwash due to the partial dilution resulting from the permeate volumes used for backwash 1 2 l per cycle the design vlr value was maintained by increasing the feed concentration to 620 mgcod l 1 2 4 sampling and analyses the influent wastewater was characterized upon collection from the wwtp and the effluent permeate was accumulated stored at 4 c and sampled weekly for the analysis of the main chemical and physical parameters these included ph electrical conductivity ec total suspended solids tss turbidity daily only in permeate chemical oxygen demand cod n nh4 n no2 n no3 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp all analyses and determinations were performed according to standard methods 33 turbidity was measured with a 2100p turbidimeter hach loveland co usa ec and ph were measured with an innolab multi 9420 ids wtw weilheim germany the bioreactor was regularly monitored for temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration do luminescence probe hach loveland co usa the activated sludge was also sampled three times per week and characterized for tss vss oxidation reduction potential orp ph sludge volume index measured after 30 min settling svi and capillary suction time cst also these determinations were performed according to standard methods 33 3 results under all the tested configurations the cod removal efficiency were in the range 86 95 and partial nitrogen removal was achieved with nitrate never exceeding 30 mgn l 1 in the effluent confirming the excellent system s performance in terms of permeate quality table 3 in monitoring the process performance the dm was considered to grow beyond equilibrium conditions when the tmp reached values higher than 20 mbar negative pressure and this was chosen as the starting point of the rapid tmp increase and performance decrease sludge cake growth phase in the reported experiments on site manual cleaning of the filtration modules was carried out when the tmp progressive increase reached values above 200 mbar however this value was often quickly reached and overcome when the tmp started to increase due to cake growth an example of the real time tmp data collected every 5 min from the filtration modules is shown in fig 2a where three events of pressure increase and recovery through manual cleaning are plotted data extracted from test p2 b whose overall performance is discussed in the following fig 2b shows the maximum tmp values reached at the end of every 4 h cycle within the range 20 200 mbar absolute values the tmp increase rate over time is represented by the slopes of the respective trend lines straight lines this simplified approach was adopted for all the datasets of the 5 tests in order to obtain a simple parameter slope that could be used to compare the performance of the different dm maintenance strategies considered indeed these lines provide a simplified representation of the speed to which the pressure of 200 mbar was reached once the instability was established i e after the conventional threshold of 20 mbar had been overcome the simple calculation of these slopes is an easy way to evaluate the cake layer accumulation the lower the slope value the longer the time to achieve the critical tmp value these slopes tmp increase rates were calculated for all the tests performed the different dm maintenance strategies have resulted in different tmp increase rates which reflected in longer or shorter timeframes between the start of the tmp rise system s instability and the need of on site manual cleaning fig 2b also shows the second degree polynomial functions of the same selected datasets dotted lines these represent the best fitting functions of the series the different tests showed different dataset trends corresponding to different polynomial functions respectively this suggests that the cake growth patterns may be different also within the same test the effectiveness over time of the cyclic temporized dm maintenance strategy adopted i e the duration of the dm equilibrium conditions is indirectly represented by the frequency of manual cleaning the lower the frequency the higher the effectiveness because a longer equilibrium of the system is obtained i e suction pressure values below 20 mbar for extended periods without the start up of progressive tmp increase the rate of tmp increase and the frequency of on site manual module cleaning were considered the main operational characteristics of the different cyclic temporized module cleaning strategies and table 4 summarizes the steady state average values of these parameters for the tests performed in particular the average tmp increase rate for each test represents the average slope of the negative pressure increase lines as described above specific performance indicators for the different dm maintenance approaches are reported in the following and the main sfd mbr process characteristics over time are shown in fig 3 3 1 continuous fine bubble dm scouring p1 the sfd mbr configuration p1 was operated under equilibrium conditions for a period of 24 days during this period the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were in the range 2 2 2 8 mgtss l 1 with a svi of 230 340 ml gtss 1 and a cst ranging between 6 and 10 s fig 3 the frequency of manual on site membrane cleaning was 1 33 week 1 table 4 meaning that the manual intervention was required every 5 to 6 days on average the effluent quality was very high with average permeate turbidity cod and tn were 1 3 0 8 ntu 21 4 1 2 mgcod l 1 and 62 3 3 3 mgn l 1 respectively table 3 3 2 backwash with permeate p2 a and p2 b as described in the previous section two different tests were performed with configuration p2 since periodic backwash was applied with and without continuous fine bubble air scouring of the dm this was aimed at evaluating the influence of scouring on permeate quality and on site cleaning frequency the p2 a mode including continuous air scouring of the module also during backwash was maintained under steady state conditions for 19 days in this test the mlss ranged between 1 1 and 1 6 mgtss l 1 with a svi of 100 215 ml gtss 1 mainly around 100 150 ml gtss 1 and a cst in the range 7 11 s the on site membrane cleaning frequency was 2 88 week 1 i e one manual cleaning every 2 to 3 days and the average effluent turbidity was 23 5 20 4 ntu suggesting a relatively lower quality the p2 b configuration without air scouring was operated for 37 days at the steady state in this test the mlss ranged between 0 7 and 1 8 mgtss l 1 with a variable svi of 80 780 ml gtss 1 mostly above 200 ml gtss 1 and a cst in the range 6 9 s the on site manual membrane cleaning frequency was 1 44 week 1 with on site membrane cleanings every 4 to 5 days and the average effluent turbidity was 2 3 1 6 ntu thus in the very good quality range 3 3 mass air load supply p3 a and p3 b as in the previous case two tests were performed also with configuration p3 here the two tests differed in terms of timing of the periodic temporized supply of a mass air load for dm renewal as explained in section 2 1 above in the p3 a mode a 40 minute filtration break was adopted 10 min pause 20 min mass air load and 10 min pause and equilibrium conditions were kept for 13 days in this test the mlss ranged between 0 9 and 1 5 mgtss l 1 with a svi of 60 110 ml gtss 1 and a cst in the range 6 11 s under these conditions the on site membrane cleaning frequency was 0 54 week 1 table 4 i e only one manual cleaning in the 2 week period and the average effluent turbidity was 1 9 1 0 ntu thus again in the high quality range in the p3 b configuration the filtration break lasted 11 min 3 min pause 5 min mass air load and 3 min pause and steady state conditions were maintained for 21 days under these conditions the mlss concentration was between 2 2 and 2 8 mgtss l 1 the svi was in the range 230 350 ml gtss 1 and the cst in the range 6 11 s in this test the on site membrane cleaning frequency was 0 33 week 1 corresponding to one manual cleaning in the whole 3 week period table 4 and the average effluent turbidity was as low as 1 2 0 4 ntu confirming the very high performance in terms of permeate quality 4 discussion and comparison of the different strategies aim of the set of tests presented here was to compare different strategies for cyclic temporized dm maintenance operation with respect to a benchmark which had already been evaluated in previous experimental campaigns 2 29 30 besides biological process stability both the effluent quality and process sustainable operation were considered in this comparison and specific attention was given to turbidity as an indicator of the effluent quality and manual module cleaning frequency as a proxy to operation sustainability all the reported results refer to steady state conditions i e stable operating parameters and constant process operation fig 3 shows the main characteristics of the mixed liquor in the different experiments and specifically the mlss the svi and the cst over time these are especially relevant for the sfd mbr performance because the suspended sludge represents the building material of the dm in all the tests reported here the steady state mixed liquor biomass concentrations were consistent to those previously observed under similar conditions 2 however in the present experiments an influence of temperature was observed higher temperatures around 18 20 c resulted in mlss concentrations above 2 gtss l 1 and svi values in the range 230 350 ml gtss 1 tests p1 and p3 b while lower temperatures around 13 c displayed suspended biomass concentrations below 2 gtss l 1 and svi values below 200 ml gtss 1 tests p2 a p2 b and p3 a this is consistent with previously reported trends of biomass growth as a function of temperature 34 35 in the case of p2 b the svi values showed a strong variability over time possibly due to fluctuations in the composition of the real municipal wastewater nevertheless the cst was very stable throughout the different tests and always ranged between 6 and 11 s suggesting that the filterability of the suspended biomass was rather independent of the dm maintenance strategy adopted the variability of svi and the stability of cst also suggest that temperature and feed fluctuations affected the biomass settleability but had limited influence on its filterability the latter is possibly related to the presence of colloids and or the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps resulting from stress conditions overload famine toxicants salinity ph etc 36 38 these aspects will have to be investigated in future experimental tests in previous investigations the cst was proposed as an indicator of the quality of the filtration process in sfd mbr and values above 11 s were related to possible process instabilities and decreased overall performance 31 the results presented here confirm that cst values below this threshold correspond to stable operation of the sfd mbr and high effluent quality compatible with water reuse fig 3 also shows the systems performance in terms of tmp evolution over time and manual cleaning requirements the data displayed suggest that the tested temporized dm maintenance strategies had different levels of effectiveness in avoiding excessive cake accumulation and consequent permeability decrease and tmp rise in the reported experiments the adoption of fine bubble air scouring backwash with or without simultaneous air scouring and mass air load supply with different durations resulted in substantially different manual cleaning frequencies with much lower requirements when the latter approach was adopted sustainability of process operation in terms of on site module cleaning frequencies and negative pressure increase rates under the different conditions is also indicated by the data reported in table 4 both tests adopting the mass air load supply as a regular cyclic procedure provided better results with respect to the benchmark and to the backwash based strategy in particular the shorter mass air load p3 b was more effective than the longer one p3 a allowing extended periods of 20 25 days without the need of manual module cleaning also the speed of pressure increase observed with this operational mode was comparable to the one featured by the other two except p2 a that showed a much faster tmp rise suggesting an effective control of the dm thickness through the turbulence induced by the mass air load similar to that obtained through backwash and or fine bubble scouring the effectiveness of the backwash based strategy was comparable with the benchmark only when operated without fine bubble module scouring p2 b on the other hand when backwash was coupled with air scouring p2 a its effectiveness dropped the pressure increase rate was much faster and manual module cleaning was required almost every 2 5 days table 4 if confirmed at a larger plant scale this high frequency of required human intervention makes the overall process operation relatively complex and costly thus limiting its applicability in terms of effluent quality fig 4 shows the turbidity the cod and the nitrogen concentrations measured in the sfd mbr permeate over time for the different dm maintenance approaches tested the turbidity was consistently below 5 ntu and often much lower in all tests except p2 a confirming the overall very good performance of the sfd mbr and effluent quality levels largely within water reuse standards in test p2 a the simultaneous occurrence of fine bubble air scouring and backwash may have caused limited cake stability and some loss of particulate and colloidal materials at the beginning of each 4 h cycle when filtration was resumed following the interruption this has resulted in strongly variable effluent turbidity values often above the threshold of 10 ntu normally considered for uv disinfection and water reuse fig 4 shows that overall very good effluent quality was obtained in all experiments however it is possible to notice that best performances and stability were obtained in test p3 b the effluent cod average concentration was in the range 21 4 83 7 mgcod l 1 with removal percentages between 86 and 95 table 3 once again the lowest cod removal performance was observed in p2 a consistently with the higher effluent turbidity under all the tested conditions the nitrogen balance showed partial nitrogen removal with effluent tn concentrations often above 50 mgn l 1 nevertheless effluent nitrate concentrations were always below 30 mgn l 1 and complete nitrification was always observed table 3 considering the relatively high influent nitrogen concentration tn always above 70 mgn l 1 and n nh4 often higher than 40 mgn l 1 the overall removal of nitrogen may be attributed to partial denitrification this may possibly occur within the dm due either to the occurrence of local anoxic zones and the development of anoxic denitrifying consortia or to the growth of aerobic denitrifying organisms 3 5 39 however this hypothesis should be confirmed through specific investigations on the microbiological composition of sludge cakes 5 conclusions the sfd mbr can be considered among the most promising and interesting wastewater treatment technologies because it combines high effluent quality easily complying with standards for reuse with economic and environmental sustainability of operation furthermore the limited pressure requirements for permeate extraction make the sfd mbr suitable for gravity driven operation allowing its adoption also in remote areas where the energy needs for aeration may be covered through solar powered supply 40 41 nevertheless as all filtration based processes also the sfd mbr has some maintenance requirements in order to keep steady operation and high quality effluent in particular the effectiveness of dm filtration depends on the possibility of maintaining a cake layer with relatively constant characteristics as long as possible and renewing it periodically the dm maintenance can be approached through different strategies and this paper reports the results of experimental investigations aimed at comparing some of them all the reported tests were performed under the same operating conditions except for the approach adopted for dm maintenance and the systems performances were evaluated in terms of effluent quality and process sustainability results have shown that the sfd mbr always produced high quality effluents largely independent of the dm maintenance strategy adopted in particular effluent turbidity values normally well below 5 ntu cod removal efficiencies always above 86 and often close to 95 complete nitrification and partial nitrogen removal were obtained the latter may be possibly due to the development of anoxic denitrifying bacteria within the dm or to the possible occurrence of aerobic denitrifiers but these features should be confirmed through a deeper microbiological investigation the occurrence of low ntu values and nitrate concentrations in the range 20 30 mgn l 1 suggests that these effluents may be beneficially reused in irrigation in terms of operation sustainability the mass air load supply was the most effective cyclic and temporized dm maintenance strategy as it resulted in much lower frequencies of on site manual cleaning both the tests carried out with this strategy displayed long periods exceeding two weeks without the need of manual cleaning and the test with shorter mass air supply duration p3 b allowed for 3 weeks of continuous operation between manual interventions these results should be confirmed through further investigations under more challenging process conditions in terms of biomass loading rates and with larger scale installations and more advanced analytical techniques may be employed to provide a deeper understanding of membrane properties nevertheless they suggest that once the most appropriate automated and temporized maintenance strategy is assessed the sfd mbr can be operated for long timeframes with very limited manpower this makes this technology a reliable and sustainable tool especially suited for decentralized applications where it may have a strong potential for example for water reuse in irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

12495,the self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfd mbr is an evolution of the conventional ultrafiltration based mbr where filtration occurs through a cake layer dynamic membrane dm supported by a filtration net the effluent quality levels that may be achieved through this technology are comparable to those of conventional mbr and suitable for effluent reuse as shown in previous research in addition sfd mbr are more sustainable both in terms of investment costs filtration net materials are cheaper than uf membranes and operation indeed the typical operating pressure of these systems is below 100 mbar thus compatible with gravity driven operation nevertheless as all membrane based processes also sfd mbr require periodic maintenance cleaning of the supports holding the filtering layers in order to ensure high and constant effluent quality and steady operation in this paper different strategies for continuous or temporized cyclic dm maintenance aimed at limiting the frequency of on site manual cleaning interventions are compared in particular five tests were performed at the bench scale adopting the same process conditions except for the type of dm maintenance strategy continuous fine bubble air scouring of the membrane surface was compared with two intermittent cyclic procedures based on backwash with permeate with and without simultaneous air scouring and mass air load supply with two cycles of different durations respectively the results have confirmed the overall high performance of this technology under all the tested conditions with cod removal efficiencies always exceeding 86 effluent turbidity values normally well below 5 ntu and often much lower complete nitrification and partial nitrogen removal furthermore the comparison among the different dm maintenance strategies has shown that the mass air load supply is the most efficient approach towards sustainable operation in particular shorter mass air load cycles provided the best performance in limiting the manual cleaning needs which under this condition were as low as once every 3 weeks the key finding of this study is the demonstration of cyclic air mass load as an effective preventive cleaning strategy allowing good performance of a bench scale sfd mbr strongly reducing the manual maintenance requirements more experiments are required to confirm these results in larger scale installations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dynamic membrane wastewater sfd mbr filtration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the self forming dynamic membrane bioreactor sfd mbr is an evolution of the conventional ultrafiltration based mbr where filtration nets are used as filtering supports to favor the spontaneous accumulation of a sludge layer cake or dynamic membrane dm which becomes the main filtration medium 1 with an effluent quality similar to conventional mbr the advantages of sfd mbr are higher productivity fluxes up to hundreds l m 2 h 1 lower energy requirements transmembrane pressure tmp below few hundreds mbar suitable to gravity driven operation cheaper support materials nylon or polyethylene nets 1 2 these characteristics make the sfd mbr a simpler and more robust technology with respect to higher pressure membrane systems possibly suited for decentralized applications even solar powered and water reclamation in remote areas besides being the main filtration medium the dm contributes to the effectiveness of wastewater treatment through the metabolic activity of the microbial consortia composing the cake layer indeed the latter is made of different microbial groups and its composition varies according to process and environmental conditions such as wastewater composition operating parameters hydrodynamics etc 3 5 a number of studies have been published in recent years on the optimization of sfd mbr operating conditions and on the effects of biological process parameters as for example mixing regimes reactor temperature sludge retention time etc on dm development and characteristics inter alia 6 12 other researchers have reported on the role of supporting materials on dm formation and stability 13 18 the composition of the filtering layers has also been investigated both from the structural microbiological and biochemical viewpoints 19 24 moreover the understanding of fouling mechanisms and the optimization of fouling control strategies are critical for the steady operation of mbr and micro ultrafiltration processes in general and have been thoroughly investigated 25 27 in the case of sfd mbr the optimization of operation requires accurate control of the sludge layers that tend to accumulate on the filtration support indeed excessive accumulation and thick cake layers limit filtration and cause rapid tmp increase whereas insufficient build up of biomass layers lowers the system s performance in terms of permeate quality and may result in losses of solid and colloidal matter from the reactor 28 to the best of the authors knowledge the different possible approaches to dynamic membrane maintenance in order to extend the operation of sfd mbr were not investigated and compared so far this paper aims at contributing to the understanding of how sfd mbr operation can be optimized for achieving long term operation without losses of dm efficiency and consequent need of process interruptions main objective is to show the overall reliability and sustainability of this technology under given conditions surface filtration processes cause the accumulation of solid materials at the interface between the two phases in this sense to avoid the need of frequent manual cleaning of the filtering surfaces the development and maintenance of dm relies on tools and strategies to automatically limit their growth thickness increase or favoring their periodic renewal results from several experimental campaigns are presented where different approaches were adopted towards cake layer control and maintenance of steady operation tests were carried out at the bench scale and using mostly the same equipment and experimental conditions except for the dm maintenance approach in order to compare the performance of similar sfd mbr systems in terms of effluent quality and operation sustainability three different strategies were adopted to limit cake accumulation and avoid or slow down the tendency to tmp increase and the consequent need of manual cleaning of the filtration modules the standard benchmarking procedure was continuous air scouring of the filtering surfaces through fine bubble air diffusers placed immediately below the filtration modules as optimized in previous experiments 29 this was compared for efficacy with two different approaches the first one consisted in temporized periodic backwash of the filtration modules with a limited volume of the produced permeate the second one involved the cyclic supply of a massive air load for cleaning the modules with a much larger volume and pressure with respect to the fine bubble diffusers used for the continuous air scouring of the benchmark configuration process effectiveness under the different testing conditions was evaluated in terms of effluent quality turbidity and other physical and chemical parameters and sustainability pressure increase rates and frequency of on site manual cleaning of the supports temporary increase of effluent turbidity was expected every time the filtration module was manually cleaned and restored to its initial configuration clean filtration net the permeate quality rapidly increased with the build up of the dm and this behavior was common for all the maintenance approaches tested the results provide interesting insights on the most appropriate strategy to maintain sustainable long term operation and good permeate quality in sfd mbr that should then be further verified at a larger scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a completely mixed and aerated bioreactor having 14 l operating volume was set up and equipped with two submerged filtration modules where nylon nets pore size 50 μm nitex sefar ag heiden switzerland were used to support the growth of dynamic membranes fig 1 each module was composed of two square filtering frames having a surface of 6 6 cm each therefore the total filtering surface of each module was about 0 0072 m2 the permeate was extracted through each module with a peristaltic pump nike nk m pro injecta s r l rieti italy and all the experiments were run with a net flowrate of about 0 52 l h 1 including the suction breaks due to the temporized dm maintenance as described below the plant feed and permeate extraction were synchronized by maintaining constant the reactor operating volume through a level control connected to the feed pump sludge mixing was provided by an air pump with an average flowrate of 4 l min 1 m2k3 schego germany equipped with a fine bubble diffuser placed at the bottom of the reactor which also ensured a concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the range 2 4 mgo2 l 1 for biological oxidation processes the sludge retention time srt of the biological system was always maintained at 15 days by purging the reactor s mixed liquor every two days to obtain a weekly discharge volume of 6 5 l in all the experimental runs the sfd mbr performances were evaluated after 15 days from start up i e after 1 srt or after complete biomass turnover in order to skip the biological system s transient growth phase and evaluate the bioprocesses only when in equilibrium conditions the tmp was monitored in continuous through a couple of pressure transducers one per each module val co s r l s ilario di nerviano italy these were connected to a datalogger sysman progetti e servizi s r l italy and pressure data were recorded every 5 min when the tmp values exceeded about 200 mbar negative pressure the modules were removed from the reactor and manually cleaned on site through tap water jet rinsing of the filtering surface the tmp increase rates and the module cleaning frequencies were always recorded as these parameters were chosen as indicators of treatment sustainability 2 2 dm maintenance approaches in order to compare different dm maintenance approaches the two filtration modules placed in the reactor were operated according to different modes in the different testing periods as described in the following previous work has shown that a slight and continuous air supply through fine bubble diffusers can be used for scouring the filtering surfaces and prevent excess cake accumulation in sfd mbr 2 29 32 therefore in the benchmark configuration called p1 an additional air pump m2k3 schego germany equipped with a fine bubble diffuser placed immediately below the filtration module was operated in continuous with a flowrate of 0 15 l min 1 in order to maintain the dm in its maturity stage 29 microbubbles rising parallel and close to the surface of the two filtering frames allowed to maintain the filtration flux to slow down the tmp increase and consequently to reduce the frequency of on site module cleaning operation under these conditions was carried out with 4 h cycles where permeate extraction was maintained for 229 min and then interrupted for a 11 min pause also called relaxation phase same suction interruption time adopted in the other membrane maintenance strategies as described in the following this resulted in a flux of 74 6 l m 2 h 1 a hydraulic retention time hrt of 13 0 h and a volumetric loading rate vlr of 0 81 gcod lreact days 1 table 1 two alternative approaches were compared to the benchmark configuration and tested with the same objective of maintaining steady filtration with constant average permeate quality and limiting the tmp increase both of them were based on the idea of favoring a periodical dm renewal instead of dm conservation as in the benchmark by replacing or integrating the continuous fine bubble scouring with intermittent temporized actions aimed at regularly removing the dm at least partly thus cyclically promoting the development of a new one the first strategy called p2 was based on backwash and consisted in 4 h cycles with 229 min of continuous permeate suction and interruption of filtration for 11 min 3 min break 5 min backwash and another 3 min pause the permeate was collected in a vessel and used for backwash by pumping it countercurrent through the module with a peristaltic pump seko pr18 www seko com seko s p a rieti italy at a flowrate of 14 4 l h 1 i e more than one order of magnitude higher than the filtration flowrate the aim was to detach the cake layers from the supports and recover the system s permeability each backwash cycle implied 1 2 l of permeate returning into the reactor every 4 h resulting in a higher hrt of 19 2 h with respect to the benchmark the influent cod concentration was increased as described below to maintain a vlr similar to those of non backwashed experiments in order to evaluate the performance of the backwashed system with and without air scouring in a first test called p2 a the fine bubble air scouring was maintained also during the backwash while in a second test called p2 b the air scouring was switched off completely i e also during permeate suction the second approach called p3 consisted in periodically providing a sudden mass air load through a dedicated air blower lp 100h yasunaga japan and a pipe placed just below the modules without any air diffuser an air flow more than two orders of magnitude higher than the one used for surface scouring was adopted for this purpose same as for p2 also in this case the aim was to cyclically remove the cake layer from the support through the turbulence resulting from the mass air load a first test p3 a was performed with 4 h cycles composed of a filtration period of 200 min followed by a 40 minute suction break 10 min pause 20 min mass air load supply and another 10 min pause the resulting hrt was 14 4 h and the vlr was 0 75 gcod lreact d 1 in a second test p3 b the 4 h cycle was split into 229 min of continuous filtration and 11 min of interruption 3 min break 5 min mass air load supply and 3 min pause with an identical time schedule of p1 thus resulting in the same hrt and vlr values table 1 reports the main operating conditions of the experiments carried out with the different dm maintenance strategies the hrt and the vlr of each experiment were calculated by considering the different net flowrates of the two membrane modules depending on the operation mode indeed interruptions of filtration and backwash affected the net flowrate and the hrt and vlr were calculated accordingly the relatively high hrt values are due to the minimum operating reactor volume required for hosting the filtering modules in larger installations the ratio between filtering surfaces and reactor volume may be more favorable allowing for lower hrt values 2 3 municipal wastewater characteristics and bioprocess loading conditions real pre settled municipal wastewater was collected once or twice per week at a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp stored at 4 c and used to feed all the experimental runs table 2 reports the main average characteristics of the municipal wastewater in order to obtain relatively stable operating conditions of the biological processes a volumetric loading rate vlr of 0 8 gcod lreact d 1 was targeted to this aim the feed cod was maintained at an average value of about 450 mgcod l 1 either by diluting the wastewater with tap water or by adding a solution of sodium acetate yeast extract and peptone 50 25 25 as cod respectively in the experiments with backwash due to the partial dilution resulting from the permeate volumes used for backwash 1 2 l per cycle the design vlr value was maintained by increasing the feed concentration to 620 mgcod l 1 2 4 sampling and analyses the influent wastewater was characterized upon collection from the wwtp and the effluent permeate was accumulated stored at 4 c and sampled weekly for the analysis of the main chemical and physical parameters these included ph electrical conductivity ec total suspended solids tss turbidity daily only in permeate chemical oxygen demand cod n nh4 n no2 n no3 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp all analyses and determinations were performed according to standard methods 33 turbidity was measured with a 2100p turbidimeter hach loveland co usa ec and ph were measured with an innolab multi 9420 ids wtw weilheim germany the bioreactor was regularly monitored for temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration do luminescence probe hach loveland co usa the activated sludge was also sampled three times per week and characterized for tss vss oxidation reduction potential orp ph sludge volume index measured after 30 min settling svi and capillary suction time cst also these determinations were performed according to standard methods 33 3 results under all the tested configurations the cod removal efficiency were in the range 86 95 and partial nitrogen removal was achieved with nitrate never exceeding 30 mgn l 1 in the effluent confirming the excellent system s performance in terms of permeate quality table 3 in monitoring the process performance the dm was considered to grow beyond equilibrium conditions when the tmp reached values higher than 20 mbar negative pressure and this was chosen as the starting point of the rapid tmp increase and performance decrease sludge cake growth phase in the reported experiments on site manual cleaning of the filtration modules was carried out when the tmp progressive increase reached values above 200 mbar however this value was often quickly reached and overcome when the tmp started to increase due to cake growth an example of the real time tmp data collected every 5 min from the filtration modules is shown in fig 2a where three events of pressure increase and recovery through manual cleaning are plotted data extracted from test p2 b whose overall performance is discussed in the following fig 2b shows the maximum tmp values reached at the end of every 4 h cycle within the range 20 200 mbar absolute values the tmp increase rate over time is represented by the slopes of the respective trend lines straight lines this simplified approach was adopted for all the datasets of the 5 tests in order to obtain a simple parameter slope that could be used to compare the performance of the different dm maintenance strategies considered indeed these lines provide a simplified representation of the speed to which the pressure of 200 mbar was reached once the instability was established i e after the conventional threshold of 20 mbar had been overcome the simple calculation of these slopes is an easy way to evaluate the cake layer accumulation the lower the slope value the longer the time to achieve the critical tmp value these slopes tmp increase rates were calculated for all the tests performed the different dm maintenance strategies have resulted in different tmp increase rates which reflected in longer or shorter timeframes between the start of the tmp rise system s instability and the need of on site manual cleaning fig 2b also shows the second degree polynomial functions of the same selected datasets dotted lines these represent the best fitting functions of the series the different tests showed different dataset trends corresponding to different polynomial functions respectively this suggests that the cake growth patterns may be different also within the same test the effectiveness over time of the cyclic temporized dm maintenance strategy adopted i e the duration of the dm equilibrium conditions is indirectly represented by the frequency of manual cleaning the lower the frequency the higher the effectiveness because a longer equilibrium of the system is obtained i e suction pressure values below 20 mbar for extended periods without the start up of progressive tmp increase the rate of tmp increase and the frequency of on site manual module cleaning were considered the main operational characteristics of the different cyclic temporized module cleaning strategies and table 4 summarizes the steady state average values of these parameters for the tests performed in particular the average tmp increase rate for each test represents the average slope of the negative pressure increase lines as described above specific performance indicators for the different dm maintenance approaches are reported in the following and the main sfd mbr process characteristics over time are shown in fig 3 3 1 continuous fine bubble dm scouring p1 the sfd mbr configuration p1 was operated under equilibrium conditions for a period of 24 days during this period the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were in the range 2 2 2 8 mgtss l 1 with a svi of 230 340 ml gtss 1 and a cst ranging between 6 and 10 s fig 3 the frequency of manual on site membrane cleaning was 1 33 week 1 table 4 meaning that the manual intervention was required every 5 to 6 days on average the effluent quality was very high with average permeate turbidity cod and tn were 1 3 0 8 ntu 21 4 1 2 mgcod l 1 and 62 3 3 3 mgn l 1 respectively table 3 3 2 backwash with permeate p2 a and p2 b as described in the previous section two different tests were performed with configuration p2 since periodic backwash was applied with and without continuous fine bubble air scouring of the dm this was aimed at evaluating the influence of scouring on permeate quality and on site cleaning frequency the p2 a mode including continuous air scouring of the module also during backwash was maintained under steady state conditions for 19 days in this test the mlss ranged between 1 1 and 1 6 mgtss l 1 with a svi of 100 215 ml gtss 1 mainly around 100 150 ml gtss 1 and a cst in the range 7 11 s the on site membrane cleaning frequency was 2 88 week 1 i e one manual cleaning every 2 to 3 days and the average effluent turbidity was 23 5 20 4 ntu suggesting a relatively lower quality the p2 b configuration without air scouring was operated for 37 days at the steady state in this test the mlss ranged between 0 7 and 1 8 mgtss l 1 with a variable svi of 80 780 ml gtss 1 mostly above 200 ml gtss 1 and a cst in the range 6 9 s the on site manual membrane cleaning frequency was 1 44 week 1 with on site membrane cleanings every 4 to 5 days and the average effluent turbidity was 2 3 1 6 ntu thus in the very good quality range 3 3 mass air load supply p3 a and p3 b as in the previous case two tests were performed also with configuration p3 here the two tests differed in terms of timing of the periodic temporized supply of a mass air load for dm renewal as explained in section 2 1 above in the p3 a mode a 40 minute filtration break was adopted 10 min pause 20 min mass air load and 10 min pause and equilibrium conditions were kept for 13 days in this test the mlss ranged between 0 9 and 1 5 mgtss l 1 with a svi of 60 110 ml gtss 1 and a cst in the range 6 11 s under these conditions the on site membrane cleaning frequency was 0 54 week 1 table 4 i e only one manual cleaning in the 2 week period and the average effluent turbidity was 1 9 1 0 ntu thus again in the high quality range in the p3 b configuration the filtration break lasted 11 min 3 min pause 5 min mass air load and 3 min pause and steady state conditions were maintained for 21 days under these conditions the mlss concentration was between 2 2 and 2 8 mgtss l 1 the svi was in the range 230 350 ml gtss 1 and the cst in the range 6 11 s in this test the on site membrane cleaning frequency was 0 33 week 1 corresponding to one manual cleaning in the whole 3 week period table 4 and the average effluent turbidity was as low as 1 2 0 4 ntu confirming the very high performance in terms of permeate quality 4 discussion and comparison of the different strategies aim of the set of tests presented here was to compare different strategies for cyclic temporized dm maintenance operation with respect to a benchmark which had already been evaluated in previous experimental campaigns 2 29 30 besides biological process stability both the effluent quality and process sustainable operation were considered in this comparison and specific attention was given to turbidity as an indicator of the effluent quality and manual module cleaning frequency as a proxy to operation sustainability all the reported results refer to steady state conditions i e stable operating parameters and constant process operation fig 3 shows the main characteristics of the mixed liquor in the different experiments and specifically the mlss the svi and the cst over time these are especially relevant for the sfd mbr performance because the suspended sludge represents the building material of the dm in all the tests reported here the steady state mixed liquor biomass concentrations were consistent to those previously observed under similar conditions 2 however in the present experiments an influence of temperature was observed higher temperatures around 18 20 c resulted in mlss concentrations above 2 gtss l 1 and svi values in the range 230 350 ml gtss 1 tests p1 and p3 b while lower temperatures around 13 c displayed suspended biomass concentrations below 2 gtss l 1 and svi values below 200 ml gtss 1 tests p2 a p2 b and p3 a this is consistent with previously reported trends of biomass growth as a function of temperature 34 35 in the case of p2 b the svi values showed a strong variability over time possibly due to fluctuations in the composition of the real municipal wastewater nevertheless the cst was very stable throughout the different tests and always ranged between 6 and 11 s suggesting that the filterability of the suspended biomass was rather independent of the dm maintenance strategy adopted the variability of svi and the stability of cst also suggest that temperature and feed fluctuations affected the biomass settleability but had limited influence on its filterability the latter is possibly related to the presence of colloids and or the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps resulting from stress conditions overload famine toxicants salinity ph etc 36 38 these aspects will have to be investigated in future experimental tests in previous investigations the cst was proposed as an indicator of the quality of the filtration process in sfd mbr and values above 11 s were related to possible process instabilities and decreased overall performance 31 the results presented here confirm that cst values below this threshold correspond to stable operation of the sfd mbr and high effluent quality compatible with water reuse fig 3 also shows the systems performance in terms of tmp evolution over time and manual cleaning requirements the data displayed suggest that the tested temporized dm maintenance strategies had different levels of effectiveness in avoiding excessive cake accumulation and consequent permeability decrease and tmp rise in the reported experiments the adoption of fine bubble air scouring backwash with or without simultaneous air scouring and mass air load supply with different durations resulted in substantially different manual cleaning frequencies with much lower requirements when the latter approach was adopted sustainability of process operation in terms of on site module cleaning frequencies and negative pressure increase rates under the different conditions is also indicated by the data reported in table 4 both tests adopting the mass air load supply as a regular cyclic procedure provided better results with respect to the benchmark and to the backwash based strategy in particular the shorter mass air load p3 b was more effective than the longer one p3 a allowing extended periods of 20 25 days without the need of manual module cleaning also the speed of pressure increase observed with this operational mode was comparable to the one featured by the other two except p2 a that showed a much faster tmp rise suggesting an effective control of the dm thickness through the turbulence induced by the mass air load similar to that obtained through backwash and or fine bubble scouring the effectiveness of the backwash based strategy was comparable with the benchmark only when operated without fine bubble module scouring p2 b on the other hand when backwash was coupled with air scouring p2 a its effectiveness dropped the pressure increase rate was much faster and manual module cleaning was required almost every 2 5 days table 4 if confirmed at a larger plant scale this high frequency of required human intervention makes the overall process operation relatively complex and costly thus limiting its applicability in terms of effluent quality fig 4 shows the turbidity the cod and the nitrogen concentrations measured in the sfd mbr permeate over time for the different dm maintenance approaches tested the turbidity was consistently below 5 ntu and often much lower in all tests except p2 a confirming the overall very good performance of the sfd mbr and effluent quality levels largely within water reuse standards in test p2 a the simultaneous occurrence of fine bubble air scouring and backwash may have caused limited cake stability and some loss of particulate and colloidal materials at the beginning of each 4 h cycle when filtration was resumed following the interruption this has resulted in strongly variable effluent turbidity values often above the threshold of 10 ntu normally considered for uv disinfection and water reuse fig 4 shows that overall very good effluent quality was obtained in all experiments however it is possible to notice that best performances and stability were obtained in test p3 b the effluent cod average concentration was in the range 21 4 83 7 mgcod l 1 with removal percentages between 86 and 95 table 3 once again the lowest cod removal performance was observed in p2 a consistently with the higher effluent turbidity under all the tested conditions the nitrogen balance showed partial nitrogen removal with effluent tn concentrations often above 50 mgn l 1 nevertheless effluent nitrate concentrations were always below 30 mgn l 1 and complete nitrification was always observed table 3 considering the relatively high influent nitrogen concentration tn always above 70 mgn l 1 and n nh4 often higher than 40 mgn l 1 the overall removal of nitrogen may be attributed to partial denitrification this may possibly occur within the dm due either to the occurrence of local anoxic zones and the development of anoxic denitrifying consortia or to the growth of aerobic denitrifying organisms 3 5 39 however this hypothesis should be confirmed through specific investigations on the microbiological composition of sludge cakes 5 conclusions the sfd mbr can be considered among the most promising and interesting wastewater treatment technologies because it combines high effluent quality easily complying with standards for reuse with economic and environmental sustainability of operation furthermore the limited pressure requirements for permeate extraction make the sfd mbr suitable for gravity driven operation allowing its adoption also in remote areas where the energy needs for aeration may be covered through solar powered supply 40 41 nevertheless as all filtration based processes also the sfd mbr has some maintenance requirements in order to keep steady operation and high quality effluent in particular the effectiveness of dm filtration depends on the possibility of maintaining a cake layer with relatively constant characteristics as long as possible and renewing it periodically the dm maintenance can be approached through different strategies and this paper reports the results of experimental investigations aimed at comparing some of them all the reported tests were performed under the same operating conditions except for the approach adopted for dm maintenance and the systems performances were evaluated in terms of effluent quality and process sustainability results have shown that the sfd mbr always produced high quality effluents largely independent of the dm maintenance strategy adopted in particular effluent turbidity values normally well below 5 ntu cod removal efficiencies always above 86 and often close to 95 complete nitrification and partial nitrogen removal were obtained the latter may be possibly due to the development of anoxic denitrifying bacteria within the dm or to the possible occurrence of aerobic denitrifiers but these features should be confirmed through a deeper microbiological investigation the occurrence of low ntu values and nitrate concentrations in the range 20 30 mgn l 1 suggests that these effluents may be beneficially reused in irrigation in terms of operation sustainability the mass air load supply was the most effective cyclic and temporized dm maintenance strategy as it resulted in much lower frequencies of on site manual cleaning both the tests carried out with this strategy displayed long periods exceeding two weeks without the need of manual cleaning and the test with shorter mass air supply duration p3 b allowed for 3 weeks of continuous operation between manual interventions these results should be confirmed through further investigations under more challenging process conditions in terms of biomass loading rates and with larger scale installations and more advanced analytical techniques may be employed to provide a deeper understanding of membrane properties nevertheless they suggest that once the most appropriate automated and temporized maintenance strategy is assessed the sfd mbr can be operated for long timeframes with very limited manpower this makes this technology a reliable and sustainable tool especially suited for decentralized applications where it may have a strong potential for example for

efficient processes for the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa however hydrated electron reduction has inherent deficiency in the mineralization i e converting organic carbon into co2 of pfoa furthermore toxic byproducts such as partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas might give secondary pollution if the wholly hydrodefluorination of pfoa is not achieved bdd electrochemical oxidation can obtain a high mineralization efficiency but it leads to a low defluorination i e transforming c f bonds into f ions efficiency due to the generation of toxic volatile fluorinated alkanes herein we report a coupled process that is hydrated electron reduction as pre treatment and bdd electrochemical oxidation as post treatment to achieve a complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa the results demonstrate that 50 mg l pfoa can be 100 deluorinated and mineralized under 5 h uv sulfite reduction followed by 10 h electrochemical oxidation this coupled process strongly inhibits the production of the toxic volatile fluorinated pollutants and quickly converts the residual toxic sulfite in uv sulfite system to the sulfate mechanism investigation demonstrates that bdd oxidation is able to transform hdcas and pfsas formed by hydrated electron reduction to the perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas with shorter carbon chain than pfoa which can be further defluorinated and mineralized graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfoa complete defluorination complete mineralization hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids perfluorocarboxylic acids coupled process data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa as one of typical representatives of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass cnf2n 1 r has been widely used to produce many industrial products such as refrigerant flame retardant and polymer 1 owing to their excellent thermal chemical stability and surface activity 2 the widespread utilization and weak governance of pfoa have led to this compound detected in various environments such as air soil waterbody and living organisms 3 4 numerous proofs have showed that pfoa are hepatotoxic genotoxic neurotoxic reproductive toxic to animals and humans 5 6 since the hydrogen atoms on the carbon chain of pfoa are all replaced by fluorine atoms and the cf bond formed has an extremely high bond energy 451 485 kj mol to resist to normally chemical and biological degradation pfoa is also called as forever chemical 7 so far no effective natural attenuation of pfoa has been found and conventional methods for removal of persistent pollutants can only achieve partial degradation under specific and harsh conditions 8 10 therefore seeking an efficient and complete pfoa degradation strategy is attracting more and more attentions at present the researches on the pfoa degradation mainly focus on electrochemical oxidation 11 14 chemical reduction 15 17 adsorption 18 filtration 19 thermal decomposition 20 23 and biodegradation 24 25 etc conventional chemical oxidation such as advanced oxidation processes aops that utilize strong oxidizing radicals e g hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 oxidation potentials of 2 33 3 1 v nhe 26 27 to degrade organic pollutants are ineffective on the degradation of pfoa due to their insufficient capability to break cf bond 28 electrochemical oxidation using anodes with high overpotential of oxygen evolution such as bdd ti4o7 pbo2 and dimensionally stable anode dsa 29 31 exhibits an excellent mineralization of pfoa where the pfoa first loses an electron on the anode to form pfoa radical that can be further oxidized by oh formed by anodic reaction 12 32 33 however electrochemical approach requires high electricity input and is challenged by the low defluorination efficiency due to generation of volatile fluorinated products 13 reductive dehalogenation technology is often used to improve the biodegradability of persistent organic pollutants and to facilitate their subsequent biodegradation 34 pfoa is a kind of halogenated compound but the reduction potential of conventional reducing agents is not enough to defluorinate 35 hydrated electron eaq consists of one electron and six water molecules with a high reducing capability reduction potential e0 2 9 v rhe 36 and has been used in the reduction of pfoa to achieve a high defluorination rate and efficiency however the mineralization efficiency of pfoa reduction by eaq is low due to generation of organic byproducts such as hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas that give another environment pollution 15 16 37 39 adsorption and filtration technologies can effectively remove pfoa but they only transfer pfoa between different phases without achieving complete degradation 40 41 thermal decomposition of pfoa is an energy intensive process and a scale up would be more challenged 20 biodegradation exhibits unsatisfactory performance on pfoa degradation due to extremely low defluorination rate and efficiency 42 43 in summary single technology has various defects and is still far from practical applications previous studies have investigated coupled processes such as ion exchange resin coupled with electrochemical oxidation 44 electrochemical sorption coupled with hydrated electron reduction 45 and aops coupled with hydrated electron reduction 46 for the pfass degradation but most of them prefer to pursue a high efficient defluorination rather than a complete degradation defluorination and mineralization efficiency both close to 100 however complete defluorination and mineralization of pfass is necessary to avoid the second pollution and post treatment in this work the feasibility of hydrated electron reduction coupled with electrochemical oxidation to achieve a complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa is investigated the hydrated electron reduction in an uv sulfite system and electrochemical oxidation by a bdd electrode are thoroughly compared to ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of each process for pfoa degradation then an coupled process involving reduction as pre treatment and oxidation as post treatment are developed to obtain a near complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa the optimal reaction conditions and mechanisms for thorough pfoa degradation in this coupled process are investigated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this experiment such as perfluoro octanoic acid pfoa c8

electron reduction system uv sulfite process is selected as an efficient approach to generate hydrated electron for pfoa reduction this system has another advantage is that the residual sulfite can serve as a good electrolyte in subsequent electrochemical oxidation where it will be oxidized to low harmful sulfate 47 effect of different reaction conditions for pfoa degradation in uv sulfite

reduction shows highly efficient pfoa degradation 100 removal within 0 5 h while electrochemical oxidation needs 7 5 h to reach a complete removal fig 1a hydrated electron reduction or electrochemical oxidation alone could not achieve a complete pfoa defluorination during 15 h reaction in contrast three coupled processes of red oxi 1 red oxi 2 and red oxi 3 all exhibit an enhancement in defluorination especially for red oxi 3 reaches a near complete defluorination within 14 h a complete defluorination is one of the major goals pursued by pfoa degradation since incomplete defluorination might accompany with the formation of fluorinated organic products that exhibit a more recalcitrant 48 and toxic 49 to the environment these inspiring results indicate that pre reduction coupled with post oxidation might be a promising approach for pfoa complete degradation and drives us to explore deeper into this process the pfoa mineralization mainly occurred in oxidation stage of each process and can achieve a complete mineralization within 15 h except a single reduction process red with the negligible mineralization efficiency fig 1c what should be noted is that although single electrochemical oxidation oxi leads to the highest mineralization rate mineralization efficiency calculated here is based on the change in solution toc and excludes the toxic volatile fluorinated alkanes vfas generated and detected during oxi process thus its mineralization efficiency is overestimated to further investigate this interesting finding of vfas production and its influence the vfas were identified by the gc ms as well as the mass balance of carbon and fluorine was analyzed fig 2 the gc ms results demonstrate that three vfas including chf3 c2f6 and c9f20 are detected in the gas phase niu et al have proposed a hypothesis that vfas might generate in electrochemical oxidation of pfass but they did not specifically verify it 13 the carbon balance shows that the most of organic carbon in pfoa solution was removed during electrochemical oxidation while the fluorine balance shows that a significant proportion of fluorine is embedded in unknown byproducts named as other products which are most likely vfas that volatilize into the gas phase or may escape detection this explains that why the defluorination efficiency is far behind the mineralization efficiency in single electrochemical oxidation even at different current densities fig 2c d and different initial concentration of pfoa fig s9 on the contrast few vfas were detected in coupled processes which leads to high defluorination efficiencies fig 1b indicating their high mineralization efficiencies obtained here are real fig 1c especially for red oxi 3 it gives the both complete defluorination and mineralization these results support that oxidation followed with reduction may suppress vfas production to decompose the most of c f bonds into f ions and co2 3 2 the transformation of reduction products during oxidation post treatment to deeply explore why the red oxi 3 system could achieve the pfoa complete defluorination and mineralization meanwhile suppress the generation of vfas the transformation of reduction products by oxidation post treatment are investigated in detail the exploration begins with the identification of partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas generated during hydrated electron reduction the lc ms ms results demonstrate 27 kinds of hdcas are detected detail information are summarized in table s4 the concentration of hdcas decreased to zero during the post oxidation fig 3 in contrast hdcas cannot be completely degraded by the hydrated electron reduction alone except for hdcas 6 kinds of short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas also be detected and their concentration evolutions are depicted in fig 4 compared with the reduction alone three coupled processes all improved the yield of c2 c7 short chain pfcas fig 3a f indicating the hdcas produced by hydrated electron reduction were converted to the c2 c7 short chain pfcas during the post oxidation process the c2 c7 short chain pfcas are known to be more susceptible to degradation than pfoa during oxidation40 previous studies have also showed that oh could convert fluorotelomer carboxylates cnf2n 1 ch2ch2 coo one of hdcas to the mixture of various short chain pfcas cnf2n 1 coo along with the cleavage of cf bonds 48 50 51 this observation indicates that the hdcas generated in the reduction stage could be converted into short chain pfcas by a subsequent oxidation stage for further defluorination and mineralization 3 3 proposing the possible degradation pathways of pfoa in coupled process during reduction stage pfoa mainly undergoes chain shorting pathway fig 5 i ii with the formation of c2 c7 short chain pfcas h f exchange pathway fig 5 iii iv v with the formation of hdcas as well as side reaction pathway fig 5 vi with the formation of perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas during the subsequent oxidation stage c2 c7 short chain pfcas are further degraded by undergoing direct electron transfer det kolbe decarboxylation kd oh addition thermal decomposition td and oh addition degradation pathway 12 52 to form shorter chain pfcas cnf2n 1 to cn 1f2 n 1 1 with the defluorination and mineralization fig 5 vii hdcas would like to be transformed into carbon pfcas by undergoing substitution of hydrogen atoms by oh and elimination then the formed keto acids undergo det kd to produce cnf2n 1 radical and go back to pathway vii pathway viii ix x observed in this study are slightly different with literature reports that hdcas undergo a one step reaction with the cleavage of the partially hydrodefluorinated group in advanced oxidation processes 48 considering subsequent oxidation stage in our case is electrochemical advanced oxidation processes there is a possibility of electron transfer from the degradation products to the anode with the production of ketoacids and further be degraded to cnf2n 1 radical 53 pfsas give one electron to the anode to form cnf2n 1so3 radical which then form cnf2n 1 radical by desulfonation to go back to pathway vii what should be noted is there is still another possible degradation pathway for cnf2n 1 radical to co2 as shown in fig 5 xii and verified by zhuo et al 54 through o18 isotope labeling method in our opinion both pathway vii and pathway xii are concurrent because c2 to c7 are indeed detected but at a low concentration fig 4 in addition neither pathway vii nor pathway xii has an essential influence on our overall degradation pathway proposal because both of them start with the degradation of cnf2n 1 radical as for the conversion of unsaturated hdcas fig s10 in subsequent oxidation stage unsaturated bonds would like to be oxidized by oh 55 to convert hdcas to pfcas with a shorter carbon chain that were finally degraded 3 4 the mass balance of sulfur carbon and fluorine during the red oxi 3 processes the residual sulfite after hydrated electron reduction is toxic for environment so it is necessary to check its fate during the red oxi 3 process the residual sulfite could be completely oxidized to sulfate at the beginning of subsequent oxidation stage fig 6a mass balance of carbon fig 6b during the red oxi 3 process is more reasonable compared with the single oxidation process where the total carbon excess the theoretical maximum due to the over estimation of the vfas fig 2a the column at 30 min and 120 min the other products accounts for 15 in carbon balance and 8 in fluorine balance after 11 h treatment in red oxi 3 process which also indicates the other products may be partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas after 15 h treatment in red oxi 3 process other products accounts for 0 in carbon and fluorine balance indicating complete defluorination and mineralization are achieved 3 5 environmental implication since pfoa can be considered as one of the most refractory organic pollutants the coupled process designed by this study should be also applicable to the degradation of other recalcitrant organic wastewaters such as halogenated organic wastewaters that are resistant to traditional aops and biodegradation processes the energy consumption fig s12 for red oxi 3 0 146 kw h is higher than single oxidation 0 063 kw h but much lower than single reduction 0 42 kw h considering the complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa achieved by red oxi 3 a slight increase in energy consumption over the single oxidation is acceptable taking account into the feasibility of practical application uv sulfite pre reduction and bdd electrochemical post oxidation should be investigated in realistic streams for example the chloride presented in wastewater may readily be converted to perchlorate during the electrochemical oxidation process the impact of perchlorate on the formation of others byproducts needs to be further evaluated despite an addition of hydrogen peroxide could effectively inhibit the perchlorate formation without compromising the degradation efficiency of pfoa 56 the concentration of pfoa in realistic streams is various coupled process should also be investigated in wastewater with low concentration of pfoa or concentrated pfoa such as that in filterate of membrane treatment 4 conclusions the complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa are achieved by coupling hydrated electron reduction pre treatment with electrochemical oxidation post treatment comparing to hydrated electron reduction alone the coupled process could completely mineralize pfoa and convert the residual toxic sulfite to sulfate comparing to the electrochemical oxidation alone the coupled process could obtain a higher defluorination efficiency and inhibit the formation of toxic volatile fluorinated alkanes the degradation mechanism demonstrates that the post oxidation is able to transform partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids and perfluorosulfonic acids formed by pre reduction to the perfluorocarboxylic acids with shorter carbon chain than pfoa which can be easily defluorinated and mineralized by the oxidation this study provides a novel strategy on the complete degradation of pfoa and other pfass by designing a coupled system declaration of competing interest

technology shenzhen 518055 china corresponding author hydrated electron reduction in an ultraviolet uv sulfite system and electrochemical oxidation on a boron doped diamond bdd anode both are efficient processes for the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa however hydrated electron reduction has inherent deficiency in the mineralization i e converting organic carbon into co2 of pfoa furthermore toxic byproducts such as partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas might give secondary pollution if the wholly hydrodefluorination of pfoa is not achieved bdd electrochemical oxidation can obtain a high mineralization efficiency but it leads to a low defluorination i e transforming c f bonds into f ions efficiency due to the generation of toxic volatile fluorinated alkanes herein we report a coupled process that is hydrated electron reduction as pre treatment and bdd electrochemical oxidation as post treatment to achieve a complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa the results demonstrate that 50 mg l pfoa can be 100 deluorinated and mineralized under 5 h uv sulfite reduction followed by 10 h electrochemical oxidation this coupled process strongly inhibits the production of the toxic volatile fluorinated pollutants and quickly converts the residual toxic sulfite in uv sulfite system to the sulfate mechanism investigation demonstrates that bdd oxidation is able to transform hdcas and pfsas formed by hydrated electron reduction to the perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas with shorter carbon chain than pfoa which can be further defluorinated and mineralized graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfoa complete defluorination complete mineralization hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids

polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass cnf2n 1 r has been widely used to produce many industrial products such as refrigerant flame retardant and polymer 1 owing to their excellent thermal chemical stability and surface activity 2 the widespread utilization and weak governance of pfoa have led to this compound detected in various environments such as air soil waterbody and living organisms 3 4 numerous proofs have showed that pfoa are hepatotoxic genotoxic neurotoxic reproductive toxic to animals and humans 5 6 since the hydrogen atoms on the carbon chain of pfoa are all replaced by fluorine atoms and the cf bond formed has an extremely high bond energy 451 485 kj mol to resist to normally chemical and biological degradation pfoa is also called as forever chemical 7 so far no effective natural attenuation of pfoa has been found and conventional methods for removal of persistent pollutants can only achieve partial degradation under specific and harsh conditions 8 10 therefore seeking an efficient and complete pfoa degradation strategy is attracting more and more attentions at present the researches on the pfoa degradation mainly focus on electrochemical oxidation 11 14 chemical reduction 15 17 adsorption 18 filtration 19 thermal decomposition 20 23 and biodegradation 24 25 etc conventional chemical oxidation such as advanced oxidation processes aops that utilize strong oxidizing radicals e g hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 oxidation potentials of 2 33 3 1 v nhe 26 27 to degrade organic pollutants are ineffective on the degradation of pfoa due to their insufficient capability to break cf bond 28 electrochemical oxidation using anodes with high overpotential of oxygen evolution such as bdd ti4o7 pbo2 and dimensionally stable anode dsa 29 31 exhibits an excellent mineralization of pfoa where the pfoa first loses an electron on the anode to form pfoa radical that can be further oxidized by oh formed by anodic reaction 12 32 33 however electrochemical approach requires high electricity input and is challenged by the low defluorination efficiency due to generation of volatile fluorinated products 13 reductive dehalogenation technology is often used to improve the biodegradability of persistent organic pollutants and to facilitate their subsequent biodegradation 34 pfoa is a kind of halogenated compound but the reduction potential of conventional reducing agents is not enough to defluorinate 35 hydrated electron eaq consists of one electron and six water molecules with a high reducing capability reduction potential e0 2 9 v rhe 36 and has been used in the reduction of pfoa to achieve a high defluorination rate and efficiency however the mineralization efficiency of pfoa reduction by eaq is low due to generation of organic byproducts such as hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas that give another environment pollution 15 16 37 39 adsorption and filtration technologies can effectively remove pfoa but they only transfer pfoa between different phases without achieving complete degradation 40 41 thermal decomposition of pfoa is an energy intensive process and a scale up would be more challenged 20 biodegradation exhibits unsatisfactory performance on pfoa degradation due to extremely low defluorination rate and efficiency 42 43 in summary single technology has various defects and is still far from practical applications previous studies have investigated coupled processes such as ion exchange resin coupled with electrochemical oxidation 44 electrochemical sorption coupled with hydrated electron reduction 45 and aops coupled with hydrated electron reduction 46 for the pfass degradation but most of them prefer to pursue a high efficient defluorination rather than a complete degradation defluorination and mineralization efficiency both close to 100 however complete defluorination and mineralization of pfass is necessary to avoid the second pollution and post treatment in this work the feasibility of hydrated electron reduction coupled with electrochemical oxidation to achieve a complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa is investigated the hydrated electron reduction in an uv sulfite system and electrochemical oxidation by a bdd electrode are thoroughly compared to ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of each process for pfoa degradation then an coupled process involving reduction as pre treatment and oxidation as post treatment are developed to obtain a near complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa the optimal reaction conditions and mechanisms for thorough pfoa degradation in this coupled process are investigated 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this experiment such as perfluoro octanoic acid pfoa c8

electron reduction system uv sulfite process is selected as an efficient approach to generate hydrated electron for pfoa reduction this system has another advantage is that the residual sulfite can serve as a good electrolyte in subsequent electrochemical oxidation where it will be oxidized to low harmful sulfate 47 effect of different reaction conditions for pfoa degradation in uv sulfite

processes were provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrated electron reduction coupled with bdd electrochemical oxidation for pfoa complete degradation hydrated electron reduction shows highly efficient pfoa degradation 100 removal within 0 5 h while electrochemical oxidation needs 7 5 h to reach a complete removal fig 1a hydrated electron reduction or electrochemical oxidation alone could not achieve a complete pfoa defluorination during 15 h reaction in contrast three coupled processes of red oxi 1 red oxi 2 and red oxi 3 all exhibit an enhancement in defluorination especially for red oxi 3 reaches a near complete defluorination within 14 h a complete defluorination is one of the major goals pursued by pfoa degradation since incomplete defluorination might accompany with the formation of fluorinated organic products that exhibit a more recalcitrant 48 and toxic 49 to the environment these inspiring results indicate that pre reduction coupled with post oxidation might be a promising approach for pfoa complete degradation and drives us to explore deeper into this process the pfoa mineralization mainly occurred in oxidation stage of each process and can achieve a complete mineralization within 15 h except a single reduction process red with the negligible mineralization efficiency fig 1c what should be noted is that although single electrochemical oxidation oxi leads to the highest mineralization rate mineralization efficiency calculated here is based on the change in solution toc and excludes the toxic volatile fluorinated alkanes vfas generated and detected during oxi process thus its mineralization efficiency is overestimated to further investigate this interesting finding of vfas production and its influence the vfas were identified by the gc ms as well as the mass balance of carbon and fluorine was analyzed fig 2 the gc ms results demonstrate that three vfas including chf3 c2f6 and c9f20 are detected in the gas phase niu et al have proposed a hypothesis that vfas might generate in electrochemical oxidation of pfass but they did not specifically verify it 13 the carbon balance shows that the most of organic carbon in pfoa solution was removed during electrochemical oxidation while the fluorine balance shows that a significant proportion of fluorine is embedded in unknown byproducts named as other products which are most likely vfas that volatilize into the gas phase or may escape detection this explains that why the defluorination efficiency is far behind the mineralization efficiency in single electrochemical oxidation even at different current densities fig 2c d and different initial concentration of pfoa fig s9 on the contrast few vfas were detected in coupled processes which leads to high defluorination efficiencies fig 1b indicating their high mineralization efficiencies obtained here are real fig 1c especially for red oxi 3 it gives the both complete defluorination and mineralization these results support that oxidation followed with reduction may suppress vfas production to decompose the most of c f bonds into f ions and co2 3 2 the transformation of reduction products during oxidation post treatment to deeply explore why the red oxi 3 system could achieve the pfoa complete defluorination and mineralization meanwhile suppress the generation of vfas the transformation of reduction products by oxidation post treatment are investigated in detail the exploration begins with the identification of partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas generated during hydrated electron reduction the lc ms ms results demonstrate 27 kinds of hdcas are detected detail information are summarized in table s4 the concentration of hdcas decreased to zero during the post oxidation fig 3 in contrast hdcas cannot be completely degraded by the hydrated electron reduction alone except for hdcas 6 kinds of short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas also be detected and their concentration evolutions are depicted in fig 4 compared with the reduction alone three coupled processes all improved the yield of c2 c7 short chain pfcas fig 3a f indicating the hdcas produced by hydrated electron reduction were converted to the c2 c7 short chain pfcas during the post oxidation process the c2 c7 short chain pfcas are known to be more susceptible to degradation than pfoa during oxidation40 previous studies have also showed that oh could convert fluorotelomer carboxylates cnf2n 1 ch2ch2 coo one of hdcas to the mixture of various short chain pfcas cnf2n 1 coo along with the cleavage of cf bonds 48 50 51 this observation indicates that the hdcas generated in the reduction stage could be converted into short chain pfcas by a subsequent oxidation stage for further defluorination and mineralization 3 3 proposing the possible degradation pathways of pfoa in coupled process during reduction stage pfoa mainly undergoes chain shorting pathway fig 5 i ii with the formation of c2 c7 short chain pfcas h f exchange pathway fig 5 iii iv v with the formation of hdcas as well as side reaction pathway fig 5 vi with the formation of perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas during the subsequent oxidation stage c2 c7 short chain pfcas are further degraded by undergoing direct electron transfer det kolbe decarboxylation kd oh addition thermal decomposition td and oh addition degradation pathway 12 52 to form shorter chain pfcas cnf2n 1 to cn 1f2 n 1 1 with the defluorination and mineralization fig 5 vii hdcas would like to be transformed into carbon pfcas by undergoing substitution of hydrogen atoms by oh and elimination then the formed keto acids undergo det kd to produce cnf2n 1 radical and go back to pathway vii pathway viii ix x observed in this study are slightly different with literature reports that hdcas undergo a one step reaction with the cleavage of the partially hydrodefluorinated group in advanced oxidation processes 48 considering subsequent oxidation stage in our case is electrochemical advanced oxidation processes there is a possibility of electron transfer from the degradation products to the anode with the production of ketoacids and further be degraded to cnf2n 1 radical 53 pfsas give one electron to the anode to form cnf2n 1so3 radical which then form cnf2n 1 radical by desulfonation to go back to pathway vii what should be noted is there is still another possible degradation pathway for cnf2n 1 radical to co2 as shown in fig 5 xii and verified by zhuo et al 54 through o18 isotope labeling method in our opinion both pathway vii and pathway xii are concurrent because c2 to c7 are indeed detected but at a low concentration fig 4 in addition neither pathway vii nor pathway xii has an essential influence on our overall degradation pathway proposal because both of them start with the degradation of cnf2n 1 radical as for the conversion of unsaturated hdcas fig s10 in subsequent oxidation stage unsaturated bonds would like to be oxidized by oh 55 to convert hdcas to pfcas with a shorter carbon chain that were finally degraded 3 4 the mass balance of sulfur carbon and fluorine during the red oxi 3 processes the residual sulfite after hydrated electron reduction is toxic for environment so it is necessary to check its fate during the red oxi 3 process the residual sulfite could be completely oxidized to sulfate at the beginning of subsequent oxidation stage fig 6a mass balance of carbon fig 6b during the red oxi 3 process is more reasonable compared with the single oxidation process where the total carbon excess the theoretical maximum due to the over estimation of the vfas fig 2a the column at 30 min and 120 min the other products accounts for 15 in carbon balance and 8 in fluorine balance after 11 h treatment in red oxi 3 process which also indicates the other products may be partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids hdcas after 15 h treatment in red oxi 3 process other products accounts for 0 in carbon and fluorine balance indicating complete defluorination and mineralization are achieved 3 5 environmental implication since pfoa can be considered as one of the most refractory organic pollutants the coupled process designed by this study should be also applicable to the degradation of other recalcitrant organic wastewaters such as halogenated organic wastewaters that are resistant to traditional aops and biodegradation processes the energy consumption fig s12 for red oxi 3 0 146 kw h is higher than single oxidation 0 063 kw h but much lower than single reduction 0 42 kw h considering the complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa achieved by red oxi 3 a slight increase in energy consumption over the single oxidation is acceptable taking account into the feasibility of practical application uv sulfite pre reduction and bdd electrochemical post oxidation should be investigated in realistic streams for example the chloride presented in wastewater may readily be converted to perchlorate during the electrochemical oxidation process the impact of perchlorate on the formation of others byproducts needs to be further evaluated despite an addition of hydrogen peroxide could effectively inhibit the perchlorate formation without compromising the degradation efficiency of pfoa 56 the concentration of pfoa in realistic streams is various coupled process should also be investigated in wastewater with low concentration of pfoa or concentrated pfoa such as that in filterate of membrane treatment 4 conclusions the complete defluorination and mineralization of pfoa are achieved by coupling hydrated electron reduction pre treatment with electrochemical oxidation post treatment comparing to hydrated electron reduction alone the coupled process could completely mineralize pfoa and convert the residual toxic sulfite to sulfate comparing to the electrochemical oxidation alone the coupled process could obtain a higher defluorination efficiency and inhibit the formation of toxic volatile fluorinated alkanes the degradation mechanism demonstrates that the post oxidation is able to transform partially hydrodefluorinated carboxylic acids and perfluorosulfonic acids formed by pre reduction to the perfluorocarboxylic acids with shorter carbon chain than pfoa which can be easily defluorinated and mineralized by the oxidation this study provides a novel strategy on the complete degradation of pfoa and other pfass by designing a coupled system declaration of competing interest

12497,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o could be recovered from wastewater containing phosphorus and showed high potential as an alternative source of phosphorus fertilizer a comparison of batch experiment and continuous crystallization processes was carried out using batch reactor and fluidized bed reactor fbr methods respectively the continuous crystallization processes for phosphorus granulation were conducted both in a seeded fbc and unseeded fbhc system various seed materials such as dolomite camg co3 2 cahpo4 and sio2 were applied as seed material in fbc in the batch reactor the operating parameters including ph mg 0 p 0 molar ratio and initial phosphorus concentration were first optimized the effects of the coexisting ions so4 2 cl no3 na k ca2 and organic pollutants ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and citric acid on phosphorus containing wastewater treatment were also examined the hydraulic parameters of fbr fluidized bed reactor including effluent phe and cross sectional surface loading l kg m 2 h 1 were investigated to recover phosphorus and ammonium as struvite pellets under optimum conditions phe 8 8 mg 0 p 0 1 3 1 l 2 4 kg p m 2 h 1 fbc using dolomite as seed resulted in higher phosphorus removal efficiency than the fbhc system with total removal tr 93 0 and a crystallization ratio cr 85 0 as confirmed by the xrd pattern the solid products consist of magnesium ammonium phosphate mgnh4po4 6h2o from both fbc and fbhc processes the high crystallization ratio cr 85 and the recovery of crystal pellets 1 mm in the fbc process reduce the production of sludge compared to traditional chemical precipitation and fbhc processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords struvite precipitation phosphorus recovery wastewater treatment fluidized bed reactor data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction phosphorus is naturally circulated on the earth via phosphate rock leaching sedimentation biological consumption and biological wastes 1 anthropogenic activities have significantly affected the natural cycle of phosphorus 2 excessive phosphorus mobilization into natural water bodies via industrial and municipal wastewater causes serious ecological problems that lead to eutrophication 3 inorganic phosphate ions as the primary forms of p in water can be as high as 19 445 mg l in dairy wastewater 4 5 100 453 mg l in swine wastewater 6 7 20 328 mg l in urine 8 9 and 3240 9937 mg l in anodized wastewater 10 on the other hand the consumption of phosphate rock is getting higher up to 44 5 million tonnes in 2016 worldwide 11 removing phosphate from agricultural and livestock wastewater followed by applying the by product back to the agricultural activity as active fertilizer offers a significant impact on resource recovery and circular economy struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate map mgnh4po4 6h2o is one of the phosphate based fertilizers that become the commonly recycled product in the phosphate removal system ryu and lee 12 observed that the application of struvite resulted in less bioaccumulation of hg pb cr and ni in vegetable tissue than in commercial fertilizers the struvite precipitation is determined by the chemical equilibrium of the proper ratio of mg n p ranging from 1 0 2 0 1 1 13 15 subsequent separation of the generated struvite precipitate from the bulk liquid is also a key process in the recovery of phosphorus conventional chemical precipitation is an attractive treatment to recover phosphorus as struvite owing to its advantages such as producing high quality by products with a relatively high recovery rate and minimum environmental impact 16 17 however this treatment process produces a huge amount of sludge which requires additional sedimentation tanks due to the low physical separation efficiency to collect struvite product 18 moreover a further sludge drying process is also needed due to the production of sludge with high moisture content as compared to conventional precipitation methods fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization fbhc produces higher separability pure particles and faster settling times 19 granulated particles can be produced by controlling the hydraulic parameters of the fbhc thus reducing the production of wet slurry 20 the core shell structure of fbhc pellet product indicated there are 2 phases in the particle formation process the agglomerated primary crystal as a core structure plays a role as seeds that are formed as the system enters the heterogeneous nucleation zone meanwhile the more rigid coating structure is formed as the system enters a metastable zone these two different conditions for the seed formation and particle growth process become the drawbacks of the fbhc system due to the operation difficulty 21 a seeded fbc system could be proposed to solve the disadvantages of the granule production of the fbhc system early in collisions the additional seeds serve as active surfaces and centers of collision effective for accumulating fine nuclei and promoting crystal growth 22 furthermore the suitable additional seeds could enhance the removal efficiency of the target pollutant significantly the author s earlier work verified that the fbc surpassed fbhc in effectiveness for removing phosphorus from an aqueous solution by the recovery of calcium phosphate crystals 23 in this study the recovery of phosphorus as granulated struvite via a fluidized bed reactor was proposed a set of the batch experiment via the jar test method was also preceding experimented to determine the equilibrium condition of struvite formation the continuous system was also tested under a fluidized bed reactor fbr process to produce the low moisture struvite crystal pellets synthetic wastewater of 400 mg p l which simulated a typical concentration of phosphorus in the discharge of animal wastewater was treated as the model wastewater to rectify the potential drawback of the fbr system the system was operated under both seeded and unseeded processes named fluidized bed crystallization fbc and fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization fbhc respectively three different seeds including dolomite camg co3 2 sio2 and cahpo4 were introduced into the fbc system because of their environmentally friendly properties various parameters including ph molar ratio of mg to p mg 0 p 0 p inlet concentration and coexisting ions were tested to obtain the optimum struvite crystallization efficiency the performance of fbc and fbhc was then compared and evaluated under similar conditions

optimized a mechanical stirrer from hung yao instrument co was applied to agitate the solution at two different speeds to facilitate floc formation 150 rpm was applied for 10 min to ensure complete mixing of the reactants followed by 30 rpm for 50 min dropwise ph adjustments were made every 2 min using hcl and naoh 0 1 m solutions at the end of the process the concentrations of nh4 n total phosphorus tp and mg2 were measured hcl 35 was used to dissolved the solid product sample the fraction of a specific elements such as n mg p in the solid product was calculated by measuring the concentration of a related compound in the digested solution of the solid product as presented in eq 1 1 fraction in solid c d v 0 m 0 100 where m0 v0 represents the initial sample weight mg and used volume of hcl in l and cd represents the measured concentration in mg l 1 by using the assumption that ammonium would only precipitate as struvite the struvite purity can be calculated 25 26 as shown in eq 2 below 2 struvite purity mass n in solid 14 245 purity of struvite is determined by the percent mass of nitrogen in a precipitate as calculated by eq 1 molecular masses of mgnh4po4 6h2o and n are 245 and 14 g mol 1 respectively 2 2 2 fluidized bed reactor the laboratory scale of the fbc and fbhc systems has been experimented with in a 350 ml of cylindrical pyrex reactor the reactor was built as a vertical column with 100 cm height and 2 5 cm in diameter the recycle point was placed at 90 cm from the bottom of the reactor and 5 cm below the effluent point three 3 inlet at the bottom

provide a surface to enhance the heterogeneous crystallization process fbhc fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization applies the unseeded crystallization process to fluidized beds a 5 ml min pumping of the target pollutant p solution is required to homogenize seed material in the fbhc system meanwhile the precipitant that consists of ammonium and magnesium mixture 8 4 mm and 6 45 mm respectively were also pumped at 5 ml min into the fbr reactor and reached a molar ratio mg 0 p 0 n 0 of 1 3 1 1 in the mixing point the recirculation stream was maintained at 50 ml min as the seed particles were stable enough the condition was changed to stimulate the growth of the generated particles the inlet concentration was doubled and followed by the increase of inlet concentration to 50 ml min a 150 ml min recirculation stream is then used to maintain a constant up flow velocity of 30 m h and reduce supersaturation by adjusting the ph at the reactant tank the effluent ph was maintained at 9 0 during both the seed formation and particle growth steps in the fbhc system the reactor top was sampled at the reflux point 5 cm below the outlet after 25 hydraulic retention time hrt cycles approximately 87 5 min 1 hrt 3 5 min as the system reached steady state in order to determine the soluble phosphorus concentration in the effluent a sample was filtered through a 0 45 m filter to determine the total

ratio cr could be determined using eqs 3 4 3 tr 1 p s q t p 0 q p 100 4 cr 1 p t q t p 0 q p 100 the phosphorus concentrations at the inlet was named as p 0 meanwhile p s represents the dissolved residual phosphorus concentration in effluent point after filtration and p t represents the total effluent phosphorus levels without filtration that determines both of dissolved residual phosphorus and digested phosphorus concentration from the sludge that was washed out from the reactor the experimental parameters of the fbr reactors are listed in table s1 tr refers to the total amount of related compounds that can be precipitates by the process whereas cr refers to the amount of phosphorus that exists as larger recoverable crystals 27 an optimum operating condition is defined as the experimental parameter value resulting in the highest cr value low cr value followed by high tr value indicates a significant amount of undesired sludge has formed in the system 2 3 analytical methods

to detect the functional groups of solids 3 result and discussions 3 1 phosphorus removal in a batch reactor 3 1 1 effect of ph the effect of different ph on the recovery of ammonium magnesium and phosphorus is shown in fig 1 the initial molar ratio of mg 0 n 0 p 0 was set at 1 1 1 since ph was known to be decreased during struvite precipitation which affected the precipitation efficiency ph was controlled at the desired value during the operation at ph 8 0 10 0 the phosphorus removal efficiency was around 83 7 94 9 indicating that ph had a strong effect on the phosphate recovery fig 1a however the recovery efficiency of ammonium was dropped as ph increased to 10 with ammonium removal efficiency of 69 4 it is consistent with the low nitrogen composition in the solid product at ph 10 which is shown in fig 1b at ph 10 nitrogen volatilizes from an aqueous solution in the form of gaseous nh3 due to its equilibrium state and reduces struvite crystallization the pka of ammonium ammonia is 9 3 causes the ammonium nitrogen can be easily transferred from a liquid to dissolved ammonia gas by following eq 5 5 nh 4 oh h 2 o nh 3 g by increasing ph value to the alkaline area the equilibrium relation of nh4 nh3 in the aqueous solution is shifted to the right as nitrogen was significantly removed by volatilization mg3 po4 2 was predominantly precipitated followed by the decreasing of nh4 n removal efficiency 28 consistent with the previous research that struvite is hard to precipitate under extremely alkaline conditions and favorably optimized under a ph of 8 9 29 30 the recovery of phosphorus and ammonium via struvite precipitation could reach the optimal value at ph 9 0 corresponding to 90 6 of struvite purity fig 1b hao et al reported that the struvite purity at a high ph level 9 5 was below 30 31 that is consistent to this study with 11 2 of struvite purity at ph 10 0 at ph higher than 10 struvite crystallization is possibly inhibited by the formation of mg3 po4 2 and mg oh 2 precipitates similarly as reported by karmegam et al the formation of magnesium phosphate appeared to inhibit struvite formation at ph 9 5 32 ph 9 0 then considered as the optimum ph value and to be applied in further experiments the xrd pattern that is shown in fig 1c indicated that the crystal products are predominated by struvite compound at ph 8 0 9 5 fit with the standard jcpds 15 0762 however at ph 10 0 the solid crystallinity decreases by the possibility of mg3 po4 2 formation related to the low nitrogen composition in a solid product the solubility curve of possible species is depicted in fig 1d by considering the magnesium speciations in the system to give a clear overview of the formation of struvite magnesium phosphate and magnesium hydroxide speciation of magnesium ions as a result of phosphate species complexation and hydrolysis in water can be explained as follows 6 mg 2 h 2 o mgoh h k 1 mgoh h mg 2 10 11 4 7 mg 2 po 4 3 mgpo 4 k f 1 mgpo 4 mg 2 po 4 3 10 3 13 8 mg 2 po 4 3 h mghpo 4 k f 2 mghpo 4 0 mg 2 po 4 3 h 10 14 24 9 mg 2 po 4 3 2 h mgh 2 po 4 k f 3 mgh 2 po 4 mg 2 po 4 3 h 2 10 21 01 based on eqs 6 9 the total magnesium could be determined by the summary of these species 10 mg total mg 2 mgoh mgpo 4 mghpo 4 0 mgh 2 po 4 the magnesium precipitants that happened in solution under the existence of phosphate and ammonium species could be four major forms including mgnh4po4 6h2o mghpo4 mg3 po4 2 and mg oh 2 eqs 11 14 a ph regulated competition occurs between these reactions 11 mgn h 4 p o 4 s mg 2 n h 4 p o 4 3 k sp 10

po4 2 and mg oh 2 solubility can be established fig 1d conventionally solubility curves are plotted either as precipitation from supersaturated solutions at equilibrium or as crystals dissolve in undersaturated solutions at equilibrium 33 fig 1d showed that the composition of the produced precipitates mainly depended on the ph condition the predominant mg precipitates changed from pure mgnh4po4 6h2o to mg3 po4 2 mgnh4po4 6h2o mixture at ph above 8 5 as plotted in the magnesium effluent concentration with the solubility curve of magnesium species the solid product at ph 9 0 is a mixture of mgnh4po4 6h2o and mg3 po4 2 mg oh 2 and mghpo4 are easier to dissociate than other magnesium compounds leading to the inexistence of this precipitate under a ph of 10 3 1 2 effect of mg 0 p 0 molar ratio and input p concentration the p harvesting efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the mg2 dosage to increase the degree of supersaturation in the struvite system as the mg 0 p 0 dosing ratio was raised to 1 3 at an initial p concentration of 400 mg l p removal efficiency can be enhanced to 95 2 fig 2a a study conducted by kim et al determined that the ideal mg 0 n 0 p 0 ratio should be 1 2 1 0 1 0 during full scale application the mg 0 p 0 ratio should be 1 3 1 34 according to the solubility curve when the po4 3 concentration is constant the po4 3 removal efficiency will be enhanced by increasing the mg concentration and creating a higher mg 0 p 0 molar ratio a previous study found similar results 34 however this was not beneficial for the removal of mg2 and nh4 n as the mg 0 p 0 molar ratio was higher than 1 3 the nitrogen removal efficiency declined because some p was consumed during the formation of mg3 po4 2 predicted solubility curves of struvite under different mg dosages were presented in fig 2c showing the low potential formation of struvite when the mg 0 p 0 molar ratio of 0 6 as illustrated in fig 2b the p recovery efficiency reaches up to 95 2 at an mg 0 p 0 dosing ratio of 1 3 in the real case the phosphate concentration may be varied at different times thus the effect of initial p concentration on p harvesting behavior was investigated various po4 3 concentrations from 2 2 to 25 mm 69 to 775 mg p l were introduced to investigate the adaptability of the system under different po4 3 concentrations the po4 3 removal efficiency increased as phosphorus concentration increased from 2 2 to 25 mmol l explained by the increase of supersaturation condition as the struvite solubility remains the same the phosphate concentration is following the equilibrium concentration resulting in the higher consumption of dissolved phosphate that leads to higher phosphorus removal efficiency the theoretical line of struvite drawn based on the different initial p concentrations shows the high potential of struvite formation reaching 25 mmol l confirming this conclusion fig 2d 3 1 3 effect of co existing ions real wastewater may contain various compounds besides phosphorus as the main pollutant different ions in wastewater streams may affect the removal efficiency of targeted pollutants the influence of co existing ions na ca2 k no3 so4 2 and cl and chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and citric acid were tested at two concentration levels ions 0 p 0 molar ratios of 2 5 and 5 0 as shown in fig 3a phosphorus removal is not significantly affected under the presence of chloride sodium and nitrate at ions 0 p 0 molar ratios of 2 5 and 5 meanwhile the presence of ca2 as a common co existing ion in wastewater enhances the p removal from 95 2 to 99 6 the higher p removal is explained by the co precipitation of canh4po4 7h2o ca3 po4 2 and cahpo4 with struvite ca3 po4 2 could be dominant in the cap system because cahpo4 and canh4po4 7h2o could be suppressed due to their unstable forms 35 36 the higher solubility line of ca3 po4 2 compared to struvite presented in fig 3c confirms the high potential for the formation of cap compounds compared to others in the system which can inhibit the struvite precipitation 37 and decrease the struvite purity 38 it was reported that n removal efficiency drops from 90 6 to 22 9 at a ca2 po4 3 molar ratio of 2 5 1 potassium k presence slightly disturbing the formation of desired n struvite while the phosphorus removal remained unchanged due to the formation of co precipitated mgkpo4 6h2o k struvite with mgnh 4 po4 6h2o n struvite the pksp of n struvite was 13 16 39 whereas that of k struvite was 11 7 18 indicating that k struvite is more soluble than n struvite the presence of k in the solution could cease the struvite formation explained by the near solubility line of k struvite in comparison to n struvite fig 3c the presence of so4 is proved to affect the formation of struvite at so4 2 0 p 0 5 where the removal efficiency of both p and n was reduced it was reported that high sulfate concentration in a solution would extend the induction time of struvite precipitation 40 therefore longer reaction time is required to reach the equilibrium state for struvite formation in the presence of potassium 15 mgk po 4 s mg 2 k po 4 3 k sp 10 11 7 the chelating agents such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and citric acid cause an inhibitory effect of mg on struvite crystallization due to the formation of a highly soluble complex of mg citric and mg edta 41 citric acid and edta significantly reduced phosphorus removal efficiency and reached 0 removals at the molar ratio organic 0 p 0 2 5 the equilibrium constant of the magnesium complexes of edta and citric acid formation were presented in eqs 16 19 42 43 16 mg 2 edta mg edta 2 k c1 10 8 69 17 mg 2 h 2 cit mgh 2 cit k c2 10 0 6 18 mg 2 hcit 2 mghcit k c3 10 1 78 19 mg 2 cit 3

descending order edta citric acid ca2 k so4 2 cl no3 na cl 3 1 4 precipitate characterization after the reaction precipitates were characterized by sem eds ft ir and xrd a sem image in fig 4a indicated that the precipitates were populated with some rectangular orthorhombic crystals the energy dispersive spectrometer spectrum eds analysis shows the atomic ratio of mg n p o 1 0 6 0 8 8 4 fig 4b the theoretical value of struvite for mg n p o is 1 1 1 10 the deviation is caused by another possible precipitate form such as mg3 po4 2 or adsorbed compound of mg n p and o onto the existed particle surface eds mapping confirmed the appearance of mg p n and o the infrared spectra from ft ir analysis of struvite precipitate and struvite biochar precipitate were shown in fig 4c the obvious po4 3 p characteristic absorption peaks appeared at wave numbers of between 560 and 600 cm 1 960 cm 1 44 and at 1000 1100 cm 1 45 the deformation vibration of nh4 also appeared at wave number 1435 3 cm 1 46 confirming that struvite existed in precipitates the xrd patterns fig 4d showed that the crystalline precipitates consist of a struvite structure which is fitted by the struvite standard from jcpds 15 0762 based on the results and characterization mentioned above it can be confirmed that struvite is the main product in operating conditions at ph 9 0 and mg 0 p 0 n 0 1 3 1 1 however struvite precipitate as a sludge that has a small particle size and high water content a sedimentation tank is needed to collect the sludge high energy is also needed to dry the sludge and become the applicable solid 3 2 phosphorus removal in a fluidized bed reactor 3 2 1 particle synthesis in fluidized bed reactor two kinds of fbr systems were conducted to produce struvite pellets from synthetic phosphate wastewater the seeded fbr system fbc fluidized bed crystallizer utilized the heterogeneous seeds meanwhile the unseeded fbr named fbhc fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization started without the additional seed in the fbc system the different seed materials of sio2 dolomite camg co3 2 and cahpo4 were introduced the seed was added to the reactor at a static bed height of 30 cm phosphate solution 12 9 mm and the mixture of ammonium and magnesium solution 16 8 mm and 12 9 mm respectively were pumped into the reactor at 50 ml min each the degree of supersaturation was maintained low by using a high recirculation rate at 150 ml min to stimulate the heterogeneous struvite nucleation onto the provided seed using sio2 dolomite and cahpo4 as seed materials the newly formed nuclei deposits onto the seed surface to form bigger pellets namely struvite sio2 struvite dolomite and struvite cahpo4 in the fbhc system the preceding step was needed to produce the homogeneous seed phosphate solution 6 45 mm and the mixture of ammonium and magnesium 8 4 mm and 6 45 mm respectively were pumped into the reactor at the low volumetric rate of 5 ml min a low recycle rate was applied at 50 ml min leading to the low dilution effect in the mixing point and creating the high supersaturation condition the homogeneous new particles that were formed in the high supersaturation condition played a role as seed material after enough amount of sludge was produced the supersaturation condition was reduced by increasing the inlet and recirculation rate to 50 and 150 ml min respectively inlet concentration also doubled to enhance the coating rate of the previously produced seed particles the low degree of supersaturation placed the system in the heterogeneous nucleation and metastable zone due to the low energy in the system that is caused by low supersaturation conditions the new nuclei could only be formed onto the existing surface from the homogeneous seeds that are previously generated this phenomenon leads to the particle growth becoming the bigger pellets namely struvite fbhc the crystal pellets generated were then harvested and dried in the oven at 60 c overnight before further characterization 3 2 2 characterization of fbr particle products the morphology of different fbc pellets was determined using a scanning electron microscope sem fig 5 a c shows that the surface of the silica and dolomite have a smooth and non porous surface after the fbc process the surface of the recovered pellet that is coated by struvite has a rougher surface as shown in the exterior observation of the cross sectional view the coated compound appears flaky and has a triangular cavity similar to pure struvite crystal under the higher magnification of 20 k a similar structure was found in another fbc product as shown in fig 5 pellets made from fbhc contain no heterogeneous seed material as a core the interior textures of fbhc products are greatly different from shells fig 5b in the preceding step crystallites are homogeneously nucleated and aggregated thus forming the granule core the shell structure was formed by the heterogeneous nucleation onto the core surface in the low supersaturation condition of the system the bigger flakes size aggregated and coated onto the existing core surface the fluid shear and surface abrasion created the round shape of the pellets meanwhile the collision between particles initiated the particle squeezing and dewatering in fig 5b less defined aggregates are the result of this phenomenon xrd and raman analysis were conducted with initial seed materials and after coating confirming the formation of struvite at the end of the reaction fig s2 3 2 3 fbc and fbhc comparison the performance of the fbc and fbhc processes was compared after obtaining sufficient pellet quantities and sizes a static particle bed of 30 cm height was prepared in the fbr reactor each reactant of phosphorus 12 9 mm at 50 ml min and the mixed mgn solution were pumped into the fbr reactor at a molar ratio of mg 0 p 0 n 0 1 3 1 1 into the fbr reactor a constant up flow velocity of 30 m h was maintained with a recirculation stream speed of 150 ml min fig 6a b illustrate nitrogen and phosphorus removal in different numbers of hrt the cr and tr values obtained with the addition of dolomite seed achieved the highest phosphorus and nitrogen efficiency cr 60 and tr 91 8 similar tr results could be obtained under the application of cahpo4 seed material however the cr results are significantly lower for both phosphorus and nitrogen removal compared to dolomite seed inactive seeded material such as sio2 only serves as the carrier to the struvite material coated on its surface meanwhile active materials such as dolomite camg co3 2 could absorb phosphorus anion in an aqueous solution as reported by other studies 23 47 the effect of different seeds material including sio2 cahpo4 dolomite struvite and the unseeded system was presented at ph 9 0 showing the highest removal efficiency of both tp and nh4 n reported for dolomite material with 13 5 of p and 8 59 of n removal fig s3 it was reported by ha et al 23 that dolomite seed serves as an adsorbent and precipitant leached ca2 from dolomite for phosphorus removal in the aqueous solution dolomite seed contains the alkali metal me ca mg co3 47 that gives a negative charge on its surface at ph 9 0 explaining the reduction of nh4 n in solution by adsorption the fbhc system shows the lower cr and tr compared to the dolomite seeded system because the crystallization in fbhc system only rely on the initial addition of magnesium precipitant without any additional leached compound from the existed seed however the struvite purity produced by fbhc system is higher than that of dolomite seeded system due to the inexistence of heterogeneous seed material 3 2 4 parameters optimization experiments in these experiments only the struvite dolomite system was tested due to its superior performance to other seed materials based on the previous experiment various hydraulic parameters including ph and cross sectional loading l were tested to investigate the optimal operating conditions 3 2 4 1 effect of ph the ph value of the solution is responsible for the speciation of all compounds that are involved in the system it affects both removal efficiency and struvite purity in the system as shown in fig 7a the value of cr for nitrogen and phosphorus has a maximum value of around 80 at ph 8 8 and then respectively decreases to 70 and 77 at ph 9 the maximum tr of 87 5 for nitrogen removal is obtained at ph 8 8 before slightly dropping to 75 9 as ph increases to 9 0 meanwhile the tr value for phosphorus keeps increasing from 64 9 to 94 8 as ph increase from 7 to 9 it is caused by the formation of another phosphate species under the insufficient amount of nitrogen due to the volatilization of ammonia in high ph that changes the actual molar ratio of mg 0 n 0 p 0 in the system in the high degree of supersaturation with the increasing ph the solute concentration gets closer to the zone of homogeneous nucleation initiating the generation of new nuclei in the bulk solution 48 new clusters formed in the reactor are more easily uplifted by the up flow stream and drained out reducing the crystallization ratio cr the amount of undesired sludge in the effluent stream could be observed from the value gap between tr and cr value the big difference of tr and cr value indicated the high amount of generated sludge washed out in the effluent stream meanwhile the small value gap between tr and cr indicated that the target pollutant is well recovered as a granulated crystal 3 2 4 2 effect of cross sectional loading cross sectional loading is an intrinsic parameter commonly used for scaling up an operation l kg m 2 h 1 the mass loading of p in a reactor per unit of time is defined as the mass of p flowing through the reactor a change in the input p concentration cp adjusted the cross sectional loading l kg m 2 h 1 0 5 4 5 kg m 2 h 1 whereas the total inflow rate qt and reflux rate qr remained constant at 100 ml min qp qmg n 50 ml min and 150 ml min as observed from fig 7b in dolomite seeded system cross sectional loading l of 2 4 kg m 2 h 1 is considered to be the optimum value that is resulting in total phosphorus removal of 93 and a crystallization ratio of higher than 80 when p loading exceeds 2 4 kg m 2 h 1 cr values decrease to 44 1 in the high p loading case homogeneous nucleation was accelerated and excessive small particles were formed 49 as the small particles are light and easily washed out the total p in the effluent stream is increased leading to a low cr in terms of cr the trend of the crystallization ratio of phosphorus and nitrogen was related due to the formation of struvite granules meanwhile the tr remains constant because the soluble phosphorus always follows its equilibrium condition 3 2 5 effect of supersaturation on the crystallization efficiency in the fbr system the sludge formation in the fbr system is highly dependent on the supersaturation in the effluent stream there are two phosphate phases in the effluent stream the soluble phosphate and phosphate based sludge that is washed out from the reactor due to the uplift flow the amount of the sludge product that is represented as ssp could be presented as 22 s sp p sludge p eq p t p s p eq where p t p s and p eq represent the total phosphorus soluble sludge soluble phosphorus and theoretical phosphorus equilibrium in the effluent stream meanwhile the supersaturation condition in the inlet point depends on the mixing phosphorus concentration from the total inlet and recirculation stream that can be calculated as 23 s in q p p in q r p t q r q p q mg n p eq 1 2 p in r p t r 1 p eq 24 ln s in ln 1 2 p in r 1 p eq where p in inlet phosphorus concentration r qr qt qr qmg n qp p eq theoretical concentration of p at equilibrium therefore the potential sludge formation in different inlet conditions could be observed by plotting the si supersaturation index of sludge production and mixing point as plotted in fig 7c the si in the mixing inlet point linearly correlated with the si at the effluent stream with an r square value of 97 the plot shows that initial saturation values play a key role in the effluent values of elements in the discharge wastewater the amount of deposition increases as the degree of supersaturation increases 50 a crystal s growth is inhibited once the supersaturation reaches the homogeneous nucleation zone the use of various technologies for struvite precipitation in the recent papers for phosphorus removal are summarized in table 1 traditional chemical precipitation was the common treatment to promote phosphorus removal from wastewater in early works however conventional precipitation treatment created a large amount of water rich sludge that needed further dewatering as listed in table 1 mgnh4po4 6h2o recycling using the fbr process from this study is an economical and highly feasible method of treatment due to its high removal efficiency and the production of large granule products that are suitable for further use 4 conclusions to recover phosphorus as struvite crystals mgnh4po4 6h2o from wastewater containing phosphorus batch processes and continuous processes using fbr technology were evaluated the performance of various seed materials was conducted for enhancing the crystallization ratio of struvite under the dolomite seeded system the crystallization ratio was enhanced from about 63 to 78 at a ph of 9 0 and mg 0 p 0 ratio 1 3 the capacity of the fbc system was maximized at a cross sectional loading l of 2 4 kg m 2 h 1 and ph 8 8 that was resulting in the crystallization efficiency of 85 with the corresponding total removal efficiency at 93 based on xrd and raman analysis the pellet product was detected as a dolomite seed coated by a struvite shell that has a high potential to be applied as low dissolved fertilizer dolomite can however adversely affect the purity of recovered struvite if used as seed phosphorus can be recovered as granulated pellets in this study by fluidized bed crystallization that are highly separable and have high potential for further use declaration

12497,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o could be recovered from wastewater containing phosphorus and showed high potential as an alternative source of phosphorus fertilizer a comparison of batch experiment and continuous crystallization processes was carried out using batch reactor and fluidized bed reactor fbr methods respectively the continuous crystallization processes for phosphorus granulation were conducted both in a seeded fbc and unseeded fbhc system various seed materials such as dolomite camg co3 2 cahpo4 and sio2 were applied as seed material in fbc in the batch reactor the operating parameters including ph mg 0 p 0 molar ratio and initial phosphorus concentration were first optimized the effects of the coexisting ions so4 2 cl no3 na k ca2 and organic pollutants ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and citric acid on phosphorus containing wastewater treatment were also examined the hydraulic parameters of fbr fluidized bed reactor including effluent phe and

consist of magnesium ammonium phosphate mgnh4po4 6h2o from both fbc and fbhc processes the high crystallization ratio cr 85 and the recovery of crystal pellets 1 mm in the fbc process reduce the production of sludge compared to traditional chemical precipitation and fbhc processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords struvite precipitation phosphorus recovery wastewater treatment fluidized bed reactor data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction phosphorus is naturally circulated on the earth via phosphate rock leaching sedimentation biological consumption and biological wastes 1 anthropogenic activities have significantly affected the natural cycle of phosphorus 2 excessive phosphorus mobilization into natural water bodies via industrial and municipal wastewater causes serious ecological problems that lead to eutrophication 3 inorganic phosphate ions as the primary forms of p in water can be as high as 19 445 mg l in dairy wastewater 4 5 100 453 mg l in swine wastewater 6 7 20 328 mg l in urine 8 9 and 3240 9937 mg l in anodized wastewater 10 on the other hand the consumption of phosphate rock is getting higher up to 44 5 million tonnes in 2016 worldwide 11 removing phosphate from agricultural and livestock wastewater followed by applying the by product back to the agricultural activity as active fertilizer offers a significant impact on resource recovery and circular economy struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate map mgnh4po4 6h2o is one of the phosphate based fertilizers that become the commonly recycled product in the phosphate removal system ryu and lee 12 observed that the application of struvite resulted in less bioaccumulation of hg pb cr and ni in vegetable tissue than in commercial fertilizers the struvite precipitation is determined by the chemical equilibrium of the proper ratio of mg n p ranging from 1 0 2 0 1 1 13 15 subsequent separation of the generated struvite precipitate from the bulk liquid is also a key process in the recovery of phosphorus conventional chemical precipitation is an attractive treatment to recover phosphorus as struvite owing to its advantages such as producing high quality by products with a relatively high recovery rate and minimum environmental impact 16 17 however this treatment process produces a huge amount of sludge which requires additional sedimentation tanks due to the low physical separation efficiency to collect struvite product 18 moreover a further sludge drying process is also needed due to the production of sludge with high moisture content as compared to conventional precipitation methods fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization fbhc produces higher separability pure particles and faster settling times 19 granulated particles can be produced by controlling the hydraulic parameters of the fbhc thus reducing the production of wet slurry 20 the core shell structure of fbhc pellet product indicated there are 2 phases in the particle formation process the agglomerated primary crystal as a core structure plays a role as seeds that are formed as the system enters the heterogeneous nucleation zone meanwhile the more rigid coating structure is formed as the system enters a metastable zone these two different conditions for the seed formation and particle growth process become the drawbacks of the fbhc system due to the operation difficulty 21 a seeded fbc system could be proposed to solve the disadvantages of the granule production of the fbhc system early in collisions the additional seeds serve as active surfaces and centers of collision effective for accumulating fine nuclei and promoting crystal growth 22 furthermore the suitable additional seeds could enhance the removal efficiency of the target pollutant significantly the author s earlier work verified that the fbc surpassed fbhc in effectiveness for removing phosphorus from an aqueous solution by the recovery of calcium phosphate crystals 23 in this study the recovery of phosphorus as granulated struvite via a fluidized bed reactor was proposed a set of the batch experiment via the jar test method was also preceding experimented to determine the equilibrium condition of struvite formation the continuous system was also tested under a fluidized bed reactor fbr process to produce the low moisture struvite crystal pellets synthetic wastewater of 400 mg p l which simulated a typical concentration of phosphorus in the discharge of animal wastewater was treated as the model wastewater to rectify the potential drawback of the fbr system the system was operated under both seeded and unseeded processes named fluidized bed crystallization fbc and fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization fbhc respectively three different seeds including dolomite camg co3 2 sio2 and cahpo4 were introduced into the fbc system because of their environmentally friendly properties various parameters including ph molar ratio of mg to p mg 0 p 0 p inlet concentration and coexisting ions were tested to obtain the optimum struvite crystallization efficiency the performance of fbc and fbhc was then compared and evaluated under similar conditions with hydraulic parameters including hydraulic retention time hrt ph and cross sectional loading l 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all of the chemicals were laboratory grade and used directly without any further purification laboratory grade doubly deionized ultrapure water ro resistance 18 2 mω was used to prepared all solutions the experiments were performed using 500 ml of synthetic wastewater prepared with nah2po4 h2o showa japan mgcl2 6h2o panreac germany and nh4cl showa japan the phosphorus concentration was fixed at 400 mg p l 1 and mg 0 n 0 p 0 molar ratios were varied in the range of 0 6 1 1 1 5 1 1 by changing mg dosage three kinds of carrier seeds were introduced to the system cahpo4 particles from the recovered by product of the fluidized bed granulation process system from previous research 24 industrial grade dolomite powder that was purchased from gong chang industrial and mining co taiwan and the sand granular sio2 from a by product of a plastic producing company chang chun group taiwan a ph adjustment was performed with naoh 91 merck and hcl 37 merck 2 2 experimental set ups 2 2 1 batch reactor br these experiments were conducted in a simulated batch

optimized a mechanical stirrer from hung yao instrument co was applied to agitate the solution at two different speeds to facilitate floc formation 150 rpm was applied for 10 min to ensure complete mixing of the reactants followed by 30 rpm for 50 min dropwise ph adjustments were made every 2 min using hcl and naoh 0 1 m solutions at the end of the process the concentrations of nh4 n total phosphorus tp and mg2 were measured hcl 35 was used to dissolved the solid product sample the fraction of a specific elements such as n mg p in the solid product was calculated by measuring the concentration of a related compound in the digested solution of the solid product as presented in eq 1 1 fraction in solid c d v 0 m 0 100 where m0 v0 represents the initial sample weight mg and used volume of hcl in l and cd represents the measured concentration in mg l 1 by using the assumption that ammonium would only precipitate as struvite the struvite purity can be calculated 25 26 as shown in eq 2 below 2 struvite purity mass n in solid 14 245 purity of struvite is determined by the percent mass of nitrogen in a precipitate as calculated by eq 1 molecular masses of mgnh4po4 6h2o and n are 245 and 14 g mol 1 respectively 2 2 2 fluidized bed reactor the laboratory scale of the fbc and fbhc systems has been experimented with in a 350 ml of cylindrical pyrex reactor the reactor was built as a vertical column with 100 cm height and 2 5 cm in diameter the recycle point was placed at 90 cm from the bottom of the reactor and 5 cm below the effluent point three 3 inlet at the bottom of the reactor column are linked to a peristaltic pump masterflex l s cole parmer instrument co usa as shown in fig s1 to control inlet flow rates of mixture of magnesium and ammonium salts precipitants phosphorus and the reflux flow rate the reactor arrangement and condition were described in fig s1 fluidized bed crystallization fbc utilized seed materials sio2 dolomite or cahpo4 to provide a surface to enhance the heterogeneous crystallization process fbhc fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization applies the unseeded crystallization process to fluidized beds a 5 ml min pumping of the target pollutant p solution is required to homogenize seed material in the fbhc system meanwhile the precipitant that consists of ammonium and magnesium mixture 8 4 mm and 6 45 mm respectively were also pumped at 5 ml min into the fbr reactor and reached a molar ratio mg 0 p 0 n 0 of 1 3 1 1 in the mixing point the recirculation stream was maintained at 50 ml min as the seed particles were stable enough the condition was changed to stimulate the growth of the generated particles the inlet concentration was doubled and followed by the increase of inlet concentration to 50 ml min a 150 ml min recirculation stream is then used to maintain a constant up flow velocity of 30 m h and reduce supersaturation by adjusting the ph at the reactant tank the effluent ph was maintained at 9 0 during both the seed formation and particle growth steps in the fbhc system the reactor top was sampled at the reflux point 5 cm below the outlet after 25 hydraulic retention time hrt cycles approximately 87 5 min 1 hrt 3 5 min as the system reached steady state in order to determine the soluble phosphorus concentration in the effluent a sample was filtered through a 0 45 m filter to determine the total amount of phosphorus in both soluble and suspended particle forms the other sample was not filtered two set of samples were acidified by 0 05 ml hno3 70 total phosphorus removal tr and crystallization ratio cr could be determined using eqs 3 4 3 tr 1 p s q t p 0 q p 100 4 cr 1 p t q t p 0 q p 100 the phosphorus concentrations at the inlet was named as p 0 meanwhile p s represents the dissolved residual phosphorus concentration in effluent point after filtration and p t represents the total effluent phosphorus levels without filtration that determines both of dissolved residual phosphorus and digested phosphorus concentration from the sludge that was washed out from the reactor the experimental parameters of the fbr reactors are listed in table s1 tr refers to the total amount of related compounds that can be precipitates by the process whereas cr refers to the amount of phosphorus that exists as larger recoverable crystals 27 an optimum operating condition is defined as the experimental parameter value resulting in the highest cr value low cr value followed by high tr value indicates a significant amount of undesired sludge has formed in the system 2 3 analytical methods

to detect the functional groups of solids 3 result and discussions 3 1 phosphorus removal in a batch reactor 3 1 1 effect of ph the effect of different ph on the recovery of ammonium magnesium and phosphorus is shown in fig 1 the initial molar ratio of mg 0 n 0 p 0 was set at 1 1 1 since ph was known to be decreased during struvite precipitation which affected the precipitation efficiency ph was controlled at the desired value during the operation at ph 8 0 10 0 the phosphorus removal efficiency was around 83 7 94 9 indicating that ph had a strong effect on the phosphate recovery fig 1a however the recovery efficiency of ammonium was dropped as ph increased to 10 with ammonium removal efficiency of 69 4 it is consistent with the low nitrogen composition in the solid product at ph 10 which is shown in fig 1b at ph 10 nitrogen volatilizes from an aqueous solution in the form of gaseous nh3 due to its equilibrium state and reduces struvite crystallization the pka of ammonium ammonia is 9 3 causes the ammonium nitrogen can be easily transferred from a liquid to dissolved ammonia gas by following eq 5 5 nh 4 oh h 2 o nh 3 g by increasing ph value to the alkaline area the equilibrium relation of nh4 nh3 in the aqueous solution is shifted to the right as nitrogen was significantly removed by volatilization mg3 po4 2 was predominantly precipitated followed by the decreasing of nh4 n removal efficiency 28 consistent with the previous research that struvite is hard to precipitate under extremely alkaline conditions and favorably optimized under a ph of 8 9 29 30 the recovery of phosphorus and ammonium via struvite precipitation could reach the optimal value at ph 9 0 corresponding to 90 6 of struvite purity fig 1b hao et al reported that the struvite purity at a high ph level 9 5 was below 30 31 that is consistent to this study with 11 2 of struvite purity at ph 10 0 at ph higher than 10 struvite crystallization is possibly inhibited by the formation of mg3 po4 2 and mg oh 2 precipitates similarly as reported by karmegam et al the formation of magnesium phosphate appeared to inhibit struvite formation at ph 9 5 32 ph 9 0 then considered as the optimum ph value and to be applied in further experiments the xrd pattern that is shown in fig 1c indicated that the crystal products are predominated by struvite compound at ph 8 0 9 5 fit with the standard jcpds 15 0762 however at ph 10 0 the solid crystallinity decreases by the possibility of mg3 po4 2 formation related to the low nitrogen composition in a solid product the solubility curve of possible species is depicted in fig 1d by considering the magnesium speciations in the system to give a clear overview of the formation of struvite magnesium phosphate and magnesium hydroxide speciation of magnesium ions as a result of phosphate species complexation and hydrolysis in water can be explained as follows 6 mg 2 h 2 o mgoh h k 1 mgoh h mg 2 10 11 4 7 mg 2 po 4 3 mgpo 4 k f 1 mgpo 4 mg 2 po 4 3 10 3 13 8 mg 2 po 4 3 h mghpo 4 k f 2 mghpo 4 0 mg 2 po 4 3 h 10 14 24 9 mg 2 po 4 3 2 h mgh 2 po 4 k f 3 mgh 2 po 4 mg 2 po 4 3 h 2 10 21 01 based on eqs 6 9 the total magnesium could be determined by the summary of these species 10 mg total mg 2 mgoh mgpo 4 mghpo 4 0 mgh 2 po 4 the magnesium precipitants that happened in solution under the existence of phosphate and ammonium species could be four major forms including mgnh4po4 6h2o mghpo4 mg3 po4 2 and mg oh 2 eqs 11 14 a ph regulated competition occurs between these reactions 11 mgn h 4 p o 4 s mg 2 n h 4 p o 4 3 k sp 10 13 16 12 mghp o 4 s mg 2 hp o 4 2 k sp 10 5 82 13 mg 3 po 4 2 s 3 mg 2 2 po 4 3 k sp 10 25 2 14 mg oh 2 s mg 2 2 oh k sp 1 38 11 subsequently the relationship between ph and mgnh4po4 6h2o mghpo4 mg3 po4 2 and mg oh 2 solubility can be established fig 1d conventionally solubility curves are plotted either as precipitation from supersaturated solutions at equilibrium or as crystals dissolve in undersaturated solutions at equilibrium 33 fig 1d showed that the composition of the produced precipitates mainly depended on the ph condition the predominant mg precipitates changed from pure mgnh4po4 6h2o to mg3 po4 2 mgnh4po4 6h2o mixture at ph above 8 5 as plotted in the magnesium effluent concentration with the solubility curve of magnesium species the solid product at ph 9 0 is a mixture of mgnh4po4 6h2o and mg3 po4 2 mg oh 2 and mghpo4 are easier to dissociate than other magnesium compounds leading to the inexistence of this precipitate under a ph of 10 3 1 2 effect of mg 0 p 0 molar ratio and input p concentration the p harvesting efficiency can be enhanced by increasing the mg2 dosage to increase the degree of supersaturation in the struvite system as the mg 0 p 0 dosing ratio was raised to 1 3 at an initial p concentration of 400 mg l p removal efficiency can be enhanced to 95 2 fig 2a a study conducted by kim et al determined that the ideal mg 0 n 0 p 0 ratio should be 1 2 1 0 1 0 during full scale application the mg 0 p 0 ratio should be 1 3 1 34 according to the solubility curve when the po4 3 concentration is constant the po4 3 removal efficiency will be enhanced by increasing the mg concentration and creating a higher mg 0 p 0 molar ratio a previous study found similar results 34 however this was not beneficial for the removal of mg2 and nh4 n as the mg 0 p 0 molar ratio was higher than 1 3 the nitrogen removal efficiency declined because some p was consumed during the formation of mg3 po4 2 predicted solubility curves of struvite under different mg dosages were presented in fig 2c showing the low potential formation of struvite when the mg 0 p 0 molar ratio of 0 6 as illustrated in fig 2b the p recovery efficiency reaches up to 95 2 at an mg 0 p 0 dosing ratio of 1 3 in the real case the phosphate concentration may be varied at different times thus the effect of initial p concentration on p harvesting behavior was investigated various po4 3 concentrations from 2 2 to 25 mm 69 to 775 mg p l were introduced to investigate the adaptability of the system under different po4 3 concentrations the po4 3 removal efficiency increased as phosphorus concentration increased from 2 2 to 25 mmol l explained by the increase of supersaturation condition as the struvite solubility remains the same the phosphate concentration is following the equilibrium concentration resulting in the higher consumption of dissolved phosphate that leads to higher phosphorus removal efficiency the theoretical line of struvite drawn based on the different initial p concentrations shows the high potential of struvite formation reaching 25 mmol l confirming this conclusion fig 2d 3 1 3 effect of co existing ions real wastewater may contain various compounds besides phosphorus as the main pollutant different ions in wastewater streams may affect the removal efficiency of targeted pollutants the influence of co existing ions na ca2 k no3 so4 2 and cl and chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and citric acid were tested at two concentration levels ions 0 p 0 molar ratios of 2 5 and 5 0 as shown in fig 3a phosphorus removal is not significantly affected under the presence of chloride sodium and nitrate at ions 0 p 0 molar ratios of 2 5 and 5 meanwhile the presence of ca2 as a common co existing ion in wastewater enhances the p removal from 95 2 to 99 6 the higher p removal is explained by the co precipitation of canh4po4 7h2o ca3 po4 2 and cahpo4 with struvite ca3 po4 2 could be dominant in the cap system because cahpo4 and canh4po4 7h2o could be suppressed due to their unstable forms 35 36 the higher solubility line of ca3 po4 2 compared to struvite presented in fig 3c confirms the high potential for the formation of cap compounds compared to others in the system which can inhibit the struvite precipitation 37 and decrease the struvite purity 38 it was reported that n removal efficiency drops from 90 6 to 22 9 at a ca2 po4 3 molar ratio of 2 5 1 potassium k presence slightly disturbing the formation of desired n struvite while the phosphorus removal remained unchanged due to the formation of co precipitated mgkpo4 6h2o k struvite with mgnh 4 po4 6h2o n struvite the pksp of n struvite was 13 16 39 whereas that of k struvite was 11 7 18 indicating that k struvite is more soluble than n struvite the presence of k in the solution could cease the struvite formation explained by the near solubility line of k struvite in comparison to n struvite fig 3c the presence of so4 is proved to affect the formation of struvite at so4 2 0 p 0 5 where the removal efficiency of both p and n was reduced it was reported that high sulfate concentration in a solution would extend the induction time of struvite precipitation 40 therefore longer reaction time is required to reach the equilibrium state for struvite formation in the presence of potassium 15 mgk po 4 s mg 2 k po 4 3 k sp 10 11 7 the chelating agents such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and citric acid cause an inhibitory effect of mg on struvite crystallization due to the formation of a highly soluble complex of mg citric and mg edta 41 citric acid and edta significantly reduced phosphorus removal efficiency and reached 0 removals at the molar ratio organic 0 p 0 2 5 the equilibrium constant of the magnesium complexes of edta and citric acid formation were presented in eqs 16 19 42 43 16 mg 2 edta mg edta 2 k c1 10 8 69 17 mg 2 h 2 cit mgh 2 cit k c2 10 0 6 18 mg 2 hcit 2 mghcit k c3 10 1 78 19 mg 2 cit 3

descending order edta citric acid ca2 k so4 2 cl no3 na cl 3 1 4 precipitate characterization after the reaction precipitates were characterized by sem eds ft ir and xrd a sem image in fig 4a indicated that the precipitates were populated with some rectangular orthorhombic crystals the energy dispersive spectrometer spectrum eds analysis shows the atomic ratio of mg n p o 1 0 6 0 8 8 4 fig 4b the theoretical value of struvite for mg n p o is 1 1 1 10 the deviation is caused by another possible precipitate form such as mg3 po4 2 or adsorbed compound of mg n p and o onto the existed particle surface eds mapping confirmed the appearance of mg p n and o the infrared spectra from ft ir analysis of struvite precipitate and struvite biochar precipitate were shown in fig 4c the obvious po4 3 p characteristic absorption peaks appeared at wave numbers of between 560 and 600 cm 1 960 cm 1 44 and at 1000 1100 cm 1 45 the deformation vibration of nh4 also appeared at wave number 1435 3 cm 1 46 confirming that struvite existed in precipitates the xrd patterns fig 4d showed that the crystalline precipitates consist of a struvite structure which is fitted by the struvite standard from jcpds 15 0762 based on the results and characterization mentioned above it can be confirmed that struvite is the main product in operating conditions at ph 9 0 and mg 0 p 0 n 0 1 3 1 1 however struvite precipitate as a sludge that has a small particle size and high water content a sedimentation tank is needed to collect the sludge high energy is also needed to dry the sludge and become the applicable solid 3 2 phosphorus removal in a fluidized bed reactor 3 2 1 particle synthesis in fluidized bed reactor two kinds of fbr systems were conducted to produce struvite pellets from synthetic phosphate wastewater the seeded fbr system fbc fluidized bed crystallizer utilized the heterogeneous seeds meanwhile the unseeded fbr named fbhc fluidized bed homogeneous crystallization started without the additional seed in the fbc system the different seed materials of sio2 dolomite camg co3 2 and cahpo4 were introduced the seed was added to the reactor at a static bed height of 30 cm phosphate solution 12 9 mm and the mixture of ammonium and magnesium solution 16 8 mm and 12 9 mm respectively were pumped into the reactor at 50 ml min each the degree of supersaturation was maintained low by using a high recirculation rate at 150 ml min to stimulate the heterogeneous struvite nucleation onto the provided seed using sio2 dolomite and cahpo4 as seed materials the newly formed nuclei deposits onto the seed surface to form bigger pellets namely struvite sio2 struvite dolomite and struvite cahpo4 in the fbhc system the preceding step was needed to produce the homogeneous seed phosphate solution 6 45 mm and the mixture of ammonium and magnesium 8 4 mm and 6 45 mm respectively were pumped into the reactor at the low volumetric rate of 5 ml min a low recycle rate was applied at 50 ml min leading to the low dilution effect in the mixing point and creating the high supersaturation condition the homogeneous new particles that were formed in the high supersaturation condition played a role as seed material after enough amount of sludge was produced the supersaturation condition was reduced by increasing the inlet and recirculation rate to 50 and 150 ml min respectively inlet concentration also doubled to enhance the coating rate of the previously produced seed particles the low degree of supersaturation placed the system in the heterogeneous nucleation and metastable zone due to the low energy in the system that is caused by low supersaturation conditions the new nuclei could only be formed onto the existing surface from the homogeneous seeds that are previously generated this phenomenon leads to the particle growth becoming the bigger pellets namely struvite fbhc the crystal pellets generated were then harvested and dried in the oven at 60 c overnight before further characterization 3 2 2 characterization of fbr particle products the morphology of different fbc pellets was determined using a scanning electron microscope sem fig 5 a c shows that the surface of the silica and dolomite have a smooth and non porous surface after the fbc process the surface of the recovered pellet that is coated by struvite has a rougher surface as shown in the exterior observation of the cross sectional view the coated compound appears flaky and has a triangular cavity similar to pure struvite crystal under the higher magnification of 20 k a similar structure was found in another fbc product as shown in fig 5 pellets made from fbhc contain no heterogeneous seed material as a core the interior textures of fbhc products are greatly different from shells fig 5b in the preceding step crystallites are homogeneously nucleated and aggregated thus forming the granule core the shell structure was formed by the heterogeneous nucleation onto the core surface in the low supersaturation condition of the system the bigger flakes size aggregated and coated onto the existing core surface the fluid shear and surface abrasion created the round shape of the pellets meanwhile the collision between particles initiated the particle squeezing and dewatering in fig 5b less defined aggregates are the result of this phenomenon xrd and raman analysis were conducted with initial seed materials and after coating confirming the formation of struvite at the end of the reaction fig s2 3 2 3 fbc and fbhc comparison the performance of the fbc and fbhc processes was compared after obtaining sufficient pellet quantities and sizes a static particle bed of 30 cm height was prepared in the fbr reactor each reactant of phosphorus 12 9 mm at 50 ml min and the mixed mgn solution were pumped into the fbr reactor at a molar ratio of mg 0 p 0 n 0 1 3 1 1 into the fbr reactor a constant up flow velocity of 30 m h was maintained with a recirculation stream speed of 150 ml min fig 6a b illustrate nitrogen and phosphorus removal in different numbers of hrt the cr and tr values obtained with the addition of dolomite seed achieved the highest phosphorus and nitrogen efficiency cr 60 and tr 91 8 similar tr results could be obtained under the application of cahpo4 seed material however the cr results are significantly lower for both phosphorus and nitrogen removal compared to dolomite seed inactive seeded material such as sio2 only serves as the carrier to the struvite material coated on its surface meanwhile active materials such as dolomite camg co3 2 could absorb phosphorus anion in an aqueous solution as reported by other studies 23 47 the effect of different seeds material including sio2 cahpo4 dolomite struvite and the unseeded system was presented at ph 9 0 showing the highest removal efficiency of both tp and nh4 n reported for dolomite material with 13 5 of p and 8 59 of n removal fig s3 it was reported by ha et al 23 that dolomite seed serves as an adsorbent and precipitant leached ca2 from dolomite for phosphorus removal in the aqueous solution dolomite seed contains the alkali metal me ca mg co3 47 that gives a negative charge on its surface at ph 9 0 explaining the reduction of nh4 n in solution by adsorption the fbhc system shows the lower cr and tr compared to the dolomite seeded system because the crystallization in fbhc system only rely on the initial addition of magnesium precipitant without any additional leached compound from the existed seed however the struvite purity produced by fbhc system is higher than that of dolomite seeded system due to the inexistence of heterogeneous seed material 3 2 4 parameters optimization experiments in these experiments only the struvite dolomite system was tested due to its superior performance to other seed materials based on the previous experiment various hydraulic parameters including ph and cross sectional loading l were tested to investigate the optimal operating conditions 3 2 4 1 effect of ph the ph value of the solution is responsible for the speciation of all compounds that are involved in the system it affects both removal efficiency and struvite purity in the system as shown in fig 7a the value of cr for nitrogen and phosphorus has a maximum value of around 80 at ph 8 8 and then respectively decreases to 70 and 77 at ph 9 the maximum tr of 87 5 for nitrogen removal is obtained at ph 8 8 before slightly dropping to 75 9 as ph increases to 9 0 meanwhile the tr value for phosphorus keeps increasing from 64 9 to 94 8 as ph increase from 7 to 9 it is caused by the formation of another phosphate species under the insufficient amount of nitrogen due to the volatilization of ammonia in high ph that changes the actual molar ratio of mg 0 n 0 p 0 in the system in the high degree of supersaturation with the increasing ph the solute concentration gets closer to the zone of homogeneous nucleation initiating the generation of new nuclei in the bulk solution 48 new clusters formed in the reactor are more easily uplifted by the up flow stream and drained out reducing the crystallization ratio cr the amount of undesired sludge in the effluent stream could be observed from the value gap between tr and cr value the big difference of tr and cr value indicated the high amount of generated sludge washed out in the effluent stream meanwhile the small value gap between tr and cr indicated that the target pollutant is well recovered as a granulated crystal 3 2 4 2 effect of cross sectional loading cross sectional loading is an intrinsic parameter commonly used for scaling up an operation l kg m 2 h 1 the mass loading of p in a reactor per unit of time is defined as the mass of p flowing through the reactor a change in the input p concentration cp adjusted the cross sectional loading l kg m 2 h 1 0 5 4 5 kg m 2 h 1 whereas the total inflow rate qt and reflux rate qr remained constant at 100 ml min qp qmg n 50 ml min and 150 ml min as observed from fig 7b in dolomite seeded system cross sectional loading l of 2 4 kg m 2 h 1 is considered to be the optimum value that is resulting in total phosphorus removal of 93 and a crystallization ratio of higher than 80 when p loading exceeds 2 4 kg m 2 h 1 cr values decrease to 44 1 in the high p loading case homogeneous nucleation was accelerated and excessive small particles were formed 49 as the small particles are light and easily washed out the total p in the effluent stream is increased leading to a low cr in terms of cr the trend of the crystallization ratio of phosphorus and nitrogen was related due to the formation of struvite granules meanwhile the tr remains constant because the soluble phosphorus always follows its equilibrium condition 3 2 5 effect of supersaturation on the crystallization efficiency in the fbr system the sludge formation in the fbr system is highly dependent on the supersaturation in the effluent stream there are two phosphate phases in the effluent stream the soluble phosphate and phosphate based sludge that is washed out from the reactor due to the uplift flow the amount of the sludge product that is represented as ssp could be presented as 22 s sp p sludge p eq p t p s p eq where p t p s and p eq represent the total phosphorus soluble sludge soluble phosphorus and theoretical phosphorus equilibrium in the effluent stream meanwhile the supersaturation condition in the inlet point depends on the mixing phosphorus concentration from the total inlet and recirculation stream that can be calculated as 23 s in q p p in q r p t q r q p q mg n p eq 1 2 p in r p t r 1 p eq 24 ln s in ln 1 2 p in r 1 p eq where p in inlet phosphorus concentration r qr qt qr qmg n qp p eq theoretical concentration of p at equilibrium therefore the potential sludge formation in different inlet conditions could be observed by plotting the si supersaturation index of sludge production and mixing point as plotted in fig 7c the si in the mixing inlet point linearly correlated with the si at the effluent stream with an r square value of 97 the plot shows that initial saturation values play a key role in the effluent values of elements in the discharge wastewater the amount of deposition increases as the degree of supersaturation increases 50 a crystal s growth is inhibited once the supersaturation reaches the homogeneous nucleation zone the use of various technologies for struvite precipitation in the recent papers for phosphorus removal are summarized in table 1 traditional chemical precipitation was the common treatment to promote phosphorus removal from wastewater in early works however conventional precipitation treatment created a large amount of water rich sludge that needed further dewatering as listed in table 1 mgnh4po4 6h2o recycling using the fbr process from this study is an economical and highly feasible method of treatment due to its high removal efficiency and the production of large granule products that are suitable for further use 4 conclusions to recover phosphorus as struvite crystals mgnh4po4 6h2o from wastewater containing phosphorus batch processes and continuous processes using fbr technology were evaluated the performance of various seed materials was conducted for enhancing the crystallization ratio of struvite under the dolomite seeded system the crystallization ratio was enhanced from about 63 to 78 at a ph of 9 0 and mg 0 p 0 ratio 1 3 the capacity of the fbc system was maximized at a cross sectional loading l of 2 4 kg m 2 h 1 and ph 8 8 that was resulting in the crystallization efficiency of 85 with the corresponding total removal efficiency at 93 based on xrd and raman analysis the pellet product was detected as a dolomite seed coated by a struvite shell that has a high potential to be applied as low dissolved fertilizer dolomite can however adversely affect the purity of recovered struvite if used as seed phosphorus can be recovered as granulated pellets in this study by fluidized bed crystallization that are highly separable and have high potential for further use declaration

12498,the nitrogen and sulfur pollutants are challenging to remove simultaneously by biological methods if the wastewater contains low concentration organics the desulfurization denitrification performances were compared in low zero concentration organics up flow reactors with different reflux ratios according to the distribution characteristics of the functional bacteria and functional genes the metabolism pathways of the sulfur and nitrogen in the low concentration organics environment were proposed the results showed that total organic concentration of 30 50 mg c l and reflux ratio of 1 5 were conducive to efficient desulfurization denitrification influent low concentration organics significantly changed the bacterial community structure of the suspended sludge and biofilms in the low concentration organics environment c n 2 sulfurovum desulfocapsa geobacter thauera and pseudomonas were the dominant bacteria most sulfide based autotrophic denitrification bacteria and heterotrophic denitrification bacteria were distributed in biofilms the high abundance of sqr and fcca b genes indicated s2 oxidation to s0 dominating the bioreactor no2 was removed via assimilatory nitrite reduction and denitrification while s2 was removed via sulfur oxidation and assimilatory sulfate reduction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords low concentration organics reflux ratio element sulfur sulfur oxidation genes biofilm data availability the sequencing data of this study are available through the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under the project accession number srp228293 and srp228296 1 introduction in high concentration organics high toc wastewater such as dyeing pharmaceutical and chemical production wastewater the nitrogenous compounds are mainly converted to nitrate and nitrite no3 no2 via nitrification while the sulfate so4 2 is converted to s2 via the anaerobic sulfate reduction meanwhile the organics are also consumed in quantity bringing the effluent of low concentration organics and high concentration no3 no2 and sulfide s2 this wastewater is challenging to treat for its insufficient organic sources poor biochemical performance and uncontrollable secondary pollution 1 2 which seriously threatens the environment s ecological balance and human health 3 5 recently the sulfide based autotrophic denitrification process sbad has often been adopted as the advanced treatment process for the nitrification and sulfate reduction 6 it can remove no3 no2 and s2 in low zero concentration organics low zero toc wastewater 7 no3 no2 is converted to n2 while s2 is converted to element sulfur s0 thiosulfate s2o3 2 or so4 2 8 9 the product type of s2 oxidation depends on the ratio of electron donors to acceptors 10 such as s2 no2 or toc no2 the residual organics from the pretreatment would inevitably enter sbad process and serve as one kind of electron donors in the bioreactor the influent organics were reported to change the dominant bacterial genera in the system because sbad was a kind of autotrophic reaction 11 resulting in the fluctuations of pollutants removal the high total organic concentration toc made the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb close to that of sulfide based autotrophic denitrification bacteria sdb 12 decreasing the removal rate of sulfur pollutants by 40 and the total nitrogen removal rate by 30 13 14 additionally the high toc was conducive to the proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb which promoted so4 2 reduction to s2 but decreased the removal of s2 15 when toc declined the low toc environment c n 2 appeared 16 the relative abundance of sdb increased to 2 7 4 5 times that of hdb 17 the highest generation rate of s0 was found in the facultative autotrophic and heterotrophic environment with low toc 11 the reaction activity of s2 and the intensity of sbad also reached a high level 18 19 making the average removal rate of tn increase by 3 2 7 7 13 the facultative environment had advantages compared with individual autotrophic or heterotrophic 20 when organics were withdrawn from the influent the zero toc environment appeared the biomass generated was lower than that in the low toc environment but the amount of generated s2o3 2 was high 18 the mechanism of the above phenomena was unclear but low toc might positively affect the removal of contaminants therefore it was necessary to deeply explore the pollutant transformation mechanism based on the metabolic capacity of functional bacteria in the low toc environment to ensure the efficient operation of the reactor the organics competed with s2 for electron acceptor no3 no2 in sbad affecting the number of electrons released by s2 19 when the electrons were inadequate s0 the product of s2 oxidation would be over oxidized to so4 2 to release more electrons 21 additionally organics could encourage the microorganisms to secrete the extracellular polymers eps 22 making s0 particles easy to adhere to the activated sludge thus eps made s0 challenging to discharge from the bioreactor with the low hydrodynamic force the cumulated s0 was then converted to some sulfurous reducing substances such as s2o3 2 and polysulfide sx 2 23 which might participate in sbad as electron donors again to change the type of s2 oxidation product the wastewater with high flow velocity was reported to wash s0 down and the concentration of s0 was increased in the effluent 24 accordingly coupling hydraulic conditions and organics concentration had an important effect on the type of products in sbad the reflux ratio was an essential hydraulic factor affecting the water flow velocity shear force and mass transfer efficiency 25 therefore it is of practical significance to explore the effect of low toc on s2 conversion under different reflux ratios this work aims to explore the optimal low toc for sbad and analyze the desulfurization denitrification characteristics under the coupling conditions of low toc and different reflux ratios it compared the up flow biofilm reactor performances in low toc and zero toc environments and studied the effects of low toc on the bacterial community and functional genes then it discussed the metabolic pathways of sulfur and nitrogen in the low toc environment to provide the theoretical basis and data support for the optimization of sbad 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor and operation the anaerobic up flow biofilm reactor with an effective volume of 1 77 l was shown in fig 1 it was filled with 10 10 10 mm polyurethane sponges pore size of 20 ppi shown in fig s1 the temperature was maintained at 30 1 c the wastewater was pumped into the reactor from the bottom to contact the activated sludge fully and a peristaltic pump was used for internal reflux a three phase separator was used on the top to separate the solid liquid and gas substances the volume of inoculated sludge was 800 ml and the volatile suspended solid concentration mlvss was 9 7 g l the wastewater containing na2s 9h2o nano2 nahco3 1 g l nh4cl 0 05 g l and k2hpo4 0 5 g l was used as the influent the influent concentrations of s2 and no2 were 200 mg s l and 50 mg n l in the reactor the influent toc was 30 mg c l via adding ch3coona to the low toc reactor the ph value was adjusted at 7 5 0 1 via hcl 0 1 mol l the hydraulic retention time was maintained at 5 36 h while the reflux ratio increased stepwise from 0 1 14th day 0 5 15 26th day 1 0 27 41st day to 1 5 42 54th day 2 2 batch experiment the effect of low toc on sbad was studied using multiple anaerobic flasks of 500 ml the inoculated activated sludge was taken from a stably operating sbad bioreactor the influent of the batch experiment was consistent with that of the up flow reactor mentioned above influent toc was 0 mg c l 15 mg c l 30 mg c l 50 mg c l 75 mg c l and 100 mg c l the actual c n value was 0 0 35 0 70 1 17 1 75 and 2 33 respectively after blowing high purity helium into the flask to remove oxygen the flask was quickly sealed to establish an anaerobic environment the flasks were placed in an oscillating incubator of 30 1 c and 120 rpm min the removal rate of s2 and no2 rrsulfide rrnitrite and the generation rate of s2 grsulfur in each flask were analyzed until s2 and no2 were consumed completely 2 3 chemical analysis and calculation method the n 1 nye ethylenediamine spectrophotometry method uv 752 china was used to analyze no2 n 26 the ion chromatography dionex aquion usa was used to analyze so4 2 s the ph value was detected by ph meter phs 3c china the p amino dimethylaniline spectrophotometry method uv 752 china was used to detect s2 s 27 toc analyzer aurora 1030 usa was used to measure toc grsulfur was calculated according to the sulfur balance method as follows where s2 in s2 eff and so4 2 eff mg s l meant the concentration of influent s2 effluent s2 and effluent so4 2 mgs l respectively 1 gr sulfur 100 so 4 2 eff 100 s 2 in s 2 eff 2 4 microbial sample collection and high throughput sequencing four activated sludge samples were collected from low toc and zero toc reactors at reflux ratio 1 5 respectively the sample was quickly transferred to the sterile sample tube with blowing helium gas and then stored in the refrigerator at 80 c the samples in low toc and zero toc reactors were named y1 y4 and z1 z4 respectively whose sampling sites were shown in fig s2 primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used to amplify 16s rdna sequences in v3 v4 region of each sample the process included dna extraction polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification miseq library construction and sequencing based on quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime software the obtained high quality sequences were classified by otu according to 97 sequence similarity the principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the differences in bacterial communities the phylogenetic investigation of communities by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the meta genome of the original 16s rdna data the kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome kegg was used to predict the functional genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of low toc on autotrophic desulfurization denitrification in the batch experiment rrsulfide rrnitrite and grsulfur were shown in fig s3 the variation of rrsulfide was similar under different influent toc conditions which could be summarized into three stages a rapid rise stage 0 6 h b stationary stage 7 10 h and c descent stage 11 48 h at rapid rise stage rrsulfide with toc 15 75 mg l was close to or higher than rrsulfide with toc 0 mg l and the higher toc was the greater the removal velocity of s2 was however the removal velocity of s2 with toc 100 mg c l was lower than that with toc 0 mg c l s2 oxidation to s0 was an intermediate step of s2 oxidation to so4 2 which had a greater reaction velocity than s2 oxidation to so4 2 under the conditions of limited no2 more organics could provide more electrons for no2 reduction which promoted s2 oxidation to s0 to enhance the removal velocity of s2 11 however toc 100 mg c l was too high and inhibited the activity of autotrophic sdb 16 thus the removal velocity of s2 was low in the descent stage rrsulfide declined sharply with toc 15 100 mg c l the greater toc was the greater rrsulfide decline range was and the earlier the time to start the decline of rrsulfide was srb has the long attaching growth time of about 22 h 28 in this reactor srb used so4 2 as the substrate for growth and metabolism while so4 2 was the metabolite of sdb the generation of so4 2 lasted for some time further lengthening the growth time of srb as time passed by srb began to appear in the descent stage the high toc began to promote srb reducing so4 2 to s2 thus the concentration of s2 increased to cause rrsulfide decrease at rapid rise stage rrnitrite with toc 0 100 mg c l rose rapidly in 0 6 h the higher toc was the higher the removal velocity of no2 was no2 with toc 15 mg c l was removed completely in 24 h while rrnitrite with toc 75 100 mg c l reached 100 in 6 h like s2 used by sdb facultative heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria could also use organics to reduce no2 for energy metabolism and cell synthesis 29 at rapid rise stage the electron donors in the reactor were mainly organics and s2 the higher toc was the more electrons were supplied for no2 removal however when organics and s2 were consumed completely s0 became the electron donor the ability of s0 particles to release electrons was weaker making the denitrification velocity begin to decrease 30 the variation of grsulfur was generally divided into two stages a rising stage 0 6 h and b descent stage 6 48 h at a stage grsulfur in each flask rose gradually and reached the maximum value at 6 h the maximum grsulfur in the flasks of toc 15 75 mg c l were all higher than that of toc 0 mg c l the influent organics provided the extra electrons for no2 reduction thus s2 oxidation to s0 rather than to so4 2 could provide enough electrons therefore the organics promoted grsulfur to increase before 6 h however grsulfur in each flask showed a downward trend at b stage with toc 50 mg c l the higher toc was the less the decline of grsulfur was with toc 50 mg c l the higher toc was the greater the decline of grsulfur was fang et al 31 also found a similar phenomenon that low toc enhanced the generation of s0 and inhibited s0 oxidation to so4 2 in the short term because s2 had a higher ability to release electrons than s0 no2 was more inclined to oxidize s2 to s0 and then continued to oxidize s0 to so4 2 to obtain a faster conversion rate 32 after 6 h s2 in the flask was consumed completely and then s0 continued to react with the remaining no2 decreasing grsulfur with toc 50 mg c l the higher toc the more electrons could be released to slow down the conversion of s2 to so4 2 meanwhile organics were inevitably used by srb to reduce so4 2 to slow down the increase of so4 2 with toc 50 mg c l toc was high to promote s0 reduction to s2 and significantly decreased grsulfur 33 at 24 h grsulfur with toc 0 75 100 mg c l suddenly declined below 0 but recovered soon the autotrophic sdb died with time gonging because the nutritional substrates were exhausted toc 0 mg c l or the inhibition of high toc toc 75 100 mg c l and so4 2 stored in sdb was released into the wastewater subsequently so4 2 was gradually reduced to s2 by srb to enhance grsulfur slightly considering the removal velocity and rate of s2 and no2 as well as the generation stability and rate of s0 the optimal toc for sbad was 30 50 mg c l 3 2 bioreactor performances with low toc and different reflux ratios variations of rrnitrite rrsulfide grsulfur toc and so4 2 concentration in influent low toc and zero toc reactors with different reflux ratios were shown in fig 2 respectively under reflux ratio 0 and influent toc 30 mg c l rrnitrite was stable at 100 rrsulfide declined to 85 and then rose to 96 grsulfur decreased to 15 on the 5th day and then gradually recovered to 40 because sdb and hdb consumed no2 which was limited in the reactor rrnitrite stabilized at a high level as sdb was inhibited by organics initially 13 hdb gained a temporary advantage in the competition for electron acceptors however with the gradual adaptation of sdb to the low toc environment rrsulfide gradually recovered because the activated sludge was initially domesticated the reactor was operated with the reflux at start up time then the reflux was withdrawn from the reactor at the first stage when the reflux ratio s effect operation began s0 was gradually accumulated in the activated sludge and further oxidized to so4 2 without reflux making grsulfur below 0 on the 5th day meanwhile some autotrophic microorganisms were progressively eliminated in the low toc environment their cytoplasm and stored substances were released to provide electrons for denitrification 34 reducing the demand for sdb to obtain electrons from s0 oxidation therefore grsulfur gradually recovered under reflux ratio 0 and influent toc 0 mg c l rrnitrite and rrsulfide were stable at 100 but grsulfur decreased from 43 to 6 because sdb tended to convert s0 to so4 2 when the electron donors were limited it was found by comparison that organics improved the activity of heterotrophic bacteria but low toc was insufficient to threaten the dominant position of sdb moreover low concentration organics were gradually converted into co2 promoting the growth of sdb 35 which further improved the intensity of desulfurization denitrification and increased rrsulfide and grsulfur it was consistent with the results of the previous batch experiment under reflux ratio 0 5 and influent toc 30 mg c l grsulfur plummeted to 0 03 and then rose to 18 the microorganisms were reported to secrete more eps for the increasing water scour 22 and the slightly increasing shear force was insufficient to overcome the adhesion of eps for s0 36 s0 accumulated in the activated sludge was oxidized to so4 2 making grsulfur a negative value but subsequently eps and the dissolution of microbial residues provided more electrons for denitrification making grsulfur slowly rise again 37 under reflux ratio 0 5 and influent toc 0 mg c l grsulfur briefly increased to 20 but subsequently declined to 8 0 in the autotrophic reaction system the ability of autotrophic bacteria to secrete eps was weaker than that of heterotrophic bacteria 35 with the increasing velocity the water flow washed s0 off the activated sludge and increased grsulfur in the short term however when s2 was consumed s0 was more likely to be oxidized to so4 2 decreasing grsulfur gradually it was found by comparison that the slight increase of reflux ratio had a high effect on grsulfur microorganisms in toc 30 mg c l reactor could fast adapt to the new environment grsulfur in the low toc reactor increased gradually and was higher than that in the zero toc reactor under reflux ratio 1 0 and influent toc 30 mg c l rrsulfide briefly declined to 91 and then increased to 99 grsulfur and so4 2 concentration fluctuated wildly the reflux ratio continued to rise and the increased water flow shear force eliminated the microorganisms with weak adhesion thus much soluble organic substances were released and improved the activity of hdb 38 hdb temporarily dominated the competition with sdb decreasing rrsulfide meanwhile the increasing toc promoted srb to reduce s0 so4 2 to s2 which decreased rrsulfide when the limited organics were consumed sdb dominated the reactor again and increased rrsulfide to 99 because the concentration of dissolved organics was not stable the interaction between the electron donors and electron acceptors was also unstable making concentration of so4 2 fluctuate wildly under reflux ratio 1 0 and influent toc 0 mg c l grsulfur rapidly increased to 32 and then declined to 0 05 the water flow velocity in the zero toc reactor increased again and the newly generated s0 together with the s0 adhered to the activated sludge were washed out resulting in a sharp rise of grsulfur however because the electron donors were limited in the zero toc reactor s0 had to be oxidized to so4 2 to supply enough electrons and s0 decreased subsequently it was found by comparison that grsulfur in the low toc reactor was higher than that in the zero toc reactor with high velocity water flow the influent low toc enhanced the interaction between hdb and sdb and prevented s0 oxidation to so4 2 which was conducive to completely removing sulfurous pollutants in the wastewater under reflux ratio 1 5 and influent toc 30 mg c l grsulfur decreased and subsequently increased to about 55 with the reflux ratio increasing the suspended sludge presented semi fluidization and the gap between the biofilm fillers also increased resulting in a significant loss and death of microorganisms the dissolved organics increased and promoted the proliferation of facultative denitrifying bacteria this kind of bacteria tended to convert s2 to so4 2 resulting in a temporary decline of grsulfur however the high shear force washed s0 out gradually and reduced the probability of s0 oxidation to increase grsulfur meanwhile srb in the facultative environment reduced so4 2 to s2 decreasing so4 2 concentration to increase grsulfur under reflux ratio 1 5 and influent toc 0 mg c l grsulfur increased gradually to 25 it was also attributed to the s0 particles washed out of the activated sludge by the increasing water flow shear force however grsulfur could only maintain at about 25 in the zero toc reactor lower than that in the low toc reactor because the electron donors in the reactor were limited the high reflux ratio together with the low toc improved the distribution ratio of s0 in the water phase bringing the high grsulfur under reflux ratio 1 5 the two bioreactors operated stably and the microbial samples were collected at this stage rrnitrite rrsulfide did not change significantly at different stages in the two reactors no2 was the only electron acceptor based on the calculation of electrons 1 mol l s2 oxidation to s0 so4 2 could release 2 8 mol l electrons while no2 reduction to n2 nh4 nh2 used only 3 6 mol l electrons 39 40 s2 oxidation could release 12 50 50 00 mmol l electrons while no2 reduction could accept 10 70 21 40 mmol l electrons therefore the electron donors were relative excessive to the acceptors no2 could obtain sufficient electrons to be completely removed s2 was firstly oxidized to s0 and s0 was further oxidized to so4 2 when s2 was exhausted moreover some s2 and s0 combined to generate s3 2 39 which made rrsulfide maintain at a high level at all the stages with different reflux ratios additionally the mass balance was carried out at this stage as shown in table 1 the generation of 100 62 mg s l so4 2 released 25 16 mmol l electrons in low toc reactor while the generation of 153 84 mg s l so4 2 released 38 46 mmol l electrons in zero toc reactor the removal of 49 88 mg n l no2 in low toc reactor accepted 10 69 21 38 mmol l electrons while the removal of 49 92 mg n l no2 in zero toc reactor accepted 10 70 21 39 mmol l electrons the amounts of apparent released electrons were larger than that of accepted electrons it was attributed to the accumulation of s0 moreover some s2 could combine with s0 to generate intermediate products such as s3 2 39 which made much electron donors accumulated in the initial stages much s0 and s3 2 accumulated in the activated sludge at the initial stages was further oxidized to so4 2 which made the apparent generation amounts of so4 2 and amounts of released electrons increase at the stage with reflux ratio 1 5 3 3 effect of low toc on the bacterial community structure the β diversity index pca was used to explore the bacterial community structure differences between the low toc and zero toc bioreactors as shown in fig s4 the longer the distance between the two points the greater the difference in bacterial community structure was in the low toc reactor the distances of y4 to y1 y3 were long while the distances among y1 y3 were short it indicated that the bacterial community structure in the suspended sludge and biofilms were significantly different but there was no significant difference in the bacterial community structure in biofilms at different positions the organics changed nutritional conditions promoted the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and increased the complexity of bacterial communities 41 the structure of suspended sludge was loose and only microorganisms adapted to the strong water shear force were suitable to survive on it however the fillers provided shelter for microorganisms and the hydraulic conditions surrounding them were relatively stable which was conducive to the attachment and growth of various functional bacteria especially the heterotrophic bacteria 42 therefore the type of bacterial carriers significantly impacted the bacterial community structure of the low toc reactor z4 point in fig s4 was close to z1 but far away from z2 and z3 indicating that the location of activated sludge significantly impacted the bacterial community structure in the zero toc reactor z1 z4 were close to the reactor wall and the considerable inner wall friction made the mass transfer slow and the nutritional substrates limited it was difficult for heterotrophic bacteria to compete with autotrophic ones there the mass transfer at z2 z3 was fast and the biofilms there could retain some microbial residues to provide organics for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria resulting in a more complex microbial community structure 3 4 spatial distribution of functional bacteria in the reactor the distribution of bacteria in the low toc reactor was shown in fig 3 there were four main functional bacteria in the reactor sdb hdb srb and acid producing bacteria apb the bacterial genera with high relative abundance in y1 y4 were similar including sulfurovum desulfocapsa geobacter thauera and pseudomonas but only sulfurovum desulfocapsa and thauera were found as the dominant bacteria in the zero toc reactor sulfurovum was an autotrophic bacterium that could reduce no2 to n2 with s2 s0 as an electron donor 43 the relative abundance of sulfurovum was the highest in the low toc reactor which was 27 8 32 9 28 9 and 74 9 in y1 y4 respectively the semi fluidization of the suspended sludge made it difficult for bacteria to grow however because sulfurovum had flagella to resist strong shear force and the low toc had little inhibition on the autotrophic bacteria 17 sulfurovum could grow on the suspended sludge and dominated y4 the relative abundance of sulfurovum in z1 z4 was 82 2 56 4 68 1 and 90 9 respectively which significantly increased in the biofilms z1 z3 in the zero toc reactor the organics could promote the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria the secretion of eps and biofilm formation 22 and tend to accumulate in biofilms however surrounding the biofilms without influent organics in zero toc reactor toc was low to hinder the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which was conducive for the autotrophic bacteria to dominate in the biofilms desulfocapsa was a typical srb reducing so4 2 to s2 44 while geobacter was the srb reducing s0 to s2 and oxidizing organics to co2 45 the relative abundance of desulfocapsa was 4 12 3 55 2 87 and 4 58 in y1 y4 respectively geobacter was distributed primarily in biofilms its relative abundance was 3 5 2 1 and 1 6 in y1 y3 respectively as the products of s2 oxidation so4 2 and s0 worked with organics to provide the survival substrates for desulfocapsa and geobacter desulfocapsa had flagella suitable for surviving in the suspended sludge and could use co2 to grow with no organics 45 46 which enhanced the relative abundance of desulfocapsa close to the inner wall it was challenging to retain s0 due to the loose structure of suspended sludge thus the relative abundance of geobacter with s0 as substrate was low in y4 eps was secreted in biofilms to adsorb more nutritional substrates 22 promoting the growth of geobacter because s0 particles were more difficult to be used than so4 2 the relative abundance of geobacter was slightly lower than that of desulfocapsa in the zero toc reactor desulfocapsa was found as the only dominant srb which was 9 8 29 4 15 1 and 3 0 in z1 z4 respectively compared with zero toc reactor the relative abundance of desulfocapsa in the low toc reactor was lower due to the lack of influent organics the electron donors in the zero toc reactor were limited thus s0 was over oxidized to so4 2 to release electrons providing so4 2 for desulfocapsa to grow moreover the low toc promoted the growth of apb whose competition for organics was high in the low toc reactor therefore the abundance of srb was low in the low toc reactor thauera and pseudomonas were the typical facultative denitrifying bacteria which could oxidize s2 s0 or organics to reduce no2 47 48 in the low toc reactor thauera was mainly distributed in biofilms and the relative abundance was 2 7 1 6 and 1 2 respectively in y1 y3 pseudomonas was mainly distributed in y3 with a relative abundance of 2 3 under facultative conditions pseudomonas tended to utilize organics while thauera tended to utilize s2 12 49 as discussed in section 3 2 organics tended to accumulate in biofilms and provided beneficial conditions for the facultative denitrifying bacteria to grow the fast mass transfer and suitable water flow shear force in y3 made the organics relatively abundant for pseudomonas growing toc was low in y1 which allowed thauera using s2 to grow in the zero toc reactor only thauera became the dominant bacteria due to the low toc and the relative abundance was 1 1 1 4 2 3 and 0 5 respectively to sum up the low concentration organics were introduced into the reactor increasing the complexity of the symbiotic relationship among microorganisms but making the bacterial community structure more stable 12 and sulfurovum was always the essential dominant bacteria which ensured the efficient operation of the desulfurization denitrification system in addition many kinds of apb have been found in the low toc reactor which could metabolize organics to co2 and h2 50 apb was widely distributed on biofilms especially at y2 the high flow shear force at y2 stimulated the microorganisms to secrete more eps and eliminated many microorganisms with weak adhesion ability 22 these organics provided apb much suitable nutritional substrates and the organic products by apb subsequently moved with the water to y1 and y3 supporting the growth of hdb and srb apb also existed in the zero toc reactor but its species and relative abundance were lower than those in the low toc reactor this difference was mainly caused by the influent organics 3 5 functional genes and sulfur nitrogen transformation pathways picrust was used to predict the genes related to nitrogen sulfur transformation in the low toc reactor as shown in fig 4 in the zero toc reactor the types of functional genes were as shown in fig s5 according to the types of functional genes and the removal of pollutants fig 2 the transformation pathway of sulfur and nitrogen in the low toc environment was analyzed and shown in fig 5 the denitrification functional genes included the assimilatory nitrite reduction genes nira k00366 napa k02567 napb k02568 napc k02569 napd k02570 nape k02571 napf k02572 and napg k02573 the dissimilatory nitrite reduction genes nirb k00362 nird k00363 and nrfa k03385 and the denitrification genes nirk k00368 norq k04748 norb k04564 norc k02305 and nosz k00376 no2 was converted to nitrogenous organics such as amino acids via the assimilatory nitrite reduction 40 no2 was reduced to nh3 via the dissimilatory nitrite reduction 39 for the denitrification process nirk was involved in reducing no2 to nitric oxide no 51 norq norb and norc were involved in reducing no to nitrous oxide n2o n2o reductase encoded by nosz was involved in reducing n2o to n2 52 the relative abundances of assimilatory nitrite reduction and denitrification genes were high in the suspended sludge and biofilms the relative abundance of dissimilatory nitrite reduction genes was high in biofilms it indicated that assimilatory nitrite reduction was the most important pathway for no2 removal in the low toc reactor followed by denitrification in an environment with sufficient toc the denitrifying functional bacterias had to renew themselves and secrete eps quickly to stabilize the microbial micelles under the high shear force 53 the assimilation of no2 played an essential role in synthesizing amino acids 54 additionally the dissimilatory nitrite reduction was more likely to occur with rich organics whereas denitrification tended to occur with limited organics 55 the influent organics diffused from the biofilms area to the suspended sludge area and were gradually consumed along the way making toc higher in biofilms than in the suspended sludge therefore dissimilatory nitrite reduction mainly occurred in biofilms in the low toc reactor in the zero toc reactor the types of functional genes were as shown in fig s5 no2 was removed mainly via the denitrification pathway because denitrification required fewer electrons than assimilatory dissimilatory nitrite reduction the organics directly affected the dominating nitrogen transformation in desulfurization denitrification system the sulfur oxidation functional genes included sqr k17218 fcca k17230 fccb k17229 soxa k17222 soxb k17224 soxc k17225 dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 the sqr and fcca fccb were mainly involved in s2 oxidation to s0 sox soxa soxb and soxc was mainly involved in s2 oxidation to the sulfane and then oxidation to so4 2 56 dsra dsrb participated in s0 s2 oxidation to trisulfide s3 2 and so4 2 57 the relative abundances of sqr and fcca b were high while those of sox and drsa b were low indicating that s2 oxidation to s0 dominated in the low toc reactor it was attributed to the high shear force washing s0 out to avoid oxidation to so4 2 additionally the relative abundance of sulfur oxidation genes in the low toc reactor was lower than that in the zero toc reactor because the influent organics enhanced the intensity of hdb the intensity of sbad was decreased in the competition process and made the abundance of sulfur oxidation genes decline however hdb secreted more antioxidant enzymes to synthesize eps to increase the self aggregation ability 58 eps made the bacterial community structure more stable and provided more electron donors for the efficient operation of the reactor therefore although the influent organics decreased the relative abundance of sulfur oxidation genes it promoted s2 oxidation to s0 which was more conducive to completely removing sulfurous pollutants the functional genes related to the sulfate reduction were shown in fig 4 c including the assimilatory sulfate reduction genes sat k00958 cysc k00860 cysd k00957 cysnc k00955 cysn k00956 cysh k00390 cysj k00380 and cysi k00381 and the dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes apra k00394 aprb k00395 dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 in the assimilatory sulfate reduction sat cysn cysnc and cysd converted so4 2 to adenosine 5 phosphate sulfate aps cysc converted aps to 3 adenosine phosphate 5 phosphate sulfate paps cysh converted paps to sulfite so3 2 then cysj and cysi converted so3 2 to s2 to finally synthesize organics such as amino acids 41 in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction sat catalyzed the reduction of so4 2 to aps apra and aprb converted aps to so3 2 then dsra and dsrb catalyzed so3 2 to s2 59 the relative abundance of assimilatory sulfate reduction genes in the suspended sludge was higher than in biofilms toc around the suspended sludge was relatively low and srb favors synthesis of sulfur containing amino acids by assimilation under the low toc condition 60 however the relative abundances of cysh cysj and cysi were very low 0 1 indicating that paps was not converted into so3 2 and the assimilatory sulfate reduction in the suspended sludge was incomplete it was reported that some reductants such as organics could catalyze the conversion of paps to s2o3 2 via thiosulfate reductase or polysulfide reductase a chain 61 therefore it was deduced that so4 2 was converted to paps via the assimilatory sulfate reduction in the suspended sludge and then paps was reduced to s2o3 2 or s2 for synthesizing the amino acids in biofilms the relative abundance of genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction was slightly higher than that of genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction the organics around biofilms enhanced dissimilatory sulfate reduction but the low concentration organics in influent were insufficient to enhance dissimilation greatly in the zero toc reactor the dissimilatory sulfate reduction dominated biofilms and the assimilatory sulfate reduction in the suspended sludge stopped at so3 2 so3 2 was diffused into the biofilms z1 z3 and converted into s2 via dissimilatory sulfate reduction hdb had an advantage over srb in competing for organics 62 the influent toc improved the activity of hdb in the low toc reactor while hdb was inhibited under the conditions of limited organics in the zero toc reactor therefore toc for srb increased in the zero toc reactor which was conducive to dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sum up the low influent toc limited the activity of srb changed the type of intermediates in the assimilation sulfate reduction and decreased the intensity of sulfate reduction in the reactor 4 conclusions the bioreactor performances dominant bacteria and functional genes distribution in the low zero toc desulfurization denitrification reactors were analyzed and compared in this work low toc was found conducive to removing s2 and no2 and s2 oxidation to s0 the fillers made the uneven distribution of organics making the heterotrophic bacteria mainly grow on the biofilms in the low toc reactor the dominant bacteria of sulfurovum and desulfocapsa promoted the synergism of sulfide based denitrification and sulfate reduction the genes sqr and fcca fccb dominated the reactor influent organics enhanced assimilatory nitrite reduction and sulfide oxidation but inhibited dissimilatory sulfate reduction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12498,the nitrogen and sulfur pollutants are challenging to remove simultaneously by biological methods if the wastewater contains low concentration organics the desulfurization denitrification performances were compared in low zero concentration organics up flow reactors with different reflux ratios according to the distribution characteristics of the functional bacteria and functional genes the metabolism pathways of the sulfur and nitrogen in the low concentration organics environment were proposed the results showed that total organic concentration of 30 50 mg c l and reflux ratio of 1 5 were conducive to efficient desulfurization denitrification influent low concentration organics significantly changed the bacterial community structure of the suspended sludge and biofilms in the low concentration organics environment c n 2 sulfurovum desulfocapsa geobacter thauera and pseudomonas were the dominant bacteria most sulfide based autotrophic denitrification bacteria and heterotrophic denitrification bacteria were distributed in biofilms the high abundance of sqr and fcca b genes indicated s2 oxidation to s0 dominating the bioreactor no2 was removed via assimilatory nitrite reduction and denitrification while s2 was removed via sulfur oxidation and assimilatory sulfate reduction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords low concentration organics reflux ratio element sulfur sulfur oxidation genes biofilm data availability the sequencing data of this study are available through the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database under the project accession number srp228293 and srp228296 1 introduction in high concentration organics high toc wastewater such as dyeing pharmaceutical and chemical production wastewater the nitrogenous compounds are mainly converted to nitrate and nitrite no3 no2 via nitrification while the sulfate so4 2 is converted to s2 via the anaerobic sulfate reduction meanwhile the organics are also consumed in quantity bringing the effluent of low concentration organics and high concentration no3 no2 and sulfide s2 this wastewater is challenging to treat for its insufficient organic sources poor biochemical performance and uncontrollable secondary pollution 1 2 which seriously threatens the environment s ecological balance and human health 3 5 recently the sulfide based autotrophic denitrification process sbad has often been adopted as the advanced treatment process for the nitrification and sulfate reduction 6 it can remove no3 no2 and s2 in low zero concentration organics low zero toc wastewater 7 no3 no2 is converted to n2 while s2 is converted to element sulfur s0 thiosulfate s2o3 2 or so4 2 8 9 the product type of s2 oxidation depends on the ratio of electron donors to acceptors 10 such as s2 no2 or toc no2 the residual organics from the pretreatment would inevitably enter sbad process and serve as one kind of electron donors in the bioreactor the influent organics were reported to change the dominant bacterial genera in the system because sbad was a kind of autotrophic reaction 11 resulting in the fluctuations of pollutants removal the high total organic concentration toc made the abundance of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb close to that of sulfide based autotrophic denitrification bacteria sdb 12 decreasing the removal rate of sulfur pollutants by 40 and the total nitrogen removal rate by 30 13 14 additionally the high toc was conducive to the proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb which promoted so4 2 reduction to s2 but decreased the removal of s2 15 when toc declined the low toc environment c n 2 appeared 16 the relative abundance of sdb increased to 2 7 4 5 times that of hdb 17 the highest generation rate of s0 was found in the facultative autotrophic and heterotrophic environment with low toc 11 the reaction activity of s2 and the intensity of sbad also reached a high level 18 19 making the average removal rate of tn increase by 3 2 7 7 13 the facultative environment had advantages compared with individual autotrophic or heterotrophic 20 when organics were withdrawn from the influent the zero toc environment appeared the biomass generated was lower than that in the low toc environment but the amount of generated s2o3 2 was high 18 the mechanism of the above phenomena was unclear but low toc might positively affect the removal of contaminants therefore it was necessary to deeply explore the pollutant transformation mechanism based on the metabolic capacity of functional bacteria in the low toc environment to ensure the efficient operation of the reactor the organics competed with s2 for electron acceptor no3 no2 in sbad affecting the number of electrons released by s2 19 when the electrons were inadequate s0 the product of s2 oxidation would be over oxidized to so4 2 to release more electrons 21 additionally organics could encourage the microorganisms to secrete the extracellular polymers eps 22 making s0 particles easy to adhere to the activated sludge thus eps made s0 challenging to discharge from the bioreactor with the low hydrodynamic force the cumulated s0 was then converted to some sulfurous reducing substances such as s2o3 2 and polysulfide sx 2 23 which might participate in sbad as electron donors again to change the type of s2 oxidation product the wastewater with high flow velocity was reported to wash s0 down and the concentration of s0 was increased in the effluent 24 accordingly coupling hydraulic conditions and organics concentration had an important effect on the type of products in sbad the reflux ratio was an essential hydraulic factor affecting the water flow velocity shear force and mass transfer efficiency 25 therefore it is of practical significance to explore the effect of low toc on s2 conversion under different reflux ratios this work aims to explore the optimal low toc for sbad and analyze the desulfurization denitrification characteristics under the coupling conditions of low toc and different reflux ratios it compared the up flow biofilm reactor performances in low toc and zero toc environments and studied the effects of low toc on the bacterial community and functional genes then it discussed the metabolic pathways of sulfur and nitrogen in the low toc environment to provide the theoretical basis and data support for the optimization of sbad 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor and operation the anaerobic up flow biofilm reactor with an effective volume of 1 77 l was shown in fig 1 it was filled with 10 10 10 mm polyurethane sponges pore size of 20 ppi shown in fig s1 the temperature was maintained at 30 1 c the wastewater was pumped into the reactor from the bottom to contact the activated sludge fully and a peristaltic pump was used for internal reflux a three phase separator was used on the top to separate the solid liquid and gas substances the volume of inoculated sludge was 800 ml and the volatile suspended solid concentration mlvss was 9 7 g l the wastewater containing na2s 9h2o nano2 nahco3 1 g l nh4cl 0 05 g l and k2hpo4 0 5 g l was used as the influent the influent concentrations of s2 and no2 were 200 mg s l and 50 mg n l in the reactor the influent toc was 30 mg c l via adding ch3coona to the low toc reactor the ph value was adjusted at 7 5 0 1 via hcl 0 1 mol l the hydraulic retention time was maintained at 5 36 h while the reflux ratio increased stepwise from 0 1 14th day 0 5 15 26th day 1 0 27 41st day to 1 5 42 54th day 2 2 batch experiment the effect of low toc on sbad was studied using multiple anaerobic flasks of 500 ml the inoculated activated sludge was taken from a stably operating sbad bioreactor the influent of the batch experiment was consistent with that of the up flow reactor mentioned above influent toc was 0 mg c l 15 mg c l 30 mg c l 50 mg c l 75 mg c l and 100 mg c l the actual c n value was 0 0 35 0 70 1 17 1 75 and 2 33 respectively after blowing high purity helium into the flask to remove oxygen the flask was quickly sealed to establish an anaerobic environment the flasks were placed in an oscillating incubator of 30 1 c and 120 rpm min the removal rate of s2 and no2 rrsulfide rrnitrite and the generation rate of s2 grsulfur in each flask were analyzed until s2 and no2 were consumed completely 2 3 chemical analysis and calculation method the n 1 nye ethylenediamine spectrophotometry method uv 752 china was used to analyze no2 n 26 the ion chromatography dionex aquion usa was used to analyze so4 2 s the ph value was detected by ph meter phs 3c china the p amino dimethylaniline spectrophotometry method uv 752 china was used to detect s2 s 27 toc analyzer aurora 1030 usa was used to measure toc grsulfur was calculated according to the sulfur balance method as follows where s2 in s2 eff and so4 2 eff mg s l meant the concentration of influent s2 effluent s2 and effluent so4 2 mgs l respectively 1 gr sulfur 100 so 4 2 eff 100 s 2 in s 2 eff 2 4 microbial sample collection and high throughput sequencing four activated sludge samples were collected from low toc and zero toc reactors at reflux ratio 1 5 respectively the sample was quickly transferred to the sterile sample tube with blowing helium gas and then stored in the refrigerator at 80 c the samples in low toc and zero toc reactors were named y1 y4 and z1 z4 respectively whose sampling sites were shown in fig s2 primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used to amplify 16s rdna sequences in v3 v4 region of each sample the process included dna extraction polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification miseq library construction and sequencing based on quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime software the obtained high quality sequences were classified by otu according to 97 sequence similarity the principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the differences in bacterial communities the phylogenetic investigation of communities by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the meta genome of the original 16s rdna data the kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome kegg was used to predict the functional genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of low toc on autotrophic desulfurization denitrification in the batch experiment rrsulfide rrnitrite and grsulfur were shown in fig s3 the variation of rrsulfide was similar under different influent toc conditions which could be summarized into three stages a rapid rise stage 0 6 h b stationary stage 7 10 h and c descent stage 11 48 h at rapid rise stage rrsulfide with toc 15 75 mg l was close to or higher than rrsulfide with toc 0 mg l and the higher toc was the greater the removal velocity of s2 was however the removal velocity of s2 with toc 100 mg c l was lower than that with toc 0 mg c l s2 oxidation to s0 was an intermediate step of s2 oxidation to so4 2 which had a greater reaction velocity than s2 oxidation to so4 2 under the conditions of limited no2 more organics could provide more electrons for no2 reduction which promoted s2 oxidation to s0 to enhance the removal velocity of s2 11 however toc 100 mg c l was too high and inhibited the activity of autotrophic sdb 16 thus the removal velocity of s2 was low in the descent stage rrsulfide declined sharply with toc 15 100 mg c l the greater toc was the greater rrsulfide decline range was and the earlier the time to start the decline of rrsulfide was srb has the long attaching growth time of about 22 h 28 in this reactor srb used so4 2 as the substrate for growth and metabolism while so4 2 was the metabolite of sdb the generation of so4 2 lasted for some time further lengthening the growth time of srb as time passed by srb began to appear in the descent stage the high toc began to promote srb reducing so4 2 to s2 thus the concentration of s2 increased to cause rrsulfide decrease at rapid rise stage rrnitrite with toc 0 100 mg c l rose rapidly in 0 6 h the higher toc was the higher the removal velocity of no2 was no2 with toc 15 mg c l was removed completely in 24 h while rrnitrite with toc 75 100 mg c l reached 100 in 6 h like s2 used by sdb facultative heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria could also use organics to reduce no2 for energy metabolism and cell synthesis 29 at rapid rise stage the electron donors in the reactor were mainly organics and s2 the higher toc was the more electrons were supplied for no2 removal however when organics and s2 were consumed completely s0 became the electron donor the ability of s0 particles to release electrons was weaker making the denitrification velocity begin to decrease 30 the variation of grsulfur was generally divided into two stages a rising stage 0 6 h and b descent stage 6 48 h at a stage grsulfur in each flask rose gradually and reached the maximum value at 6 h the maximum grsulfur in the flasks of toc 15 75 mg c l were all higher than that of toc 0 mg c l the influent organics provided the extra electrons for no2 reduction thus s2 oxidation to s0 rather than to so4 2 could provide enough electrons therefore the organics promoted grsulfur to increase before 6 h however grsulfur in each flask showed a downward trend at b stage with toc 50 mg c l the higher toc was the less the decline of grsulfur was with toc 50 mg c l the higher toc was the greater the decline of grsulfur was fang et al 31 also found a similar phenomenon that low toc enhanced the generation of s0 and inhibited s0 oxidation to so4 2 in the short term because s2 had a higher ability to release electrons than s0 no2 was more inclined to oxidize s2 to s0 and then continued to oxidize s0 to so4 2 to obtain a faster conversion rate 32 after 6 h s2 in the flask was consumed completely and then s0 continued to react with the remaining no2 decreasing grsulfur with toc 50 mg c l the higher toc the more electrons could be released to slow down the conversion of s2 to so4 2 meanwhile organics were inevitably used by srb to reduce so4 2 to slow down the increase of so4 2 with toc 50 mg c l toc was high to promote s0 reduction to s2 and significantly decreased grsulfur 33 at 24 h grsulfur with toc 0 75 100 mg c l suddenly declined below 0 but recovered soon the autotrophic sdb died with time gonging because the nutritional substrates were exhausted toc 0 mg c l or the inhibition of high toc toc 75 100 mg c l and so4 2 stored in sdb was released into the wastewater subsequently so4 2 was gradually reduced to s2 by srb to enhance grsulfur slightly considering the removal velocity and rate of s2 and no2 as well as the generation stability and rate of s0 the optimal toc for sbad was 30 50 mg c l 3 2 bioreactor performances with low toc and different reflux ratios variations of rrnitrite rrsulfide grsulfur toc and so4 2 concentration in influent low toc and zero toc reactors with different reflux ratios were shown in fig 2 respectively under reflux ratio 0 and influent toc 30 mg c l rrnitrite was stable at 100 rrsulfide declined to 85 and then rose to 96 grsulfur decreased to 15 on the 5th day and then gradually recovered to 40 because sdb and hdb consumed no2 which was limited in the reactor rrnitrite stabilized at a high level as sdb was inhibited by organics initially 13 hdb gained a temporary advantage in the competition for electron acceptors however with the gradual adaptation of sdb to the low toc environment rrsulfide gradually recovered because the activated sludge was initially domesticated the reactor was operated with the reflux at start up time then the reflux was withdrawn from the reactor at the first stage when the reflux ratio s effect operation began s0 was gradually accumulated in the activated sludge and further oxidized to so4 2 without reflux making grsulfur below 0 on the 5th day meanwhile some autotrophic microorganisms were progressively eliminated in the low toc environment their cytoplasm and stored substances were released to provide electrons for denitrification 34 reducing the demand for sdb to obtain electrons from s0 oxidation therefore grsulfur gradually recovered under reflux ratio 0 and influent toc 0 mg c l rrnitrite and rrsulfide were stable at 100 but grsulfur decreased from 43 to 6 because sdb tended to convert s0 to so4 2 when the electron donors were limited it was found by comparison that organics improved the activity of heterotrophic bacteria but low toc was insufficient to threaten the dominant position of sdb moreover low concentration organics were gradually converted into co2 promoting the growth of sdb 35 which further improved the intensity of desulfurization denitrification and increased rrsulfide and grsulfur it was consistent with the results of the previous batch experiment under reflux ratio 0 5 and influent toc 30 mg c l grsulfur plummeted to 0 03 and then rose to 18 the microorganisms were reported to secrete more eps for the increasing water scour 22 and the slightly increasing shear force was insufficient to overcome the adhesion of eps for s0 36 s0 accumulated in the activated sludge was oxidized to so4 2 making grsulfur a negative value but subsequently eps and the dissolution of microbial residues provided more electrons for denitrification making grsulfur slowly rise again 37 under reflux ratio 0 5 and influent toc 0 mg c l grsulfur briefly increased to 20 but subsequently declined to 8 0 in the autotrophic reaction system the ability of autotrophic bacteria to secrete eps was weaker than that of heterotrophic bacteria 35 with the increasing velocity the water flow washed s0 off the activated sludge and increased grsulfur in the short term however when s2 was consumed s0 was more likely to be oxidized to so4 2 decreasing grsulfur gradually it was found by comparison that the slight increase of reflux ratio had a high effect on grsulfur microorganisms in toc 30 mg c l reactor could fast adapt to the new environment grsulfur in the low toc reactor increased gradually and was higher than that in the zero toc reactor under reflux ratio 1 0 and influent toc 30 mg c l rrsulfide briefly declined to 91 and then increased to 99 grsulfur and so4 2 concentration fluctuated wildly the reflux ratio continued to rise and the increased water flow shear force eliminated the microorganisms with weak adhesion thus much soluble organic substances were released and improved the activity of hdb 38 hdb temporarily dominated the competition with sdb decreasing rrsulfide meanwhile the increasing toc promoted srb to reduce s0 so4 2 to s2 which decreased rrsulfide when the limited organics were consumed sdb dominated the reactor again and increased rrsulfide to 99 because the concentration of dissolved organics was not stable the interaction between the electron donors and electron acceptors was also unstable making concentration of so4 2 fluctuate wildly under reflux ratio 1 0 and influent toc 0 mg c l grsulfur rapidly increased to 32 and then declined to 0 05 the water flow velocity in the zero toc reactor increased again and the newly generated s0 together with the s0 adhered to the activated sludge were washed out resulting in a sharp rise of grsulfur however because the electron donors were limited in the zero toc reactor s0 had to be oxidized to so4 2 to supply enough electrons and s0 decreased subsequently it was found by comparison that grsulfur in the low toc reactor was higher than that in the zero toc reactor with high velocity water flow the influent low toc enhanced the interaction between hdb and sdb and prevented s0 oxidation to so4 2 which was conducive to completely removing sulfurous pollutants in the wastewater under reflux ratio 1 5 and influent toc 30 mg c l grsulfur decreased and subsequently increased to about 55 with the reflux ratio increasing the suspended sludge presented semi fluidization and the gap between the biofilm fillers also increased resulting in a significant loss and death of microorganisms the dissolved organics increased and promoted the proliferation of facultative denitrifying bacteria this kind of bacteria tended to convert s2 to so4 2 resulting in a temporary decline of grsulfur however the high shear force washed s0 out gradually and reduced the probability of s0 oxidation to increase grsulfur meanwhile srb in the facultative environment reduced so4 2 to s2 decreasing so4 2 concentration to increase grsulfur under reflux ratio 1 5 and influent toc 0 mg c l grsulfur increased gradually to 25 it was also attributed to the s0 particles washed out of the activated sludge by the increasing water flow shear force however grsulfur could only maintain at about 25 in the zero toc reactor lower than that in the low toc reactor because the electron donors in the reactor were limited the high reflux ratio together with the low toc improved the distribution ratio of s0 in the water phase bringing the high grsulfur under reflux ratio 1 5 the two bioreactors operated stably and the microbial samples were collected at this stage rrnitrite rrsulfide did not change significantly at different stages in the two reactors no2 was the only electron acceptor based on the calculation of electrons 1 mol l s2 oxidation to s0 so4 2 could release 2 8 mol l electrons while no2 reduction to n2 nh4 nh2 used only 3 6 mol l electrons 39 40 s2 oxidation could release 12 50 50 00 mmol l electrons while no2 reduction could accept 10 70 21 40 mmol l electrons therefore the electron donors were relative excessive to the acceptors no2 could obtain sufficient electrons to be completely removed s2 was firstly oxidized to s0 and s0 was further oxidized to so4 2 when s2 was exhausted moreover some s2 and s0 combined to generate s3 2 39 which made rrsulfide maintain at a high level at all the stages with different reflux ratios additionally the mass balance was carried out at this stage as shown in table 1 the generation of 100 62 mg s l so4 2 released 25 16 mmol l electrons in low toc reactor while the generation of 153 84 mg s l so4 2 released 38 46 mmol l electrons in zero toc reactor the removal of 49 88 mg n l no2 in low toc reactor accepted 10 69 21 38 mmol l electrons while the removal of 49 92 mg n l no2 in zero toc reactor accepted 10 70 21 39 mmol l electrons the amounts of apparent released electrons were larger than that of accepted electrons it was attributed to the accumulation of s0 moreover some s2 could combine with s0 to generate intermediate products such as s3 2 39 which made much electron donors accumulated in the initial stages much s0 and s3 2 accumulated in the activated sludge at the initial stages was further oxidized to so4 2 which made the apparent generation amounts of so4 2 and amounts of released electrons increase at the stage with reflux ratio 1 5 3 3 effect of low toc on the bacterial community structure the β diversity index pca was used to explore the bacterial community structure differences between the low toc and zero toc bioreactors as shown in fig s4 the longer the distance between the two points the greater the difference in bacterial community structure was in the low toc reactor the distances of y4 to y1 y3 were long while the distances among y1 y3 were short it indicated that the bacterial community structure in the suspended sludge and biofilms were significantly different but there was no significant difference in the bacterial community structure in biofilms at different positions the organics changed nutritional conditions promoted the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and increased the complexity of bacterial communities 41 the structure of suspended sludge was loose and only microorganisms adapted to the strong water shear force were suitable to survive on it however the fillers provided shelter for microorganisms and the hydraulic conditions surrounding them were relatively stable which was conducive to the attachment and growth of various functional bacteria especially the heterotrophic bacteria 42 therefore the type of bacterial carriers significantly impacted the bacterial community structure of the low toc reactor z4 point in fig s4 was close to z1 but far away from z2 and z3 indicating that the location of activated sludge significantly impacted the bacterial community structure in the zero toc reactor z1 z4 were close to the reactor wall and the considerable inner wall friction made the mass transfer slow and the nutritional substrates limited it was difficult for heterotrophic bacteria to compete with autotrophic ones there the mass transfer at z2 z3 was fast and the biofilms there could retain some microbial residues to provide organics for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria resulting in a more complex microbial community structure 3 4 spatial distribution of functional bacteria in the reactor the distribution of bacteria in the low toc reactor was shown in fig 3 there were four main functional bacteria in the reactor sdb hdb srb and acid producing bacteria apb the bacterial genera with high relative abundance in y1 y4 were similar including sulfurovum desulfocapsa geobacter thauera and pseudomonas but only sulfurovum desulfocapsa and thauera were found as the dominant bacteria in the zero toc reactor sulfurovum was an autotrophic bacterium that could reduce no2 to n2 with s2 s0 as an electron donor 43 the relative abundance of sulfurovum was the highest in the low toc reactor which was 27 8 32 9 28 9 and 74 9 in y1 y4 respectively the semi fluidization of the suspended sludge made it difficult for bacteria to grow however because sulfurovum had flagella to resist strong shear force and the low toc had little inhibition on the autotrophic bacteria 17 sulfurovum could grow on the suspended sludge and dominated y4 the relative abundance of sulfurovum in z1 z4 was 82 2 56 4 68 1 and 90 9 respectively which significantly increased in the biofilms z1 z3 in the zero toc reactor the organics could promote the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria the secretion of eps and biofilm formation 22 and tend to accumulate in biofilms however surrounding the biofilms without influent organics in zero toc reactor toc was low to hinder the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which was conducive for the autotrophic bacteria to dominate in the biofilms desulfocapsa was a typical srb reducing so4 2 to s2 44 while geobacter was the srb reducing s0 to s2 and oxidizing organics to co2 45 the relative abundance of desulfocapsa was 4 12 3 55 2 87 and 4 58 in y1 y4 respectively geobacter was distributed primarily in biofilms its relative abundance was 3 5 2 1 and 1 6 in y1 y3 respectively as the products of s2 oxidation so4 2 and s0 worked with organics to provide the survival substrates for desulfocapsa and geobacter desulfocapsa had flagella suitable for surviving in the suspended sludge and could use co2 to grow with no organics 45 46 which enhanced the relative abundance of desulfocapsa close to the inner wall it was challenging to retain s0 due to the loose structure of suspended sludge thus the relative abundance of geobacter with s0 as substrate was low in y4 eps was secreted in biofilms to adsorb more nutritional substrates 22 promoting the growth of geobacter because s0 particles were more difficult to be used than so4 2 the relative abundance of geobacter was slightly lower than that of desulfocapsa in the zero toc reactor desulfocapsa was found as the only dominant srb which was 9 8 29 4 15 1 and 3 0 in z1 z4 respectively compared with zero toc reactor the relative abundance of desulfocapsa in the low toc reactor was lower due to the lack of influent organics the electron donors in the zero toc reactor were limited thus s0 was over oxidized to so4 2 to release electrons providing so4 2 for desulfocapsa to grow moreover the low toc promoted the growth of apb whose competition for organics was high in the low toc reactor therefore the abundance of srb was low in the low toc reactor thauera and pseudomonas were the typical facultative denitrifying bacteria which could oxidize s2 s0 or organics to reduce no2 47 48 in the low toc reactor thauera was mainly distributed in biofilms and the relative abundance was 2 7 1 6 and 1 2 respectively in y1 y3 pseudomonas was mainly distributed in y3 with a relative abundance of 2 3 under facultative conditions pseudomonas tended to utilize organics while thauera tended to utilize s2 12 49 as discussed in section 3 2 organics tended to accumulate in biofilms and provided beneficial conditions for the facultative denitrifying bacteria to grow the fast mass transfer and suitable water flow shear force in y3 made the organics relatively abundant for pseudomonas growing toc was low in y1 which allowed thauera using s2 to grow in the zero toc reactor only thauera became the dominant bacteria due to the low toc and the relative abundance was 1 1 1 4 2 3 and 0 5 respectively to sum up the low concentration organics were introduced into the reactor increasing the complexity of the symbiotic relationship among microorganisms but making the bacterial community structure more stable 12 and sulfurovum was always the essential dominant bacteria which ensured the efficient operation of the desulfurization denitrification system in addition many kinds of apb have been found in the low toc reactor which could metabolize organics to co2 and h2 50 apb was widely distributed on biofilms especially at y2 the high flow shear force at y2 stimulated the microorganisms to secrete more eps and eliminated many microorganisms with weak adhesion ability 22 these organics provided apb much suitable nutritional substrates and the organic products by apb subsequently moved with the water to y1 and y3 supporting the growth of hdb and srb apb also existed in the zero toc reactor but its species and relative abundance were lower than those in the low toc reactor this difference was mainly caused by the influent organics 3 5 functional genes and sulfur nitrogen transformation pathways picrust was used to predict the genes related to nitrogen sulfur transformation in the low toc reactor as shown in fig 4 in the zero toc reactor the types of functional genes were as shown in fig s5 according to the types of functional genes and the removal of pollutants fig 2 the transformation pathway of sulfur and nitrogen in the low toc environment was analyzed and shown in fig 5 the denitrification functional genes included the assimilatory nitrite reduction genes nira k00366 napa k02567 napb k02568 napc k02569 napd k02570 nape k02571 napf k02572 and napg k02573 the dissimilatory nitrite reduction genes nirb k00362 nird k00363 and nrfa k03385 and the denitrification genes nirk k00368 norq k04748 norb k04564 norc k02305 and nosz k00376 no2 was converted to nitrogenous organics such as amino acids via the assimilatory nitrite reduction 40 no2 was reduced to nh3 via the dissimilatory nitrite reduction 39 for the denitrification process nirk was involved in reducing no2 to nitric oxide no 51 norq norb and norc were involved in reducing no to nitrous oxide n2o n2o reductase encoded by nosz was involved in reducing n2o to n2 52 the relative abundances of assimilatory nitrite reduction and denitrification genes were high in the suspended sludge and biofilms the relative abundance of dissimilatory nitrite reduction genes was high in biofilms it indicated that assimilatory nitrite reduction was the most important pathway for no2 removal in the low toc reactor followed by denitrification in an environment with sufficient toc the denitrifying functional bacterias had to renew themselves and secrete eps quickly to stabilize the microbial micelles under the high shear force 53 the assimilation of no2 played an essential role in synthesizing amino acids 54 additionally the dissimilatory nitrite reduction was more likely to occur with rich organics whereas denitrification tended to occur with limited organics 55 the influent organics diffused from the biofilms area to the suspended sludge area and were gradually consumed along the way making toc higher in biofilms than in the suspended sludge therefore dissimilatory nitrite reduction mainly occurred in biofilms in the low toc reactor in the zero toc reactor the types of functional genes were as shown in fig s5 no2 was removed mainly via the denitrification pathway because denitrification required fewer electrons than assimilatory dissimilatory nitrite reduction the organics directly affected the dominating nitrogen transformation in desulfurization denitrification system the sulfur oxidation functional genes included sqr k17218 fcca k17230 fccb k17229 soxa k17222 soxb k17224 soxc k17225 dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 the sqr and fcca fccb were mainly involved in s2 oxidation to s0 sox soxa soxb and soxc was mainly involved in s2 oxidation to the sulfane and then oxidation to so4 2 56 dsra dsrb participated in s0 s2 oxidation to trisulfide s3 2 and so4 2 57 the relative abundances of sqr and fcca b were high while those of sox and drsa b were low indicating that s2 oxidation to s0 dominated in the low toc reactor it was attributed to the high shear force washing s0 out to avoid oxidation to so4 2 additionally the relative abundance of sulfur oxidation genes in the low toc reactor was lower than that in the zero toc reactor because the influent organics enhanced the intensity of hdb the intensity of sbad was decreased in the competition process and made the abundance of sulfur oxidation genes decline however hdb secreted more antioxidant enzymes to synthesize eps to increase the self aggregation ability 58 eps made the bacterial community structure more stable and provided more electron donors for the efficient operation of the reactor therefore although the influent organics decreased the relative abundance of sulfur oxidation genes it promoted s2 oxidation to s0 which was more conducive to completely removing sulfurous pollutants the functional genes related to the sulfate reduction were shown in fig 4 c including the assimilatory sulfate reduction genes sat k00958 cysc k00860 cysd k00957 cysnc k00955 cysn k00956 cysh k00390 cysj k00380 and cysi k00381 and the dissimilatory sulfate reduction genes apra k00394 aprb k00395 dsra k11180 and dsrb k11181 in the assimilatory sulfate reduction sat cysn cysnc and cysd converted so4 2 to adenosine 5 phosphate sulfate aps cysc converted aps to 3 adenosine phosphate 5 phosphate sulfate paps cysh converted paps to sulfite so3 2 then cysj and cysi converted so3 2 to s2 to finally synthesize organics such as amino acids 41 in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction sat catalyzed the reduction of so4 2 to aps apra and aprb converted aps to so3 2 then dsra and dsrb catalyzed so3 2 to s2 59 the relative abundance of assimilatory sulfate reduction genes in the suspended sludge was higher than in biofilms toc around the suspended sludge was relatively low and srb favors synthesis of sulfur containing amino acids by assimilation under the low toc condition 60 however the relative abundances of cysh cysj and cysi were very low 0 1 indicating that paps was not converted into so3 2 and the assimilatory sulfate reduction in the suspended sludge was incomplete it was reported that some reductants such as organics could catalyze the conversion of paps to s2o3 2 via thiosulfate reductase or polysulfide reductase a chain 61 therefore it was deduced that so4 2 was converted to paps via the assimilatory sulfate reduction in the suspended sludge and then paps was reduced to s2o3 2 or s2 for synthesizing the amino acids in biofilms the relative abundance of genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction was slightly higher than that of genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction the organics around biofilms enhanced dissimilatory sulfate reduction but the low concentration organics in influent were insufficient to enhance dissimilation greatly in the zero toc reactor the dissimilatory sulfate reduction dominated biofilms and the assimilatory sulfate reduction in the suspended sludge stopped at so3 2 so3 2 was diffused into the biofilms z1 z3 and converted into s2 via dissimilatory sulfate reduction hdb had an advantage over srb in competing for organics 62 the influent toc improved the activity of hdb in the low toc reactor while hdb was inhibited under the conditions of limited organics in the zero toc reactor therefore toc for srb increased in the zero toc reactor which was conducive to dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sum up the low influent toc limited the activity of srb changed the type of intermediates in the assimilation sulfate reduction and decreased the intensity of sulfate reduction in the reactor 4 conclusions the bioreactor performances dominant bacteria and functional genes distribution in the low zero toc desulfurization denitrification reactors were analyzed and compared in this work low toc was found conducive to removing s2 and no2 and s2 oxidation to s0 the fillers made the uneven distribution of organics making the heterotrophic bacteria mainly grow on the biofilms in the low toc reactor the dominant bacteria of sulfurovum and desulfocapsa promoted the synergism of sulfide based denitrification and sulfate reduction the genes sqr and fcca fccb dominated the reactor influent organics enhanced assimilatory nitrite reduction and sulfide oxidation but inhibited dissimilatory sulfate reduction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

an optimal condition that reduces ca precipitation the addition of magnesium salts to real drinking water was also investigated as a means of adjusting the ca mg ratio and reducing ca precipitation a test bench was used to examine the effect of water velocity during its conduction on ca precipitation simulating an intermittent water supply the results were analyzed and compared in terms of initial precipitation rate of precipitation and maximum precipitation of ca using a modified model of gompertz and the precipitate was analyzed through x ray diffraction the results of the present work found an optimal ca mg ratio 1 1 that avoided ca precipitation at batch conditions and during water conduction at different velocities as well as ca mg ratios that retarded or increased both the induction time and the maximum rate of ca precipitation chemical conditioning by adjusting the ca mg ratio is a viable option to minimize ca precipitation in pipes keywords ca precipitation ca mg ratio chemical conditioning drinking groundwater intermittent water supply data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water supply systems are prone to scaling and corrosion due to the presence of certain parameters during water conduction particularly alkalinity and hardness these parameters along with certain conditions can result in scaling such scale formations are a major issue in water supply piping as they can cause structural failures and blockages 1 alkalinity in water can have serious implications for human health causing irritation of the eyes skin and mucous membranes as well as gastrointestinal problems 2 hardness is composed principally of calcium with a lesser amount of magnesium it can be present in wastewater as a byproduct of water treatment or in groundwater due to the percolation of water through minerals containing calcium or magnesium limestone and dolomite are two minerals that introduce calcium and magnesium respectively into water systems 3 likewise dominant ions of ca and bicarbonate have been observed in aquifers during different seasons which could be due to the hydrogeochemical process of chemical weathering that controls the chemical species distribution in the groundwater supplies 4 as a result drinking groundwater typically has a high level of hardness as well as several cations like aluminum barium strontium iron zinc and manganese that form stable salts total hardness is a key parameter determining the quality of water and it can be classified as temporary or permanent it is used to categorize water as soft hard or very hard hardness is most often expressed as milligrams of calcium carbonate equivalent per liter water containing calcium carbonate at concentrations below 60 mg l is generally considered soft 60 120 mg l is moderately hard 120 180 mg l is hard and 180 mg l is very hard depending on the chemical properties of water such as ph and alkalinity water with a hardness above approximately 200 mg l can lead to scale deposition in treatment plants as well as in distribution systems washing machines boilers and tanks 2 conversely water with a hardness of 100 mg l may have a low buffering capacity making it more corrosive to water pipes while there is no specific health based guideline value for water hardness it can still affect the taste and acceptability of drinking water for consumers furthermore high levels of hardness in water can influence human health causing cardiovascular disease cancer cerebrovascular mortality effects on the nervous system diabetes alzheimer s disease reproductive health issues kidney stones digestive problems and constipation 5 the world health organization who recommends that the value of hardness in water be within the range of 100 to 300 mg l additionally a guideline value of 500 mg l as calcium carbonate has been established for hardness based on household use considerations and taste 2 alkalinity and hardness present several challenges to complying with water requirements for drinking household or industrial utilities scale deposits can cause significant problems in various systems including cooling waters geothermal wells oil and gas production 1 6 7 and drinking water conduction systems 8 the principal component is calcium carbonate which has been widely studied 7 9 12 research has focused on studying the kinetics of precipitation processes formed in bulk solution 9 or surface deposition 7 evaluating different conditions such as temperature pressure the ionic composition of the water phase and the presence of solids 6 and different approaches have been used to describe the kinetics of the precipitation process and the polymorphs of calcium carbonate 12 various technologies have been developed to reduce scale formation such as ph adjustment removal of scale forming species the addition of chemical inhibitors and magnetic and electric treatment 1 13 treatments for hardness and alkalinity removal include precipitation membrane filtration coagulation ion exchange and adsorption 14 some disadvantages are presented in these chemical processes such as a large amount of sludge produced cost of investment operation and maintenance the addition of chemicals to adjust the ph or re carbonation of the softened water as well as the use of chemicals that could affect the quality desirable to potable water use 1 another technique uses citric acid with laminar flow to control caco3 scale deposition on the piping system 15 one more solution is reducing ph by injecting co2 into the water this reacts with water to produce hydrogen ions h increasing the solubility of carbonates and in addition reducing the overall carbon footprint of the process 16 but it must be considered that co2 could be released by the change in pressure obtained during water conduction through the elements of the water network however the implementation of the present technologies is difficult to be applied especially in developing countries where investment and operation costs are significant hurdles 17 overall more research is needed to develop effective and affordable technologies for reducing scale formation in water supply systems drinking groundwater can lead to recurrent piping obstructions due to the presence of high levels of alkalinity and hardness 8 the composition of this water often includes alkalinity ranging from 175 to 200 mg l ph in a range of 7 9 and a temperature of 20 c 30 c with varying levels of hardness 18 20 interestingly analysis of different drinking groundwater sources has shown that water sources with the highest levels such as those in water supply systems f to i as shown in fig 1 do not typically experience piping obstruction problems in contrast sources with the lowest levels of hardness such as those in water supply systems a to e despite being within the recommended values of 100 200 mg l present recurrent issues of piping obstruction further analysis has revealed that the ca mg ratio of the water sources could play a crucial role in causing piping scaling in distribution systems specifically sources with ca mg ratios 2 are linked to problems of piping scaling whereas sources with ca mg ratios 1 do not exhibit this problem fig 1 therefore the primary cause of ca precipitation leading to piping obstruction could be related to the ca mg ratio value in water sources rather than the level of hardness alone groundwater contains various ions that can significantly impact the kinetics of ca precipitation the induction time mineral growth rate and composition are all susceptible to alteration due to the incorporation of numerous trace elements 21 reports indicate that the critical saturation ratio for caco3 precipitation is subject to fluctuation based on temperature as well as the concentrations of mg2 and so4 2 ions in the water 6 and other ions like sr 21 these factors are of great interest in the field of geochemistry due to the occurrence and composition of magnesian calcites influenced by different physicochemical factors such as temperature growth rate mg2 ca2 ratios presence of foreign ions and polymers pco2 saturation state of water and transport conditions 22 other reports include the study of the kinetics of calcium carbonate precipitation both in the bulk solution and on the metal surface at different ca mg ratios 7 11 a report includes the results obtained for the kinetics of ca and mg where hco3 was the counter ion in synthetic and real groundwater 9 despite the research conducted on the effect of mg on ca precipitation no studies have yet been conducted on the relationship between ca mg and alkalinity concentrations found in drinking groundwater for drinking water during its conduction calcium carbonate formation may occur either homogeneously in the bulk solution or heterogeneously on the walls of pipes the induction time of ca precipitation is influenced by factors such as temperature or the material used for conduction 1 on the other hand intermittent drinking water supplies can also have a significant impact on water quality 23 24 precipitation of calcium could be promoted because when water is not circulating nucleation and mineral growth occur leading to pipe scaling preventing pipe scaling requires an understanding of surface interaction and the presence of other ions during calcium carbonate precipitation during water conduction determining the various parameters of ca precipitation such as induction time rate of precipitation and maximum amount of precipitated calcium can help in establishing an optimal operation mode of water supply that reduces or avoids salt precipitation during water conduction despite the research conducted on the effect of mg on ca precipitation adjusting the ca mg ratio has not been considered as a drinking water treatment to reduce or avoid ca precipitation moreover the effect of the ca mg ratio on ca precipitation during water conduction at different velocities has not been studied the present work aims to fill these gaps through the study of the ca mg ratio effect on ca precipitation this is with the objective of probing the adjustment of the ca mg ratio of real drinking groundwater as chemical conditioning to avoid ca precipitation during water conduction the optimal ca mg ratio that avoids ca precipitation was studied following the next points i conducting experiments on ca precipitation at different ca mg ratios and both initial ca and alkalinity concentrations this under batch experiments for synthetic and real drinking groundwater ii adjusting the ca mg ratio via the addition of mg salts to real drinking water to obtain the optimal ratio that avoids ca precipitation iii probing the ca mg ratio effect and ca precipitation at different velocities of water conduction simulating intermittent water conduction this through a test bench and for synthetic and real drinking groundwater at different ca mg ratios data obtained from the kinetics of ca precipitation at different experimental conditions was processed and adjusted using a modified gompertz model with the aim of obtaining and discussing the induction time rate of precipitation and maximum amount of precipitated calcium in addition the characterization and comparison of the precipitate obtained during the experiments with precipitate from real water networks were done using x ray diffraction xrd 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch experiments experiments of precipitation of calcium in drinking groundwater were done using both synthetic and real water samples the composition of the synthetic water was based on the same levels of hardness and alkalinity as real drinking groundwater table 1 lists the different initial concentrations of ca alkalinity and different ca mg ratios that were tested additional information on the chemical composition of the samples is presented in table s1 of the supporting information si the synthetic water was prepared by mixing a mgcl2 6h2o and caso4 2h2o solution with a nahco3 solution initially mgcl2 6h2o fermont 99 9 purity was dissolved followed by caso4 2h2o fermont 98 4 purity in the same solution it was observed that the solubility of caso4 was improved when mgcl2 was added first to the solution the nahco3 fermont 99 9 purity solution was prepared separately next the salts were completely dissolved and both solutions were mixed the solutions were all prepared using deionized water and different concentrations of mgcl2 6h2o were added to achieve various ca mg hardness concentration ratios for experiments using real water the water was collected from wells and transported to the laboratory next two series of experiments were conducted adding either mgcl2 6h2o or mgso4 7h2o fermont 99 9 purity in stoichiometric concentrations to obtain different ca mg ratios as shown in table 1 the final volume of all solutions was 1 l the kinetics of precipitation were measured in glass flasks sealed without stirring the experiments were conducted at two different temperatures 20 1 c and 25 1 c which correspond to the temperature range typically found in drinking water piping the experiments at 25 1 c were heated to the desired temperature using a hot plate with a pid temperature controller which was fitted in one of the necks through a thermocouple the temperature was controlled with an accuracy of 1 c samples were taken from the flasks and monitored over time to measure ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec the ca hardness total hardness and alkalinity concentrations were also determined the ph and ec were measured using a multimeter and electrodes thermoscientific orion star a329 ph ise the ca concentration was obtained from the calcium hardness while the mg concentration was determined by the difference between the total hardness and ca hardness the hardness and alkalinity values were determined using standard methods 25 2 2 data processing the data obtained for ca precipitation results were adjusted using a modified model of gompertz which is employed to describe growth data according to mathematical parameters 26 normally utilized to describe the activity of microbial growth however it was considered appropriate to describe ca precipitation our results showed a correlation coefficient higher than 0 9 the expression describing this model is as follows 1 y aexp exp μ m e a λ t 1 fitting the data was done by plotting the ca concentration that precipitates y against the time t see fig s1 the parameters of the equation were resolved where μ m represents the maximum ca precipitation attained during a certain period resulting in a lag time λ or in our case an induction time additionally the production curves exhibit a final phase where the rate of precipitation decreases until it finally reaches the maximum precipitation rate leading to an asymptote a being reached and e exp 1 2 3 test bench the test bench was constructed using hydraulic pvc pipes of inside diameters to generate specific water velocities during conduction the pipe diameters were 18 2 mm 1 2 20 7 mm 3 4 29 4 mm 1 and 34 2 mm 1 1 4 which correspond to velocities of 1 9 m s 1 6 m s 0 8 m s and 0 6 m s respectively a detailed diagram of the test bench can be found in fig s2 the flow rate was determined through a rotameter located at the outlet of the pump and the start of pipe conduction a centrifugal pump with ½ hp was used to pump the water through the piping the bench test was tested using synthetic drinking groundwater at two conditions of ca mg 3 8 and 1 1 both at an initial alkalinity concentration of 200 mg l as caco3 and an initial ca concentration of 46 1 mg l table 1 real drinking water was tested at two conditions the first one at the ca mg 4 8 which doesn t have an adjustment of ca mg ratio and the second test was with adjustment of ca mg 1 1 better ca mg ratio determined through previous batch experiments salts were added to the solutions following the same procedure as the assays with synthetic and real water at batch conditions with 10 l of solution being prepared the experimentation was conducted at a laboratory temperature of 20 c 1 c to simulate an intermittent water supply water conduction was performed for 15 min twice a week after being recirculated the water was kept inside the pipe by valves placed on the extremes of the pipe the test bench was designed to ensure that the different velocities were tested under the same contact area 0 32 m2 a control experiment was also performed in piping where no water conduction was taking place water samples were taken from the pipes before being piped the parameters and data processing were consistent with those in previous batch experiments 2 4 x ray diffraction analysis the precipitate samples obtained from experiments with synthetic water under batch conditions and real water conducted in the 1 in test bench were analyzed by xrd d8advance bruker diffractometer with cu kα radiation these samples correspond to the experiments that presented precipitation furthermore they were compared to precipitate samples collected from the real pipe water network that experienced obstruction problems 3 results and discussion 3 1 description of the kinetics of ca precipitations using a modified model of gompertz different sections may be seen during ca precipitation using the modified model of gompertz fig s1 for region 1 no ca precipitation is observed and ec and alkalinity values remained practically constant corresponding to the induction time λ for the water distribution system the time of initial ca precipitation λ could be considered the limit within which water must be conducted in the water distribution system and be used by the users if the induction time for a given supersaturation is longer than the retention time of the water in the distribution system the scale might not form it is relevant for distribution systems that operate under intermittent water supply conditions for region 2 calcium starts to precipitate and values of ec and alkalinity begin to reduce the amount of ca precipitated increases rapidly for a specific time μ and values of ec and alkalinity are reduced the maximum rate of precipitation takes relevance if the water is inside the piping during a stop of conduction because of the intermittent water thus more ca precipitates in the water distribution system next a slower rate of ca precipitation occurs and the precipitation rate reaches its maximum it is supposed to be caused by the decrease in saturation index caused by the precipitation of the chemical species 10 the values of ec and alkalinity stop reducing in this region the solution gradually approaches equilibrium a this means that a gives the value of total ca that could be precipitated in the water distribution system monitoring the variation of parameters associated with the calcium precipitation yields information concerning the kinetics and potential amount of ca that can be precipitated 3 2 synthetic water initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l at 20 c the lower values of λ correspond to high ca mg ratios ca mg 11 approximately 129 h the rise in mg concentration ca mg 2 2 and 7 7 increases the induction time to higher values than 400 h see fig 2 a a higher amount of mg gives ca mg 1 and 0 7 which avoids ca precipitation so λ doesn t have any value the control experiment absent of mg is located at ca mg 0 and the induction time for this experiment shows similar values ca mg 2 2 and 7 1 while in comparison with ca mg 11 it shows a reduction of λ which means that the mg in low concentration could increase ca precipitation the saturation index increases with the increase in mg concentration and therefore ca mg is reduced nonetheless the ca precipitation is dependent on the ca mg ratio the ca mg ratio modified caco3 precipitation even at rather high supersaturation forming a metastable state in the solution it will therefore not precipitate despite being thermodynamically unstable 6 at 25 c induction time is reduced particularly near ca mg 4 and reaches its maximum at ca mg 0 7 fig 2 a as in experiments at 20 c the initial ca precipitation is delayed with the increase in mg concentration thus the increase in temperature reduces the induction time of ca precipitation even at the most stable ratios obtained at 20 c the maximum rate of precipitation is reduced with the increase of mg at 20 c fig 2 b while at 25 c a low difference between the different ca mg ratios probed was obtained the μ at 25 c is higher than at 20 c the temperature could increase the saturation state and enhance the rate of calcite precipitation 27 control experiments show nearly equal or higher μ values than experiments with the presence of mg some works report that mg affects the crystallization process of caco3 and a general agreement exists over its inhibiting effect on the growth of calcite affecting induction time and the precipitation rate 22 mg inhibits growth primarily by kink blocking and impedes crystal growth by either blocking the propagation of the kink 21 the maximum amount of ca that could be precipitated was reduced at the lowest ca mg ratios at 20 c fig 2 c while at 25 c a low difference of a was obtained between the different ca mg ratios tested thus the better ca mg ratio for these initial alkalinity and ca values is ca mg between 0 7 and 1 at 20 c because no ca precipitation was obtained at 25 c ca precipitation is present however λ is increased at ca mg 0 7 nonetheless mg precipitation was determined at ca mg 0 7 for both temperatures figs s3 a and s4 a this could be due to the high concentration of mg at this ratio some studies report increases in mg2 in the bulk solution to increase the induction time 7 10 11 28 another study reports that magnesium exponentially decreases the rate of calcite precipitation even at very low concentrations 21 nonetheless the results of the present work found an optimal ca mg ratio that avoided ca precipitation as well as ca mg ratios that retarded or increased both the induction time and the maximum rate of ca precipitation 3 3 synthetic water initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 36 mg l precipitation of ca was absent in almost all the ca mg ratios tested at 20 c fig 3 the unique experiments that showed precipitation were the control experiment and the assay with the highest ca mg ratio of 9 while the other ca mg ratios in a range of 0 7 to 7 4 did not show ca precipitation the induction time for the control and ca mg 9 has a low value of 61 h fig 3 a a slow reduction in mg concentration was obtained at ca mg 0 9 see fig s5 a precipitation of mg has been observed to be small compared to ca precipitation 9 at 25 c ca precipitation was not present at ca mg 0 7 whereas for the ca mg ratios from 1 8 to 9 λ was increased with the increase of mg concentration for control experiments these had similar results at 20 c and 25 c the maximum rate of precipitation was similar in both the control experiment and the highest ca mg ratio at 20 c this value is near the experiment with an initial ca of 46 mg l thus low mg concentrations did not show any effect on ca precipitation for 25 c μ starts to increase until a maximum value at ca mg 6 3 next this is reduced until ca mg 0 7 where μ 0 and a 0 fig 3 b for the maximum ca precipitated at 25 c see fig 3 c this was nearly the same amount of ca for ca mg 1 8 to 9 his means that the worst ca mg ratio at these conditions is 6 3 because the lowest λ and both the highest values of μ and a were obtained the best conditions at 20 c were ratios between 0 7 and 7 4 whereas at 25 c ca mg 0 7 was the better ratio in comparison with previous initial conditions even though ca concentration is lower the experiments at 25 c show lower values of λ and a than the experiments with an initial ca concentration of 46 mg l 3 4 synthetic water initial alkalinity of 175 mg l caco3 and ca 56 mg l a difference in results from the previous initial conditions was observed high initial ca concentration and lower alkalinity showed that the increase in mg concentration reduced the induction time fig 4 a this could be due to the other conditions reaching a metastable solution at a higher concentration of alkalinity despite the fact that increasing mg concentration reduces the induction time at ca mg 0 7 the ca does not show precipitation at 20 c whereas at 25 c the induction time reduction with the increase of mg concentration shows a considerable reduction at ca mg ratio nearly to 4 his was a similar behavior observed for the experiment with an initial alkalinity concentration of 200 mg l and ca 46 mg l at 25 c next an increase in induction time with the increase in mg concentration was observed for the maximum ca precipitation it has a similar behavior at both 20 c and 25 c μ is reduced with the increase of mg concentration obtaining the lowest values at ca mg 0 7 fig 4 b the same behavior was observed for the maximum ca precipitated this is reduced with the increase in mg concentration the best ca mg ratio for both temperatures is ca mg nearly to 0 7 ca did not show precipitation at 20 c whereas at 25 c despite the induction time is reduced μ and a have the lower values for all the ca mg ratios tested nonetheless precipitation of magnesium was observed low precipitations were obtained at 20 c but these were higher at 25 c and ca mg 0 6 whereas at ca mg 0 9 it was very low figs s7 a and s8 a the results show some variances between the experiments performed at different initial concentrations of ca and or alkalinity nonetheless ca mg 0 7 was the better ratio to avoid or reduce ca precipitation at different initial concentrations of ca alkalinity and temperature but precipitation of mg could be present thus a ratio gradually higher than 1 0 reduces both ca and mg precipitation 3 5 real water initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 48 mg l the ca mg ratio of samples of real drinking groundwater with an initial concentration of alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 48 mg l was adjusted through the addition of mg2 using mgcl2 or mgso4 the adjustment of ca precipitation results using the modified model of gompertz was difficult for experiments performed at 20 c due to the low precipitation of calcium on the other hand experiments with adjustment of ca mg using mgcl2 showed higher ca precipitation than experiments using mgso4 at 25 c ca precipitation was increased in comparison with experiments at 20 c similar behavior was observed for both series of experiments induction time was slightly reduced with the increase in mg concentration nevertheless a considerable reduction at ca mg 4 was obtained even when real water has a ca mg ratio of 4 8 fig 5 a this behavior was also observed for the conditions of synthetic water both at an initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l and at an initial alkalinity of 175 mg l caco3 and ca 56 mg l thus the ca mg ratio of nearly 4 has a singular effect on the reduction of induction time for mgcl2 experiments the induction time for the next ca mg ratios increased with the increase of mg concentration until the ca mg ratio of 0 7 whereas for mgso4 assays λ increases for ca mg of 0 6 and 1 these ratios did not show precipitation of ca fig 5 a the μ was reduced with the increase of mg concentration at the same rate as the results of synthetic water with an exception at ca mg 2 which shows a high rate of ca precipitation for the mgcl2 experiment fig 5 b the same behavior was obtained for the maximum ca precipitation fig 5 c except for ca mg 1 1 where even a reduction in μ and an increase in λ were obtained thus mgso4 was shown to be a better option to adjust the ca mg ratio some works report that the crystal growth of calcite is reduced by so4 2 ions in the water both mg2 and so4 2 retard the induction time and slow the growth rate of the crystal more than when only magnesium is added 6 27 29 preliminary studies established that sulfate and chloride loss from solution did not occur during the caco3 precipitation reaction 9 the inhibiting effect of magnesium is enhanced if so4 2 is present but the inhibitory effect of so4 2 is less than the mg2 effect 30 experiments using mgso4 stop ca precipitation from a ca mg ratio of 1 1 to 0 6 while assays using mgcl2 do it until a ca mg ratio of 0 7 at 25 c using mgso4 to adjust the ca mg to 0 6 a lower precipitation of ca was obtained however a higher mg precipitation was observed compared to ca mg 1 0 where very low ca and mg precipitation was obtained figs s9 and s10 thus mgso4 was selected to adjust the ca mg ratio for the experiments performed on the test bench and the ca mg ratio elected was 1 1 because it reduces ca and mg precipitation in addition this ratio also reduced the amount of mg salt used to adjust the ca mg ratio in real water in comparison with a ca mg ratio of 0 6 0 7 in comparison with the experiments using synthetic water both at 20 c and 25 c the adjustment of the ca mg ratio showed better results reducing or avoiding ca precipitation for experiments with real drinking water this could be due to the precipitation kinetics are typically slower in natural fluids than in simple growth solutions due to the blocking of active growth sites by adsorbed ions or molecules present in water 21 thus the adjustment of the ca mg ratio has the feasibility to retard or avoid ca precipitation as a treatment of real water 3 6 bench test synthetic and real drinking groundwater a comparison of two conditions probed for synthetic water shows a clear difference in λ μ and a parameters fig 6 induction time was higher for ca mg 1 1 than for ca mg 3 8 as was expected in accordance with batch experiment results thus the ca mg ratio influences ca initial precipitation during conduction at different velocities nonetheless interestingly results show that the increase in water conduction velocity increases the induction time see fig 6 a it means that the initial precipitation of ca is slower with the increase in velocity in comparison with batch experiments induction time was reduced because of the velocity of conduction the unique condition that doesn t show ca precipitation was the control experiment 0 m s thus the material of the pipe pvc does not influence ca precipitation at this ca mg ratio for ca mg 3 8 the solution shows precipitation of ca as was observed in batch experiments in batch experiments ca did not precipitate at ca mg 1 1 however during water conduction precipitation of ca was observed see fig 6 thus the stability of the solution at this ca mg ratio at batch conditions is affected by the velocity of water conduction and promotes ca precipitation ca mg 1 1 showed a singular effect at a velocity of 0 8 m s where induction time was highly reduced in comparison with other velocities concerning to μ this increase for both ca mg ratios tested according to the increase of velocity is higher for ca mg 1 1 than for ca mg 3 8 this could be due to the higher saturation of chemical species due to the fact that the ratio of 1 1 has a higher concentration of mg than the ratio of 3 8 fig 6 b however the maximum amount of ca that could be precipitated was higher for ca mg 3 8 obtaining higher precipitation than batch experiments some works report a greater inhibiting effect of mg on bulk precipitation than surface deposition in an agitation system as well as ca precipitation which is inhibited in proportion to the concentration of mg in the bulk solution 7 10 11 differences with the present study could be due to higher ca and mg concentrations tested in other studies for the present study ca precipitated was observed in bulk solution the walls of the piping did not show any apparent scaling better results for ca mg 1 1 were obtained compared with ca mg 3 8 this can also be observed in mg precipitation where higher precipitation was obtained for ca mg 3 8 figs s11 and s12 for real drinking groundwater assays bench test results showed lower ca precipitation in comparison with synthetic water similar behavior was obtained for batch experiments results of the real drinking water tested in bench tests at different velocities of water conduction are shown in fig 7 the adjustment of the data using the gompertz modified model showed poor adjustment due to the low precipitation of ca fig 7 shows the results of ca precipitated vs time for this experiment high velocities promote the initial precipitation of ca this effect is contrary to that observed for synthetic water experiments where high velocities extend the induction time this could be explained by the additional ions present in real water which could precipitate at high velocities and promote the ca precipitation magnesium was not precipitated as was obtained for a synthetic water test at nearly the same ca mg ratio fig s13 the precipitation of calcium was observed to be nearly equal for all the velocities tested even for the control experiment this shows an unstable solution that easily has the precipitation of calcium an exception for the experiment was obtained at water conducted at 0 8 m s fig 7 this velocity also showed a particular deviation from the expected in experiments performed with synthetic water where both induction time was reduced and the maximum rate of precipitation see fig 6 a and 6 b for this case an increase in ca precipitation was observed this could be due to the precipitation of certain solids depending on the velocity of water conduction which affects the stability of the solution some studies report the precipitation of minerals depending on the velocity of water conduction 31 at a ca mg ratio of 1 1 calcium was not precipitated and all the parameters were maintained constant for the control experiment and all the velocities tested these results are not present in fig 7 to clearly show the relevant results however additional parameters of ec mg concentration and alkalinity can be seen in fig s14 thus real water with an adjustment of the ca mg ratio at 1 1 avoids ca precipitation even if it is conducted at different velocities in comparison with synthetic water results at ca mg 1 1 for real water the presence of other ions enhances the solubility of ca this behavior was also observed in batch experiments previously described thus the adjustment of the ca mg ratio to 1 1 was enough to avoid ca precipitation in real water for both batch experiments and in water conduction at different velocities as well as mg precipitation even though the addition of salts increases the concentrations of some ions present in water the hardness and saturation index also are increased the metastable solution formed by the ca mg ratio avoids ca precipitation both at different initial ca concentrations and different concentrations of alkalinity langelier saturation index lsi is an index used to give information about whether the water of interest is unsaturated lsi 0 neutral lsi 0 or supersaturated lsi 0 with respect to calcium carbonate for its determination it considers the ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids ca2 hco3 and water temperature 32 nonetheless lsi does not consider the mg effect over ca precipitation then water could have a value of lsi 0 indicating scale may form and not present ca precipitation due to its ca mg ratio lsi could overestimate scale formation on the other hand the adjustment of the ca mg ratio through the addition of mg salts adds ions that are usually present in water sources such as chloride and sulfate 3 7 xrd analysis results samples of precipitated obtained from kinetics experiments using synthetic groundwater were collected and analyzed by xrd this was compared for both the analysis of minerals found in the drinking water supply network with problems of piping obstruction and precipitated obtained in the test bench for synthetic groundwater at batch conditions ca precipitated shows a predominance of calcite monohydrated caco3 h2o and calcite caco3 as well as the presence of aragonite caco3 mg could be precipitated as magnesite mgco3 fig s15 a tao chen 2005 found mg2 suppressed vaterite formation and resulted in calcite dominated scale and mg2 adsorbs on the surface of calcites causing the increase in surface roughness and distortion of crystals 7 monohydrocalcite has been observed could be present in a medium containing mgcl2 and mgso4 at mg ca molar ratios of 2 4 6 and 8 33 for the experiments at the test bench the unique experiment with relevant precipitation was the test carried out using real groundwater absent of ca mg ratio adjustment and conducted at 0 8 m s interestingly the precipitated at this operational condition was higher in comparison to other velocities tested analysis of xrd showed that ca was precipitated principally as calcite and caco3 h2o fig s15 b as was obtained for the precipitated obtained in experiments of synthetic groundwater at batch conditions additional possible species are caso4 2h2o and cacl2 some studies report the co precipitation of caco3 and caso4 in piping distribution systems 34 al2sio5 was also determined silicates are commonly obtained in piped obstructed 8 similar chemical species were determined for the sample of precipitated obtained from the real water network fig s15 c during water conduction different velocities of water conduction are operated then possibly affecting and promoting the precipitation of ca as caco3 caco3 h2o cacl2 and caso4 as well as the presence of al2sio5 as was determined even when mg could precipitate as magnesium silicates 35 this was not determined in xrd analysis this could be due to the mg concentration being low in real drinking groundwater this could confirm the fact that scarce magnesium concentration in real drinking groundwater causes calcium precipitation in piping water networks 3 8 general discussion about ca mg ratio adjustment as chemical conditioning of drinking groundwater this treatment is easy to apply and can be carried out especially in developing countries where the application of commonly used treatments to reduce hardness is difficult for reasons such as investment maintenance and the operation of plants even though the adjustment of the ca mg ratio of drinking groundwater treatment seems to be a feasible treatment it is recommended to test different ca mg ratios for every water source under study this is due to the possibility of the presence of other ions in different sources that could affect the ca precipitation during water conduction on the other hand hardness water treatments such as demineralization softening membrane treatment reverse osmosis and others sometimes require a post treatment focus on the addition of calcium and magnesium salts to reduce possible negative health impacts as well as corrosion or aggression of the water and to improve taste 36 37 a certain ca2 concentration is required in drinking water not only to avoid ca precipitation but also because of health reasons where ca is essential for human growth and health drinking water is a source of ca in daily dosage several guidelines recommend 80 ca2 120 mg l as caco3 experts believe that mg2 is also essential to human health however recommendations for minimum or maximum concentration have not been made 2 38 some guidelines establish levels for ca 100 mg l and mg 30 mg l and a maximum admissible concentration for mg 125 mg l 36 thus the addition of mg salts to adjust the ca mg ratio to avoid ca precipitation could be beneficial to give the drinking water the mineral content recommended no health based guideline value is proposed for hardness ph sulfate or chloride in drinking water nonetheless the levels of the ions added must be in accordance with guidelines for drinking water 39 an increase in hardness by mg addition is acceptable because water hardness of 500 mg l is tolerated by consumers but depending on ph and alkalinity hardness above about 200 mg l can result in scale deposition whereas soft waters with a hardness of less than about 100 mg l have a low buffering capacity and may be more corrosive to water pipes nonetheless the treatment proposed in this work increases the hardness but avoids ca precipitation the ph is poorly modified by the ions added but it must be maintained between the recommended range of 6 5 and 9 5 sulfate must be below the considered taste impairment level of 250 mg l and the maximum recommended level of 500 mg l chloride concentrations must be less than about 250 mg l because they can give rise to a detectable taste in water and excessive concentrations increase rates of corrosion of metals in the distribution system depending on the alkalinity of the water thus it is necessary to take care of the final levels of the parameters of the water to make it palatable and non corrosive as well as to meet health requirements the final levels of the parameters will depend on the initial levels in the water under study the presence of excess levels will require post treatment 16 32 37 4 conclusions the optimal ratio of ca mg that avoids ca precipitation at high concentrations of hardness and alkalinity was found through batch experiments and simulating water conduction using a test bench a ca mg ratio near to 1 1 avoids calcium precipitation as well as magnesium precipitation this ratio was probed at batch conditions using synthetic groundwater at 20 c and 25 c with the following characteristics initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 36 mg l and initial concentrations of alkalinity of 175 mg l caco3 and ca 56 mg l this optimal ratio was also found to be the better ratio for the chemical conditioning of real drinking groundwater to avoid calcium precipitation at 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l the optimal ratio was achieved through the adjustment of the ca mg ratio by adding mg salts magnesium was added as mgcl2 or mgso4 mgso4 is more feasible to carry out the treatment both at 20 c and 25 c in batch assays test bench results found that calcium precipitation is affected by both the ca mg ratio and velocity of conduction of water calcium and magnesium precipitation are reduced at lower ca mg ratios for synthetic water high velocities of water conduction retard the induction time of ca precipitation but increase its maximum rate of precipitation and the total quantity of ca precipitated real drinking groundwater ca mg 4 8 presents ca precipitation at different velocities of water conduction high velocities promote the initial precipitation of ca the adjustment of this type of water to a ca mg ratio of 1 1 avoids ca precipitation even if it is conducted at different velocities 0 0 to 1 9 m s this ratio was enough to avoid ca precipitation in real water in batch experiments as well as simulating water conduction then this treatment could be feasible to avoid calcium precipitation although good results were obtained further research must be done considering the presence of other ions and inherent parameters of water conduction such as materials of conduction temperatures and velocities of water conduction this information could be useful for drinking groundwater treatment focused on avoiding calcium precipitation the description of ca precipitation through induction time rate of precipitation and total ca precipitation at different initial conditions gives information for drinking water supply systems that use intermittent supply to determine better times of water supply on the other hand the ca mg ratio could be considered a parameter to select water sources that

12499,drinking groundwater sources can vary in their calcium ca magnesium mg ratios alkalinity levels and temperatures high levels of calcium relative to magnesium in water encourage ca precipitation causing pipe obstruction problems during water distribution ca mg ratio was studied in batch experiments using synthetic and real groundwater at different alkalinity levels and temperatures to obtain an optimal condition that reduces ca precipitation the addition of magnesium salts to real drinking water was also investigated as a means of adjusting the ca mg ratio and reducing ca precipitation a test bench was used to examine the effect of water velocity during its conduction on ca precipitation simulating an intermittent water supply the results were analyzed and compared in terms of initial precipitation rate of precipitation and maximum precipitation of ca using a modified model of gompertz and the precipitate was analyzed through x ray diffraction the results of the present work found an optimal ca mg ratio 1 1 that avoided ca precipitation at batch conditions and during water conduction at different velocities as well as ca mg ratios that retarded or increased both the induction time and the maximum rate of ca precipitation chemical conditioning by adjusting the ca mg ratio is a viable option to minimize ca precipitation in pipes keywords ca precipitation ca mg ratio chemical conditioning drinking groundwater intermittent water supply data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water supply systems are prone to scaling and corrosion due to the presence of certain parameters during water conduction particularly alkalinity and hardness these parameters along with certain conditions can result in scaling such scale formations are a major issue in water supply piping as they can cause structural failures and blockages 1 alkalinity in water can have serious implications for human health causing irritation of the eyes skin and mucous membranes as well as gastrointestinal problems 2 hardness is composed principally of calcium with a lesser amount of magnesium it can be present in wastewater as a byproduct of water treatment or in groundwater due to the percolation of water through minerals containing calcium or magnesium limestone and dolomite are two minerals that introduce calcium and magnesium respectively into water systems 3 likewise dominant ions of ca and bicarbonate have been observed in aquifers during different seasons which could be due to the hydrogeochemical process of chemical weathering that controls the chemical species distribution in the groundwater supplies 4 as a result drinking groundwater typically has a high level of hardness as well as several cations like aluminum barium strontium iron zinc and manganese that form stable salts total hardness is a key parameter determining the quality of water and it can be classified as temporary or permanent it is used to categorize water as soft hard or very hard hardness is most often expressed as milligrams of calcium carbonate equivalent per liter water containing calcium carbonate at concentrations below 60 mg l is generally considered soft 60 120 mg l is moderately hard 120 180 mg l is hard and 180 mg l is very hard depending on the chemical properties of water such as ph and alkalinity water with a hardness above approximately 200 mg l can lead to scale deposition in treatment plants as well as in distribution systems washing machines boilers and tanks 2 conversely water with a hardness of 100 mg l may have a low buffering capacity making it more corrosive to water pipes while there is no specific health based guideline value for water hardness it can still affect the taste and acceptability of drinking water for consumers furthermore high levels of hardness in water can influence human health causing cardiovascular disease cancer cerebrovascular mortality effects on the nervous system diabetes alzheimer s disease reproductive health issues kidney stones digestive problems and constipation 5 the world health organization who recommends that the value of hardness in water be within the range of 100 to 300 mg l additionally a guideline value of 500 mg l as calcium carbonate has been established for hardness based on household use considerations and taste 2 alkalinity and hardness present several challenges to complying with water requirements for drinking household or industrial utilities scale deposits can cause significant problems in various systems including cooling waters geothermal wells oil and gas production 1 6 7 and drinking water conduction systems 8 the principal component is calcium carbonate which has been widely studied 7 9 12 research has focused on studying the kinetics of precipitation processes formed in bulk solution 9 or surface deposition 7 evaluating different conditions such as temperature pressure the ionic composition of the water phase and the presence of solids 6 and different approaches have been used to describe the kinetics of the precipitation process and the polymorphs of calcium carbonate 12 various technologies have been developed to reduce scale formation such as ph adjustment removal of scale forming species the addition of chemical inhibitors and magnetic and electric treatment 1 13 treatments for hardness and alkalinity removal include precipitation membrane filtration coagulation ion exchange and adsorption 14 some disadvantages are presented in these chemical processes such as a large amount of sludge produced cost of investment operation and maintenance the addition of chemicals to adjust the ph or re carbonation of the softened water as well as the use of chemicals that could affect the quality desirable to potable water use 1 another technique uses citric acid with laminar flow to control caco3 scale deposition on the piping system 15 one more solution is reducing ph by injecting co2 into the water this reacts with water to produce hydrogen ions h increasing the solubility of carbonates and in addition reducing the overall carbon footprint of the process 16 but it must be considered that co2 could be released by the change in pressure obtained during water conduction through the elements of the water network however the implementation of the present technologies is difficult to be applied especially in developing countries where investment and operation costs are significant hurdles 17 overall more research is needed to develop effective and affordable technologies for reducing scale formation in water supply systems drinking groundwater can lead to recurrent piping obstructions due to the presence of high levels of alkalinity and hardness 8 the composition of this water often includes alkalinity ranging from 175 to 200 mg l ph in a range of 7 9 and a temperature of 20 c 30 c with varying levels of hardness 18 20 interestingly analysis of different drinking groundwater sources has shown that water sources with the highest levels such as those in water supply systems f to i as shown in fig 1 do not typically experience piping obstruction problems in contrast sources with the lowest levels of hardness such as those in water supply systems a to e despite being within the recommended values of 100 200 mg l present recurrent issues of piping obstruction further analysis has revealed that the ca mg ratio of the water sources could play a crucial role in causing piping scaling in distribution systems specifically sources with ca mg ratios 2 are linked to problems of piping scaling whereas sources with ca mg ratios 1 do not exhibit this problem fig 1 therefore the primary cause of ca precipitation leading to piping obstruction could be related to the ca mg ratio value in water sources rather than the level of hardness alone groundwater contains various ions that can significantly impact the kinetics of ca precipitation the induction time mineral growth rate and composition are all susceptible to alteration due to the incorporation of numerous trace elements 21 reports indicate that the critical saturation ratio for caco3 precipitation is subject to fluctuation based on temperature as well as the concentrations of mg2 and so4 2 ions in the water 6 and other ions like sr 21 these factors are of great interest in the field of geochemistry due to the occurrence and composition of magnesian calcites influenced by different physicochemical factors such as temperature growth rate mg2 ca2 ratios presence of foreign ions and polymers pco2 saturation state of water and transport conditions 22 other reports include the study of the kinetics of calcium carbonate precipitation both in the bulk solution and on the metal surface at different ca mg ratios 7 11 a report includes the results obtained for the kinetics of ca and mg where hco3 was the counter ion in synthetic and real groundwater 9 despite the research conducted on the effect of mg on ca precipitation no studies have yet been conducted on the relationship between ca mg and alkalinity concentrations found in drinking groundwater for drinking water during its conduction calcium carbonate formation may occur either homogeneously in the bulk solution or heterogeneously on the walls of pipes the induction time of ca precipitation is influenced by factors such as temperature or the material used for conduction 1 on the other hand intermittent drinking water supplies can also have a significant impact on water quality 23 24 precipitation of calcium could be promoted because when water is not circulating nucleation and mineral growth occur leading to pipe scaling preventing pipe scaling requires an understanding of surface interaction and the presence of other ions during calcium carbonate precipitation during water conduction determining the various parameters of ca precipitation such as induction time rate of precipitation and maximum amount of precipitated calcium can help in establishing an optimal operation mode of water supply that reduces or avoids salt precipitation during water conduction despite the research conducted on the effect of mg on ca precipitation adjusting the ca mg ratio has not been considered as a drinking water treatment to reduce or avoid ca precipitation moreover the effect of the ca mg ratio on ca precipitation during water conduction at different velocities has not been studied the present work aims to fill these gaps through the study of the ca mg ratio effect on ca precipitation this is with the objective of probing the adjustment of the ca mg ratio of real drinking groundwater as chemical conditioning to avoid ca precipitation during water conduction the optimal ca mg ratio that avoids ca precipitation was studied following the next points i conducting experiments on ca precipitation at different ca mg ratios and both initial ca and alkalinity concentrations this under batch experiments for synthetic and real drinking groundwater ii adjusting the ca mg ratio via the addition of mg salts to real drinking water to obtain the optimal ratio that avoids ca precipitation iii probing the ca mg ratio effect and ca precipitation at different velocities of water conduction simulating intermittent water conduction this through a test bench and for synthetic and real drinking groundwater at different ca mg ratios data obtained from the kinetics of ca precipitation at different experimental conditions was processed and adjusted using a modified gompertz model with the aim of obtaining and discussing the induction time rate of precipitation and maximum amount of precipitated calcium in addition the characterization and comparison of the precipitate obtained during the experiments with precipitate from real water networks were done using x ray diffraction xrd 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch experiments experiments of precipitation of calcium in drinking groundwater were done using both synthetic and real water samples the composition of the synthetic water was based on the same levels of hardness and alkalinity as real drinking groundwater table 1 lists the different initial concentrations of ca alkalinity and different ca mg ratios that were tested additional information on the chemical composition of the samples is presented in table s1 of the supporting information si the synthetic water was prepared by mixing a mgcl2 6h2o and caso4 2h2o solution with a nahco3 solution initially mgcl2 6h2o fermont 99 9 purity was dissolved followed by caso4 2h2o fermont 98 4 purity in the same solution it was observed that the solubility of caso4 was improved when mgcl2 was added first to the solution the nahco3 fermont 99 9 purity solution was prepared separately next the salts were completely dissolved and both solutions were mixed the solutions were all prepared using deionized water and different concentrations of mgcl2 6h2o were added to achieve various ca mg hardness concentration ratios for experiments using real water the water was collected from wells and transported to the laboratory next two series of experiments were conducted adding either mgcl2 6h2o or mgso4 7h2o fermont 99 9 purity in stoichiometric concentrations to obtain different ca mg ratios as shown in table 1 the final volume of all solutions was 1 l the kinetics of precipitation were measured in glass flasks sealed without stirring the experiments were conducted at two different temperatures 20 1 c and 25 1 c which correspond to the temperature range typically found in drinking water piping the experiments at 25 1 c were heated to the desired temperature using a hot plate with a pid temperature controller which was fitted in one of the necks through a thermocouple the temperature was controlled with an accuracy of 1 c samples were taken from the flasks and monitored over time to measure ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec the ca hardness total hardness and alkalinity concentrations were also determined the ph and ec were measured using a multimeter and electrodes thermoscientific orion star a329 ph ise the ca concentration was obtained from the calcium hardness while the mg concentration was determined by the difference between the total hardness and ca hardness the hardness and alkalinity values were determined using standard methods 25 2 2 data processing the data obtained for ca precipitation results were adjusted using a modified model of gompertz which is employed to describe growth data according to mathematical parameters 26 normally utilized to describe the activity of microbial growth however it was considered appropriate to describe ca precipitation our results showed a correlation coefficient higher than 0 9 the expression describing this model is as follows 1 y aexp exp μ m e a λ t 1 fitting the data was done by plotting the ca concentration that precipitates y against the time t see fig s1 the parameters of the equation were resolved where μ m represents the maximum ca precipitation attained during a certain period resulting in a lag time λ or in our case an induction time additionally the production curves exhibit a final phase where the rate of precipitation decreases until it finally reaches the maximum precipitation rate leading to an asymptote a being reached and e exp 1 2 3 test bench the test bench was constructed using hydraulic pvc pipes of inside diameters to generate specific water velocities during conduction the pipe diameters were 18 2 mm 1 2 20 7 mm 3 4 29 4 mm 1 and 34 2 mm 1 1 4 which correspond to velocities of 1 9 m s 1 6 m s 0 8 m s and 0 6 m s respectively a detailed diagram of the test bench can be found in fig s2 the flow rate was determined through a rotameter located at the outlet of the pump and the start of pipe conduction a centrifugal pump with ½ hp was used to pump the water through the piping the bench test was tested using synthetic drinking groundwater at two conditions of ca mg 3 8 and 1 1 both at an initial alkalinity concentration of 200 mg l as caco3 and an initial ca concentration of 46 1 mg l table 1 real drinking water was tested at two conditions the first one at the ca mg 4 8 which doesn t have an adjustment of ca mg ratio and the second test was with adjustment of ca mg 1 1 better ca mg ratio determined through previous batch experiments salts were added to the solutions following the same procedure as the assays with synthetic and real water at batch conditions with 10 l of solution being prepared the experimentation was conducted at a laboratory temperature of 20 c 1 c to simulate an intermittent water supply water conduction was performed for 15 min twice a week after being recirculated the water was kept inside the pipe by valves placed on the extremes of the pipe the test bench was designed to ensure that the different velocities were tested under the same contact area 0 32 m2 a control experiment was also performed in piping where no water conduction was taking place water samples were taken from the pipes before being piped the parameters and data processing were consistent with those in previous batch experiments 2 4 x ray diffraction analysis the precipitate samples obtained from experiments with synthetic water under batch conditions and real water conducted in the 1 in test bench were analyzed by xrd d8advance bruker diffractometer with cu kα radiation these samples correspond to the experiments that presented precipitation furthermore they were compared to precipitate samples collected from the real pipe water network that experienced obstruction problems 3 results and discussion 3 1 description of the kinetics of ca precipitations using a modified model of gompertz different sections may be seen during ca precipitation using the modified model of gompertz fig s1 for region 1 no ca precipitation is observed and ec and alkalinity values remained practically constant corresponding to the induction time λ for the water distribution system the time of initial ca precipitation λ could be considered the limit within which water must be conducted in the water distribution system and be used by the users if the induction time for a given supersaturation is longer than the retention time of the water in the distribution system the scale might not form it is relevant for distribution systems that operate under intermittent water supply conditions for region 2 calcium starts to precipitate and values of ec and alkalinity begin to reduce the amount of ca precipitated increases rapidly for a specific time μ and values of ec and alkalinity are reduced the maximum rate of precipitation takes relevance if the water is inside the piping during a stop of conduction because of the intermittent water thus more ca precipitates in the water distribution system next a slower rate of ca precipitation occurs and the precipitation rate reaches its maximum it is supposed to be caused by the decrease in saturation index caused by the precipitation of the chemical species 10 the values of ec and alkalinity stop reducing in this region the solution gradually approaches equilibrium a this means that a gives the value of total ca that could be precipitated in the water distribution system monitoring the variation of parameters associated with the calcium precipitation yields information concerning the kinetics and potential amount of ca that can be precipitated 3 2 synthetic water initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l at 20 c the lower values of λ correspond to high ca mg ratios ca mg 11 approximately 129 h the rise in mg concentration ca mg 2 2 and 7 7 increases the induction time to higher values than 400 h see fig 2 a a higher amount of mg gives ca mg 1 and 0 7 which avoids ca precipitation so λ doesn t have any value the control experiment absent of mg is located at ca mg 0 and the induction time for this experiment shows similar values ca mg 2 2 and 7 1 while in comparison with ca mg 11 it shows a reduction of λ which means that the mg in low concentration could increase ca precipitation the saturation index increases with the increase in mg concentration and therefore ca mg is reduced nonetheless the ca precipitation is dependent on the ca mg ratio the ca mg ratio modified caco3 precipitation even at rather high supersaturation forming a metastable state in the solution it will therefore not precipitate despite being thermodynamically unstable 6 at 25 c induction time is reduced particularly near ca mg 4 and reaches its maximum at ca mg 0 7 fig 2 a as in experiments at 20 c the initial ca precipitation is delayed with the increase in mg concentration thus the increase in temperature reduces the induction time of ca precipitation even at the most stable ratios obtained at 20 c the maximum rate of precipitation is reduced with the increase of mg at 20 c fig 2 b while at 25 c a low difference between the different ca mg ratios probed was obtained the μ at 25 c is higher than at 20 c the temperature could increase the saturation state and enhance the rate of calcite precipitation 27 control experiments show nearly equal or higher μ values than experiments with the presence of mg some works report that mg affects the crystallization process of caco3 and a general agreement exists over its inhibiting effect on the growth of calcite affecting induction time and the precipitation rate 22 mg inhibits growth primarily by kink blocking and impedes crystal growth by either blocking the propagation of the kink 21 the maximum amount of ca that could be precipitated was reduced at the lowest ca mg ratios at 20 c fig 2 c while at 25 c a low difference of a was obtained between the different ca mg ratios tested thus the better ca mg ratio for these initial alkalinity and ca values is ca mg between 0 7 and 1 at 20 c because no ca precipitation was obtained at 25 c ca precipitation is present however λ is increased at ca mg 0 7 nonetheless mg precipitation was determined at ca mg 0 7 for both temperatures figs s3 a and s4 a this could be due to the high concentration of mg at this ratio some studies report increases in mg2 in the bulk solution to increase the induction time 7 10 11 28 another study reports that magnesium exponentially decreases the rate of calcite precipitation even at very low concentrations 21 nonetheless the results of the present work found an optimal ca mg ratio that avoided ca precipitation as well as ca mg ratios that retarded or increased both the induction time and the maximum rate of ca precipitation 3 3 synthetic water initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 36 mg l precipitation of ca was absent in almost all the ca mg ratios tested at 20 c fig 3 the unique experiments that showed precipitation were the control experiment and the assay with the highest ca mg ratio of 9 while the other ca mg ratios in a range of 0 7 to 7 4 did not show ca precipitation the induction time for the control and ca mg 9 has a low value of 61 h fig 3 a a slow reduction in mg concentration was obtained at ca mg 0 9 see fig s5 a precipitation of mg has been observed to be small compared to ca precipitation 9 at 25 c ca precipitation was not present at ca mg 0 7 whereas for the ca mg ratios from 1 8 to 9 λ was increased with the increase of mg concentration for control experiments these had similar results at 20 c and 25 c the maximum rate of precipitation was similar in both the control experiment and the highest ca mg ratio at 20 c this value is near the experiment with an initial ca of 46 mg l thus low mg concentrations did not show any effect on ca precipitation for 25 c μ starts to increase until a maximum value at ca mg 6 3 next this is reduced until ca mg 0 7 where μ 0 and a 0 fig 3 b for the maximum ca precipitated at 25 c see fig 3 c this was nearly the same amount of ca for ca mg 1 8 to 9 his means that the worst ca mg ratio at these conditions is 6 3 because the lowest λ and both the highest values of μ and a were obtained the best conditions at 20 c were ratios between 0 7 and 7 4 whereas at 25 c ca mg 0 7 was the better ratio in comparison with previous initial conditions even though ca concentration is lower the experiments at 25 c show lower values of λ and a than the experiments with an initial ca concentration of 46 mg l 3 4 synthetic water initial alkalinity of 175 mg l caco3 and ca 56 mg l a difference in results from the previous initial conditions was observed high initial ca concentration and lower alkalinity showed that the increase in mg concentration reduced the induction time fig 4 a this could be due to the other conditions reaching a metastable solution at a higher concentration of alkalinity despite the fact that increasing mg concentration reduces the induction time at ca mg 0 7 the ca does not show precipitation at 20 c whereas at 25 c the induction time reduction with the increase of mg concentration shows a considerable reduction at ca mg ratio nearly to 4 his was a similar behavior observed for the experiment with an initial alkalinity concentration of 200 mg l and ca 46 mg l at 25 c next an increase in induction time with the increase in mg concentration was observed for the maximum ca precipitation it has a similar behavior at both 20 c and 25 c μ is reduced with the increase of mg concentration obtaining the lowest values at ca mg 0 7 fig 4 b the same behavior was observed for the maximum ca precipitated this is reduced with the increase in mg concentration the best ca mg ratio for both temperatures is ca mg nearly to 0 7 ca did not show precipitation at 20 c whereas at 25 c despite the induction time is reduced μ and a have the lower values for all the ca mg ratios tested nonetheless precipitation of magnesium was observed low precipitations were obtained at 20 c but these were higher at 25 c and ca mg 0 6 whereas at ca mg 0 9 it was very low figs s7 a and s8 a the results show some variances between the experiments performed at different initial concentrations of ca and or alkalinity nonetheless ca mg 0 7 was the better ratio to avoid or reduce ca precipitation at different initial concentrations of ca alkalinity and temperature but precipitation of mg could be present thus a ratio gradually higher than 1 0 reduces both ca and mg precipitation 3 5 real water initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 48 mg l the ca mg ratio of samples of real drinking groundwater with an initial concentration of alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 48 mg l was adjusted through the addition of mg2 using mgcl2 or mgso4 the adjustment of ca precipitation results using the modified model of gompertz was difficult for experiments performed at 20 c due to the low precipitation of calcium on the other hand experiments with adjustment of ca mg using mgcl2 showed higher ca precipitation than experiments using mgso4 at 25 c ca precipitation was increased in comparison with experiments at 20 c similar behavior was observed for both series of experiments induction time was slightly reduced with the increase in mg concentration nevertheless a considerable reduction at ca mg 4 was obtained even when real water has a ca mg ratio of 4 8 fig 5 a this behavior was also observed for the conditions of synthetic water both at an initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l and at an initial alkalinity of 175 mg l caco3 and ca 56 mg l thus the ca mg ratio of nearly 4 has a singular effect on the reduction of induction time for mgcl2 experiments the induction time for the next ca mg ratios increased with the increase of mg concentration until the ca mg ratio of 0 7 whereas for mgso4 assays λ increases for ca mg of 0 6 and 1 these ratios did not show precipitation of ca fig 5 a the μ was reduced with the increase of mg concentration at the same rate as the results of synthetic water with an exception at ca mg 2 which shows a high rate of ca precipitation for the mgcl2 experiment fig 5 b the same behavior was obtained for the maximum ca precipitation fig 5 c except for ca mg 1 1 where even a reduction in μ and an increase in λ were obtained thus mgso4 was shown to be a better option to adjust the ca mg ratio some works report that the crystal growth of calcite is reduced by so4 2 ions in the water both mg2 and so4 2 retard the induction time and slow the growth rate of the crystal more than when only magnesium is added 6 27 29 preliminary studies established that sulfate and chloride loss from solution did not occur during the caco3 precipitation reaction 9 the inhibiting effect of magnesium is enhanced if so4 2 is present but the inhibitory effect of so4 2 is less than the mg2 effect 30 experiments using mgso4 stop ca precipitation from a ca mg ratio of 1 1 to 0 6 while assays using mgcl2 do it until a ca mg ratio of 0 7 at 25 c using mgso4 to adjust the ca mg to 0 6 a lower precipitation of ca was obtained however a higher mg precipitation was observed compared to ca mg 1 0 where very low ca and mg precipitation was obtained figs s9 and s10 thus mgso4 was selected to adjust the ca mg ratio for the experiments performed on the test bench and the ca mg ratio elected was 1 1 because it reduces ca and mg precipitation in addition this ratio also reduced the amount of mg salt used to adjust the ca mg ratio in real water in comparison with a ca mg ratio of 0 6 0 7 in comparison with the experiments using synthetic water both at 20 c and 25 c the adjustment of the ca mg ratio showed better results reducing or avoiding ca precipitation for experiments with real drinking water this could be due to the precipitation kinetics are typically slower in natural fluids than in simple growth solutions due to the blocking of active growth sites by adsorbed ions or molecules present in water 21 thus the adjustment of the ca mg ratio has the feasibility to retard or avoid ca precipitation as a treatment of real water 3 6 bench test synthetic and real drinking groundwater a comparison of two conditions probed for synthetic water shows a clear difference in λ μ and a parameters fig 6 induction time was higher for ca mg 1 1 than for ca mg 3 8 as was expected in accordance with batch experiment results thus the ca mg ratio influences ca initial precipitation during conduction at different velocities nonetheless interestingly results show that the increase in water conduction velocity increases the induction time see fig 6 a it means that the initial precipitation of ca is slower with the increase in velocity in comparison with batch experiments induction time was reduced because of the velocity of conduction the unique condition that doesn t show ca precipitation was the control experiment 0 m s thus the material of the pipe pvc does not influence ca precipitation at this ca mg ratio for ca mg 3 8 the solution shows precipitation of ca as was observed in batch experiments in batch experiments ca did not precipitate at ca mg 1 1 however during water conduction precipitation of ca was observed see fig 6 thus the stability of the solution at this ca mg ratio at batch conditions is affected by the velocity of water conduction and promotes ca precipitation ca mg 1 1 showed a singular effect at a velocity of 0 8 m s where induction time was highly reduced in comparison with other velocities concerning to μ this increase for both ca mg ratios tested according to the increase of velocity is higher for ca mg 1 1 than for ca mg 3 8 this could be due to the higher saturation of chemical species due to the fact that the ratio of 1 1 has a higher concentration of mg than the ratio of 3 8 fig 6 b however the maximum amount of ca that could be precipitated was higher for ca mg 3 8 obtaining higher precipitation than batch experiments some works report a greater inhibiting effect of mg on bulk precipitation than surface deposition in an agitation system as well as ca precipitation which is inhibited in proportion to the concentration of mg in the bulk solution 7 10 11 differences with the present study could be due to higher ca and mg concentrations tested in other studies for the present study ca precipitated was observed in bulk solution the walls of the piping did not show any apparent scaling better results for ca mg 1 1 were obtained compared with ca mg 3 8 this can also be observed in mg precipitation where higher precipitation was obtained for ca mg 3 8 figs s11 and s12 for real drinking groundwater assays bench test results showed lower ca precipitation in comparison with synthetic water similar behavior was obtained for batch experiments results of the real drinking water tested in bench tests at different velocities of water conduction are shown in fig 7 the adjustment of the data using the gompertz modified model showed poor adjustment due to the low precipitation of ca fig 7 shows the results of ca precipitated vs time for this experiment high velocities promote the initial precipitation of ca this effect is contrary to that observed for synthetic water experiments where high velocities extend the induction time this could be explained by the additional ions present in real water which could precipitate at high velocities and promote the ca precipitation magnesium was not precipitated as was obtained for a synthetic water test at nearly the same ca mg ratio fig s13 the precipitation of calcium was observed to be nearly equal for all the velocities tested even for the control experiment this shows an unstable solution that easily has the precipitation of calcium an exception for the experiment was obtained at water conducted at 0 8 m s fig 7 this velocity also showed a particular deviation from the expected in experiments performed with synthetic water where both induction time was reduced and the maximum rate of precipitation see fig 6 a and 6 b for this case an increase in ca precipitation was observed this could be due to the precipitation of certain solids depending on the velocity of water conduction which affects the stability of the solution some studies report the precipitation of minerals depending on the velocity of water conduction 31 at a ca mg ratio of 1 1 calcium was not precipitated and all the parameters were maintained constant for the control experiment and all the velocities tested these results are not present in fig 7 to clearly show the relevant results however additional parameters of ec mg concentration and alkalinity can be seen in fig s14 thus real water with an adjustment of the ca mg ratio at 1 1 avoids ca precipitation even if it is conducted at different velocities in comparison with synthetic water results at ca mg 1 1 for real water the presence of other ions enhances the solubility of ca this behavior was also observed in batch experiments previously described thus the adjustment of the ca mg ratio to 1 1 was enough to avoid ca precipitation in real water for both batch experiments and in water conduction at different velocities as well as mg precipitation even though the addition of salts increases the concentrations of some ions present in water the hardness and saturation index also are increased the metastable solution formed by the ca mg ratio avoids ca precipitation both at different initial ca concentrations and different concentrations of alkalinity langelier saturation index lsi is an index used to give information about whether the water of interest is unsaturated lsi 0 neutral lsi 0 or supersaturated lsi 0 with respect to calcium carbonate for its determination it considers the ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids ca2 hco3 and water temperature 32 nonetheless lsi does not consider the mg effect over ca precipitation then water could have a value of lsi 0 indicating scale may form and not present ca precipitation due to its ca mg ratio lsi could overestimate scale formation on the other hand the adjustment of the ca mg ratio through the addition of mg salts adds ions that are usually present in water sources such as chloride and sulfate 3 7 xrd analysis results samples of precipitated obtained from kinetics experiments using synthetic groundwater were collected and analyzed by xrd this was compared for both the analysis of minerals found in the drinking water supply network with problems of piping obstruction and precipitated obtained in the test bench for synthetic groundwater at batch conditions ca precipitated shows a predominance of calcite monohydrated caco3 h2o and calcite caco3 as well as the presence of aragonite caco3 mg could be precipitated as magnesite mgco3 fig s15 a tao chen 2005 found mg2 suppressed vaterite formation and resulted in calcite dominated scale and mg2 adsorbs on the surface of calcites causing the increase in surface roughness and distortion of crystals 7 monohydrocalcite has been observed could be present in a medium containing mgcl2 and mgso4 at mg ca molar ratios of 2 4 6 and 8 33 for the experiments at the test bench the unique experiment with relevant precipitation was the test carried out using real groundwater absent of ca mg ratio adjustment and conducted at 0 8 m s interestingly the precipitated at this operational condition was higher in comparison to other velocities tested analysis of xrd showed that ca was precipitated principally as calcite and caco3 h2o fig s15 b as was obtained for the precipitated obtained in experiments of synthetic groundwater at batch conditions additional possible species are caso4 2h2o and cacl2 some studies report the co precipitation of caco3 and caso4 in piping distribution systems 34 al2sio5 was also determined silicates are commonly obtained in piped obstructed 8 similar chemical species were determined for the sample of precipitated obtained from the real water network fig s15 c during water conduction different velocities of water conduction are operated then possibly affecting and promoting the precipitation of ca as caco3 caco3 h2o cacl2 and caso4 as well as the presence of al2sio5 as was determined even when mg could precipitate as magnesium silicates 35 this was not determined in xrd analysis this could be due to the mg concentration being low in real drinking groundwater this could confirm the fact that scarce magnesium concentration in real drinking groundwater causes calcium precipitation in piping water networks 3 8 general discussion about ca mg ratio adjustment as chemical conditioning of drinking groundwater this treatment is easy to apply and can be carried out especially in developing countries where the application of commonly used treatments to reduce hardness is difficult for reasons such as investment maintenance and the operation of plants even though the adjustment of the ca mg ratio of drinking groundwater treatment seems to be a feasible treatment it is recommended to test different ca mg ratios for every water source under study this is due to the possibility of the presence of other ions in different sources that could affect the ca precipitation during water conduction on the other hand hardness water treatments such as demineralization softening membrane treatment reverse osmosis and others sometimes require a post treatment focus on the addition of calcium and magnesium salts to reduce possible negative health impacts as well as corrosion or aggression of the water and to improve taste 36 37 a certain ca2 concentration is required in drinking water not only to avoid ca precipitation but also because of health reasons where ca is essential for human growth and health drinking water is a source of ca in daily dosage several guidelines recommend 80 ca2 120 mg l as caco3 experts believe that mg2 is also essential to human health however recommendations for minimum or maximum concentration have not been made 2 38 some guidelines establish levels for ca 100 mg l and mg 30 mg l and a maximum admissible concentration for mg 125 mg l 36 thus the addition of mg salts to adjust the ca mg ratio to avoid ca precipitation could be beneficial to give the drinking water the mineral content recommended no health based guideline value is proposed for hardness ph sulfate or chloride in drinking water nonetheless the levels of the ions added must be in accordance with guidelines for drinking water 39 an increase in hardness by mg addition is acceptable because water hardness of 500 mg l is tolerated by consumers but depending on ph and alkalinity hardness above about 200 mg l can result in scale deposition whereas soft waters with a hardness of less than about 100 mg l have a low buffering capacity and may be more corrosive to water pipes nonetheless the treatment proposed in this work increases the hardness but avoids ca precipitation the ph is poorly modified by the ions added but it must be maintained between the recommended range of 6 5 and 9 5 sulfate must be below the considered taste impairment level of 250 mg l and the maximum recommended level of 500 mg l chloride concentrations must be less than about 250 mg l because they can give rise to a detectable taste in water and excessive concentrations increase rates of corrosion of metals in the distribution system depending on the alkalinity of the water thus it is necessary to take care of the final levels of the parameters of the water to make it palatable and non corrosive as well as to meet health requirements the final levels of the parameters will depend on the initial levels in the water under study the presence of excess levels will require post treatment 16 32 37 4 conclusions the optimal ratio of ca mg that avoids ca precipitation at high concentrations of hardness and alkalinity was found through batch experiments and simulating water conduction using a test bench a ca mg ratio near to 1 1 avoids calcium precipitation as well as magnesium precipitation this ratio was probed at batch conditions using synthetic groundwater at 20 c and 25 c with the following characteristics initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l initial alkalinity of 200 mg l caco3 and ca 36 mg l and initial concentrations of alkalinity of 175 mg l caco3 and ca 56 mg l this optimal ratio was also found to be the better ratio for the chemical conditioning of real drinking groundwater to avoid calcium precipitation at 200 mg l caco3 and ca 46 mg l the optimal ratio was achieved through the adjustment of the ca mg ratio by adding mg salts magnesium was added as mgcl2 or mgso4 mgso4 is more feasible to carry out the treatment both at 20 c and 25 c in batch assays test bench results found that calcium precipitation is affected by both the ca mg ratio and velocity of conduction of water calcium and magnesium precipitation are reduced at lower ca mg ratios for synthetic water high velocities of water conduction retard the induction time of ca precipitation but increase its maximum rate of precipitation and the total quantity of ca precipitated real drinking groundwater ca mg 4 8 presents ca precipitation at different velocities of water conduction high velocities promote the initial precipitation of ca the adjustment of this type of water to a ca mg ratio of 1 1 avoids ca precipitation even if it is conducted at different velocities 0 0 to 1 9 m s this ratio was enough to avoid ca precipitation in real water in batch experiments as well as simulating water conduction then this treatment could be feasible to avoid calcium precipitation although good results were obtained further research must be done considering the presence of other ions and inherent parameters of water conduction such as materials of conduction temperatures and velocities of water conduction this information could be useful for drinking groundwater treatment focused on avoiding calcium precipitation the description of ca precipitation through induction time rate of precipitation and total ca precipitation at different initial conditions gives information for drinking water supply systems that use intermittent supply to determine better times of water supply on the other hand the ca mg ratio could be considered a parameter to select water sources that
