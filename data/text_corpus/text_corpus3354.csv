16770,bromine br and iodine i in source water can form highly toxic brominated or iodinated disinfection byproducts in treatment plants for the first time the occurrence of br and i speciation and their proportion transformation in the drinking water supply system along the changjiang river were investigated 96 water samples were collected from eight drinking water treatment plants under conditions of low normal and flood water regimes total br tbr and total i ti concentrations were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms and inorganic br i forms bromide bromate iodide and iodate were determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with icpms concentrations of organic br i were calculated as the difference between total br i and inorganic br i water regimes had different effect on br and i species and there were different rules in untreated and treated water samples apparent increase of tbr and ti concentrations after water treatment were observed which indicated the possibility of br i introduction by chlorine containing disinfectant the occurrence of tbr ti bromide and total organic i in the river were investigated to increase with the direction of flow in addition tbr and ti concentrations correlated with the concentrations of artificial sweeteners e g acesulfame and sucralose a kind of wastewater indicator suggesting the influence of domestic sewage on br and i in the river in untreated water bromide was the main br species and after treatment more than 50 was transformed into organic br iodoorganics were the majority of i species in raw water and were partly transformed into iodate after treatment overall the br i species have accumulation potential in the changjiang river and organic forms occupy high proportion in treated water samples which should be paid more attention keywords bromine iodine drinking water changjiang river transformation 1 introduction bromine br and iodine i species in source water can react with disinfectants such as chlorine chloramines ozone and chlorine dioxide and natural organic matter nom or anthropogenic contaminants to produce a variety of disinfection byproducts dbps during water treatment plewa and richardson 2017 richardson et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 these brominated and iodinated dbps are generally more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs wagner and plewa 2017 among them bromate bro3 is regulated at 10 µg l in drinking water by china china 2006 because of its carcinogenicity and genotoxicity kurokawa et al 1990 weinberg et al 2003 in recent years more brominated and iodinated dbps have been detected in drinking water richardson and temes 2018 necessitating an examination of br i species in supply systems early information on br i species was mainly derived from environmental or geological surveys flury and papritz 1993 moran et al 2002 with growing interest in dbps more attention has been paid to bromide br and iodide i in the water environment and their effect on dbps formation these studies generally focus on researches of reaction kinetics or investigations of byproduct formation during simulated disinfection processes mechanistic studies have outlined the reaction process and products of br i with various disinfectants both chorine and ozone can oxidize br to form hobr or obr which can react with nom to form brominated dbps gallard et al 2003 westerhoff et al 2004 ozone can further oxidize obr to bro3 von gunten 2003 westerhoff et al 1998 additionally chlorine ozone and chloramines can oxidize i to hoi or oi which can react with nom to form iodinated dbps or be further oxidized to iodate io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 in studies on the formation of brominated and iodinated dbps br and i were mostly used as sources of br and i hua et al 2006 tan et al 2016 with the emergence of organic br i contaminants in environmental water dbps formation potential or degradation kinetics have also been studied using the herbicide bromacil hu et al 2019 brominated flame retardants gao et al 2016 and iodinated x ray contrast media jeong et al 2017 however the information on br i species occurrence distribution and transformation before and after water treatment is scarce presently especially in the changjiang river yangtze river china where the supply system provides drinking water for approximately 400 million individuals the br i species are mainly divided as organic and inorganic forms in the researches of halogenated dbps the determination and estimation of tox total organic halogen x can be cl br or i is an essential step generally the tox is determined by absorbable method which mainly includes three steps 1 separation of organic halogen from halides with active carbon 2 conversion of organic halogen into halides and 3 quantification of halides with ion chromatography kristiana et al 2015 or mass spectrometry pan and zhang 2013 pereira et al 2011 in fact the tox quantified by this method is only the absorbable part of total organic halogens and is called as aox absorbable organic halogen to measure the nonionic portion of tox zhang developed a new three step method and the main procedure was 1 separate ionic halogen and organic halogen with electrodialysis 2 converse organic halogen to halides with ultraviolet and 3 analyze halides with ion chromatography zhang et al 2018 this method for tox analysis is complicated and the organic halogen may be lost during separation and conversion procedure since br and bro3 were the stable inorganic br species in water as were i and io3 of i and the remaining fraction was in organic form subtraction can be used to get the concentration of total organic br tobr and total organic i toi specifically total br i can be quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms and inorganic br i forms can be determined by high performance liquid chromatography icpms concentrations of tobr and toi can be calculated as the difference between total br i and inorganic br i species this strategy was used for quantifying br i species in many environmental samples including fresh water gilfedder et al 2009 gilfedder et al 2011 snow gao et al 2018 gilfedder et al 2007 and atmosphere aerosol gilfedder et al 2008 siqi et al 2010 it has been demonstrated with good reliability in rivers near coast br and i mainly originate from seawater intrusion sharma et al 2019 in inland water these halogen species mostly originate from seaborne aerosols flury and papritz 1993 gilfedder et al 2008 with rapid urbanization and industrialization more and more compounds containing br i are discharged into environmental waters gilfedder et al 2008 jeong et al 2017 peng et al 2016 regli et al 2015 sawade et al 2016 in the rhine river of switzerland chemical industries and municipal waste incinerators were identified to be the major sources of br discharge which accounted for approximately 50 and 20 respectively soltermann et al 2016 but in the changjiang river the impact of human activities on br i occurrence is still unclear the present paper describes a method for evaluating the impact of sewage discharge on br i with artificial sweeteners previous studies have made us hypothesize that the artificial sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose could be used as the evaluation marker of br i source ignaz et al 2009 blackstock et al 2017 muller et al 2011 they are the most commonly used artificial sweeteners in many countries including china and are widely used in food drugs beverages and personal care products lange et al 2012 their persistence in environmental water renders them an effective marker of anthropogenic activity in wastewater blackstock et al 2017 muller et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 additionally there are no data on their occurrence in the changjiang river therefore in this paper we determined the concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose in the river and examined their correlations with br i levels to assess the effect of wastewater generally there are three water regimes low normal and flood in the changjiang river temporal and spatial variations have been reported to influence the water quality to some degree liu et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 accordingly we measured the concentrations of br i in the drinking water system along the changjiang river under these three water conditions studied the transformation of br i species after water treatment and calculated the association of acesulfame and sucralose with br i to determine the influence of sewage on br i levels in the river 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals br i standards were purchased from beijing tanmo quality test technology co ltd beijing china including potassium

volume of 1 ml water samples were filtered with polyethersulfone syringe filters 0 22 μm osmonics minnetonka mn usa and injected into the hplc system by 2 ml disposable sterile syringes wuhan wangguan medical equipment co ltd wuhan china figure s1 shows the chromatograph for one standard solution and two water samples and table s2 lists the analytical performance of ked icpms and hplc icpms for the quantification of tbr and ti and species of i io3 bro3 and br along with the recoveries of target species in spiked tap water sample since br bro3 i and io3 are the main forms of inorganic br i total organic br and total organic i were calculated as the difference between tbr or ti and the respective inorganic forms based on mass balance acesulfame and sucralose concentrations in water samples were determined by hplc orbitrap mass spectrometry qe thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa using a method described previously wang et al 2019 and the details are presented in text s1 statistical analysis was conducted using ibm statistics spss version 22 armonk ny usa 2 3 sample sites and collection ninety six samples were collected over 1 year in 2017 during times of low water regime january winter normal water regime may spring and flood water regime september summer the samples were obtained from the drinking water treatment plants dwtps in eight cities along the changjiang river fig s2 in each site water was collected from four locations untreated water includes surface water collected at the intake area and inlet water collected at the water treatment input treated water includes outlet water collected at the output after full treatment and municipal tap water collected approximately 5 km downstream to the relevant dwtps table s3 lists relevant information on source water property and treatment process performed in dwtps all samples were stabilized with 0 01 sodium hydroxide according to the reference liu et al 2007 and were placed into an ice water bath immediately after collection all samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed within 10 days prior to icpms and hplc icpms analysis all samples were filtered by disposable filters 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of br i species 3 1 1 concentrations and distribution of br i species the concentrations of br i species except bro3 in collected water samples are shown in fig 1 in low water regime lwr fig s3 in normal water regime nwr and fig s4 in flood water regime fwr respectively bro3 wasn t detected in most samples except in one water treatment plant where concentrations of bro3 in output water were 0 73 1 34 and 3 71 µg l during lwr nwr and fwr respectively these bro3 may have originated from the use of sodium hypochlorite a known bro3 source garcia villanova et al 2010 and the concentration is below the regulatory limit of 10 µg l in china the concentrations of br and i in source water are generally concerned by disinfection by products dbps researchers because they are precursors of dbps containing br and i herein the concentration of br is found to be in the range of 9 41 78 3 µg l median 28 5 µg l and i is found to be 0 11 6 96 µg l with a median of 1 28 µg l table s4 lists these values and comparisons with values reported in other countries the br i concentrations in this work were mostly within the range of reported data one of our sampling sites is a coastal city but br and i concentrations in source water were lower than those reported for other coastal cities mctigue et al 2014 sharma et al 2019 the source water of this city is from a reservoir near the changjiang river estuary to avoid seawater intrusion which may be why the br i levels are not as high as the other coastal cities concentrations of br i species can vary by season and water regime conditions gilfedder et al 2009 krasner et al 1994 herein the levels of br i species under the three regimes were compared fig 2 and the difference between water regimes were processed by paired samples test table s5 from figs 1 s3 and s4 it can be seen that tobr and io3 mainly appear in the treated water and i mostly appears in untreated water so tobr and io3 were excluded in the untreated water fig 2a and i was excluded in the treated water graph fig 2b fig 2 clearly shows the influence of water regimes on the occurrence of br and i species in untreated water samples the concentrations of tbr br and i in lwr are the greatest and the difference between nwr and fwr is not significant for ti and toi the concentration in three water regimes follows the same order of fwr lwr nwr which might due to the non point pollution of organic i in summer in treated water the concentration of br in three water regimes follows the same order as that in untreated water and the concentration of tbr and tobr in three water regimes follows the order of lwr fwr nwr which is possibly related to the higher increase of tbr in lwr and fwr than nwr after water treatment ti and toi in nwr are the lowest among these three water regimes and the difference of ti toi in lwr and fwr is not significant io3 does not show obvious rule in the three water regimes which may be related to the complex formation factors and it will be discussed in section 3 2 2 in general br i concentrations during lwr are expected to be the highest because of reduced dilution however during fwr heavy rains transport non point pollution zhang 2016 and mining scour cao et al 2008 li 1999 into the changjiang river so the br i species were not always the highest under lwr 3 1 2 proportion of br i species fig 3 a shows the proportion of individual br species tobr br and bro3 to tbr in water samples br was the main form in samples of untreated water and the proportion of br to tbr was in the range of 59 9 99 9 median 91 9 this proportion decreased to 3 2 81 3 median 32 3 in samples of treated water however the proportion of tobr to tbr ranged from 0 2 to 40 1 median 8 1 in untreated water and was 18 7 96 3 median 67 1 in treated water moreover 95 of treated water samples had a tobr to tbr ratio greater than 50 and organic br was the main form the tobr to tbr ratio in treated water did not correlate with total organic carbon during fwr table s2 but did correlate with specific ultraviolet light absorbance pearson correlation 0 750 p 0 05 this suggests that the increase in tobr after water treatment in times of flood may be related to aromatic organics or humic acid precursors fig 3b shows the ratio of i species toi io3 and i to ti unlike br species toi was the main form in both untreated and treated water samples the ratio ranged from 45 8 to 94 0 median 76 7 in untreated water samples consistent with findings from a lake in germany where soluble organically bound i accounted for the majority of total soluble i approximately 85 in the lake and inflow approximately 76 gilfedder et al 2009 i is readily taken up into plants and soil fauna both living and buried organic i are the major storage pool in the environment editors 2008 sharma et al 2019 organic i dominant the majority of i species in other environmental samples such as groundwater aerosols rain and snow gilfedder et al 2008 neal et al 2007 generally i was thought to be the main i source of i dbps formation however the national surveys of i dbps in the u s and canada showed that there was no consistent correlation between iodinated trihalomethane in treated water and i in untreated water richardson et al 2008 in an occurrence study of 28 dbps in china i dbps were detected in many treated water samples without i detection in the corresponding source water ding et al 2013 hence iodoorganics may be another important i source in i dbps formation and needs much effort in future work in samples of treated water the ratio of toi to ti ranged from 20 9 to 90 7 median 58 9 and 62 of treated water samples contained more than 50 organic i the i ti ratio ranged from 2 7 to 54 1 median 15 5 in untreated water samples but could barely be detected in samples of treated water in contrast the io3 was below the detection limit in many untreated water samples and appeared to increase in treated water the ratio was 9 2 76 7 median 38 3 implying a transformation of i to io3 in addition the greatest proportion of toi observed in untreated water during fwr fig 3b permitted the conclusion that most of i derived from non point pollution during that season could be in organic forms 3 1 3 introduction of br i by chlorine containing disinfectants the eight dwtps used three disinfectants liquid chlorine chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite table s2 in most sampling sites apparent increase of tbr ti after water treatment were observed especially in lwr and fwr fig 4 by the operation of paired samples test of spss the increases in tbr and ti were all significant tbr 75 of samples p 0 05 ti 62 5 of samples p 0 01 the increase rate in tbr were in the range of 0 8 437 median 31 and the increase rate in ti ranged from 0 7 to 174 median 22 5 the increase of tbr ti after water treatment is probably attributed to the use of chlorine containing disinfectants which are generally manufactured from brine huang 1997 qiu 2014 and both br and i are present in raw salt mendez diaz et al 2014 sharma et al 2019 liquid chlorine products are known to contain br and i impurities in the form of interhalogen compounds astm 2015 editors 2002 qiu 2014 shen 2018 hypochlorite feedstock disinfectants were already reported to contain bro3 weinberg et al 2003 in order to further validate the br i introduction from chlorine containing disinfectants liquid chlorine was absorbed in sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite were dissolved into water to determine br i species the disinfectant sample preparation methods are shown in text s2 and the results are shown in table s6 br and i impurities were all detected in the three disinfectants due to the existence of some unknown peaks the concentration of organic br and i cannot be calculated by subtraction method based on the determination results table s6 and the recommended dosage the amount of br i possibly introduced from the disinfectants into the treated water was calculated table s7 in the product description 2 kg of chlorine dioxide is generally added into 480 m3 of water accordingly 5 0 and 1 3 μg l of br and i are possibly introduced into the treatment water respectively when the dosage of cl2 was 3 mg l the introduced br and i of sodium hypochlorite would be 2 6 μg l and 8 5 μg l bro3 wasn t the main form of br in naclo aqueous solution but io3 was that of i and their ratio to tbr and ti are 39 0 and 88 2 respectively the contents of bromine and iodine in disinfectants produced by different manufacturers may be heterogeneous rafael j garcia villanova investigated the content of bro3 in 40 sodium hypochlorite solutions and found 33 of the samples contained bro3 ranging from 219 to 7684 mg l garcia villanova et al 2010 in the actual water treatment process there are many factors affecting the forms of br i such as free chlorine content disinfectant dose temperature ph organic matter and turbidity and the effect of br i impurities in disinfectants on the production of br dbps and i dbps needs further investigation fig 4 shows that the increase of tbr is apparently higher than that of ti and in some cases higher tbr increase is accompanied by higher ti growth while no significant correlation was found between them this is similar to the occurrence of br i in nature richardson et al 2008 sharma et al 2019 in addition greater variation in tbr and ti contents were found in samples collected during the times of lwr and fwr than that in nwr especially for dwtp b and a in lwr this result was assumed to be related to the more disinfection dosage during lwr and fwr over that applied for nwr the information about the dosages supplied by the dwtps operators was incomplete or unavailable and the relationship between the disinfectant dosage and the introduced br and i cannot be obtained directly but we found some clues in the reported literatures disinfectant dose in dwtps is related to temperature turbidity and water quality wang et al 2000 wei et al 2010 generally the chlorine dose is 1 3 mg l in winter larger turbidity and high levels of dissolved organic material needs more dose and even increased to 6 8 mg l when source water was seriously polluted wang et al 2000 yan et al 2013 in summer algal blooms high temperature and non point pollution ding and liu 2019 liu et al 2018a also require additional disinfection 3 1 4 increase of br i along the river direction in each sampling site two untreated water samples surface water and inlet water were taken to estimate the occurrence of br i species in the changjiang river from the concentration results fig 1 s3 and s4 it can be seen that br i concentrations are basically similar in these two untreated water samples except e where the br i concentrations in surface water are clearly higher than that in inlet water there are apparent increase trend from upstream to downstream trend test of br i concentrations along the river direction was conducted by assessing tbr br ti and toi concentrations using one way anova and it was found that the increase of these four compounds were significant p 0 01 in a linear term fig s5 shows the mean plot of these four compounds it was noted that there was a large degree of divergence from the main trend at two points the first is the higher mean concentrations of tbr and br in dwtp a under fwr fig s4 it is probably attributable to runoff from mining activities or non point pollution in heavy rain this location is rich in mineral deposits and mining is the main industry cao et al 2008 li 1999 the second is the high mean concentrations of br i in the surface water of e figs 1 s3 and s4 it may indicate the presence of sewage as evidenced from the high concentrations of artificial sweeteners fig s6 3 1 5 influence of sewage on br i occurrence in river water the variable persistence of artificial sweeteners especially for acesulfame and sucralose made them an ideal wastewater indicator van stempvoort et al 2020 yang et al 2017 correlations of some target compounds with artificial sweeteners are usually used to investigate the sewage influence or helping identifying the pollution source muller et al 2011 prescott et al 2017 figure s6 shows the concentrations of tbr ti acesulfame and sucralose in flood season and it can be seen that the concentrations of these four compounds have similar changes with the flow direction then the correlation was conducted and the results were listed in table 1 sucralose correlated better with br and i than acesulfame which may be related to the slight conversion and degradation of acesulfame during chlorination li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the correlation of ti with sucralose and acesulfame was better than tbr which may be related to the unexpected high tbr concentration in dwtp a in flood season interestingly all correlations were significant indicating similar sources pathways and fate in the drinking water system to further understand the influence of sewage on br i occurrence in the changjiang river a regression analysis of the four compounds in untreated water was conducted and the results are shown in fig s7 as can be seen r2 of the linear regression between the concentration of br i and acesulfame is 0 611 and 0 828 respectively r2 between the concentration of br i and sucralose is 0 880 and 0 878 respectively the linear relationship between the concentration of br i and artificial sweeteners suggests that domestic sewage may be one of the sources of br i in the changjiang river as we know artificial sweeteners have obvious accumulation effect in the environmental water van stempvoort et al 2011 wu et al 2014 combined with the increase of br i contents with the flow direction we can infer that bromine and iodine also have a certain accumulation tendency in the changjiang river considering the high toxicity of brominated iodinated dbps the sewage should be controlled more strictly and the concentrations of br i in source water should be monitored frequently 3 2 transformation of br i species after water treatment 3 2 1 transformation of inorganic br to organic br it was noted in section 3 1 2 that br was the main form in untreated water and organic br was the main form in treated water which indicated the formation of brominated dbps fig 5 shows the decrease value in br and increase value in tobr as well as the decrease rate of br after water treatment although concentrations of tbr increased in many samples after water treatment br concentrations still decreased sharply the increase of tobr was higher than the decrease of br in the water samples with significant increase of tbr after treatment especially in lwr and fwr which suggested the possibility of transformation of br into brominated dbps no matter the spatiotemporal variation of br in source water and the amount of introduced br during water treatment the decrease rate in br was not significantly different and was typically greater than 50 median 51 0 in lwr 62 0 in nwr and 57 5 in fwr these values are close to those reported in the literature with 69 of initial br converting into absorbable organic br tan et al 2016 of all the samples dwtp b in lwr is obviously different which may be related to the highest introduced br as depicted in figs 1 and 4 the organic precursor of br dbps in source water is limited so the extra bromine still exists in the form of br resulting in the increase of br instead of decreasing 3 2 2 transformation of i species compared with br transformation of i species after water treatment is more complex and mainly involves the formation of io3 decrease in i content and variations in toi fig 6 it is known that i is transformed into io3 during chlorination zhu and zhang 2016 while the i increase in io3 were notably greater than i decreases which may be due to the formation of io3 also related to the use of i containing disinfectant and the transformation of iodoorganics the decrease rate of i was in the range of 22 6 99 9 median 96 8 and more than 90 was observed in 83 3 of water samples compared with the variation of br decrease rate were about 51 0 62 0 and 58 5 in lwf nwf and fwf water respectively i showed much greater transformation trend for the variations in toi after water treatment although in lwr and fwr there were several cases showing toi increase may be caused by the use of i containing disinfectant more than 70 8 of the samples presented decreasing trend a paired sample t test was further carried out and it showed that the decrease in toi were significant at the 90 confidence level p 0 1 moreover the ratios of toi ti exhibited an apparent decrease under all water regime conditions fig 4b blue column base on the variations in toi after water treatment and i dbps formation schematic from literatures zhu and zhang 2016 the main reaction pathways of iodoorganics during chlorination was deduced and shown in fig 7 it is reported that toi formed quickly after chlorination of i but then decreased probably due to the substitution of hocl clo or hobr bro hclo clo i dbps int cl dbps hoi io k 3 5 l mol 1 s 1 hbro bro i dbps int br dbps int hoi io k 4 0 l mol 1 s 1 zhu and zhang 2016 the same reaction may be occurred to the iodoorganics based on the decrease investigation after water treatment in this paper in addition nom that is reactive toward hoi may also be oxidized by hocl and hobr in a competing reaction and the rate constants for relevant reactions are 5 5 104 41 l mol 1 s 1 1 0 106 l mol 1 s 1 for hoi io hclo clo and hbro bro respectively in the tested water samples hocl and hobr were present in large quantities relative to hoi so i in raw water could hardly transform into organic compounds and most of them were oxidized to io3 similarly the main disinfected product of iodoorganics was io3 while its transformation rate range 0 5 66 0 median 31 1 was much lower than that of i 4 conclusions 96 samples of water were analyzed from eight dwtps along the changjiang river under three water regime conditions for br i species the findings support the following conclusions 1 br i species are common in dwtps along the changjiang river their concentrations increase with flow direction and water regimes have different effect on the occurrence of br and i species 2 correlations of acesulfame and sucralose with tbr and ti suggest that domestic sewage contributes to br i concentrations in untreated water br i have accumulative potency along the changjiang river 3 increases in br i concentrations following water treatment indicate the introduction of br i from chlorine containing disinfectants manufactured from brine considering the accumulation characteristics of br i and the high toxicity of brominated and iodinated dbps br i impurities should be removed during the manufacturing of chlorine based disinfectants 4 inorganic br and iodoorganics are the main form of br i species in untreated water after water treatment organic br and organic i account for the majority in treated water it warrants further investigation into identification of the iodoorganics in raw water br dbps in treated water and their change in water treatment declaration of competing

recent years more brominated and iodinated dbps have been detected in drinking water richardson and temes 2018 necessitating an examination of br i species in supply systems early information on br i species was mainly derived from environmental or geological surveys flury and papritz 1993 moran et al 2002 with growing interest in dbps more attention has been paid to bromide br and iodide i in the water environment and their effect on dbps formation these studies generally focus on researches of reaction kinetics or investigations of byproduct formation during simulated disinfection processes mechanistic studies have outlined the reaction process and products of br i with various disinfectants both chorine and ozone can oxidize br to form hobr or obr which can react with nom to form brominated dbps gallard et al 2003 westerhoff et al 2004 ozone can further oxidize obr to bro3 von gunten 2003 westerhoff et al 1998 additionally chlorine ozone and chloramines can oxidize i to hoi or oi which can react with nom to form iodinated dbps or be further oxidized to iodate io3 bichsel and von gunten 1999 in studies on the formation of brominated and iodinated dbps br and i were mostly used as sources of br and i hua et al 2006 tan et al 2016 with the emergence of organic br i contaminants in environmental water dbps formation potential or degradation kinetics have also been studied using the herbicide bromacil hu et al 2019 brominated flame retardants gao et al 2016 and iodinated x ray contrast media jeong et al 2017 however the information on br i species occurrence distribution and transformation before and after water treatment is scarce presently especially in the changjiang river yangtze river china where the supply system provides drinking water for approximately 400 million individuals the br i species are mainly divided as organic and inorganic forms in the researches of halogenated dbps the determination and estimation of tox total organic halogen x can be cl br or i is an essential step generally the tox is determined by absorbable method which mainly includes three steps 1 separation of organic halogen from halides with active carbon 2 conversion of organic halogen into halides and 3 quantification of halides with ion chromatography kristiana et al 2015 or mass spectrometry pan and zhang 2013 pereira et al 2011 in fact the tox quantified by this method is only the absorbable part of total organic halogens and is called as aox absorbable organic halogen to measure the nonionic portion of tox zhang developed a new three step method and the main procedure was 1 separate ionic halogen and organic halogen with electrodialysis 2 converse organic halogen to halides with ultraviolet and 3 analyze halides with ion chromatography zhang et al 2018 this method for tox analysis is complicated and the organic halogen may be lost during separation and conversion procedure since br and bro3 were the stable inorganic br species in water as were i and io3 of i and the remaining fraction was in organic form subtraction can be used to get the concentration of total organic br tobr and total organic i toi specifically total br i can be quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms and inorganic br i forms can be determined by high performance liquid chromatography icpms concentrations of tobr and toi can be calculated as the difference between total br i and inorganic br i species this strategy was used for quantifying br i species in many environmental samples including fresh water gilfedder et al 2009 gilfedder et al 2011 snow gao et al 2018 gilfedder et al 2007 and atmosphere aerosol gilfedder et al 2008 siqi et al 2010 it has been demonstrated with good reliability in rivers near coast br and i mainly originate from seawater intrusion sharma et al 2019 in inland water these halogen species mostly originate from seaborne aerosols flury and papritz 1993 gilfedder et al 2008 with rapid urbanization and industrialization more and more compounds containing br i are discharged into environmental waters gilfedder et al 2008 jeong et al 2017 peng et al 2016 regli et al 2015 sawade et al 2016 in the rhine river of switzerland chemical industries and municipal waste incinerators were identified to be the major sources of br discharge which accounted for approximately 50 and 20 respectively soltermann et al 2016 but in the changjiang river the impact of human activities on br i occurrence is still unclear the present paper describes a method for evaluating the impact of sewage discharge on br i with artificial sweeteners previous studies have made us hypothesize that the artificial sweeteners acesulfame and sucralose could be used as the evaluation marker of br i source ignaz et al 2009 blackstock et al 2017 muller et al 2011 they are the most commonly used artificial sweeteners in many countries including china and are widely used in food drugs beverages and personal care products lange et al 2012 their persistence in environmental water renders them an effective marker of anthropogenic activity in wastewater blackstock et al 2017 muller et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 additionally there are no data on their occurrence in the changjiang river therefore in this paper we determined the concentrations of acesulfame and sucralose in the river and examined their correlations with br i levels to assess the effect of wastewater generally there are three water regimes low normal and flood in the changjiang river temporal and spatial variations have been reported to influence the water quality to some degree liu et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 accordingly we measured the concentrations of br i in the drinking water system along the changjiang river under these three water conditions studied the transformation of br i species after water treatment and calculated the association of acesulfame and sucralose with br i to determine the influence of sewage on br i levels in the river 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals br i standards were purchased from beijing tanmo quality test technology co ltd beijing china including potassium

analysis was conducted using ibm statistics spss version 22 armonk ny usa 2 3 sample sites and collection ninety six samples were collected over 1 year in 2017 during times of low water regime january winter normal water regime may spring and flood water regime september summer the samples were obtained from the drinking water treatment plants dwtps in eight cities along the changjiang river fig s2 in each site water was collected from four locations untreated water includes surface water collected at the intake area and inlet water collected at the water treatment input treated water includes outlet water collected at the output after full treatment and municipal tap water collected approximately 5 km downstream to the relevant dwtps table s3 lists relevant information on source water property and treatment process performed in dwtps all samples were stabilized with 0 01 sodium hydroxide according to the reference liu et al 2007 and were placed into an ice water bath immediately after collection all samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed within 10 days prior to icpms and hplc icpms analysis all samples were filtered by disposable filters 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of br i species 3 1 1 concentrations and distribution of br i species the concentrations of br i species except bro3 in collected water samples are shown in fig 1 in low water regime lwr fig s3 in normal water regime nwr and fig s4 in flood water regime fwr respectively bro3 wasn t detected in most samples except in one water treatment plant where concentrations of bro3 in output water were 0 73 1 34 and 3 71 µg l during lwr nwr and fwr respectively these bro3 may have originated from the use of sodium hypochlorite a known bro3 source garcia villanova et al 2010 and the concentration is below the regulatory limit of 10 µg l in china the concentrations of br and i in source water are generally concerned by disinfection by products dbps researchers because they are precursors of dbps containing br and i herein the concentration of br is found to be in the range of 9 41 78 3 µg l median 28 5 µg l and i is found to be 0 11 6 96 µg l with a median of 1 28 µg l table s4 lists these values and comparisons with values reported in other countries the br i concentrations in this work were mostly within the range of reported data one of our sampling sites is a coastal city but br and i concentrations in source water were lower than those reported for other coastal cities mctigue et al 2014 sharma et al 2019 the source water of this city is from a reservoir near the changjiang river estuary to avoid seawater intrusion which may be why the br i levels are not as high as the other coastal cities concentrations of br i species can vary by season and water regime conditions gilfedder et al 2009 krasner et al 1994 herein the levels of br i species under the three regimes were compared fig 2 and the difference between water regimes were processed by paired samples test table s5 from figs 1 s3 and s4 it can be seen that tobr and io3 mainly appear in the treated water and i mostly appears in untreated water so tobr and io3 were excluded in the untreated water fig 2a and i was excluded in the treated water graph fig 2b fig 2 clearly shows the influence of water regimes on the occurrence of br and i species in untreated water samples the concentrations of tbr br and i in lwr are the greatest and the difference between nwr and fwr is not significant for ti and toi the concentration in three water regimes follows the same order of fwr lwr nwr which might due to the non point pollution of organic i in summer in treated water the concentration of br in three water regimes follows the same order as that in untreated water and the concentration of tbr and tobr in three water regimes follows the order of lwr fwr nwr which is possibly related to the higher increase of tbr in lwr and fwr than nwr after water treatment ti and toi in nwr are the lowest among these three water regimes and the difference of ti toi in lwr and fwr is not significant io3 does not show obvious rule in the three water regimes which may be related to the complex formation factors and it will be discussed in section 3 2 2 in general br i concentrations during lwr are expected to be the highest because of reduced dilution however during fwr heavy rains transport non point pollution zhang 2016 and mining scour cao et al 2008 li 1999 into the changjiang river so the br i species were not always the highest under lwr 3 1 2 proportion of br i species fig 3 a shows the proportion of individual br species tobr br and bro3 to tbr in water samples br was the main form in samples of untreated water and the proportion of br to tbr was in the range of 59 9 99 9 median 91 9 this proportion decreased to 3 2 81 3 median 32 3 in samples of treated water however the proportion of tobr to tbr ranged from 0 2 to 40 1 median 8 1 in untreated water and was 18 7 96 3 median 67 1 in treated water moreover 95 of treated water samples had a tobr to tbr ratio greater than 50 and organic br was the main form the tobr to tbr ratio in treated water did not correlate with total organic carbon during fwr table s2 but did correlate with specific ultraviolet light absorbance pearson correlation 0 750 p 0 05 this suggests that the increase in tobr after water treatment in times of flood may be related to aromatic organics or humic acid precursors fig 3b shows the ratio of i species toi io3 and i to ti unlike br species toi was the main form in both untreated and treated water samples the ratio ranged from 45 8 to 94 0 median 76 7 in untreated water samples consistent with findings from a lake in germany where soluble organically bound i accounted for the majority of total soluble i approximately 85 in the lake and inflow approximately 76 gilfedder et al 2009 i is readily taken up into plants and soil fauna both living and buried organic i are the major storage pool in the environment editors 2008 sharma et al 2019 organic i dominant the majority of i species in other environmental samples such as groundwater aerosols rain and snow gilfedder et al 2008 neal et al 2007 generally i was thought to be the main i source of i dbps formation however the national surveys of i dbps in the u s and canada showed that there was no consistent correlation between iodinated trihalomethane in treated water and i in untreated water richardson et al 2008 in an occurrence study of 28 dbps in china i dbps were detected in many treated water samples without i detection in the corresponding source water ding et al 2013 hence iodoorganics may be another important i source in i dbps formation and needs much effort in future work in samples of treated water the ratio of toi to ti ranged from 20 9 to 90 7 median 58 9 and 62 of treated water samples contained more than 50 organic i the i ti ratio ranged from 2 7 to 54 1 median 15 5 in untreated water samples but could barely be detected in samples of treated water in contrast the io3 was below the detection limit in many untreated water samples and appeared to increase in treated water the ratio was 9 2 76 7 median 38 3 implying a transformation of i to io3 in addition the greatest proportion of toi observed in untreated water during fwr fig 3b permitted the conclusion that most of i derived from non point pollution during that season could be in organic forms 3 1 3 introduction of br i by chlorine containing disinfectants the eight dwtps used three disinfectants liquid chlorine chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite table s2 in most sampling sites apparent increase of tbr ti after water treatment were observed especially in lwr and fwr fig 4 by the operation of paired samples test of spss the increases in tbr and ti were all significant tbr 75 of samples p 0 05 ti 62 5 of samples p 0 01 the increase rate in tbr were in the range of 0 8 437 median 31 and the increase rate in ti ranged from 0 7 to 174 median 22 5 the increase of tbr ti after water treatment is probably attributed to the use of chlorine containing disinfectants which are generally manufactured from brine huang 1997 qiu 2014 and both br and i are present in raw salt mendez diaz et al 2014 sharma et al 2019 liquid chlorine products are known to contain br and i impurities in the form of interhalogen compounds astm 2015 editors 2002 qiu 2014 shen 2018 hypochlorite feedstock disinfectants were already reported to contain bro3 weinberg et al 2003 in order to further validate the br i introduction from chlorine containing disinfectants liquid chlorine was absorbed in sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite were dissolved into water to determine br i species the disinfectant sample preparation methods are shown in text s2 and the results are shown in table s6 br and i impurities were all detected in the three disinfectants due to the existence of some unknown peaks the concentration of organic br and i cannot be calculated by subtraction method based on the determination results table s6 and the recommended dosage the amount of br i possibly introduced from the disinfectants into the treated water was calculated table s7 in the product description 2 kg of chlorine dioxide is generally added into 480 m3 of water accordingly 5 0 and 1 3 μg l of br and i are possibly introduced into the treatment water respectively when the dosage of cl2 was 3 mg l the introduced br and i of sodium hypochlorite would be 2 6 μg l and 8 5 μg l bro3 wasn t the main form of br in naclo aqueous solution but io3 was that of i and their ratio to tbr and ti are 39 0 and 88 2 respectively the contents of bromine and iodine in disinfectants produced by different manufacturers may be heterogeneous rafael j garcia villanova investigated the content of bro3 in 40 sodium hypochlorite solutions and found 33 of the samples contained bro3 ranging from 219 to 7684 mg l garcia villanova et al 2010 in the actual water treatment process there are many factors affecting the forms of br i such as free chlorine content disinfectant dose temperature ph organic matter and turbidity and the effect of br i impurities in disinfectants on the production of br dbps and i dbps needs further investigation fig 4 shows that the increase of tbr is apparently higher than that of ti and in some cases higher tbr increase is accompanied by higher ti growth while no significant correlation was found between them this is similar to the occurrence of br i in nature richardson et al 2008 sharma et al 2019 in addition greater variation in tbr and ti contents were found in samples collected during the times of lwr and fwr than that in nwr especially for dwtp b and a in lwr this result was assumed to be related to the more disinfection dosage during lwr and fwr over that applied for nwr the information about the dosages supplied by the dwtps operators was incomplete or unavailable and the relationship between the disinfectant dosage and the introduced br and i cannot be obtained directly but we found some clues in the reported literatures disinfectant dose in dwtps is related to temperature turbidity and water quality wang et al 2000 wei et al 2010 generally the chlorine dose is 1 3 mg l in winter larger turbidity and high levels of dissolved organic material needs more dose and even increased to 6 8 mg l when source water was seriously polluted wang et al 2000 yan et al 2013 in summer algal blooms high temperature and non point pollution ding and liu 2019 liu et al 2018a also require additional disinfection 3 1 4 increase of br i along the river direction in each sampling site two untreated water samples surface water and inlet water were taken to estimate the occurrence of br i species in the changjiang river from the concentration results fig 1 s3 and s4 it can be seen that br i concentrations are basically similar in these two untreated water samples except e where the br i concentrations in surface water are clearly higher than that in inlet water there are apparent increase trend from upstream to downstream trend test of br i concentrations along the river direction was conducted by assessing tbr br ti and toi concentrations using one way anova and it was found that the increase of these four compounds were significant p 0 01 in a linear term fig s5 shows the mean plot of these four compounds it was noted that there was a large degree of divergence from the main trend at two points the first is the higher mean concentrations of tbr and br in dwtp a under fwr fig s4 it is probably attributable to runoff from mining activities or non point pollution in heavy rain this location is rich in mineral deposits and mining is the main industry cao et al 2008 li 1999 the second is the high mean concentrations of br i in the surface water of e figs 1 s3 and s4 it may indicate the presence of sewage as evidenced from the high concentrations of artificial sweeteners fig s6 3 1 5 influence of sewage on br i occurrence in river water the variable persistence of artificial sweeteners especially for acesulfame and sucralose made them an ideal wastewater indicator van stempvoort et al 2020 yang et al 2017 correlations of some target compounds with artificial sweeteners are usually used to investigate the sewage influence or helping identifying the pollution source muller et al 2011 prescott et al 2017 figure s6 shows the concentrations of tbr ti acesulfame and sucralose in flood season and it can be seen that the concentrations of these four compounds have similar changes with the flow direction then the correlation was conducted and the results were listed in table 1 sucralose correlated better with br and i than acesulfame which may be related to the slight conversion and degradation of acesulfame during chlorination li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the correlation of ti with sucralose and acesulfame was better than tbr which may be related to the unexpected high tbr concentration in dwtp a in flood season interestingly all correlations were significant indicating similar sources pathways and fate in the drinking water system to further understand the influence of sewage on br i occurrence in the changjiang river a regression analysis of the four compounds in untreated water was conducted and the results are shown in fig s7 as can be seen r2 of the linear regression between the concentration of br i and acesulfame is 0 611 and 0 828 respectively r2 between the concentration of br i and sucralose is 0 880 and 0 878 respectively the linear relationship between the concentration of br i and artificial sweeteners suggests that domestic sewage may be one of the sources of br i in the changjiang river as we know artificial sweeteners have obvious accumulation effect in the environmental water van stempvoort et al 2011 wu et al 2014 combined with the increase of br i contents with the flow direction we can infer that bromine and iodine also have a certain accumulation tendency in the changjiang river considering the high toxicity of brominated iodinated dbps the sewage should be controlled more strictly and the concentrations of br i in source water should be monitored frequently 3 2 transformation of br i species after water treatment 3 2 1 transformation of inorganic br to organic br it was noted in section 3 1 2 that br was the main form in untreated water and organic br was the main form in treated water which indicated the formation of brominated dbps fig 5 shows the decrease value in br and increase value in tobr as well as the decrease rate of br after water treatment although concentrations of tbr increased in many samples after water treatment br concentrations still decreased sharply the increase of tobr was higher than the decrease of br in the water samples with significant increase of tbr after treatment especially in lwr and fwr which suggested the possibility of transformation of br into brominated dbps no matter the spatiotemporal variation of br in source water and the amount of introduced br during water treatment the decrease rate in br was not significantly different and was typically greater than 50 median 51 0 in lwr 62 0 in nwr and 57 5 in fwr these values are close to those reported in the literature with 69 of initial br converting into absorbable organic br tan et al 2016 of all the samples dwtp b in lwr is obviously different which may be related to the highest introduced br as depicted in figs 1 and 4 the organic precursor of br dbps in source water is limited so the extra bromine still exists in the form of br resulting in the increase of br instead of decreasing 3 2 2 transformation of i species compared with br transformation of i species after water treatment is more complex and mainly involves the formation of io3 decrease in i content and variations in toi fig 6 it is known that i is transformed into io3 during chlorination zhu and zhang 2016 while the i increase in io3 were notably greater than i decreases which may be due to the formation of io3 also related to the use of i containing disinfectant and the transformation of iodoorganics the decrease rate of i was in the range of 22 6 99 9 median 96 8 and more than 90 was observed in 83 3 of water samples compared with the variation of br decrease rate were about 51 0 62 0 and 58 5 in lwf nwf and fwf water respectively i showed much greater transformation trend for the variations in toi after water treatment although in lwr and fwr there were several cases showing toi increase may be caused by the use of i containing disinfectant more than 70 8 of the samples presented decreasing trend a paired sample t test was further carried out and it showed that the decrease in toi were significant at the 90 confidence level p 0 1 moreover the ratios of toi ti exhibited an apparent decrease under all water regime conditions fig 4b blue column base on the variations in toi after water treatment and i dbps formation schematic from literatures zhu and zhang 2016 the main reaction pathways of iodoorganics during chlorination was deduced and shown in fig 7 it is reported that toi formed quickly after chlorination of i but then decreased probably due to the substitution of hocl clo or hobr bro hclo clo i dbps int cl dbps hoi io k 3 5 l mol 1 s 1 hbro bro i dbps int br dbps int hoi io k 4 0 l mol 1 s 1 zhu and zhang 2016 the same reaction may be occurred to the iodoorganics based on the decrease investigation after water treatment in this paper in addition nom that is reactive toward hoi may also be oxidized by hocl and hobr in a competing reaction and the rate constants for relevant reactions are 5 5 104 41 l mol 1 s 1 1 0 106 l mol 1 s 1 for hoi io hclo clo and hbro bro respectively in the tested water samples hocl and hobr were present in large quantities relative to hoi so i in raw water could hardly transform into organic compounds and most of them were oxidized to io3 similarly the main disinfected product of iodoorganics was io3 while its transformation rate range 0 5 66 0 median 31 1 was much lower than that of i 4 conclusions 96 samples of water were analyzed from eight dwtps along the changjiang river under three water regime conditions for br i species the findings support the following conclusions 1 br i species are common in dwtps along the changjiang river their concentrations increase with flow direction and water regimes have different effect on the occurrence of br and i species 2 correlations of acesulfame and sucralose with tbr and ti suggest that domestic sewage contributes to br i concentrations in untreated water br i have accumulative potency along the changjiang river 3 increases in br i concentrations following water treatment indicate the introduction of br i from chlorine containing disinfectants manufactured from brine considering the accumulation characteristics of br i and the high toxicity of brominated and iodinated dbps br i impurities should be removed during the manufacturing of chlorine based disinfectants 4 inorganic br and iodoorganics are the main form of br i species in untreated water after water treatment organic br and organic i account for the majority in treated water it warrants further investigation into identification of the iodoorganics in raw water br dbps in treated water and their change in water treatment declaration of competing

16771,storage containers are usually used to provide a constant water head in decentralized community groundwater treatment systems for the removal of iron fe and arsenic as however the commonly practiced aeration prior to storage assists in rapid and complete fe2 oxidation resulting in poor as removal despite sufficient native fe2 in the source water in this study it was found that application of anoxic storage enhanced as removal from groundwater containing 300 µg l of as iii and 2 33 mg l of fe2 in an as affected village of rajshahi district in bangladesh although the oxidation of fe2 and as iii during oxic storage was considerably faster the as fe removal ratio was higher during anoxic storage 61 80 5 µgas mgfe compared to the oxic storage 45 5 µgas mgfe this higher as removal efficacy in anoxic storage containers could not be attributed to the speciation of as since as v concentrations were higher during oxic storage due to more favorable abiotic as iii oxidation by o2 and fenton like intermediates and biotic as iii oxidizing bacteria e g sideroxydans gallionella hydrogenophaga conditions the continuous in situ hydrous ferric oxide floc formation during flow through operation and the favorable lower ph aiding higher sorption capacities for the gradually formed as v likely contributed to the improved performance in the anoxic storage containers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater treatment anoxic storage container arsenic iron 1 introduction the geogenic groundwater contamination of arsenic as negatively affects the quality of drinking water leading to health risks in many countries including bangladesh and india chakraborty et al 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 long term consumption of as contaminated water may cause skin lesions melanosis hyperkeratosis skin cancer and internal organs damage farmer and johnson 1990 guo et al 2013 li et al 2012 luzi et al 2004 according to the world health organization who the recommended values for as in drinking water should not exceed 10 µg l who 2011 whereas 50 µg l is the maximum allowable limit in bangladesh however as can be found in groundwater based drinking water supplies in bangladesh up to several mg l nordstrom 2002 in oxidizing conditions and circumneutral ph such as in surface waters arsenate as v is the predominant species which is usually present in the immobile state forming oxyanions h2aso4 haso4 2 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 lafferty et al 2010 however under circumneutral ph and reducing conditions like in groundwater aquifers arsenite as iii specie is the more toxic mobile and thermodynamically stable in the non ionic form h3aso3 villalobos et al 2014 therefore pre oxidation from as iii to as v is an essential step for as contaminated water treatment processes such as precipitation co precipitation coagulation filtration and adsorption on iron fe oxides activated alumina or bone char bai et al 2016 begum et al 2016 niazi et al 2018 pio et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 however oxidation of as iii through dissolved oxygen do is thermodynamically feasible but is slow gude et al 2018b sorlini and gialdini 2010 aeration is commonly used for oxidizing fe2 and removing carbon dioxide methane hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic compounds from water bruins et al 2014 katsoyiannis et al 2008 vries et al 2017 moreover if the water source also contains as the oxidation of fe2 can also enhance as iii oxidation by reactive oxidation species ros and or fenton like chemical reactions hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 the freshly formed hydrous ferric oxide hfo flocs from fe2 oxidation can bind and co precipitate with as katsoyiannis et al 2015 roberts et al 2004 senn et al 2018 where the binding affinity for as v is stronger than for as iii bissen and frimmel 2003 cui et al 2018 however the removal of as with oxidized hfo flocs has been found to be inefficient due to rapid and almost complete fe2 oxidation during storage or filtration before complete as iii oxidation annaduzzaman et al 2021 gude et al 2016 roberts et al 2004 moreover as formerly observed the rise in ph during aeration increases the negative surface charge on hfo flocs and hence decreases as removal potential dixit and hering 2003 han et al 2016 storage containers are usually used to provide a constant water head in decentralized community treatment systems for the removal of iron fe and arsenic as chakraborty et al 2016 however the commonly practiced aeration prior to storage results in rapid and complete fe2 oxidation resulting in poor as removal despite sufficient native fe2 in the source water as a result the conventional oxic storage and filtration processes require additional chemical oxidants adsorbents for as removal in a recent study annaduzzaman et al 2021 it was found that delayed aeration before sand filtration enhanced overall as removal it is hypothesized that the observed partial fe2 oxidation during anoxic storage promoted as removal in the following aeration filtration steps however the oxidation mechanisms and effects of temporal changes in various water quality parameters in such storage containers are not yet fully understood therefore this study aims to address the following knowledge gaps i the mode of fe2 and as iii oxidation being either homogeneous heterogeneous surface related process biological or in various combinations van beek et al 2015 vries et al 2017 ii the role of various biological processes by subsurface derived indigenous microorganisms crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018a and iii the effect of a larger surface area to adhere biofilms by application of bio carriers in the storage container thus this novel concept of anoxic storage was monitored to understand the oxidation processes of groundwater native fe2 and as iii and their effect on as removal compared to the conventional oxic storage in the presence and absence of bio carriers the oxic and anoxic storage container experiments were conducted over 30 days with natural groundwater in the presence of native fe2 2 33 mg l as 300 µg l and other con t a m i nants like po4 3 2 15 mg l and nh4 0 96 mg l furthermore this research also studied the role of bio carriers and consequent changes in bacterial growth in the storage containers 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sample quality the experiments were performed in polypropylene storage containers gazi bangladesh with a capacity of 75 l using as contaminated groundwater in the affected uttar kazirpara village in paba rajshahi district bangladesh the relevant water composition of the used groundwater is shown in table 1 the anoxic groundwater was extracted from a borehole of 50 1 m depth using a submersible pump gazi bangladesh 2 2 experimental set up of storage containers the experimental set up consisted of eight 75 l polypropylene containers gazi bangladesh to study four storage conditions in duplicate namely oxic with without bio carriers and anoxic with without bio carriers fig 1 the containers with bio carriers were half filled with anoxkaldnes k3 shaped bio carriers purchased from a local shop in dhaka osmosia water bangladesh fig 1 to ensure an abiotic environment at the start of the experiments the containers were thoroughly sterilized with 35 w w hydrogen peroxide h2o2 sigma aldrich every 24 h the stored water was replaced with freshly extracted groundwater without removing the precipitated fe oxide sludge this refill process was chosen to replicate the conventional storage practices where the precipitated fe oxide sludge generally accumulates in the storage container for several weeks the groundwater was aerated by passing it through a showerhead placed 35 cm above the top of the containers with oxic storage in the containers with anoxic storage the inlet of the extracted groundwater was filled without aeration from the bottom of the containers the anoxic containers were overflown for an additional five minutes to avoid any incidental aeration of water the water sampling was performed every 60 min for the first eight hours on days 1 5 10 20 and 30 of the experimental period the experimental time of eight hours was selected to prevent full emptying of the storage container max 90 and consequent discontinuation of the column feed during each sampling event the ph dissolved oxygen do oxygen reduction potential orp and temperature t were directly measured on site in the course of each sampling time 15 ml water samples both 0 45 µm vwr filtered and unfiltered were collected in polypropylene transparent 15 ml centrifuge tube sigma aldrich and acidified with ultrapure hno3 acid acs reagent 70 formula weight 60 01 g mol sigma aldrich to make up for 1 5 acidification of the solutions to preserve for elemental quantification such as fe as etc the water sample was collected using a 60 ml syringe and pre fixed sampling tube iv injection tube square bangladesh at approximately 10 cm above the bottom of the container fig 1 this arrangement was used to avoid opening of the container s lids risk of aeration during water sampling and to maintain consistency of sample quality additionally three times a day 0 4 and 8 h 250 ml filtered 0 45 µm water samples without acidification were collected in the 250 ml polypropylene

technology the netherlands other ions such as nh4 no3 and po4 3 were quantified at rajshahi regional laboratory department of public health engineering dphe bangladesh 2 4 arsenic speciation for the as speciation the ion exchange resin amberlite ira 400 chlorite was used this speciation was performed by a 60 ml syringe with 30 ml ion exchange resin after 0 45 μm filtration 100 ml sample were passed through 30 ml ion exchange resin column the remaining as concentration in the resin filtrate was considered as reduced as iii species gude et al 2016 karori et al 2006 finally the obtained as iii species level from the resin filtrate was subtracted from 0 45 µm filtrate total as concentration to determine dissolved as v 2 5 microbial sampling and analyses for the microbial community

sequence read archive accession number prjna673456 https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra prjna673456 3 results and discussion 3 1 immediate changes in ph do orp and fe2 the ph orp do and fe2 concentration during oxic and anoxic storage without the presence of bio carriers measured at the start of the experiment day 1 are shown in fig 2 while the natural groundwater ph do and orp were 6 94 0 07 mg l and 110 mv respectively after aeration the average ph do and orp increased to 7 5 0 03 6 75 0 05 mg l and 130 10 mv respectively this was due to atmospheric gaseous exchange resulting in the release of co2 and uptake of o2 the results for the containers with bio carriers are shown in supplementary fig s2 during the 8 h of observation the ph and orp remained stable during oxic storage fig 2a c and s2a c and do remained above 6 26 mg l fig 2b s2b the dissolved fe concentration considered as fe2 dropped to an average of 0 30 mg l from its initial groundwater concentration of 2 33 mg l which was due to rapid fe2 oxidation at the high do and ph t1 2 roughly 2 3 min fig 2d morgan and lahav 2007 stumm and lee 1961 during anoxic storage fe2 oxidation was slow in comparison with the oxidation rate during oxic storage due to the lower levels of ph 6 9 do 0 35 mg l and orp 100 mv fig 2a b c as evidenced during earlier studies vollrath et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the orp remained stable similar to its initial value 110 mv over 8 h fig 2c while do dropped from 0 35 mg l to 0 23 mg l after the experimental 8 h 1 39 0 05 mg l of fe2 remained dissolved in the anoxic stored water fig 2d s2d the observed 0 94 mg l of fe2 oxidation during anoxic storage corresponded to the average consumed 0 13 mg l of do which was equal to the do drop over 8 h part of the fe2 0 40 mg l oxidized immediately during the filling of the containers as minor do intrusion could not be avoided upon filling the container in the first 24 h of the experiments no or negligible biological growth and metabolic processes could be expected thus abiotic fe2 oxidation must have been predominated where do acted as an electron acceptor in both storage conditions 3 2 immediate changes in as iii oxidation and removal under both oxic and anoxic conditions as iii oxidation started immediately upon filling of the containers t 0 and continued over the observed experimental period of 8 h as shown in fig 3 at the start of the experiment 100 µg l and 55 µg l of as iii was oxidized during oxic and anoxic storage respectively over the next 8 h an additional 48 as iii oxidation from 188 µg l to 97 µg l was detected in the oxic storage fig 3a whereas in the anoxic storage only 22 from 236 µg l to 183 µg l additional as iii oxidation fig 3b was observed as a result the dissolved as v concentration increased in both storage conditions during oxic storage as iii oxidation was faster than in the anoxic storage probably due to the oxidation of 2 03 mg l fe2 which is known to result in reactive intermediate species ciardelli et al 2008 cui et al 2018 leupin and hug 2005 tian et al 2017 after almost complete oxidation of fe2 2 03 mg l in oxic storage after 5 min the oxidation of as iii slowed down to a rate of 11 µg l h probably due to homogeneous oxidation with o2 do 6 3 mg l lowry and lowry 2002 shafiquzzaman et al 2011 which was in the same order of magnitude as the homogeneous as iii oxidation observed by shumlas et al 2016 the oxidation of as iii under anoxic conditions was slow 6 5 µg l h the limited concentrations of do in the anoxic containers resulted in partial slow fe2 oxidation and consequently the coexistence of fe2 and oxidized fe hfo flocs stimulated heterogeneous as iii oxidation amstaetter et al 2010 tian et al 2017 wang and giammar 2015 although the overall removal of as was higher under oxic conditions the ratio between the removed as and oxidized fe was higher under anoxic conditions 61 µgas mgfe than under oxic conditions 26 µgas mgfe this result is in line with earlier studies indicating that step wise fe2 oxidation and precipitation improved as removal by adsorption and or co precipitation annaduzzaman et al 2021 casentini et al 2016 roberts et al 2004 it appears that the freshly formed hfo flocs in the anoxic storage containers were more efficient for as removal under low ph 6 9 compared to the pre formed hfo and high ph 7 5 during oxic storage kim and nriagu 2000 mercer and tobiason 2008 senn et al 2018 the as iii oxidation results for storage containers with bio carriers was similar to the experiments conducted without bio carriers both for the oxic and anoxic conditions fig 3 s3 this observation underlines that on the first experimental day surface related biological processes did not contribute to the as iii conversion and as iii oxidation could be considered as abiotic 3 3 effect of long term operation on fe2 oxidation the changes in orp and fe2 concentration for the various containers over the experimental period of 30 days are shown in fig 4 throughout the experimental periods the fe2 concentration during oxic conditions remained low and constant at 0 2 0 05 mg l and orp values remained constant too at 130 10 mv fig 4a however during anoxic storage both in the presence and absence of bio carriers orp and fe2 oxidation increased gradually over the 30 days fig 4c d where in the anoxic storage containers without bio carriers on the first day the orp remained stable over 8 h the orp drifted from 100 mv to 46 mv and from 23 mv to 49 mv on days 5 and 30 respectively fig 4c during anoxic storage in the presence of bio carriers the orp drifted from 110 mv on day 1 to 15 mv and 18 mv on days 5 and 30 correspondingly fig 4d the detected increase in orp over time during anoxic storage might have resulted from the oxidation of fe2 yue et al 2016 during anoxic storage the fe2 oxidation rate between 1 and 8 h after filling increased with time from 0 12 0 01 mg l h on the first day to 0 17 0 02 mg l h on day 30 this is probably due to bacterial growth since it is known that at low do concentrations biological fe2 oxidation is faster than abiotic oxidation vollrath et al 2012 in addition the oxidation rate upon filling during the first 10 min increased as well potentially explained by fe2 fe hydro oxide and biofilm enhanced surface related fe2 oxidation tian et al 2017 van beek et al 2015 the combination of heterogeneous and biological fe2 oxidation led to an overall drop in fe2 concentration during anoxic storage to an average of 0 94 0 05 mg l on day 30 after 8 h from 1 39 0 1 mg l on the first day 3 4 effect of long term operation on as iii oxidation and removal arsenic speciation over the 30 experimental days in the oxic and anoxic storage containers without bio carriers are depicted in fig 5 and the results for the bio carriers containing containers are detailed in fig s4 the as iii oxidation during oxic storage was considerably higher after 30 days than during anoxic storage during oxic storage in the containers with bio carriers the remaining as iii concentration decreased from 97 µg l on day 1 to 64 µg l on day 30 the detected as iii oxidation rate 13 5 µg l h during oxic storage at day 30 might have resulted from the high do concentration shumlas et al 2016 and the favorable high ph 7 5 wan et al 2011 in addition the growth of as iii oxidizing bacteria over the days in the containers could also have contributed to the increased as iii oxidation ghosh et al 2018 the removal of as after the first 8 h on day 1 was 54 5 µg l which increased to 100 10 µg l at day 5 and remained constant afterward this higher and constant as removal from day 5 onwards was possibly caused by the accumulation of hfo flocs annaduzzaman et al 2021 during anoxic storage the as iii oxidation rate also remained nearly stable throughout the 30 day experimentation fig 5b the oxidation of as iii was most likely due to the continuous fe2 oxidation over time the removal of produced as v was more effective during anoxic storage compared to oxic storage and further improved over the 30 experimental days the as removal per gram of oxidized fe increased from 61 5 µg of as on day 1 to 80 10 µg of as on day 30 during anoxic storage where during oxic storage the maximum 45 5 µg of as removal was achieved after 30 days apart from the continuous in situ hfo flocs formation and the favorable low ph 6 7 for as v adsorption klas and kirk 2013 wan et al 2011 in anoxic storage both the oxic and anoxic storage containers that contained bio carriers showed 20 5 µg l higher as iii oxidation and 17 5 µg l higher as removal respectively fig s4 compared to the containers without bio carriers over the experimental period of 30 days indicating biotic influences as further discussed below 3 5 effect of long term operation on nh4 no3 and po4 3 concentration the groundwater nh4 no3 and po4 3 concentrations were on average 0 96 mg l 0 39 mg l and 2 15 mg l respectively table 1 during both oxic and anoxic storage oxidation of nh4 was observed after 10 days fig 6 a the decrease in nh4 concentration during oxic storage resulted from the commencement of biological ammonium oxidation koch et al 2019 van kessel et al 2015 leading to an increasing no3 concentration from 0 25 0 1 mg l to 0 73 0 10 mg l however during anoxic storage without bio carriers the nh4 concentration decreased with only 0 15 0 05 mg l fig 6a over the entire experimental 30 days where the concentration of no3 after 10 days increased from 0 25 0 05 mg l to 0 80 0 05 mg l fig 6b both the bio carriers containing containers oxic and anoxic showed a 5 higher decrease in nh4 concentrations which resulted in 9 elevated no3 formation fig s5a b compared to the containers without bio carriers the nitrification process although starting up slowly was not hindered by the slow partial fe2 oxidation in the anoxic containers the concentrations of po4 3 dropped drastically during oxic storages from its source groundwater concentration of 2 15 mg l to an average of 0 65 0 05 mg l fig 6c this decrease in po4 3 concentration during oxic storage with and without bio carriers compared to anoxic storage justified its removal with hfo flocs originated from rapid 2 03 mg l fe2 oxidation fig 4a over 8 h of observation the po4 3 removal remained constant 3 likely due to the lack of new hfo floc formation however during anoxic storage the po4 3 removal followed the slow step wise fe2 oxidation and removal process annaduzzaman et al 2021 over 30 days and after 8 h po4 3 decreased from an initial concentration of 2 03 0 05 mg l to an average of 1 2 0 19 mg l where fe2 concentration decreased from an initial concentration of 1 88 0 1 mg l to 1 66 0 14 mg l 3 6 microbial communities in the container s biomass the metagenomics analysis of the microbial community from the oxic and anoxic container walls showed the presence of various microbial activities a predominance of gram negative bacteria family specifically proteobacteria groups such as comamonadaceae hydrogenophilaceae rhodocyclaceae was observed fig s6 gram negatives are usually dominant in water bodies especially in the sub terrestrial systems and such predominance has been reported in other studies from the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta region before chakraborty et al 2020 ghosh et al 2014 germination of spores and abundance of gram positives such as geodermatophilaceae actinopolysporaceae saccharopolyspora bacillus aeromicrobium oceanobacillus were found on the walls of containers with oxic water only the metagenomic library datasets from the oxic storage containers s1 s2 s3 and anoxic storage containers s1 s2 s3 were clustered and are presented in fig 7 in the oxic storage containers after an incubation period of 30 days the presence of the bacterial species pseudorhodoferrax thiobacter sideroxydans gallionella patulibacter pedomicrobium tepidicella and acidibacillus were observed these bacteria are known to accelerate fe2 oxidation meijler et al 2002 however no or limitedly available fe2 in the oxic storage containers does not imply the notion that these bacteria were involved in fe2 oxidation only in the anoxic storage containers different chemolithotrophic fe2 oxidizing bacterial genus was found except for pseudorhodoferrax which was available in both the oxic and anoxic storage containers the identified possible chemolithotrophic fe2 oxidizers in the anoxic storage containers were nitrosomonas rhodobacter and sphingobacterium table s2 besides fe2 oxidation and flocculation the abundance of fe oxidizers along with thiosulfate oxidizers like thermithiobacillus paucimonas thiobacillus dyella acidibacillus might also lead to acidification and lowering of ph fisher et al 2008 ilgrande et al 2018 this ph decreases further supported a higher as removal by adsorption with the freshly formed hfo flocs in the anoxic storage container the absence of the as iii oxidizing bacterial genus in the anoxic storage containers indicated that the observed as iii oxidation was probably controlled by continuous and slow step wise fe2 oxidation however the observed stable as iii oxidation during oxic conditions might have been associated with detected aioa gene expression of the as iii oxidizing bacterial groups fig 7 such as sideroxydans gallionella hydrogenophaga de vet et al 2011 ghosh et al 2018 in addition the bacterial population on the wall of the container under anoxic conditions was characterized by a higher abundance of nitrospirae nitrospiraceae compared to oxic conditions fig 7 suggesting a possible enhancement of nitrification bryce et al 2018 koch et al 2019 furthermore the presence of ammonia oxidizing groups like nitrosomonas chitinivorax legionella brevibacterium and the absence of nitrite oxidoreductase producing bacterial groups like nitrobacter may result in possible nitrite intermediate no2 production ilgrande et al 2018 the no3 production from nh4 could also attribute to the high rate of nitrate reduction coupled massilia candidatus paracoccus pseudorhodoferrax comamonadceae hydrogenophaga methylomonas with dissimilatory fe2 oxide reduction in the storage containers shaw et al 2020 overall the microbial processes fortify additional as removal during the incubation and slow oxidation period in the anoxic storage containers 4 conclusions the conventional practice of aeration before storage where rapid and complete fe2 oxidation takes place results in poor as removal despite the presence of sufficient native fe2 in the source water the current study hypothesized that the novel concept of anoxic storage will delay the groundwater native fe2 oxidation and consequently the in situ hfo flocs formation would allow for higher as sorption per unit fe in opposition to the conventional oxic storage the oxic and anoxic storage container experiments were conducted in pilot scale in the presence and absence of bio carriers over 30 days with natural groundwater containing fe2 2 33 mg l as 300 µg l and other contaminants like po4 3 2 15 mg l and nh4 0 96 mg l it was found that application of anoxic storage enhanced as removal from groundwater containing 300 µg l of as and 2 33 mg l of fe2 in rajshahi bangladesh although the oxidation of fe2 and as iii during oxic storage was considerably faster the as fe removal ratio was higher during anoxic storage 61 80 5 µgas mgfe compared to the oxic storage 45 5 µgas mgfe this higher as removal efficacy could not be attributed to the speciation of as since as v concentrations were higher during oxic storage due to more favorable abiotic as iii oxidation by o2 and fenton like intermediates and biotic as iii oxidizing bacteria e g sideroxydans gallionella hydrogenophaga conditions the bio carriers containing storage containers oxic and anoxic improved only 20 of as oxidation and removal compared to the without bio carriers containing storage containers therefore the improved performance in the anoxic containers was likely as a consequence of the continuous in situ hydrous ferric oxide floc formation in this flow through system as well as the favorable lower ph 6 9 aiding higher sorption capacities for the gradually formed as v declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16771,storage containers are usually used to provide a constant water head in decentralized community groundwater treatment systems for the removal of iron fe and arsenic as however the commonly practiced aeration prior to storage assists in rapid and complete fe2 oxidation resulting in poor as removal despite sufficient native fe2 in the source water in this study it was found that application of anoxic storage enhanced as removal from groundwater containing 300 µg l of as iii and 2 33 mg l of fe2 in an as affected village of rajshahi district in bangladesh although the oxidation of fe2 and as iii during oxic storage was considerably faster the as fe removal ratio was higher during anoxic storage 61 80 5 µgas mgfe compared to the oxic storage 45 5 µgas mgfe this higher as removal efficacy in anoxic storage containers could not be attributed to the speciation of as since as v concentrations were higher during oxic storage due to more favorable abiotic as iii oxidation by o2 and fenton like intermediates and biotic as iii oxidizing bacteria e g sideroxydans gallionella hydrogenophaga conditions the continuous in situ hydrous ferric oxide floc formation during flow through operation and the favorable lower ph aiding higher sorption capacities for the gradually formed as v likely contributed to the improved performance in the anoxic storage containers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater treatment anoxic storage container arsenic iron 1 introduction the geogenic groundwater contamination of arsenic as negatively affects the quality of drinking water leading to health risks in many countries including bangladesh and india chakraborty et al 2015 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 long term consumption of as contaminated water may cause skin lesions melanosis hyperkeratosis skin cancer and internal organs damage farmer and johnson 1990 guo et al 2013 li et al 2012 luzi et al 2004 according to the world health organization who the recommended values for as in drinking water should not exceed 10 µg l who 2011 whereas 50 µg l is the maximum allowable limit in bangladesh however as can be found in groundwater based drinking water supplies in bangladesh up to several mg l nordstrom 2002 in oxidizing conditions and circumneutral ph such as in surface waters arsenate as v is the predominant species which is usually present in the immobile state forming oxyanions h2aso4 haso4 2 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 lafferty et al 2010 however under circumneutral ph and reducing conditions like in groundwater aquifers arsenite as iii specie is the more toxic mobile and thermodynamically stable in the non ionic form h3aso3 villalobos et al 2014 therefore pre oxidation from as iii to as v is an essential step for as contaminated water treatment processes such as precipitation co precipitation coagulation filtration and adsorption on iron fe oxides activated alumina or bone char bai et al 2016 begum et al 2016 niazi et al 2018 pio et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 however oxidation of as iii through dissolved oxygen do is thermodynamically feasible but is slow gude et al 2018b sorlini and gialdini 2010 aeration is commonly used for oxidizing fe2 and removing carbon dioxide methane hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic compounds from water bruins et al 2014 katsoyiannis et al 2008 vries et al 2017 moreover if the water source also contains as the oxidation of fe2 can also enhance as iii oxidation by reactive oxidation species ros and or fenton like chemical reactions hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 the freshly formed hydrous ferric oxide hfo flocs from fe2 oxidation can bind and co precipitate with as katsoyiannis et al 2015 roberts et al 2004 senn et al 2018 where the binding affinity for as v is stronger than for as iii bissen and frimmel 2003 cui et al 2018 however the removal of as with oxidized hfo flocs has been found to be inefficient due to rapid and almost complete fe2 oxidation during storage or filtration before complete as iii oxidation annaduzzaman et al 2021 gude et al 2016 roberts et al 2004 moreover as formerly observed the rise in ph during aeration increases the negative surface charge on hfo flocs and hence decreases as removal potential dixit and hering 2003 han et al 2016 storage containers are usually used to provide a constant water head in decentralized community treatment systems for the removal of iron fe and arsenic as chakraborty et al 2016 however the commonly practiced aeration prior to storage results in rapid and complete fe2 oxidation resulting in poor as removal despite sufficient native fe2 in the source water as a result the conventional oxic storage and filtration processes require additional chemical oxidants adsorbents for as removal in a recent study annaduzzaman et al 2021 it was found that delayed aeration before sand filtration enhanced overall as removal it is hypothesized that the observed partial fe2 oxidation during anoxic storage promoted as removal in the following aeration filtration steps however the oxidation mechanisms and effects of temporal changes in various water quality parameters in such storage containers are not yet fully understood therefore this study aims to address the following knowledge gaps i the mode of fe2 and as iii oxidation being either homogeneous heterogeneous surface related process biological or in various combinations van beek et al 2015 vries et al 2017 ii the role of various biological processes by subsurface derived indigenous microorganisms crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018a and iii the effect of a larger surface area to adhere biofilms by application of bio carriers in the storage container thus this novel concept of anoxic storage was monitored to understand the oxidation processes of groundwater native fe2 and as iii and their effect on as removal compared to the conventional oxic storage in the presence and absence of bio carriers the oxic and anoxic storage container experiments were conducted over 30 days with natural groundwater in the presence of native fe2 2 33 mg l as 300 µg l and other con t a m i nants like po4

submersible pump gazi bangladesh 2 2 experimental set up of storage containers the experimental set up consisted of eight 75 l polypropylene containers gazi bangladesh to study four storage conditions in duplicate namely oxic with without bio carriers and anoxic with without bio carriers fig 1 the containers with bio carriers were half filled with anoxkaldnes k3 shaped bio carriers purchased from a local shop in dhaka osmosia water bangladesh fig 1 to ensure an abiotic environment at the start of the experiments the containers were thoroughly sterilized with 35 w w hydrogen peroxide h2o2 sigma aldrich every 24 h the stored water was replaced with freshly extracted groundwater without removing the precipitated fe oxide sludge this refill process was chosen to replicate the conventional storage practices where the precipitated fe oxide sludge generally accumulates in the storage container for several weeks the groundwater was aerated by passing it through a showerhead placed 35 cm above the top of the containers with oxic storage in the containers with anoxic storage the inlet of the extracted groundwater was filled without aeration from the bottom of the containers the anoxic containers were overflown for an additional five minutes to avoid any incidental aeration of water the water sampling was performed every 60 min for the first eight hours on days 1 5 10 20 and 30 of the experimental period the experimental time of eight hours was selected to prevent full emptying of the storage container max 90 and consequent discontinuation of the column feed during each sampling event the ph dissolved oxygen do oxygen reduction potential orp and temperature t were directly measured on site in the course of each sampling time 15 ml water samples both 0 45 µm vwr filtered and unfiltered were collected in polypropylene transparent 15 ml centrifuge tube sigma aldrich and acidified with ultrapure hno3 acid acs reagent 70 formula weight 60 01 g mol sigma aldrich to make up for 1 5 acidification of the solutions to preserve for elemental quantification such as fe as etc the water sample was collected using a 60 ml syringe and pre fixed sampling tube iv injection tube square bangladesh at approximately 10 cm above the bottom of the container fig 1 this arrangement was used to avoid opening of the container s lids risk of aeration during water sampling and to maintain consistency of sample quality additionally three times a day 0 4 and 8 h 250 ml filtered 0 45 µm water samples without acidification were collected in the 250 ml polypropylene

as speciation the ion exchange resin amberlite ira 400 chlorite was used this speciation was performed by a 60 ml syringe with 30 ml ion exchange resin after 0 45 μm filtration 100 ml sample were passed through 30 ml ion exchange resin column the remaining as concentration in the resin filtrate was considered as reduced as iii species gude et al 2016 karori et al 2006 finally the obtained as iii species level from the resin filtrate was subtracted from 0 45 µm filtrate total as concentration to determine dissolved as v 2 5 microbial sampling and analyses for the microbial community

sequence read archive accession number prjna673456 https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra prjna673456 3 results and discussion 3 1 immediate changes in ph do orp and fe2 the ph orp do and fe2 concentration during oxic and anoxic storage without the presence of bio carriers measured at the start of the experiment day 1 are shown in fig 2 while the natural groundwater ph do and orp were 6 94 0 07 mg l and 110 mv respectively after aeration the average ph do and orp increased to 7 5 0 03 6 75 0 05 mg l and 130 10 mv respectively this was due to atmospheric gaseous exchange resulting in the release of co2 and uptake of o2 the results for the containers with bio carriers are shown in supplementary fig s2 during the 8 h of observation the ph and orp remained stable during oxic storage fig 2a c and s2a c and do remained above 6 26 mg l fig 2b s2b the dissolved fe concentration considered as fe2 dropped to an average of 0 30 mg l from its initial groundwater concentration of 2 33 mg l which was due to rapid fe2 oxidation at the high do and ph t1 2 roughly 2 3 min fig 2d morgan and lahav 2007 stumm and lee 1961 during anoxic storage fe2 oxidation was slow in comparison with the oxidation rate during oxic storage due to the lower levels of ph 6 9 do 0 35 mg l and orp 100 mv fig 2a b c as evidenced during earlier studies vollrath et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the orp remained stable similar to its initial value 110 mv over 8 h fig 2c while do dropped from 0 35 mg l to 0 23 mg l after the experimental 8 h 1 39 0 05 mg l of fe2 remained dissolved in the anoxic stored water fig 2d s2d the observed 0 94 mg l of fe2 oxidation during anoxic storage corresponded to the average consumed 0 13 mg l of do which was equal to the do drop over 8 h part of the fe2 0 40 mg l oxidized immediately during the filling of the containers as minor do intrusion could not be avoided upon filling the container in the first 24 h of the experiments no or negligible biological growth and metabolic processes could be expected thus abiotic fe2 oxidation must have been predominated where do acted as an electron acceptor in both storage conditions 3 2 immediate changes in as iii oxidation and removal under both oxic and anoxic conditions as iii oxidation started immediately upon filling of the containers t 0 and continued over the observed experimental period of 8 h as shown in fig 3 at the start of the experiment 100 µg l and 55 µg l of as iii was oxidized during oxic and anoxic storage respectively over the next 8 h an additional 48 as iii oxidation from 188 µg l to 97 µg l was detected in the oxic storage fig 3a whereas in the anoxic storage only 22 from 236 µg l to 183 µg l additional as iii oxidation fig 3b was observed as a result the dissolved as v concentration increased in both storage conditions during oxic storage as iii oxidation was faster than in the anoxic storage probably due to the oxidation of 2 03 mg l fe2 which is known to result in reactive intermediate species ciardelli et al 2008 cui et al 2018 leupin and hug 2005 tian et al 2017 after almost complete oxidation of fe2 2 03 mg l in oxic storage after 5 min the oxidation of as iii slowed down to a rate of 11 µg l h probably due to homogeneous oxidation with o2 do 6 3 mg l lowry and lowry 2002 shafiquzzaman et al 2011 which was in the same order of magnitude as the homogeneous as iii oxidation observed by shumlas et al 2016 the oxidation of as iii under anoxic conditions was slow 6 5 µg l h the limited concentrations of do in the anoxic containers resulted in partial slow fe2 oxidation and consequently the coexistence of fe2 and oxidized fe hfo flocs stimulated heterogeneous as iii oxidation amstaetter et al 2010 tian et al 2017 wang and giammar 2015 although the overall removal of as was higher under oxic conditions the ratio between the removed as and oxidized fe was higher under anoxic conditions 61 µgas mgfe than under oxic conditions 26 µgas mgfe this result is in line with earlier studies indicating that step wise fe2 oxidation and precipitation improved as removal by adsorption and or co precipitation annaduzzaman et al 2021 casentini et al 2016 roberts et al 2004 it appears that the freshly formed hfo flocs in the anoxic storage containers were more efficient for as removal under low ph 6 9 compared to the pre formed hfo and high ph 7 5 during oxic storage kim and nriagu 2000 mercer and tobiason 2008 senn et al 2018 the as iii oxidation results for storage containers with bio carriers was similar to the experiments conducted without bio carriers both for the oxic and anoxic conditions fig 3 s3 this observation underlines that on the first experimental day surface related biological processes did not contribute to the as iii conversion and as iii oxidation could be considered as abiotic 3 3 effect of long term operation on fe2 oxidation the changes in orp and fe2 concentration for the various containers over the experimental period of 30 days are shown in fig 4 throughout the experimental periods the fe2 concentration during oxic conditions remained low and constant at 0 2 0 05 mg l and orp values remained constant too at 130 10 mv fig 4a however during anoxic storage both in the presence and absence of bio carriers orp and fe2 oxidation increased gradually over the 30 days fig 4c d where in the anoxic storage containers without bio carriers on the first day the orp remained stable over 8 h the orp drifted from 100 mv to 46 mv and from 23 mv to 49 mv on days 5 and 30 respectively fig 4c during anoxic storage in the presence of bio carriers the orp drifted from 110 mv on day 1 to 15 mv and 18 mv on days 5 and 30 correspondingly fig 4d the detected increase in orp over time during anoxic storage might have resulted from the oxidation of fe2 yue et al 2016 during anoxic storage the fe2 oxidation rate between 1 and 8 h after filling increased with time from 0 12 0 01 mg l h on the first day to 0 17 0 02 mg l h on day 30 this is probably due to bacterial growth since it is known that at low do concentrations biological fe2 oxidation is faster than abiotic oxidation vollrath et al 2012 in addition the oxidation rate upon filling during the first 10 min increased as well potentially explained by fe2 fe hydro oxide and biofilm enhanced surface related fe2 oxidation tian et al 2017 van beek et al 2015 the combination of heterogeneous and biological fe2 oxidation led to an overall drop in fe2 concentration during anoxic storage to an average of 0 94 0 05 mg l on day 30 after 8 h from 1 39 0 1 mg l on the first day 3 4 effect of long term operation on as iii oxidation and removal arsenic speciation over the 30 experimental days in the oxic and anoxic storage containers without bio carriers are depicted in fig 5 and the results for the bio carriers containing containers are detailed in fig s4 the as iii oxidation during oxic storage was considerably higher after 30 days than during anoxic storage during oxic storage in the containers with bio carriers the remaining as iii concentration decreased from 97 µg l on day 1 to 64 µg l on day 30 the detected as iii oxidation rate 13 5 µg l h during oxic storage at day 30 might have resulted from the high do concentration shumlas et al 2016 and the favorable high ph 7 5 wan et al 2011 in addition the growth of as iii oxidizing bacteria over the days in the containers could also have contributed to the increased as iii oxidation ghosh et al 2018 the removal of as after the first 8 h on day 1 was 54 5 µg l which increased to 100 10 µg l at day 5 and remained constant afterward this higher and constant as removal from day 5 onwards was possibly caused by the accumulation of hfo flocs annaduzzaman et al 2021 during anoxic storage the as iii oxidation rate also remained nearly stable throughout the 30 day experimentation fig 5b the oxidation of as iii was most likely due to the continuous fe2 oxidation over time the removal of produced as v was more effective during anoxic storage compared to oxic storage and further improved over the 30 experimental days the as removal per gram of oxidized fe increased from 61 5 µg of as on day 1 to 80 10 µg of as on day 30 during anoxic storage where during oxic storage the maximum 45 5 µg of as removal was achieved after 30 days apart from the continuous in situ hfo flocs formation and the favorable low ph 6 7 for as v adsorption klas and kirk 2013 wan et al 2011 in anoxic storage both the oxic and anoxic storage containers that contained bio carriers showed 20 5 µg l higher as iii oxidation and 17 5 µg l higher as removal respectively fig s4 compared to the containers without bio carriers over the experimental period of 30 days indicating biotic influences as further discussed below 3 5 effect of long term operation on nh4 no3 and po4 3 concentration the groundwater nh4 no3 and po4 3 concentrations were on average 0 96 mg l 0 39 mg l and 2 15 mg l respectively table 1 during both oxic and anoxic storage oxidation of nh4 was observed after 10 days fig 6 a the decrease in nh4 concentration during oxic storage resulted from the commencement of biological ammonium oxidation koch et al 2019 van kessel et al 2015 leading to an increasing no3 concentration from 0 25 0 1 mg l to 0 73 0 10 mg l however during anoxic storage without bio carriers the nh4 concentration decreased with only 0 15 0 05 mg l fig 6a over the entire experimental 30 days where the concentration of no3 after 10 days increased from 0 25 0 05 mg l to 0 80 0 05 mg l fig 6b both the bio carriers containing containers oxic and anoxic showed a 5 higher decrease in nh4 concentrations which resulted in 9 elevated no3 formation fig s5a b compared to the containers without bio carriers the nitrification process although starting up slowly was not hindered by the slow partial fe2 oxidation in the anoxic containers the concentrations of po4 3 dropped drastically during oxic storages from its source groundwater concentration of 2 15 mg l to an average of 0 65 0 05 mg l fig 6c this decrease in po4 3 concentration during oxic storage with and without bio carriers compared to anoxic storage justified its removal with hfo flocs originated from rapid 2 03 mg l fe2 oxidation fig 4a over 8 h of observation the po4 3 removal remained constant 3 likely due to the lack of new hfo floc formation however during anoxic storage the po4 3 removal followed the slow step wise fe2 oxidation and removal process annaduzzaman et al 2021 over 30 days and after 8 h po4 3 decreased from an initial concentration of 2 03 0 05 mg l to an average of 1 2 0 19 mg l where fe2 concentration decreased from an initial concentration of 1 88 0 1 mg l to 1 66 0 14 mg l 3 6 microbial communities in the container s biomass the metagenomics analysis of the microbial community from the oxic and anoxic container walls showed the presence of various microbial activities a predominance of gram negative bacteria family specifically proteobacteria groups such as comamonadaceae hydrogenophilaceae rhodocyclaceae was observed fig s6 gram negatives are usually dominant in water bodies especially in the sub terrestrial systems and such predominance has been reported in other studies from the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta region before chakraborty et al 2020 ghosh et al 2014 germination of spores and abundance of gram positives such as geodermatophilaceae actinopolysporaceae saccharopolyspora bacillus aeromicrobium oceanobacillus were found on the walls of containers with oxic water only the metagenomic library datasets from the oxic storage containers s1 s2 s3 and anoxic storage containers s1 s2 s3 were clustered and are presented in fig 7 in the oxic storage containers after an incubation period of 30 days the presence of the bacterial species pseudorhodoferrax thiobacter sideroxydans gallionella patulibacter pedomicrobium tepidicella and acidibacillus were observed these bacteria are known to accelerate fe2 oxidation meijler et al 2002 however no or limitedly available fe2 in the oxic storage containers does not imply the notion that these bacteria were involved in fe2 oxidation only in the anoxic storage containers different chemolithotrophic fe2 oxidizing bacterial genus was found except for pseudorhodoferrax which was available in both the oxic and anoxic storage containers the identified possible chemolithotrophic fe2 oxidizers in the anoxic storage containers were nitrosomonas rhodobacter and sphingobacterium table s2 besides fe2 oxidation and flocculation the abundance of fe oxidizers along with thiosulfate oxidizers like thermithiobacillus paucimonas thiobacillus dyella acidibacillus might also lead to acidification and lowering of ph fisher et al 2008 ilgrande et al 2018 this ph decreases further supported a higher as removal by adsorption with the freshly formed hfo flocs in the anoxic storage container the absence of the as iii oxidizing bacterial genus in the anoxic storage containers indicated that the observed as iii oxidation was probably controlled by continuous and slow step wise fe2 oxidation however the observed stable as iii oxidation during oxic conditions might have been associated with detected aioa gene expression of the as iii oxidizing bacterial groups fig 7 such as sideroxydans gallionella hydrogenophaga de vet et al 2011 ghosh et al 2018 in addition the bacterial population on the wall of the container under anoxic conditions was characterized by a higher abundance of nitrospirae nitrospiraceae compared to oxic conditions fig 7 suggesting a possible enhancement of nitrification bryce et al 2018 koch et al 2019 furthermore the presence of ammonia oxidizing groups like nitrosomonas chitinivorax legionella brevibacterium and the absence of nitrite oxidoreductase producing bacterial groups like nitrobacter may result in possible nitrite intermediate no2 production ilgrande et al 2018 the no3 production from nh4 could also attribute to the high rate of nitrate reduction coupled massilia candidatus paracoccus pseudorhodoferrax comamonadceae hydrogenophaga methylomonas with dissimilatory fe2 oxide reduction in the storage containers shaw et al 2020 overall the microbial processes fortify additional as removal during the incubation and slow oxidation period in the anoxic storage containers 4 conclusions the conventional practice of aeration before storage where rapid and complete fe2 oxidation takes place results in poor as removal despite the presence of sufficient native fe2 in the source water the current study hypothesized that the novel concept of anoxic storage will delay the groundwater native fe2 oxidation and consequently the in situ hfo flocs formation would allow for higher as sorption per unit fe in opposition to the conventional oxic storage the oxic and anoxic storage container experiments were conducted in pilot scale in the presence and absence of bio carriers over 30 days with natural groundwater containing fe2 2 33 mg l as 300 µg l and other contaminants like po4 3 2 15 mg l and nh4 0 96 mg l it was found that application of anoxic storage enhanced as removal from groundwater containing 300 µg l of as and 2 33 mg l of fe2 in rajshahi bangladesh although the oxidation of fe2 and as iii during oxic storage was considerably faster the as fe removal ratio was higher during anoxic storage 61 80 5 µgas mgfe compared to the oxic storage 45 5 µgas mgfe this higher as removal efficacy could not be attributed to the speciation of as since as v concentrations were higher during oxic storage due to more favorable abiotic as iii oxidation by o2 and fenton like intermediates and biotic as iii oxidizing bacteria e g sideroxydans gallionella hydrogenophaga conditions the bio carriers containing storage containers oxic and anoxic improved only 20 of as oxidation and removal compared to the without bio carriers containing storage containers therefore the improved performance in the anoxic containers was likely as a consequence of the continuous in situ hydrous ferric oxide floc formation in this flow through system as well as the favorable lower ph 6 9 aiding higher sorption capacities for the gradually formed as v declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16772,microplastics mps inevitably undergo aging transformation and transport process in environmental compartments in this study the polystyrene mps were aged via three different oxidation methods including persulfate oxidation ps uv irradiation uv and uv irradiated persulfate oxidation uvps all three treatments induced the great transformation of mps with the significant increase in surface roughness and in oxygen containing functional groups i e cooh or cooc the uvps aging showed synergetic effect due to the strengthened photo initiated chemical oxidation compared to uv and ps alone all aged mps exhibited the enhanced transport 34 9 89 2 in sandy and clay loam soils than pristine mps 30 5 and the synergetic effect was also observed in the transport behaviors of the uvps mps higher transport of mps and aged mps occurred in sandy soil than that in clay loam soil since the latter one contained high fe minerals that tend to retain mps which was confirmed by the model quartz sand column experiment modeling on the migration of mps retained in soil under a rainstorm scenario showed that the aged mps had the stronger remobility and greater proportion of cumulative flux than pristine ones in the soil profile these findings provided new insights on the fate and transport of mps in natural soil and their potential risk to groundwater contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging transport soil contamination modeling 1 introduction microplastics mps are emerging contaminants of increasing global concern as a result of intensive production and improper use approximately 12 billion metric tons of plastic wastes could be released into environment by 2050 geyer et al 2017 these discarded plastic debris with the size smaller than 5 mm are ubiquitous and prevalent in different environmental compartments extensive studies on the aquatic environment have revealed that mps had potential toxicity to the ecosystems due to their high mobility and exposure nevertheless the fate and transport of mps in terrestrial ecosystems remain largely unexplored despite plastics in terrestrial soils are 4 23 times higher than the aquatic system barnes et al 2009 scheurer and bigalke 2018 wong et al 2020 microplastic particles enter the soil environment via domestic and industrial sources such as plastic film mulching sewage sludge landfill fertilization irrigation and flooding of wastewater tire abrasion and atmospheric deposition guo et al 2020 van den berg et al 2020 wright et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 microplastics reside in soil might undergo a series of aging processes driven by physical chemical and biological factors mainly including ultraviolet radiation in topsoil celina et al 2019 hale et al 2011 liu et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 this photo initiated oxidative aging involves 1 initiation that uv energy absorption by unsaturated bonds to break chemical bonds ch bonds on the polymer backbone to form free radicals 2 propagation that polymer radicals react with oxygen to form peroxy radicals and thus leading to chain scission or cross linking and 3 termination by the formation of oxygen containing functional groups mainly c c cho and c o duan et al 2021 gewert et al 2015 gijsman et al 1999 therefore polystyrene polyethylene and polypropylene mps are more susceptible to photo initiated aging since they have unsaturated double bonds in their polymer backbone as one of the most common type of plastics found in the soil environment the polystyrene mps when exposed to the uv aging results in the cleavage of hydrogen the formation of polymer radicals and ultimately the generation of oxygen containing functional groups because the excitation energy of the phenyl ring is transferred to the nearest ch bond gewert et al 2015 rivaton and gardette 1998 apart from uv radiation the mps in soil may co exist with reactive oxygen species ros generated from chemical and biological processes especially from the chemical or biological treatments applied for the remediation of contaminated soils gardette et al 2013 liu et al 2019b luo et al 2021 chemical oxidation such as persulfate treatments is often applied for the contaminated remediation in which a variety of free radicals oh and so4 can be generated for degradation of organic contaminants and meanwhile these free radicals may induce the surface oxidation of mps andrady et al 1993 cooper and corcoran 2010 song et al 2017 excessive evidence has shown that the photo coupled with chemical processes had higher efficiencies for organic pollutants degradation by comparison with a single uv irradiation with the holes and hydroxyl radicals acting as the dominant active species loeb et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2020 smaali et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that aged mps have altered surface structure with increasing surface roughness and generation of oxygen containing functional groups including oh cooh and cho owing to the chain scission of mps and the role of reactive oxygen species ros mainly derived from the photochemical reaction celina et al 2019 kalčíková et al 2020 mao et al 2020 therefore the changes in the functional groups of mps during their aging process can be identified as an index for oxidation degree and aging dynamics in correspondence to the aging the aged mps with altered physiochemical properties could reveal different transport behavior from the pristine mps in soils occurrence of rich oxygen containing groups in the aged mps would change negative charge and zeta potential which would affect the transport of mps however to date almost all studies have used pristine mp spheres for the transport experiments through quartz sand column in addition it has been reported that environmental factors such as ph ionic strength mineral oxides and organic matters could affect the transport of colloids or microparticles chen et al 2018 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2020 nevertheless the transport behavior of aged mps in various soils remains unclear therefore this study was objected to determine the aging and transport process of mps in natural soils as well as the variables dominating the transport of these aged mps three aging methods were applied including uv irradiation persulfate oxidation and uv activated persulfate oxidation the uv irradiation was selected to simulate the photo aging of mps in soil under sunlight persulfate oxidation was selected to simulate the chemical aging of mps in contaminated soil receiving oxidation treatment the uv activated persulfate oxidation was to simulate the photochemical aging of mps the transformation of mps during aging was explored by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem two different types of soils including a sandy soil and a clay loam soil were used for the transport of mps to determine the key factor in the transport of aged mps in soils among various environmental factors the column experiments in clean quartz sand were conducted to predict the mobility behavior of mps retained in soils after the transport under local rainstorm condition modeling simulation was conducted by using hydrus 1d software 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastic particles and soils polystyrene microspheres tianjin baseline tech co china with an average diameter of 1 μm were utilized as model pristine microplastic particles mps the 2 5 w v stock pristine mps suspension was produced directly through emulsion polymerization without any modification on their spherical surfaces characterization of surface morphology and chemistry of mps was conducted by field emission using scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir respectively the concentrations of mps were determined by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer the details for the characterization were presented in supporting information two soils including sandy soil and clay loam soil were collected from topsoil 0 20 cm in anhui and hainan provinces china respectively the sampled soils were air dried crushed and sieved to obtain the soil particles with size ranging between 600 and 710 μm chen et al 2019 the details for soil characterization were described in supporting information 2 2 microplastics aging experiments 2 2 1 persulfate oxidation according to the method described by liu et al 2019b the 40 ml of 100 mg l 1 pristine polystyrene mps after sonication was introduced into 160 ml of 100 mm freshly prepared k2s2o8 solution pre adjusted to ph 7 0 on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature 25 2 c the equal amount of k2s2o8 was added to the suspension every 12 h as a result of the consumption of the k2s2o8 to prevent the accumulation of k2s2o8 in the solution the mps sample was separated from the suspension via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm every 2 days and washed 3 times with deionized di water followed by introduced into fresh k2s2o8 solution the mps were continuously treated according to the above procedures for different time periods the aged mps at 2 4 and 8 days were collected via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm and then dried immediately for characterization of surface morphology surface chemistry and particle size supporting information control samples were conducted in di water without oxidant under the same conditions 2 2 2 uv aging treatment to simulate the natural uv irradiation of mps uv aging experiments were carried out in an aging chamber with three 15 w uva 340 lamps 15 w each purchased from philips shanghai china at room temperature 25 2 c 20 mg l 1 pristine polystyrene mps were evenly distributed in a 500 ml beaker covered by a glass cover and regularly replenishing water loss the mps were sonicated every 12 h to avoid aggregation and evenly aged the aged mps samples were separated via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm after aging for 1 month 2 months and 3 months and collected for characterization of surface morphology surface chemistry and particle size supporting information control samples were conducted in di water in dark without uv irradiation at room temperature it should be noted that the uv intensity is not strong and uv irradiation is a slow aging process thus the uv aging lasted for 3 months which could be comparable to the 8 days completed in the ps treatment 2 2 3 uv activated persulfate treatment as mentioned above combined effects of uv irradiation and chemical oxidation on the aging of mps could commonly occur in the soil environment hence pristine polystyrene mps were introduced into the prepared k2s2o8 solution following the same procedures in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 and then put in an aging chamber with three uva 340 lamps 15 w each at room temperature 25 2 c the mp samples were taken after aging for 2 4 and 8 days the samples were rinsed several times with di water and collected after vacuum filtration 0 45 μm and dried immediately for characterization of surface morphology surface chemistry and particle size supporting information control samples were conducted in di water in dark without persulfate at room temperature 2 3 column transport experiments the prepared soils were dry packed into cylindrical plexiglas columns 1 2 cm inner diameter 8 cm length details for soil pretreatment and column packing were described in supporting information the soil column was initially injected upward with 100 ml of 5 mg l 1 nacl background solution at a flow rate of 0 50 0 05 ml min 1 followed by 200 ml of 20 mg l 1 mps solutions and then 50 ml of 5 mg l 1 nacl background solution at the end the effluent samples were collected into glass vials every 20 min nearly 3 34 pore volumes pv by automatic collector bs 100a huxi analytical instrument factory co shanghai china the concentration of mps in the effluent samples was determined to plot the breakthrough curves of mps transport at the end of transport experiment the soil was taken out for mps characterization by using sem to explore the mechanisms of mps transport in two soils a model quartz sand column experiment was conducted with the aiming at the possible major influence parameters such as ph ionic strength and fe mn two ph values were selected at 4 0 and 6 0 and the two types of cations including 5 mm na and 5 mm ca2 were selected according to the physicochemical properties of the two soils the quartz sand coated with fe was packed in the column for determining the effect of fe on the mps transport the selective column properties and varying environmental conditions were detailed in table s4 and s5 the transport of mps was fitted by two kinetic sites modeling based on the hydrus 1d software which can effectively model one dimensional water flow and solute movement in variably saturated soils simunek et al 2008 to qualitatively understand the interactions between mps and soil particles or quartz sand the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energy between mps and porous medium were calculated and analyzed gui et al 2021 the details for modeling and dlvo calculation were described in supporting information 2 4 migration of microplastics retained in soils by rainstorm there are still some mps that could be retained in soil after its transport these retained mps may be remobilized under severe environmental conditions such as rainstorm the mps retained in soil migrate downward by rainstorm and thus pose a potential risk to the groundwater environment based on the experimental data of the mps retained in the columns obtained in section 2 3 the mps migration in soil by heavy precipitation was simulated and modeled following simunek et al 2008 according to the recorded data the precipitation of anhui and hainan provinces china were 174 mm and 339 mm during a rainstorm event in july 2020 respectively administration 2020 the simulations were run with hydrus 1d by a nonlinear least square optimizer based on the levenberg marquardt algorithm based on the parameters from the transport breakthrough curves the retained mps in the soil from section 2 3 was considered as the contamination source at the beginning of this model the model can effectively simulate one dimensional water flow and solute movement in variably saturated soils specifically considering particle colloid mobility using attachment detachment with the high determination coefficient r2 0 95 simunek et al 2008 the values of dispersivity attachment and detachment parameters showed variability in model results which was attributed to the differences in mps properties soil properties experimental conditions and other environmental factors for instance sorption sites in different soils may have different retention capacities and rates depending on the value of smax to be consistent with the selected soils in our study depth of 0 30 cm for the topsoil was considered in this model 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aged microplastics and soil properties comparison of the sem images of aged and pristine mps clearly showed that surfaces of the mps appeared to be rough with small cracks during the aging process fig 1 a c the pristine mps had regular and smooth surfaces with an average particle size of 1161 8 17 2 nm as the aging time increased the surfaces of the mps were getting rough and uneven the average particle size of uvps mps showed the most obvious decrease from 1161 8 17 2 to 823 7 16 3 nm followed by that of uv mps to 912 5 13 8 nm and then to 924 8 14 1 for ps mps figs 1d f the ps or uv treatment alone was limited for the mp aging especially uv treatment in which the particle size did not differ noticeably during the first 30 day period but appeared to have much rougher surfaces after 90 days since uv irradiation was a long time and gradual aging process the combined uv and ps uvps treatment showed the synergetic effect in which the surface was relatively rougher and the size was smaller compared to uv and ps alone notwithstanding the shape of aged mps was little changed and was still spherical with more roughness surface the significant changes in the aged mps morphology were further supported by the results of ftir the abundance of functional groups of mps after aging was enhanced including ch2 at 2998 cm 1 and 2954 cm 1 cooh and or cooc at 1730 cm 1 coh or co c at 1269 and 1237 cm 1 and co c at 1191 and 1144 cm 1 according to the ftir spectra fig 2 a notably the peak of the carbonyl band c o stretching vibration at 1730 cm 1 increased substantially as the aging increased the major reason for the increase in oxygen containing functional groups of the aged mps could be due to ch bond breaking during oxidation process ch bond reacted with oxygen to form peroxy radicals and absorbed hydrogen atoms from the surrounding environment to form functional groups i e oh and cooh wang et al 2020 the formation of oxygen containing functional groups suggested that microplastics aging was a result of oxidation liu et al 2019a notably the uvps mps had the higher content of functional groups in a shorter time than single treated mps as the aging time increased the peak intensity of oxygen containing functional groups increased fig 2b meaning that the mps got more and more aged the changes in the functional groups corresponding to the three types of aging were compared by calculating the ratio of the maximum absorbance value for the peak relative to the value of a reference peak here we selected 840 cm 1 as a reference since it changed little with aging in this study chen et al 2015 as shown in fig 2b the resulted normalized peak intensities of the main peak cooh or cooc at 1730 cm 1 showed the greater increase than that of co c at 1144 cm 1 relatively the uv irradiation or ps oxidation gradually induced the increase on the surface functional groups of mps while the combined uv and ps can quickly initiate the advanced oxidation by generating ros and hence greatly altered the surface chemistry of mps these ftir results were consistent with that of the oxygen to carbon o c ratio which was generally used to characterize the aging degree of mps liu et al 2019b zhou et al 2020 aging increased the o c ratio of mps from 0 40 to 0 46 0 51 and 0 65 with the aging of persulfate treatment uv irradiation and uv activated persulfate treatment respectively besides our results showed that the high o c ratio of mps was also correlated with great negative surface charge of mps r2 0 958 fig s1 suggesting that the aged mps with increasing surface functional groups tended to have more negative zeta potential the changes in morphology size and chemistry of aged mps could have effect on the transport two soils with different properties were used for the transport of mps table 1 and s1 one was sandy soil containing over 95 sand and the other one was clay loam with over 41 clay content the sandy soil was slightly acidic ph 6 70 and contained mainly k 46 6 g kg 1 and na 21 3 g kg 1 while clay loam soil was acidic ph 4 76 and contained significant amounts of fe 66 0 g kg 1 and al 53 5 g kg 1 additionally more negative zeta potential was observed for sandy soil 46 2 mv than clay loam 4 5 mv due to relatively lower contents of positively charged fe al oxides in sandy soil parks 1965 two soils had different physicochemical properties which would also have distinct influence on the transport of mps in soil 3 2 transport and retention of pristine and aged microplastics in two types of soils the aged mps exhibited much greater mobility than the pristine mps in both soils as indicated by the higher breakthrough curves of the aged mps than those of the pristine ones fig 3 the mobility of the mps through both soils was followed by uvps mps uv mps ps mps pristine mps for instance in the sandy soil uvps mps had the highest breakthrough percentage of 89 2 which was approximately 1 68 times of uv mps 53 2 57 times of ps mps 34 7 and 2 92 times of pristine mps 30 5 uvps mps were the most negatively charged table s2 due to the highest formation of surface o functional groups cooh compared to the pristine mps fig 2 thus increasing the electrostatic repulsion between aged mps and soil particles this was also agreed with the result of dlvo interaction energy calculations that the highest potential energy φmax between sandy soil particles and uvps uv ps and pristine mps was 734 197 40 3 and 36 7 kbt respectively fig s2b the highest φmax for uvps was responsible for its greater electrostatic repulsion and thus increasing the transport of aged mps compared to uv mps and ps mps alone the uvps mps with the combined uv and ps treatments obviously showed the strongest effect on the mps transport which was attributed to the synergetic change in surface morphology and chemistry of uvps mps fig 2 the mps could be retained in soil during its transport we found that the pristine mps showed the highest value of maximum retention in clay loam of 186 mg g 1 table s6 therefore the above results clearly showed that aging induced changes on mps surface chemistry could facilitate the transport of mps in soils further observation showed that the transport of all mps in clay loam was greatly lower than that in the sandy soil fig 3 it was probably that the clay loam soil has much higher contents of fe al oxides providing more favorable sites for negatively charged mp particles retention through electrostatic attraction cornelis et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2020 figs 4 a d clearly showed the retention of all mps in clay loam soil that the mps were covered or coated with soil mainly soil minerals or organic compounds while the mps in sandy soil were relatively clean without any coatings figs 4e h furthermore the aged mps appeared to have more interactions with soil owing to their more adsorption sites than the pristine ones consequently resulting in greater retention in soil 3 3 key factors and mechanisms controlling the transport of microplastics in two soils with different properties to explore the difference in the transport of mps in two soils the effects from key soil properties and responsible mechanisms were further investigated by using model quartz sand column with the changing corresponding soil parameters the main different soil parameters included ph value primary cations and fe minerals table 1 and s1 other environmental factors such as soil organic matter som were reported to have some influence on mps transport lyu et al 2019 song et al 2019 in this study however the som contained in the two soils was relatively low table 1 which could have little influence on the mps transport column experiments were conducted in the two pretreated soils with som removed by 30 h2o2 for over 24 h at 80 c the results verified that om hardly affected the transport of mps through saturated soil profiles fig s3 the results showed that the aged mps had higher transport than the pristine in quartz sand under both ph 4 and 6 figs 5 a and b which corresponded to the ph values in clay loam and sandy soil respectively it was again demonstrated that aging by uv irradiation and ps oxidation enhanced the transport of mps either in real soil or in quartz sand the transport of mps in quartz sand was higher at ph 6 than that at ph 4 figs 5a and b the mps and sand got more negatively charged at higher ph table s3 contributing to the stronger electrostatic repulsions between sand and mps thus facilitating the transport of mps at higher ph fig s4 at lower ph the abundant h could absorb more negative ions that the surface charge of mps would be lower thus decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between the mps and sand which reduced the mobility of the mps the higher transport of mps at ph 6 than that at ph 4 in quartz sand was consistent with the trend of higher in sandy soil with ph 6 70 than in clay loam soil with ph 4 76 it seemed that the ph could be a factor affecting the mps transport in soil however the difference in the transport of mps between the two ph values was limited fig 5a and b thus to say the least the ph was not a key factor influencing the transport of mps two types of cations of na and ca2 were selected to test the effect of ionic strength on the mps transport the contents of k and na in sandy soil was up to 10 times greater of that in clay loam while the content of ca2 and mg2 in clay loam was about 10 times greater of that in sandy soil table 1 under all the ionic strength conditions tested the aging again facilitated the mobility of the mps through quartz sand media fig 5c for instance when the background electrolyte was 5 mm nacl the effluent recovery of pristine mps was only 39 8 whereas those of the aged ones for ps mps uv mps and uvps mps reached 43 1 53 3 and 81 6 respectively fig 5c table s4 divalent ca2 exhibited greater effect on inhibiting the transport of mps than that of monovalent na at the same concentration figs 5d for instance the effluent recovery of uvps mps was 81 6 at 5 mm nacl whereas that was only 36 1 at 5 mm cacl2 this was because more effective charge neutralization effect of ca2 than that of na owing to the higher zeta potentials of mps and quartz sand in cacl2 than those in nacl table s4 chen et al 2019 kobayashi et al 2009 li et al 2020 the higher zeta potentials of mps and quartz sand in cacl2 were due to compression of the electrical double layer and hence reducing the repulsive forces between mps and sand particles dong et al 2019 rong et al 2020 wu et al 2020 as a result the highest potential energy φmax between mps and quartz sand particles in cacl2 562 35 8 kbt was considerably lower than those in nacl 718 46 2 kbt indicating that ca2 was more effective to weaken the electrostatic repulsion between mps and porous media for more retention of mps fig s5 the higher transport of mps at nacl than that at cacl2 in quartz sand was consistent with the trend of higher in sandy soil with high na than in clay loam soil with ca therefore the ionic strength could be a factor affecting the mps transport in soil in addition to ph and ionic strength iron and aluminum oxides were reported to have a leading role in the variation of mps transport in soils han et al 2014 the previous studies showed that higher contents of fe al oxide were responsible for the enhanced nanoparticles retention in porous media cornelis et al 2013 wang et al 2015 compared to the difference in al content between the two soils clay loam soil contained fe content about 8 times higher than sandy soil table 1 in order to test the effect of fe in soil the quartz sand was pretreated with fe oh 3 in which fe content represented it in the clay loam soil in comparison with the clean quartz sand the presence of fe resulted in higher retention and low transport of the mps in fe coated sand column figs 5e and f higher positively charged fe contents increased the zeta potentials of the sand from 46 2 to 23 8 33 1 mv table s4 and s5 contributing greater electrostatic attraction between mps and sand surfaces nevertheless the uvps mps still showed the synergetic effect of enhanced transport in the fe coated quartz sand compared uv mps and ps mps fig 5f and table s5 overall the three controlling factors could be the primary drivers on the four mps transport in soils confirmed by our quartz sand column experiment with high satisfaction with varying solution chemistry the transport of mps was positively correlated with soil ph whereas negatively correlated with ionic strength and contents of fe in soils fig 6 the pearson correlation test was calculated based on the mass percentage of each mps recovered from the quartz sand column effluents under varying scenarios the mps transport in clay loam was highly sensitive to the level of fe content especially for the most aged uvps mps ph was the least affective to the transport of uvps and uv aged mps in clay loam while for the transport of pristine and ps aged mps in clay loam the influence of ph is and fe content was almost the same thus our result of the correlation matrix showed that transport of the more aged mps could be more affected by the environmental factor of fe content in clay loam soil rather than ph in sandy soil the mobility of pristine and aged mps was correlated to ph and ionic strength but the corresponding influence on the transport of four mps had no difference that is in sandy soil changes in ph and is affected all the mps mobility at the same degree while fe content obviously decreased the transport of uv and uvps aged mps at a greater extent in clay loam compared with ph and is consequently surface chemistry of mps and soil fe minerals were the determining factors on the mps transport in clay loam and ph and ionic strength were considered as the key factors for the mps transport in sandy soil 3 4 modeling on the migration of microplastic retained in soil by rainstorm the results above showed that there were still some mps that were retained in soil after its transport these retained mps may migrate downward by rainstorm and thus pose a potential risk to the groundwater environment thus the modeling was conducted to understand the stability of retained mps under rainstorm according to the results of column experiment of the mps transport in soils fig 3 the retention of each mps was different that pristine mps retained the most while uvps aged mps retained the least the mps retention after column experiments was considered as the point source for mps migration in two soils under a rainstorm event based on the fitting parameters of hydrus 1d modeling table s6 the depth of the maximum concentration was marked with time to predict the average migration rate of the mps in the soil profile figs 7 a and b aged mps showed the stronger mobility in soils following the order uvps mps uv mps ps mps pristine mps the mps migration in sandy soil was greater than that in clay loam since the mps could reach the same depth within shorter time period in sandy soil which was also consistent with the column transport experiment results cumulative flux of the mps migration was also predicted in the form of proportion of the mps content of migration over their original retention figs 7c and d the relative migration flux was evaluated since the retained mps amount varied with the soil type and aging processes the results showed that a larger proportion of the aged mps were likely to mobilize and more mps would migrate in sandy soil than in clay loam indicating the risk of groundwater contamination considering the soil used in this study was sieved and relatively uniform in size the fate and transport of mps in the real soil could be more complex the water flow parameters were estimated via the function of neural network predictions based on soil bulk density and soil textural distribution which might not represent the complex condition in the real environment therefore the major weakness of this hydrus 1d model was the lack of calibration and validation in varying field conditions which requires future work 4 conclusions and environmental implications there is increasing awareness of the detrimental impacts of mps in the terrestrial environment while large effort has been exerted to understand the distribution and toxicity of these plastic particles the transformation and transport of mps in soils may provide substantial evidence for the ecological risk in a realistic scenario this study revealed that uv irradiation and persulfate oxidation caused the change in the physicochemical properties especially in the surface chemistry of mps where oxygen containing functional groups increased and surface charge reduced all these changes resulted in the enhanced transport of aged mps in the soil environment the combined uv irradiation and persulfate oxidation exhibited the synergetic effect on the surface chemistry and transport of mps soil properties such as ph and ionic strength have also influence on the transport of mps especially fe oxide played dominant role in the mps transport due to their enhanced electrostatic interactions modeling on the migration of retained mps in a rainstorm scenario showed the rapid mobility of aged mps in soil compared to the pristine mps overall the findings of this study implied that natural uv irradiation and or chemical oxidation led to the aging of mps resulting in the enhanced transport in soil which could pose contamination risk on groundwater it should be pointed out that future work is highly recommended to involve different types of mps and varying aging

16772,microplastics mps inevitably undergo aging transformation and transport process in environmental compartments in this study the polystyrene mps were aged via three different oxidation methods including persulfate oxidation ps uv irradiation uv and uv irradiated persulfate oxidation uvps all three treatments induced the great transformation of mps with the significant increase in surface roughness and in oxygen containing functional groups i e cooh or cooc the uvps aging showed synergetic effect due to the strengthened photo initiated chemical oxidation compared to uv and ps alone all aged mps exhibited the enhanced transport 34 9 89 2 in sandy and clay loam soils than pristine mps 30 5 and the synergetic effect was also observed in the transport behaviors of the uvps mps higher transport of mps and aged mps occurred in sandy soil than that in clay loam soil since the latter one contained high fe minerals that tend to retain mps which was confirmed by the model quartz sand column experiment modeling on the migration of mps retained in soil under a rainstorm scenario showed that the aged mps had the stronger remobility and greater proportion of cumulative flux than pristine ones in the soil profile these findings provided new insights on the fate and transport of mps in natural soil and their potential risk to groundwater contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging transport soil contamination modeling 1 introduction microplastics mps are emerging contaminants of increasing global concern as a result of intensive production and improper use approximately 12 billion metric tons of plastic wastes could be released into environment by 2050 geyer et al 2017 these discarded plastic debris with the size smaller than 5 mm are ubiquitous and prevalent in different environmental compartments extensive studies on the aquatic environment have revealed that mps had potential toxicity to the ecosystems due to their high mobility and exposure nevertheless the fate and transport of mps in terrestrial ecosystems remain largely unexplored despite plastics in terrestrial soils are 4 23 times higher than the aquatic system barnes et al 2009 scheurer and bigalke 2018 wong et al 2020 microplastic particles enter the soil environment via domestic and industrial sources such as plastic film mulching sewage sludge landfill fertilization irrigation and flooding of wastewater tire abrasion and atmospheric deposition guo et al 2020 van den berg et al 2020 wright et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 microplastics reside in soil might undergo a series of aging processes driven by physical chemical and biological factors mainly including ultraviolet radiation in topsoil celina et al 2019 hale et al 2011 liu et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 this photo initiated oxidative aging involves 1 initiation that uv energy absorption by unsaturated bonds to break chemical bonds ch bonds on the polymer backbone to form free radicals 2 propagation that polymer radicals react with oxygen to form peroxy radicals and thus leading to chain scission or cross linking and 3 termination by the formation of oxygen containing functional groups mainly c c cho and c o duan et al 2021 gewert et al 2015 gijsman et al 1999 therefore polystyrene polyethylene and polypropylene mps are more susceptible to photo initiated aging since they have unsaturated double bonds in their polymer backbone as one of the most common type of plastics found in the soil environment the polystyrene mps when exposed to the uv aging results in the cleavage of hydrogen the formation of polymer radicals and ultimately the generation of oxygen containing functional groups because the excitation energy of the phenyl ring is transferred to the nearest ch bond gewert et al 2015 rivaton and gardette 1998 apart from uv radiation the mps in soil may co exist with reactive oxygen species ros generated from chemical and biological processes especially from the chemical or biological treatments applied for the remediation of contaminated soils gardette et al 2013 liu et al 2019b luo et al 2021 chemical oxidation such as persulfate treatments is often applied for the contaminated remediation in which a variety of free radicals oh and so4 can be generated for degradation of organic contaminants and meanwhile these free radicals may induce the surface oxidation of mps andrady et al 1993 cooper and corcoran 2010 song et al 2017 excessive evidence has shown that the photo coupled with chemical processes had higher efficiencies for organic pollutants degradation by comparison with a single uv irradiation with the holes and hydroxyl radicals acting as the dominant active species loeb et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2020 smaali et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that aged mps have altered surface structure with increasing surface roughness and generation of oxygen containing functional groups including oh cooh and cho owing to the chain scission of mps and the role of reactive oxygen species ros mainly derived from the photochemical reaction celina et al 2019 kalčíková et al 2020 mao et al 2020 therefore the changes in the functional groups of mps during their aging process can be identified as an index for oxidation degree and aging dynamics in correspondence to the aging the aged mps with altered physiochemical properties could reveal different transport behavior from the pristine mps in soils occurrence of rich oxygen containing groups in the aged mps would change negative charge and zeta potential which would affect the transport of mps however to date almost all studies have used pristine mp spheres for the transport experiments through quartz sand column in addition it has been reported that environmental factors such as ph ionic strength mineral oxides and organic matters could affect the transport of colloids or microparticles chen et al 2018 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2020 nevertheless the transport behavior of aged mps in various soils remains unclear therefore this study was objected to determine the aging and transport process of mps in natural soils as well as the variables dominating the transport of these aged mps three aging methods were applied including uv irradiation persulfate oxidation and uv activated persulfate oxidation the uv irradiation was selected to simulate the photo aging of mps in soil under sunlight persulfate oxidation was selected to simulate the chemical aging of mps in contaminated soil receiving oxidation treatment the uv activated persulfate oxidation was to simulate the photochemical aging of mps the transformation of mps during aging was explored by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem two different types of soils including a sandy soil and a clay loam soil were used for the transport of mps to determine the key factor in the transport of aged mps in soils among various environmental factors the column experiments in clean quartz sand were conducted to predict the mobility behavior of mps retained in soils after the transport under local rainstorm condition modeling simulation was conducted by using hydrus 1d software 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastic particles and soils polystyrene microspheres tianjin baseline tech co china with an average diameter of 1 μm were utilized as model pristine microplastic particles mps the 2 5 w v stock pristine mps suspension was produced directly through emulsion polymerization without any modification on their spherical surfaces characterization of surface morphology and chemistry of mps was conducted by field emission using scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir respectively the concentrations of mps were determined by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer the details for the characterization were presented in supporting information two soils including sandy soil and clay loam soil were collected from topsoil 0 20 cm in anhui and hainan provinces china respectively the sampled soils were air dried crushed and sieved to obtain the soil particles with size ranging between 600 and 710 μm chen et al 2019 the details for soil characterization were described in supporting information 2 2 microplastics aging experiments 2 2 1 persulfate oxidation according to the method described by liu et al 2019b the 40 ml of 100 mg l 1 pristine polystyrene mps after sonication was introduced into 160 ml of 100 mm freshly prepared k2s2o8 solution pre adjusted to ph 7 0 on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature 25 2 c the equal amount of k2s2o8 was added to the suspension every 12 h as a result of the consumption of the k2s2o8 to prevent the accumulation of k2s2o8 in the solution the mps sample was separated from the suspension via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm every 2 days and washed 3 times with deionized di water followed by introduced into fresh k2s2o8 solution the mps were continuously treated according to the above procedures for different time periods the aged mps at 2 4 and 8 days were collected via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm and then dried immediately for characterization of surface morphology surface chemistry and particle size supporting information control samples were conducted in di water without oxidant under the same conditions 2 2 2 uv aging treatment to simulate the natural uv irradiation of mps uv aging experiments were carried out in an aging chamber with three 15 w uva 340 lamps 15 w each purchased from philips shanghai china at room temperature 25 2 c 20 mg l 1 pristine polystyrene mps were evenly distributed in a 500 ml beaker covered by a glass cover and regularly replenishing water loss the mps were sonicated every 12 h to avoid aggregation and evenly aged the aged mps samples were separated via vacuum filtration 0 45 μm after aging for 1 month 2 months and 3 months and collected for characterization of surface morphology surface chemistry and particle size supporting information control samples were conducted in di water in dark without uv irradiation at room temperature it should be noted that the uv intensity is not strong and uv irradiation is a slow aging process thus the uv aging lasted for 3 months which could be comparable to the 8 days completed in the ps treatment 2 2 3 uv activated persulfate treatment as mentioned above combined effects of uv irradiation and chemical oxidation on the aging of mps could commonly occur in the soil environment hence pristine polystyrene mps were introduced into the prepared k2s2o8 solution following the same procedures in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 and then put in an aging chamber with three uva 340 lamps 15 w each at room temperature 25 2 c the mp samples were taken after aging for 2 4 and 8 days the samples were rinsed several times with di water and collected after vacuum filtration 0 45 μm and dried immediately for characterization of surface morphology surface chemistry and particle size supporting information control samples were conducted in di water in dark without persulfate at room temperature 2 3 column transport experiments the prepared soils were dry packed into cylindrical plexiglas columns 1 2 cm inner diameter 8 cm length details for soil pretreatment and column packing were described in supporting information the soil column was initially injected upward with 100 ml of 5 mg l 1 nacl background solution at a flow rate of 0 50 0 05 ml min 1 followed by 200 ml of 20 mg l 1 mps solutions and then 50 ml of 5 mg l 1 nacl background solution at the end the effluent samples were collected into glass vials every 20 min nearly 3 34 pore volumes pv by automatic collector bs 100a huxi analytical instrument factory co shanghai china the concentration of mps in the effluent samples was determined to plot the breakthrough curves of mps transport at the end of transport experiment the soil was taken out for mps characterization by using sem to explore the mechanisms of mps transport in two soils a model quartz sand column experiment was conducted with the aiming at the possible major influence parameters such as ph ionic strength and fe mn two ph values were selected at 4 0 and 6 0 and the two types of cations including 5 mm na and 5 mm ca2 were selected according to the physicochemical properties of the two soils the quartz sand coated with fe was packed in the column for determining the effect of fe on the mps transport the selective column properties and varying environmental conditions were detailed in table s4 and s5 the transport of mps was fitted by two kinetic sites modeling based on the hydrus 1d software which can effectively model one dimensional water flow and solute movement in variably saturated soils simunek et al 2008 to qualitatively understand the interactions between mps and soil particles or quartz sand the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energy between mps and porous medium were calculated and analyzed gui et al 2021 the details for modeling and dlvo calculation were described in supporting information 2 4 migration of microplastics retained in soils by rainstorm there are still some mps that could be retained in soil after its transport these retained mps may be remobilized under severe environmental conditions such as rainstorm the mps retained in soil migrate downward by rainstorm and thus pose a potential risk to the groundwater environment based on the experimental data of the mps retained in the columns obtained in section 2 3 the mps migration in soil by heavy precipitation was simulated and modeled following simunek et al 2008 according to the recorded data the precipitation of anhui and hainan provinces china were 174 mm and 339 mm during a rainstorm event in july 2020 respectively administration 2020 the simulations were run with hydrus 1d by a nonlinear least square optimizer based on the levenberg marquardt algorithm based on the parameters from the transport breakthrough curves the retained mps in the soil from section 2 3 was considered as the contamination source at the beginning of this model the model can effectively simulate one dimensional water flow and solute movement in variably saturated soils specifically considering particle colloid mobility using attachment detachment with the high determination coefficient r2 0 95 simunek et al 2008 the values of dispersivity attachment and detachment parameters showed variability in model results which was attributed to the differences in mps properties soil properties experimental conditions and other environmental factors for instance sorption sites in different soils may have different retention capacities and rates depending on the value of smax to be consistent with the selected soils in our study depth of 0 30 cm for the topsoil was considered in this model 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of aged microplastics and soil properties comparison of the sem images of aged and pristine mps clearly showed that surfaces of the mps appeared to be rough with small cracks during the aging process fig 1 a c the pristine mps had regular and smooth surfaces with an average particle size of 1161 8 17 2 nm as the aging time increased the surfaces of the mps were getting rough and uneven the average particle size of uvps mps showed the most obvious decrease from 1161 8 17 2 to 823 7 16 3 nm followed by that of uv mps to 912 5 13 8 nm and then to 924 8 14 1 for ps mps figs 1d f the ps or uv treatment alone was limited for the mp aging especially uv treatment in which the particle size did not differ noticeably during the first 30 day period but appeared to have much rougher surfaces after 90 days since uv irradiation was a long time and gradual aging process the combined uv and ps uvps treatment showed the synergetic effect in which the surface was relatively rougher and the size was smaller compared to uv and ps alone notwithstanding the shape of aged mps was little changed and was still spherical with more roughness surface the significant changes in the aged mps morphology were further supported by the results of ftir the abundance of functional groups of mps after aging was enhanced including ch2 at 2998 cm 1 and 2954 cm 1 cooh and or cooc at 1730 cm 1 coh or co c at 1269 and 1237 cm 1 and co c at 1191 and 1144 cm 1 according to the ftir spectra fig 2 a notably the peak of the carbonyl band c o stretching vibration at 1730 cm 1 increased substantially as the aging increased the major reason for the increase in oxygen containing functional groups of the aged mps could be due to ch bond breaking during oxidation process ch bond reacted with oxygen to form peroxy radicals and absorbed hydrogen atoms from the surrounding environment to form functional groups i e oh and cooh wang et al 2020 the formation of oxygen containing functional groups suggested that microplastics aging was a result of oxidation liu et al 2019a notably the uvps mps had the higher content of functional groups in a shorter time than single treated mps as the aging time increased the peak intensity of oxygen containing functional groups increased fig 2b meaning that the mps got more and more aged the changes in the functional groups corresponding to the three types of aging were compared by calculating the ratio of the maximum absorbance value for the peak relative to the value of a reference peak here we selected 840 cm 1 as a reference since it changed little with aging in this study chen et al 2015 as shown in fig 2b the resulted normalized peak intensities of the main peak cooh or cooc at 1730 cm 1 showed the greater increase than that of co c at 1144 cm 1 relatively the uv irradiation or ps oxidation gradually induced the increase on the surface functional groups of mps while the combined uv and ps can quickly initiate the advanced oxidation by generating ros and hence greatly altered the surface chemistry of mps these ftir results were consistent with that of the oxygen to carbon o c ratio which was generally used to characterize the aging degree of mps liu et al 2019b zhou et al 2020 aging increased the o c ratio of mps from 0 40 to 0 46 0 51 and 0 65 with the aging of persulfate treatment uv irradiation and uv activated persulfate treatment respectively besides our results showed that the high o c ratio of mps was also correlated with great negative surface charge of mps r2 0 958 fig s1 suggesting that the aged mps with increasing surface functional groups tended to have more negative zeta potential the changes in morphology size and chemistry of aged mps could have effect on the transport two soils with different properties were used for the transport of mps table 1 and s1 one was sandy soil containing over 95 sand and the other one was clay loam with over 41 clay content the sandy soil was slightly acidic ph 6 70 and contained mainly k 46 6 g kg 1 and na 21 3 g kg 1 while clay loam soil was acidic ph 4 76 and contained significant amounts of fe 66 0 g kg 1 and al 53 5 g kg 1 additionally more negative zeta potential was observed for sandy soil 46 2 mv than clay loam 4 5 mv due to relatively lower contents of positively charged fe al oxides in sandy soil parks 1965 two soils had different physicochemical properties which would also have distinct influence on the transport of mps in soil 3 2 transport and retention of pristine and aged microplastics in two types of soils the aged mps exhibited much greater mobility than the pristine mps in both soils as indicated by the higher breakthrough curves of the aged mps than those of the pristine ones fig 3 the mobility of the mps through both soils was followed by uvps mps uv mps ps mps pristine mps for instance in the sandy soil uvps mps had the highest breakthrough percentage of 89 2 which was approximately 1 68 times of uv mps 53 2 57 times of ps mps 34 7 and 2 92 times of pristine mps 30 5 uvps mps were the most negatively charged table s2 due to the highest formation of surface o functional groups cooh compared to the pristine mps fig 2 thus increasing the electrostatic repulsion between aged mps and soil particles this was also agreed with the result of dlvo interaction energy calculations that the highest potential energy φmax between sandy soil particles and uvps uv ps and pristine mps was 734 197 40 3 and 36 7 kbt respectively fig s2b the highest φmax for uvps was responsible for its greater electrostatic repulsion and thus increasing the transport of aged mps compared to uv mps and ps mps alone the uvps mps with the combined uv and ps treatments obviously showed the strongest effect on the mps transport which was attributed to the synergetic change in surface morphology and chemistry of uvps mps fig 2 the mps could be retained in soil during its transport we found that the pristine mps showed the highest value of maximum retention in clay loam of 186 mg g 1 table s6 therefore the above results clearly showed that aging induced changes on mps surface chemistry could facilitate the transport of mps in soils further observation showed that the transport of all mps in clay loam was greatly lower than that in the sandy soil fig 3 it was probably that the clay loam soil has much higher contents of fe al oxides providing more favorable sites for negatively charged mp particles retention through electrostatic attraction cornelis et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2020 figs 4 a d clearly showed the retention of all mps in clay loam soil that the mps were covered or coated with soil mainly soil minerals or organic compounds while the mps in sandy soil were relatively clean without any coatings figs 4e h furthermore the aged mps appeared to have more interactions with soil owing to their more adsorption sites than the pristine ones consequently resulting in greater retention in soil 3 3 key factors and mechanisms controlling the transport of microplastics in two soils with different properties to explore the difference in the transport of mps in two soils the effects from key soil properties and responsible mechanisms were further investigated by using model quartz sand column with the changing corresponding soil parameters the main different soil parameters included ph value primary cations and fe minerals table 1 and s1 other environmental factors such as soil organic matter som were reported to have some influence on mps transport lyu et al 2019 song et al 2019 in this study however the som contained in the two soils was relatively low table 1 which could have little influence on the mps transport column experiments were conducted in the two pretreated soils with som removed by 30 h2o2 for over 24 h at 80 c the results verified that om hardly affected the transport of mps through saturated soil profiles fig s3 the results showed that the aged mps had higher transport than the pristine in quartz sand under both ph 4 and 6 figs 5 a and b which corresponded to the ph values in clay loam and sandy soil respectively it was again demonstrated that aging by uv irradiation and ps oxidation enhanced the transport of mps either in real soil or in quartz sand the transport of mps in quartz sand was higher at ph 6 than that at ph 4 figs 5a and b the mps and sand got more negatively charged at higher ph table s3 contributing to the stronger electrostatic repulsions between sand and mps thus facilitating the transport of mps at higher ph fig s4 at lower ph the abundant h could absorb more negative ions that the surface charge of mps would be lower thus decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between the mps and sand which reduced the mobility of the mps the higher transport of mps at ph 6 than that at ph 4 in quartz sand was consistent with the trend of higher in sandy soil with ph 6 70 than in clay loam soil with ph 4 76 it seemed that the ph could be a factor affecting the mps transport in soil however the difference in the transport of mps between the two ph values was limited fig 5a and b thus to say the least the ph was not a key factor influencing the transport of mps two types of cations of na and ca2 were selected to test the effect of ionic strength on the mps transport the contents of k and na in sandy soil was up to 10 times greater of that in clay loam while the content of ca2 and mg2 in clay loam was about 10 times greater of that in sandy soil table 1 under all the ionic strength conditions tested the aging again facilitated the mobility of the mps through quartz sand media fig 5c for instance when the background electrolyte was 5 mm nacl the effluent recovery of pristine mps was only 39 8 whereas those of the aged ones for ps mps uv mps and uvps mps reached 43 1 53 3 and 81 6 respectively fig 5c table s4 divalent ca2 exhibited greater effect on inhibiting the transport of mps than that of monovalent na at the same concentration figs 5d for instance the effluent recovery of uvps mps was 81 6 at 5 mm nacl whereas that was only 36 1 at 5 mm cacl2 this was because more effective charge neutralization effect of ca2 than that of na owing to the higher zeta potentials of mps and quartz sand in cacl2 than those in nacl table s4 chen et al 2019 kobayashi et al 2009 li et al 2020 the higher zeta potentials of mps and quartz sand in cacl2 were due to compression of the electrical double layer and hence reducing the repulsive forces between mps and sand particles dong et al 2019 rong et al 2020 wu et al 2020 as a result the highest potential energy φmax between mps and quartz sand particles in cacl2 562 35 8 kbt was considerably lower than those in nacl 718 46 2 kbt indicating that ca2 was more effective to weaken the electrostatic repulsion between mps and porous media for more retention of mps fig s5 the higher transport of mps at nacl than that at cacl2 in quartz sand was consistent with the trend of higher in sandy soil with high na than in clay loam soil with ca therefore the ionic strength could be a factor affecting the mps transport in soil in addition to ph and ionic strength iron and aluminum oxides were reported to have a leading role in the variation of mps transport in soils han et al 2014 the previous studies showed that higher contents of fe al oxide were responsible for the enhanced nanoparticles retention in porous media cornelis et al 2013 wang et al 2015 compared to the difference in al content between the two soils clay loam soil contained fe content about 8 times higher than sandy soil table 1 in order to test the effect of fe in soil the quartz sand was pretreated with fe oh 3 in which fe content represented it in the clay loam soil in comparison with the clean quartz sand the presence of fe resulted in higher retention and low transport of the mps in fe coated sand column figs 5e and f higher positively charged fe contents increased the zeta potentials of the sand from 46 2 to 23 8 33 1 mv table s4 and s5 contributing greater electrostatic attraction between mps and sand surfaces nevertheless the uvps mps still showed the synergetic effect of enhanced transport in the fe coated quartz sand compared uv mps and ps mps fig 5f and table s5 overall the three controlling factors could be the primary drivers on the four mps transport in soils confirmed by our quartz sand column experiment with high satisfaction with varying solution chemistry the transport of mps was positively correlated with soil ph whereas negatively correlated with ionic strength and contents of fe in soils fig 6 the pearson correlation test was calculated based on the mass percentage of each mps recovered from the quartz sand column effluents under varying scenarios the mps transport in clay loam was highly sensitive to the level of fe content especially for the most aged uvps mps ph was the least affective to the transport of uvps and uv aged mps in clay loam while for the transport of pristine and ps aged mps in clay loam the influence of ph is and fe content was almost the same thus our result of the correlation matrix showed that transport of the more aged mps could be more affected by the environmental factor of fe content in clay loam soil rather than ph in sandy soil the mobility of pristine and aged mps was correlated to ph and ionic strength but the corresponding influence on the transport of four mps had no difference that is in sandy soil changes in ph and is affected all the mps mobility at the same degree while fe content obviously decreased the transport of uv and uvps aged mps at a greater extent in clay loam compared with ph and is consequently surface chemistry of mps and soil fe minerals were the determining factors on the mps transport in clay loam and ph and ionic strength were considered as the key factors for the mps transport in sandy soil 3 4 modeling on the migration of microplastic retained in soil by rainstorm the results above showed that there were still some mps that were retained in soil after its transport these retained mps may migrate downward by rainstorm and thus pose a potential risk to the groundwater environment thus the modeling was conducted to understand the stability of retained mps under rainstorm according to the results of column experiment of the mps transport in soils fig 3 the retention of each mps was different that pristine mps retained the most while uvps aged mps retained the least the mps retention after column experiments was considered as the point source for mps migration in two soils under a rainstorm event based on the fitting parameters of hydrus 1d modeling table s6 the depth of the maximum concentration was marked with time to predict the average migration rate of the mps in the soil profile figs 7 a and b aged mps showed the stronger mobility in soils following the order uvps mps uv mps ps mps pristine mps the mps migration in sandy soil was greater than that in clay loam since the mps could reach the same depth within shorter time period in sandy soil which was also consistent with the column transport experiment results cumulative flux of the mps migration was also predicted in the form of proportion of the mps content of migration over their original retention figs 7c and d the relative migration flux was evaluated since the retained mps amount varied with the soil type and aging processes the results showed that a larger proportion of the aged mps were likely to mobilize and more mps would migrate in sandy soil than in clay loam indicating the risk of groundwater contamination considering the soil used in this study was sieved and relatively uniform in size the fate and transport of mps in the real soil could be more complex the water flow parameters were estimated via the function of neural network predictions based on soil bulk density and soil textural distribution which might not represent the complex condition in the real environment therefore the major weakness of this hydrus 1d model was the lack of calibration and validation in varying field conditions which requires future work 4 conclusions and environmental implications there is increasing awareness of the detrimental impacts of mps in the terrestrial environment while large effort has been exerted to understand the distribution and toxicity of these plastic particles the transformation and transport of mps in soils may provide substantial evidence for the ecological risk in a realistic scenario this study revealed that uv irradiation and persulfate oxidation caused the change in the physicochemical properties especially in the surface chemistry of mps where oxygen containing functional groups increased and surface charge reduced all these changes resulted in the enhanced transport of aged mps in the soil environment the combined uv irradiation and persulfate oxidation exhibited the synergetic effect on the surface chemistry and transport of mps soil properties such as ph and ionic strength have also influence on the transport of mps especially fe oxide played dominant role in the mps transport due to their enhanced electrostatic interactions modeling on the migration of retained mps in a rainstorm scenario showed the rapid mobility of aged mps in soil compared to the pristine mps overall the findings of this study implied that natural uv irradiation and or chemical oxidation led to the aging of mps resulting in the enhanced transport in soil which could pose contamination risk on groundwater it should be pointed out that future work is highly recommended to involve different types of mps and varying aging

16773,the global presence of microplastics in the environment is well documented nowadays studies already showed the potential risks that microplastic particles might cause to the ecosystem while potential human health effects are currently under investigation as one of the main inputs of these crucial researches the concentration of microplastics in the environment should be measured precisely confidently and monitored regularly to determine exposure levels of these pollutants some study highlights that the results are usually inconsistent and uncertain due to different sampling and sample preparation methods and the lack of quality assurance and quality control of these processes the need for a standardized methodology is an emerging issue as this would provide the right tools to establish a global monitoring system of microplastics validated sample preparation methods of water especially freshwater samples for microplastic analysis are rarely described to fulfil the gap this study aims to create and validate a special toolset and the related standard operating procedure for enhanced sample preparation a newly developed equipment the small volume glass separator was designed to easily isolate microplastics from freshwater samples and concentrate the treated sample in a small volume thus reducing the brine solution use and the sample transfer steps these features enable better prevention of contamination and making sample preparation easy fast and cost effective the small volume glass separator and the related standard operation procedure was validated on model freshwater and wastewater samples with the use of fluorescently tagged microplastics and environmentally relevant microplastics fragments fibres recoveries were measured with optical microscopy under uv light and with near infrared spectroscopy microscopy recovery tests with fluorescently tagged microspheres showed that average recovery with the small volume glass separator is 12 39 higher than that of a widespread sample preparation method this procedure was also able to recover on average 64 29 of all the environmentally relevant particles during the validation process results show that size and density have a great influence on potential particle loss recovery of smaller particles are less with both methods than that of the larger particles but small volume glass separator yielded significantly higher recovery for more dense particles the results of this study help to better understand particle loss during sample preparation and thus contribute to the establishment of standardised microplastic analysis processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics validation sample preparation recovery near infrared spectroscopy freshwater 1 introduction the overuse of plastics created an ever growing demand in its production in 2018 over 350 million tons of plastic were produced globally hale et al 2020 the accumulation of plastic debris has resulted in a global environmental problem plastics tend to disintegrate and besides the larger plastic debris microplastic mp particles particles below 5 mm are reported too law and thompson 2014 wagner et al 2014 these small particles might cause physical and toxicological harm to organisms peng et al 2020 and the knowledge on these harms and the abundance of mps is continuously expanding however most results could be deceptive and inappropriate due to a high uncertainty caused by improper methods of sampling e g low sample volume detection and quantification e g using visual analysis only of mps to obtain globally uniform results to measure and ultimately overcome such an environmental challenge standardisation is necessary prata et al 2019 some research groups are aware of these problems and started to tackle them by conducting validation studies to define the recovery efficiency of the methods the results of these validation tests provide not only information on particle loss but also on background contamination these approaches help to reduce uncertainty in the results wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 combining different analytical techniques based on molecular spectroscopy fourier transformation infra red ftir raman coupled with microscopy and thermal decomposition thermal extraction and desorption ted pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography gc and mass spectrometry ms methods might further improve the robustness of validation studies elert et al 2017 validation is essential to harmonize analytical methods that is a crucial step before standardization but only a handful of paper has been published in the last decade dealing with this issue primpke et al 2020 the main parameters of the tests described in these articles will be summarised in table 4 in the discussion section to facilitate an easy comparison with the results of the current study in the comparison of validation tests a wide range of applied parameters can be observed validation studies rely on different plastic types to model environmental conditions only three studies imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 vermeiren et al 2020 cover more than three environmentally relevant plastic types such as pp pe pvc pet ps according to schwarz et al 2019 other studies use only one or two different types of polymers in their validation process these are mainly polyethylene pe but polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet is also in the scope of some studies hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 xu et al 2020 the shape of mps is also diverse mainly commercially available microspheres cam were selected in some cases manually cut fragments mcf quinn et al 2017 vermeiren et al 2020 or ground particles gp imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 were used in these cases the irregularity of the particles represents better the physical degradation of plastics in the environment than in the case of manufactured microspheres currently there is no consensus about the standard particle sizes validation studies seem to use a large size range from tens of microns to few millimetres of mp standards for better representation to get information about the size ranges self produced mcf and gp must be sieved and thus fractionated before use there are some exceptions where only one size range was applied ziajahromi et al 2017 xu et al 2020 diversity arises in case of sample preparation methods as well regular laboratory glassware is readily available thus it is widely used however their use raises several questions about accuracy and particle loss koelmans et al 2019 one major step in mp sample preparation process is density separation in most cases brine solutions with a density over 1 2 g cm 3 are used to recover more dense polymers such as polyvinyl chloride and pet as well the correlation between density and recoveries was showed by quinn et al 2017 despite this evidence in some cases water is used for validation purposes the analysis of the recovered particles is often conducted by visual analysis which can lead to uncertain results in few cases visual analysis is combined with other analytical methods such as ftir ziajahromi et al 2017 xu et al 2020 or raman spectroscopy imhof et al 2012 in the last decade most of the validation studies investigated sediment wastewater or soil samples only one of these methods are optimized for surface waters especially for freshwater mintenig et al 2020 as the human health effects of mps have a growing concern a validated sample preparation method for freshwater is necessary to further improve data quality the goal of our research was to develop and validate a method including a specially designed glassware for freshwater sample preparation that could be a basis for a routine standardised analysis in the future we present a routine method that is cost and resource efficient easy to master and helps to prevent sample contamination by reducing transfer steps during sample preparation this does not mean the application of a completely new approach that would further expand methodological contradictions but the best practices have been compiled and applied while non cutting edge methodologies e g use of water as density separation liquid optical analysis of mps have been excluded 2 materials and methods 2 1 density separation equipment different filtration and density separation steps are often used for the preparation of water samples for mp analysis to conduct these steps usually general laboratory glassware is used only imhof et al 2012 coppock et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 lechthaler et al 2020 and vermeiren et al 2020 describe specific devices developed for mp sample preparation all of these the microplastic sediment separator the overflow column and the elutriation column were developed and optimized for density separation of sediment samples knutsen et al 2020 in this study instead of using general laboratory glassware a small volume glass separator svgs was designed and used this enables fast sample preparation in a cost efficient way with low volumes of brine solution and few sample transfer steps that helps to prevent both contaminations of the sample and particle loss the svgs consists of two parts made of borosilicate glass that are attached with a ground surface conical joint the sample is added to the bottom part through the top opening of the bottom part the volume of the bottom part in this case is 500 ml but other parts with larger volumes e g 1000 ml can be produced too parallel to the sample a glass coated magnetic stirring rod is added too afterwards the upper part is attached and the brine solution ca 500 ml used for density separation is filled in through the side inlet valve the separated sample is collected between two valves in the upper part the volume of the concentrated sample is 10 ml after the separation the sample retention valve is closed the brine solution is discarded on the side valve for recycling and the upper part containing the sample max 10 ml is detached the upper part is turned upside down and due to the conical shape the sample is transferred easily with thorough rinsing this procedure minimises particle loss while keeps the resulting sample volume low which helps the following oxidation steps to be conducted easily and efficiently the svgs is presented in fig 1 2 2 artificial water medium for recovery measurements real life samples or spiked field collected samples are not appropriate as these are not mp free and their mp content may vary both in quantity and quality to ensure standard quality and avoid unknown naturally occurring microplastics artificial solutions were used based on international guidelines two model solutions from oecd organisation for economic co operation and development guidelines were selected to simulate natural freshwater and wastewater in a standard manner following the prescribed steps oecd 201 model freshwater and oecd 303 model wastewater were prepared in our laboratory besides the original recipe three modified versions of these solutions were used for a better environmental representation in the case of oecd 201 microcrystalline cellulose mcc was added in different concentrations to simulate suspended solids a solution with 50 mg l 1 mcc was made to model hungarian freshwaters with the experienced suspended solid concentrations during previous sampling campaigns in addition a solution with 200 mg l 1 of mcc was prepared to model freshwater with the highest limit of suspended solids in hungarian freshwaters according to the relevant hungarian directive decree no 28 of 2004 xii 25 kvvm following the same principle and the relevant regulation an additional artificial wastewater solution was made oecd 303 was mixed with soybean meal dénes natura ltd hungary to reach the same 200 mg l 1 concentration this was done not only to increase the suspended solid concentration in the solution but to elevate the protein content of the artificial wastewater solution as well 2 3 reference microplastics to assess the recovery of the selected sample preparation methods the solutions described in section 2 2 were spiked with commercially available fluorescently tagged microspheres fmp obtained from cospheric llc usa four different polyethylene spheres were used the detailed properties of the fmps are highlighted in table 1 these microspheres are not suitable to represent environmentally more relevant secondary microplastics so these had to be prepared to have an insight into the recovery of non engineered particles for this polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet fragments were produced applying exactly the same cryogenic milling method as described by bordós et al 2021 where details on size fractioning density and thickness measurements such as morphological assessment with scanning electron microscopy are also presented besides these materials polyamide pa fibre with a diameter of 0 23 mm kaposplast ltd hungary was used if pa was also ground just like the other materials it would lose its fibrous property therefore the pa particles were cut manually to 1 1 5 mm long fibres with a razor table 2 presents the detailed parameters of the environmentally relevant particles that were used for the tests 2 4 sample preparation and analysis methods to compare the efficiency of different techniques recovery measurements were conducted not only with the svgs but the density separation method described by masura et al 2015 too a flow scheme of the experimental setup is presented in the supplementary information si1 for the selection of an appropriate reference method for comparison the abundance of the most common methods used in mp sample preparation has been assessed and compiled in table 3 although the method described by masura et al 2015 was developed for marine mp analysis it is well described and widely referred which makes it a good basis for comparison for the comparison of the two methods 1000 ml of each artificial water presented in section 2 2 were spiked in five independent replicates with 40 particles 10 of each type of the fmps shown in table 1 as an input for the sample preparation tests the initial volume was set to 1000 ml this is a general volume of concentrated sample when a validated water sampling is conducted with pump and filter cascades bordós et al 2021 the following steps were conducted when samples were prepared with the svgs 1000 ml of artificial water sample was filtered through a cellulose nitrate membrane filter mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary with a vacuum pump vp 100 c vacuubrand gmbh germany after the whole volume was filtered the membrane filter was put into a small 250 ml beaker with 10 15 ml of zinc chloride brine solution to prepare the brine solution 1000 grams of zinc chloride salt purissimum thomasker finechemicals inc hungary was mixed with 800 ml of mp free deionized water deionized water was filtered through on a 5 μm metal filter to reach a saturated solution with a density of 1 7 g cm 3 the small beaker was put into ultrasonic bath realsonic cleaner kln ultraschall gmbh germany where it was sonicated on nominal 37 khz for 5 minutes to remove all particles from the surface of the membrane the membrane was rinsed with mp free water then removed from the beaker the solution was poured into the svgs and a glass coated magnetic stirring rod was added the beaker was washed with mp free deionized water three times to ensure no particles left in it the water used for rinsing 10 20 ml does not influence the density of the brine solution 500 ml significantly the separation device was then filled up until the top of the ground joint through the side valve for this reason a silicon tube and a separation funnel were connected to the side valve the svgs was put onto a magnetic stirrer are hot plate f20500162 velp scientific inc italy where it was stirred for ten minutes at 1000 rpm after the stirring the upper part of the svgs was assembled and the whole separator was topped with zncl2 solution through the side inlet valve the sample was stirred for an extra twenty minutes at 1000 rpm the intensive stirring was done to ensure that the particles do not stick in the neck of the glass equipment after stirring the solution was settled for 60 minutes to perform density separation afterwards the sample retention valve was closed the residual brine solution was poured out on the side valve into an empty beaker and recycled then the two parts of the device were dismantled the upper part was turned upside down and the trapped sample was rinsed thoroughly into a small beaker the volume of the sample was tripled with 30 hydrogen peroxide 30 h2o2 medical purissimum merck kgaa germany under a fume hood the sample was heated to 70 c and stirred at 400 rpm for 60 minutes the oxidation was continued until the full discoloration of the sample after cooling to room temperature and vacuum filtered onto mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary these were analysed visually under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification with uv illumination op uv led 365 nm in case of the method described by masura et al 2015 the initial 1000 ml of the oedc artificial solutions were first spiked with the fmps 10 from each 40 in total and then filtered on a 50 μm metal mesh filter retsch gmbh germany as due to the homogeneous particle size distribution the filter cascade 5 6 0 3 mm described by the method of masura et al 2015 was not necessary the residue on the filter was rinsed with deionized water into a 250 ml beaker originally the beakers were dried for 24 hours at 90 c to determine the mass of total solids in our case this was not necessary since the solid concentrations were known already the oxidisation step was conducted with fenton reagent as described in the method the samples were oxidized with a 1 1 mixture of 20 ml 0 05 m feso4 solution plant cell culture tested 99 sigma aldrich and 30 of h2o2 medical purissimum merck kgaa germany the sample was heated on a magnetic stirrer are hot plate f20500162 velp scientific inc italy to 75 c and left unbothered for 30 minutes then 30 g of nacl was added to increase the density of the solution ρ 1 2 g cm 3 after the sample has cooled to room temperature it was poured into a glass funnel the sample was left undisturbed overnight for density separation the next day the floated particles were vacuum filtered onto an mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary instead of using a 0 3 mm metal sieve the sample was analysed visually under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification with uv illumination op uv led 365 nm in addition two experiments were performed to test the influence of the spiked mp quantity on the recovery to support the results of the validation tests for this 1000 ml of oecd 201 50 mg l 1 mcc solution was spiked first with 20 5 of each type second with 80 20 of each type fmps the samples were prepared in three replicates with the svgs as described above at the last step the samples were again filtered to cellulose nitrate filters mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary and the recovered particles were counted under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification illuminated with uv light op uv led 365 nm after these tests the svgs was evaluated for the recovery capacity of environmentally relevant microplastics as well the validation was conducted in triplicates 10 particles of each polymer type listed in table 2 were added to 1000 ml of oecd 201 50 mg l 1 mcc solution and the above described sample preparation method was conducted finally the sample was cooled at room temperature and vacuum filtered on whatmann anodisc inorganic membrane filters ø 25 mm pore 0 2 µm ge healthcare united kingdom the filters were rinsed with ethanol 96 proanal ph eur thomasker finechemicals inc hungary that was evaporated at room temperature to dry the sample the anodisc filters were then analysed with a fourier transform ft spectrophotometer microscope system perkinelmer spectrum 400 ft ir ft nir spectrophotometer coupled to a perkinelmer spotlight 400 ft ir ft nir microscope imaging system attachment perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa in the near infrared nir region with exactly the same method that was described by bordós et al 2021 2 5 quality control measures during laboratory work we introduced strict qc qa measures that follow previous research papers recommendations prata et al 2019 stock et al 2019 further to the precautions taken background measurements were conducted to better understand the origin of a potential bias in the laboratory cotton lab coat and nitrile gloves were worn it has been reported that some nitrile gloves are able to shed mp particles witzig et al 2020 as standard particles were used these particles could not hinder the results of this study a laminar flow cabinet was used for the sample preparation steps the oxidation steps were executed under fume hoods although the fume hood does not protect fully the samples from airborne particle contamination wesch et al 2017 it had to be used to protect the personnel from acid fume during the oxidation sample containers were always covered with aluminium foil or watch glass in the mp laboratory a high intensity cleaning schedule was introduced work surfaces were cleaned daily where sample preparation took place other benches were cleaned weekly with a cotton rug our laboratory s background was measured in two separate experiments both air deposition and contamination of the used deionised water were tested to assess potential air deposition of ambient mps four petri dishes ø 90 mm were placed to different locations on the workbenches for 48 hours the petri dishes were filled with 30 ml of prefiltered 5 µm mesh size stainless steel filter deionized water to collect the dust after two days of airborne settlement the dishes were collected emptied and the water was filtered through whatman anodisc filters ø 25 mm pore 0 2 µm ge healthcare united kingdom deionised water was used during the experiments was filtered through a 5 µm mesh size stainless steel filter that was built in the water system this was necessary for the sample preparation and washing of the glass equipment background pollution of this filtered water was tested too a pre cleaned 10000 ml volumetric flask was filled with this water then it was filtered through an 0 8 µm pore size cellulose nitrate membrane filter the filter was cleaned with pre filtered deionized water in a 250 ml beaker with an ultrasonic bath and samples were filtered onto an anodisc filter in both cases the samples were analysed with a fourier transform ft spectrophotometer microscope system in the near infrared nir region as described above 3 results 3 1 comparison of separation methods to compare the sample preparation methods a system of artificial waters and fluorescent microspheres with well defined parameters was established to eliminate bias as much as possible the results of the five replicatesare highlighted in fig 2 regarding average recoveries the method conducted based on masura et al 2015 yielded 45 7 70 4 of the original number of added fmps while the svgs resulted in 81 10 93 2 recovery when the effect of the applied artificial waters is considered there are no significant differences in the case of the svgs recoveries of the oecd 201 50 mg l 1 mcc are slightly higher 93 2 than that of the other solutions 81 10 83 11 in the case of the other method there is a decreased yield when oecd 303 200 mg l 1 soymeal was applied 45 7 compared to its freshwater recoveries where no significant differences are shown 61 70 4 all polymers used in this test are made of pe and all are spherical this allows a comparison of the effects of density and size on the recovery a clear correlation between density and recovery could be observed as the highest density particles 300 355 µm 1 2 g cm 3 had poor recovery average 14 12 range 4 34 in every scenario when the samples were prepared with the method of masura et al 2015 while less dense particles 300 355 µm 1 13 g cm3 had higher recovery average 65 25 range 24 88 and the low density particles 300 355 µm 0 97 g cm 3 showed the highest values average 93 6 range 86 98 in case of the svgs method all particles in the size range of 300 355 µm but with different densities showed similarly high recovery results in each medium average 93 5 95 4 range 86 100 in the case of particles with similar densities 0 97 0 98 g cm 3 but with different size 90 106 µm 300 355 µm there is a clear difference in recovery rates too bigger particles are recovered better both methods yielded an average of 93 recovery smaller particles were recovered with the svgs in average 60 12 range 48 78 which is slightly lower than the recovery of the other method average 69 11 range 50 74 all results are presented in fig 2 3 2 effects of the fluorescent mp quantity on the recovery of the svgs range test the supporting measurements on the influence of the spiked mp quantity showed high recovery rates as well in the case of the first test when a reduced number of fmps 5 5 particles were added the average recovery of all particles was 93 3 in the second test when an increased number of fmps 20 20 particles was added to the solution the average recovery results were 97 1 this means that the svgs is also able to reach high recovery when a lower or higher number of mps are used for spiking the tendency of lower recovery for smaller particles can be observed too results are shown in fig 3 3 3 validation with environmentally relevant particles using the svgs device for artificial water spiked with fragments and fibres a good recovery potential was observed as shown in fig 4 on average of all polymers 64 5 was recovered from all five materials pa ρ 1 14 g cm 3 had the highest recovery rate consistently all replicates yielded over 90 on average 97 5 the second highest recovery regarding the pvc ρ 1 28 g cm 3 particles on average 90 8 was recovered the results of the other three particle types vary the highest density polymer pet ρ 1 4 g cm 3 yielded on average 50 14 similarly to the low density pe ρ 0 95 g cm 3 where on average 53 21 of the particles were recovered interestingly the worst recovery occurred in case of pp where the density is the lowest amongst the tested materials ρ 0 9 g cm 3 pp was recovered only in an average of 30 14 results are highlighted in fig 4 3 4 background measurements four parallel samples were taken to measure airborne settlement in our laboratory only one pp and one pvc particle were found on two separate samples three parallel deionized water sample was also taken to measure background contamination one of the three filtered deionized water samples contained one pe particle this means background pollution during sample preparation is negligible 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different equipment and brine solutions the goal of this study was to create a system that can be a basis for a future standardized method compared to previous studies where mainly common glassware quinn et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 xu et al 2020 was applied the svgs has many advantages in previous studies the glassware is usually open and exposed to contamination while the svgs is designed to be a closed system as the plastic particles float to the top during density separation the aeration valve is closed thus there is no chance for contamination here in addition other studies include plenty of sample transfer steps that requires pouring from one container into another this approach on the one hand raises the potential of contamination and on the other hand it is also increasing the sample volume due to the washing steps after each pouring which is able to hinder the preparation similar to previous studies imhof et al 2012 liu et al 2019 the svgs applies a single step sample transfer method and the separated sample can be rinsed with only a few millilitres of filtered deionized water low volume is a key to keep low not only the contamination but the operation costs as well since brine solution and other high density solutions e g ammonium metatungstate hydrate ρ 1 5 g cm 1 are relatively expensive zobkov and esiukova 2017 the reduction of chemical use makes the process more sustainable and environmentally friendly this approach was applied in our method with the recycling of the used brine solution similarly to previous studies rodrigues et al 2020 the zncl2 solution ρ 1 7 g cm 3 was filtered through a 20 µm pore size metal mesh filter and reused few times before it was discarded this recycling method was suitable for our purpose since all the particles used in the validations were larger than 90 µm it is possible to filter the zncl2 solution on a finer metal mesh or cellulose nitrate filter as well however this would greatly increase the time of recycling 4 2 artificial standard solutions a novelty in our study is that standard oced 201 and 303 artificial solutions were used to model freshwater and treated wastewater samples these solutions were modified by adding mcc or soy meal to simulate suspended solid content on the contrary other validation studies usually use environmental samples imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 vermeiren et al 2020 xu et al 2020 these samples in most cases are solid media sediment soil or sludge and used as they were collected this might lead to overestimation of microplastic concentration hence these environmental samples could be already contaminated with mp particles only quinn et al 2017 have considered this issue in this study the samples used for validation were cleaned with density separation before application in addition the chemical and physical composition of these samples might be different every time so replicates cannot be conducted in a homogeneous medium only a few studies carried out validation in liquid medium löder et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 wiggin and holland 2019 xu et al 2020 either milliq deionized water millipore water landfill leachate or wastewater was used as it is highlighted in table 4 to measure recovery efficiency accurately it is crucial that the composition of the media used is consistent otherwise the results will be unreliable and distorted the artificial waters and the careful preparation ensure consistency in physical chemical composition and provide a mp contamination free background for our measurements 4 3 physical parameters of standard particles the results of the comparison tests do not always show significant differences as it is shown in the high standard deviation values but it was observable that polymer density and size have an important role in recovery results analogous to quinn et al 2017 our experiments justified that denser mp particles require denser brine solution when the best recovery performance is targeted based on our experiments we can conclude that small particles had lower recovery results in both separation methods than larger particles denser particles were recovered more effectively in the svgs method than in the method described by masura et al 2015 the overall recovery of the separation methods was 85 8 and 61 8 respectively the good traceability of the used fluorescent microspheres helped to identify potential losses it was observed in both methods that particles could stick to glass surfaces and might be hard to remove even with a thorough rinsing spiking tests with fmps might help to understand the strength and weakness of a certain sample preparation method or density separation equipment itself these particles can be a good alternative too when surrogate standard addition is considered during the preparation of real life samples using a large variety of polymers in sample preparation validation is uncommon according to the literature löder et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 xu et al 2020 as also highlighted in table 4 self made particles ground particles or manually cut fibers are rarely applied too imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 cashman et al 2020 vermeiren et al 2020 in our study the applied particles in the validation tests covered environmentally relevant mps in polymer type size and shape to better represent real life samples this approach strengthens the results of the validation and better eliminates uncertainty which is caused when only engineered microspheres are used these environmentally less relevant microspheres yielded much higher recovery results thus can cause overestimation of the recovery of more realistic particles fragments fibers despite this fact fluorescently tagged microplastic beads are a viable alternative for standard addition purposes helping to build strong qa qc measures these serve as an optimal surrogate standard as they are not present in the environment so these can be well distinguished from natural ones thus excluded from the final results furthermore fmps provide valuable information about particle losses as these are easily tracked during preparation processes the use of naturally not occurring fmps would make it also possible to test the efficiency of the svgs in the future with the use of more rich and diverse environmental matrices the recoveries of the different polymer types are not in line with their density in the case of pa size could be an affecting factor as these mps were cut by hand and were the largest amongst all materials in the case of the fragments with a similar size range no correlation could be observed too probably due to the irregular shapes the environmental relevance of the applied particles and fibres such as some limitations of their use for validation were already discussed by bordós et al 2021 4 4 analysis and data quality previously several validation tests used only visual analysis hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 vermeiren et al 2020 as reported visual analysis is readily available in most cases but the output results are the most debatable as well in our research visual analysis was only applied in case of naturally not occurring fluorescent particles when environmentally relevant particles were used for spiking ft nir spectroscopy was conducted to prove the origin of the recovered particles ft nir analysis of the final filters was conducted in a very trustful way by microscope imaging system as not only single points were measured but imaging was conducted to further improve our data quality only 80 or higher pearson correlation coefficient between the original nir spectra from polymer particles and original nir spectra from reference polymer library using the wavenumber range of 6500 and 4000 cm 1 were accepted additionally visual analysis was also conducted to prevent single count of overlapping or aggregated particles further improvement of the svgs might be necessary as smaller particles in the 100 µm size range might get lost to a larger extent than larger particles currently the standardised production of the reference materials in this size range is not solved their handling is complicated and raises a lot of issues as the particle sizes such as the total mass are very small the results obtained during their use might be disturbed easier by particle loss and background contamination the loss of smaller particles was also described in the literature wiggin and holland 2019 were able to recover 92 98 of the particles above 20 µm but nothing below and imhof et al 2012 was able to reach 95 with the mpss above 40 µm our results are based on larger particles and are slightly below these 85 8 and 64 29 average recovery in the case of fmps and environmentally relevant particles respectively conclusion microplastics have a growing concern regarding human health therefore the need for comparable standardized methods is urging to reach this target validation of methods is becoming more and more important based on our research currently available separation equipment lacks consistency and need some improvements to overcome this a small volume glass separator and the related standard operating procedure was developed specially for the preparation of freshwater samples the novel equipment was compared with the most referred sample preparation method masura et al 2015 and showed higher recovery efficiency in the case of all model solutions we used for method validation the best performing and environmentally most relevant model solution was selected and the validation was conducted with environmentally relevant particles as well we found that the svgs has great potential to recover larger and denser microplastics but in the case of smaller particles there is a potential loss detected some sample preparation methods for different environmental matrices were already published in recent years but in this study we presented the first validated freshwater preparation protocol further developments are necessary not only on the technical side but regarding the cooperation in standardisation so microplastic pollution can be monitored and tackled more effectively in the future declaration of competing interest none

16773,the global presence of microplastics in the environment is well documented nowadays studies already showed the potential risks that microplastic particles might cause to the ecosystem while potential human health effects are currently under investigation as one of the main inputs of these crucial researches the concentration of microplastics in the environment should be measured precisely confidently and monitored regularly to determine exposure levels of these pollutants some study highlights that the results are usually inconsistent and uncertain due to different sampling and sample preparation methods and the lack of quality assurance and quality control of these processes the need for a standardized methodology is an emerging issue as this would provide the right tools to establish a global monitoring system of microplastics validated sample preparation methods of water especially freshwater samples for microplastic analysis are rarely described to fulfil the gap this study aims to create and validate a special toolset and the related standard operating procedure for enhanced sample preparation a newly developed equipment the small volume glass separator was designed to easily isolate microplastics from freshwater samples and concentrate the treated sample in a small volume thus reducing the brine solution use and the sample transfer steps these features enable better prevention of contamination and making sample preparation easy fast and cost effective the small volume glass separator and the related standard operation procedure was validated on model freshwater and wastewater samples with the use of fluorescently tagged microplastics and environmentally relevant microplastics fragments fibres recoveries were measured with optical microscopy under uv light and with near infrared spectroscopy microscopy recovery tests with fluorescently tagged microspheres showed that average recovery with the small volume glass separator is 12 39 higher than that of a widespread sample preparation method this procedure was also able to recover on average 64 29 of all the environmentally relevant particles during the validation process results show that size and density have a great influence on potential particle loss recovery of smaller particles are less with both methods than that of the larger particles but small volume glass separator yielded significantly higher recovery for more dense particles the results of this study help to better understand particle loss during sample preparation and thus contribute to the establishment of standardised microplastic analysis processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics validation sample preparation recovery near infrared spectroscopy freshwater 1 introduction the overuse of plastics created an ever growing demand in its production in 2018 over 350 million tons of plastic were produced globally hale et al 2020 the accumulation of plastic debris has resulted in a global environmental problem plastics tend to disintegrate and besides the larger plastic debris microplastic mp particles particles below 5 mm are reported too law and thompson 2014 wagner et al 2014 these small particles might cause physical and toxicological harm to organisms peng et al 2020 and the knowledge on these harms and the abundance of mps is continuously expanding however most results could be deceptive and inappropriate due to a high uncertainty caused by improper methods of sampling e g low sample volume detection and quantification e g using visual analysis only of mps to obtain globally uniform results to measure and ultimately overcome such an environmental challenge standardisation is necessary prata et al 2019 some research groups are aware of these problems and started to tackle them by conducting validation studies to define the recovery efficiency of the methods the results of these validation tests provide not only information on particle loss but also on background contamination these approaches help to reduce uncertainty in the results wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 combining different analytical techniques based on molecular spectroscopy fourier transformation infra red ftir raman coupled with microscopy and thermal decomposition thermal extraction and desorption ted pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography gc and mass spectrometry ms methods might further improve the robustness of validation studies elert et al 2017 validation is essential to harmonize analytical methods that is a crucial step before standardization but only a handful of paper has been published in the last decade dealing with this issue primpke et al 2020 the main parameters of the tests described in these articles will be summarised in table 4 in the discussion section to facilitate an easy comparison with the results of the current study in the comparison of validation tests a wide range of applied parameters can be observed validation studies rely on different plastic types to model environmental conditions only three studies imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 vermeiren et al 2020 cover more than three environmentally relevant plastic types such as pp pe pvc pet ps according to schwarz et al 2019 other studies use only one or two different types of polymers in their validation process these are mainly polyethylene pe but polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet is also in the scope of some studies hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 xu et al 2020 the shape of mps is also diverse mainly commercially available microspheres cam were selected in some cases manually cut fragments mcf quinn et al 2017 vermeiren et al 2020 or ground particles gp imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 were used in these cases the irregularity of the particles represents better the physical degradation of plastics in the environment than in the case of manufactured microspheres currently there is no consensus about the standard particle sizes validation studies seem to use a large size range from tens of microns to few millimetres of mp standards for better representation to get information about the size ranges self produced mcf and gp must be sieved and thus fractionated before use there are some exceptions where only one size range was applied ziajahromi et al 2017 xu et al 2020 diversity arises in case of sample preparation methods as well regular laboratory glassware is readily available thus it is widely used however their use raises several questions about accuracy and particle loss koelmans et al 2019 one major step in mp sample preparation process is density separation in most cases brine solutions with a density over 1 2 g cm 3 are used to recover more dense polymers such as polyvinyl chloride and pet as well the correlation between density and recoveries was showed by quinn et al 2017 despite this evidence in some cases water is used for validation purposes the analysis of the recovered particles is often conducted by visual analysis which can lead to uncertain results in few cases visual analysis is combined with other analytical methods such as ftir ziajahromi et al 2017 xu et al 2020 or raman spectroscopy imhof et al 2012 in the last decade most of the validation studies investigated sediment wastewater or soil samples only one of these methods are optimized for surface waters especially for freshwater mintenig et al 2020 as the human health effects of mps have a growing concern a validated sample preparation method for freshwater is necessary to further improve data quality the goal of our research was to develop and validate a method including a specially designed glassware for freshwater sample preparation that could be a basis for a routine standardised analysis in the future we present a routine method that is cost and resource efficient easy to master and helps to prevent sample contamination by reducing transfer steps during sample preparation this does not mean the application of a completely new approach that would further expand methodological contradictions but the best practices have been compiled and applied while non cutting edge methodologies e g use of water as density separation liquid optical analysis of mps have been excluded 2 materials and methods 2 1 density separation equipment different filtration and density separation steps are often used for the preparation of water samples for mp analysis to conduct these steps usually general laboratory glassware is used only imhof et al 2012 coppock et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 lechthaler et al 2020 and vermeiren et al 2020 describe specific devices developed for mp sample preparation all of these the microplastic sediment separator the overflow column and the elutriation column were developed and optimized for density separation of sediment samples knutsen et al 2020 in this study instead of using general laboratory glassware a small volume glass separator svgs was designed and used this enables fast sample preparation in a cost efficient way with low volumes of brine solution and few sample transfer steps that helps to prevent both contaminations of the sample and particle loss the svgs consists of two parts made of borosilicate glass that are attached with a ground surface conical joint the sample is added to the bottom part through the top opening of the bottom part the volume of the bottom part in this case is 500 ml but other parts with larger volumes e g 1000 ml can be produced too parallel to the sample a glass coated magnetic stirring rod is added too afterwards the upper part is attached and the brine solution ca 500 ml used for density separation is filled in through the side inlet valve the separated sample is collected between two valves in the upper part the volume of the concentrated sample is 10 ml after the separation the sample retention valve is closed the brine solution is discarded on the side valve for recycling and the upper part containing the sample max 10 ml is detached the upper part is turned upside down and due to the conical shape the sample is transferred easily with thorough rinsing this procedure minimises particle loss while keeps the resulting sample volume low which helps the following oxidation steps to be conducted easily and efficiently the svgs is presented in fig 1 2 2 artificial water medium for recovery measurements real life samples or spiked field collected samples are not appropriate as these are not mp free and their mp content may vary both in quantity and quality to ensure standard quality and avoid unknown naturally occurring microplastics artificial solutions were used based on international guidelines two model solutions from oecd organisation for economic co operation and development guidelines were selected to simulate natural freshwater and wastewater in a standard manner following the prescribed steps oecd 201 model freshwater and oecd 303 model wastewater were prepared in our laboratory besides the original recipe three modified versions of these solutions were used for a better environmental representation in the case of oecd 201 microcrystalline cellulose mcc was added in different concentrations to simulate suspended solids a solution with 50 mg l 1 mcc was made to model hungarian freshwaters with the experienced suspended solid concentrations during previous sampling campaigns in addition a solution with 200 mg l 1 of mcc was prepared to model freshwater with the highest limit of suspended solids in hungarian freshwaters according to the relevant hungarian directive decree no 28 of 2004 xii 25 kvvm following the same principle and the relevant regulation an additional artificial wastewater solution was made oecd 303 was mixed with soybean meal dénes natura ltd hungary to reach the same 200 mg l 1 concentration this was done not only to increase the suspended solid concentration in the solution but to elevate the protein content of the artificial wastewater solution as well 2 3 reference microplastics to assess the recovery of the selected sample preparation methods the solutions described in section 2 2 were spiked with commercially available fluorescently tagged microspheres fmp obtained from cospheric llc usa four different polyethylene spheres were used the detailed properties of the fmps are highlighted in table 1 these microspheres are not suitable to represent environmentally more relevant secondary microplastics so these had to be prepared to have an insight into the recovery of non engineered particles for this polypropylene pp low density polyethylene ldpe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet fragments were produced applying exactly the same cryogenic milling method as described by bordós et al 2021 where details on size fractioning density and thickness measurements such as morphological assessment with scanning electron microscopy are also presented besides these materials polyamide pa fibre with a diameter of 0 23 mm kaposplast ltd hungary was used if pa was also ground just like the other materials it would lose its fibrous property therefore the pa particles were cut manually to 1 1 5 mm long fibres with a razor table 2 presents the detailed parameters of the environmentally relevant particles that were used for the tests 2 4 sample preparation and analysis methods to compare the efficiency of different techniques recovery measurements were conducted not only with the svgs but the density separation method described by masura et al 2015 too a flow scheme of the experimental setup is presented in the supplementary information si1 for the selection of an appropriate reference method for comparison the abundance of the most common methods used in mp sample preparation has been assessed and compiled in table 3 although the method described by masura et al 2015 was developed for marine mp analysis it is well described and widely referred which makes it a good basis for comparison for the comparison of the two methods 1000 ml of each artificial water presented in section 2 2 were spiked in five independent replicates with 40 particles 10 of each type of the fmps shown in table 1 as an input for the sample preparation tests the initial volume was set to 1000 ml this is a general volume of concentrated sample when a validated water sampling is conducted with pump and filter cascades bordós et al 2021 the following steps were conducted when samples were prepared with the svgs 1000 ml of artificial water sample was filtered through a cellulose nitrate membrane filter mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary with a vacuum pump vp 100 c vacuubrand gmbh germany after the whole volume was filtered the membrane filter was put into a small 250 ml beaker with 10 15 ml of zinc chloride brine solution to prepare the brine solution 1000 grams of zinc chloride salt purissimum thomasker finechemicals inc hungary was mixed with 800 ml of mp free deionized water deionized water was filtered through on a 5 μm metal filter to reach a saturated solution with a density of 1 7 g cm 3 the small beaker was put into ultrasonic bath realsonic cleaner kln ultraschall gmbh germany where it was sonicated on nominal 37 khz for 5 minutes to remove all particles from the surface of the membrane the membrane was rinsed with mp free water then removed from the beaker the solution was poured into the svgs and a glass coated magnetic stirring rod was added the beaker was washed with mp free deionized water three times to ensure no particles left in it the water used for rinsing 10 20 ml does not influence the density of the brine solution 500 ml significantly the separation device was then filled up until the top of the ground joint through the side valve for this reason a silicon tube and a separation funnel were connected to the side valve the svgs was put onto a magnetic stirrer are hot plate f20500162 velp scientific inc italy where it was stirred for ten minutes at 1000 rpm after the stirring the upper part of the svgs was assembled and the whole separator was topped with zncl2 solution through the side inlet valve the sample was stirred for an extra twenty minutes at 1000 rpm the intensive stirring was done to ensure that the particles do not stick in the neck of the glass equipment after stirring the solution was settled for 60 minutes to perform density separation afterwards the sample retention valve was closed the residual brine solution was poured out on the side valve into an empty beaker and recycled then the two parts of the device were dismantled the upper part was turned upside down and the trapped sample was rinsed thoroughly into a small beaker the volume of the sample was tripled with 30 hydrogen peroxide 30 h2o2 medical purissimum merck kgaa germany under a fume hood the sample was heated to 70 c and stirred at 400 rpm for 60 minutes the oxidation was continued until the full discoloration of the sample after cooling to room temperature and vacuum filtered onto mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary these were analysed visually under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification with uv illumination op uv led 365 nm in case of the method described by masura et al 2015 the initial 1000 ml of the oedc artificial solutions were first spiked with the fmps 10 from each 40 in total and then filtered on a 50 μm metal mesh filter retsch gmbh germany as due to the homogeneous particle size distribution the filter cascade 5 6 0 3 mm described by the method of masura et al 2015 was not necessary the residue on the filter was rinsed with deionized water into a 250 ml beaker originally the beakers were dried for 24 hours at 90 c to determine the mass of total solids in our case this was not necessary since the solid concentrations were known already the oxidisation step was conducted with fenton reagent as described in the method the samples were oxidized with a 1 1 mixture of 20 ml 0 05 m feso4 solution plant cell culture tested 99 sigma aldrich and 30 of h2o2 medical purissimum merck kgaa germany the sample was heated on a magnetic stirrer are hot plate f20500162 velp scientific inc italy to 75 c and left unbothered for 30 minutes then 30 g of nacl was added to increase the density of the solution ρ 1 2 g cm 3 after the sample has cooled to room temperature it was poured into a glass funnel the sample was left undisturbed overnight for density separation the next day the floated particles were vacuum filtered onto an mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary instead of using a 0 3 mm metal sieve the sample was analysed visually under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification with uv illumination op uv led 365 nm in addition two experiments were performed to test the influence of the spiked mp quantity on the recovery to support the results of the validation tests for this 1000 ml of oecd 201 50 mg l 1 mcc solution was spiked first with 20 5 of each type second with 80 20 of each type fmps the samples were prepared in three replicates with the svgs as described above at the last step the samples were again filtered to cellulose nitrate filters mce cellulose nitrate membrane filter ø 47 mm pore 8 0 µm labsystem kft hungary and the recovered particles were counted under an optical microscope dino lite edge am4115tl 10 140x magnification illuminated with uv light op uv led 365 nm after these tests the svgs was evaluated for the recovery capacity of environmentally relevant microplastics as well the validation was conducted in triplicates 10 particles of each polymer type listed in table 2 were added to 1000 ml of oecd 201 50 mg l 1 mcc solution and the above described sample preparation method was conducted finally the sample was cooled at room temperature and vacuum filtered on whatmann anodisc inorganic membrane filters ø 25 mm pore 0 2 µm ge healthcare united kingdom the filters were rinsed with ethanol 96 proanal ph eur thomasker finechemicals inc hungary that was evaporated at room temperature to dry the sample the anodisc filters were then analysed with a fourier transform ft spectrophotometer microscope system perkinelmer spectrum 400 ft ir ft nir spectrophotometer coupled to a perkinelmer spotlight 400 ft ir ft nir microscope imaging system attachment perkinelmer inc waltham ma usa in the near infrared nir region with exactly the same method that was described by bordós et al 2021 2 5 quality control measures during laboratory work we introduced strict qc qa measures that follow previous research papers recommendations prata et al 2019 stock et al 2019 further to the precautions taken background measurements were conducted to better understand the origin of a potential bias in the laboratory cotton lab coat and nitrile gloves were worn it has been reported that some nitrile gloves are able to shed mp particles witzig et al 2020 as standard particles were used these particles could not hinder the results of this study a laminar flow cabinet was used for the sample preparation steps the oxidation steps were executed under fume hoods although the fume hood does not protect fully the samples from airborne particle contamination wesch et al 2017 it had to be used to protect the personnel from acid fume during the oxidation sample containers were always covered with aluminium foil or watch glass in the mp laboratory a high intensity cleaning schedule was introduced work surfaces were cleaned daily where sample preparation took place other benches were cleaned weekly with a cotton rug our laboratory s background was measured in two separate experiments both air deposition and contamination of the used deionised water were tested to assess potential air deposition of ambient mps four petri dishes ø 90 mm were placed to different locations on the workbenches for 48 hours the petri dishes were filled with 30 ml of prefiltered 5 µm mesh size stainless steel filter deionized water to collect the dust after two days of airborne settlement the dishes were collected emptied and the water was filtered through whatman anodisc filters ø 25 mm pore 0 2 µm ge healthcare united kingdom deionised water was used during the experiments was filtered through a 5 µm mesh size stainless steel filter that was built in the water system this was necessary for the sample preparation and washing of the glass equipment background pollution of this filtered water was tested too a pre cleaned 10000 ml volumetric flask was filled with this water then it was filtered through an 0 8 µm pore size cellulose nitrate membrane filter the filter was cleaned with pre filtered deionized water in a 250 ml beaker with an ultrasonic bath and samples were filtered onto an anodisc filter in both cases the samples were analysed with a fourier transform ft spectrophotometer microscope system in the near infrared nir region as described above 3 results 3 1 comparison of separation methods to compare the sample preparation methods a system of artificial waters and fluorescent microspheres with well defined parameters was established to eliminate bias as much as possible the results of the five replicatesare highlighted in fig 2 regarding average recoveries the method conducted based on masura et al 2015 yielded 45 7 70 4 of the original number of added fmps while the svgs resulted in 81 10 93 2 recovery when the effect of the applied artificial waters is considered there are no significant differences in the case of the svgs recoveries of the oecd 201 50 mg l 1 mcc are slightly higher 93 2 than that of the other solutions 81 10 83 11 in the case of the other method there is a decreased yield when oecd 303 200 mg l 1 soymeal was applied 45 7 compared to its freshwater recoveries where no significant differences are shown 61 70 4 all polymers used in this test are made of pe and all are spherical this allows a comparison of the effects of density and size on the recovery a clear correlation between density and recovery could be observed as the highest density particles 300 355 µm 1 2 g cm 3 had poor recovery average 14 12 range 4 34 in every scenario when the samples were prepared with the method of masura et al 2015 while less dense particles 300 355 µm 1 13 g cm3 had higher recovery average 65 25 range 24 88 and the low density particles 300 355 µm 0 97 g cm 3 showed the highest values average 93 6 range 86 98 in case of the svgs method all particles in the size range of 300 355 µm but with different densities showed similarly high recovery results in each medium average 93 5 95 4 range 86 100 in the case of particles with similar densities 0 97 0 98 g cm 3 but with different size 90 106 µm 300 355 µm there is a clear difference in recovery rates too bigger particles are recovered better both methods yielded an average of 93 recovery smaller particles were recovered with the svgs in average 60 12 range 48 78 which is slightly lower than the recovery of the other method average 69 11 range 50 74 all results are presented in fig 2 3 2 effects of the fluorescent mp quantity on the recovery of the svgs range test the supporting measurements on the influence of the spiked mp quantity showed high recovery rates as well in the case of the first test when a reduced number of fmps 5 5 particles were added the average recovery of all particles was 93 3 in the second test when an increased number of fmps 20 20 particles was added to the solution the average recovery results were 97 1 this means that the svgs is also able to reach high recovery when a lower or higher number of mps are used for spiking the tendency of lower recovery for smaller particles can be observed too results are shown in fig 3 3 3 validation with environmentally relevant particles using the svgs device for artificial water spiked with fragments and fibres a good recovery potential was observed as shown in fig 4 on average of all polymers 64 5 was recovered from all five materials pa ρ 1 14 g cm 3 had the highest recovery rate consistently all replicates yielded over 90 on average 97 5 the second highest recovery regarding the pvc ρ 1 28 g cm 3 particles on average 90 8 was recovered the results of the other three particle types vary the highest density polymer pet ρ 1 4 g cm 3 yielded on average 50 14 similarly to the low density pe ρ 0 95 g cm 3 where on average 53 21 of the particles were recovered interestingly the worst recovery occurred in case of pp where the density is the lowest amongst the tested materials ρ 0 9 g cm 3 pp was recovered only in an average of 30 14 results are highlighted in fig 4 3 4 background measurements four parallel samples were taken to measure airborne settlement in our laboratory only one pp and one pvc particle were found on two separate samples three parallel deionized water sample was also taken to measure background contamination one of the three filtered deionized water samples contained one pe particle this means background pollution during sample preparation is negligible 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different equipment and brine solutions the goal of this study was to create a system that can be a basis for a future standardized method compared to previous studies where mainly common glassware quinn et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 hurley et al 2018 xu et al 2020 was applied the svgs has many advantages in previous studies the glassware is usually open and exposed to contamination while the svgs is designed to be a closed system as the plastic particles float to the top during density separation the aeration valve is closed thus there is no chance for contamination here in addition other studies include plenty of sample transfer steps that requires pouring from one container into another this approach on the one hand raises the potential of contamination and on the other hand it is also increasing the sample volume due to the washing steps after each pouring which is able to hinder the preparation similar to previous studies imhof et al 2012 liu et al 2019 the svgs applies a single step sample transfer method and the separated sample can be rinsed with only a few millilitres of filtered deionized water low volume is a key to keep low not only the contamination but the operation costs as well since brine solution and other high density solutions e g ammonium metatungstate hydrate ρ 1 5 g cm 1 are relatively expensive zobkov and esiukova 2017 the reduction of chemical use makes the process more sustainable and environmentally friendly this approach was applied in our method with the recycling of the used brine solution similarly to previous studies rodrigues et al 2020 the zncl2 solution ρ 1 7 g cm 3 was filtered through a 20 µm pore size metal mesh filter and reused few times before it was discarded this recycling method was suitable for our purpose since all the particles used in the validations were larger than 90 µm it is possible to filter the zncl2 solution on a finer metal mesh or cellulose nitrate filter as well however this would greatly increase the time of recycling 4 2 artificial standard solutions a novelty in our study is that standard oced 201 and 303 artificial solutions were used to model freshwater and treated wastewater samples these solutions were modified by adding mcc or soy meal to simulate suspended solid content on the contrary other validation studies usually use environmental samples imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 vermeiren et al 2020 xu et al 2020 these samples in most cases are solid media sediment soil or sludge and used as they were collected this might lead to overestimation of microplastic concentration hence these environmental samples could be already contaminated with mp particles only quinn et al 2017 have considered this issue in this study the samples used for validation were cleaned with density separation before application in addition the chemical and physical composition of these samples might be different every time so replicates cannot be conducted in a homogeneous medium only a few studies carried out validation in liquid medium löder et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 wiggin and holland 2019 xu et al 2020 either milliq deionized water millipore water landfill leachate or wastewater was used as it is highlighted in table 4 to measure recovery efficiency accurately it is crucial that the composition of the media used is consistent otherwise the results will be unreliable and distorted the artificial waters and the careful preparation ensure consistency in physical chemical composition and provide a mp contamination free background for our measurements 4 3 physical parameters of standard particles the results of the comparison tests do not always show significant differences as it is shown in the high standard deviation values but it was observable that polymer density and size have an important role in recovery results analogous to quinn et al 2017 our experiments justified that denser mp particles require denser brine solution when the best recovery performance is targeted based on our experiments we can conclude that small particles had lower recovery results in both separation methods than larger particles denser particles were recovered more effectively in the svgs method than in the method described by masura et al 2015 the overall recovery of the separation methods was 85 8 and 61 8 respectively the good traceability of the used fluorescent microspheres helped to identify potential losses it was observed in both methods that particles could stick to glass surfaces and might be hard to remove even with a thorough rinsing spiking tests with fmps might help to understand the strength and weakness of a certain sample preparation method or density separation equipment itself these particles can be a good alternative too when surrogate standard addition is considered during the preparation of real life samples using a large variety of polymers in sample preparation validation is uncommon according to the literature löder et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 xu et al 2020 as also highlighted in table 4 self made particles ground particles or manually cut fibers are rarely applied too imhof et al 2012 quinn et al 2017 hengstmann et al 2018 cashman et al 2020 vermeiren et al 2020 in our study the applied particles in the validation tests covered environmentally relevant mps in polymer type size and shape to better represent real life samples this approach strengthens the results of the validation and better eliminates uncertainty which is caused when only engineered microspheres are used these environmentally less relevant microspheres yielded much higher recovery results thus can cause overestimation of the recovery of more realistic particles fragments fibers despite this fact fluorescently tagged microplastic beads are a viable alternative for standard addition purposes helping to build strong qa qc measures these serve as an optimal surrogate standard as they are not present in the environment so these can be well distinguished from natural ones thus excluded from the final results furthermore fmps provide valuable information about particle losses as these are easily tracked during preparation processes the use of naturally not occurring fmps would make it also possible to test the efficiency of the svgs in the future with the use of more rich and diverse environmental matrices the recoveries of the different polymer types are not in line with their density in the case of pa size could be an affecting factor as these mps were cut by hand and were the largest amongst all materials in the case of the fragments with a similar size range no correlation could be observed too probably due to the irregular shapes the environmental relevance of the applied particles and fibres such as some limitations of their use for validation were already discussed by bordós et al 2021 4 4 analysis and data quality previously several validation tests used only visual analysis hengstmann et al 2018 hurley et al 2018 wiggin and holland 2019 vermeiren et al 2020 as reported visual analysis is readily available in most cases but the output results are the most debatable as well in our research visual analysis was only applied in case of naturally not occurring fluorescent particles when environmentally relevant particles were used for spiking ft nir spectroscopy was conducted to prove the origin of the recovered particles ft nir analysis of the final filters was conducted in a very trustful way by microscope imaging system as not only single points were measured but imaging was conducted to further improve our data quality only 80 or higher pearson correlation coefficient between the original nir spectra from polymer particles and original nir spectra from reference polymer library using the wavenumber range of 6500 and 4000 cm 1 were accepted additionally visual analysis was also conducted to prevent single count of overlapping or aggregated particles further improvement of the svgs might be necessary as smaller particles in the 100 µm size range might get lost to a larger extent than larger particles currently the standardised production of the reference materials in this size range is not solved their handling is complicated and raises a lot of issues as the particle sizes such as the total mass are very small the results obtained during their use might be disturbed easier by particle loss and background contamination the loss of smaller particles was also described in the literature wiggin and holland 2019 were able to recover 92 98 of the particles above 20 µm but nothing below and imhof et al 2012 was able to reach 95 with the mpss above 40 µm our results are based on larger particles and are slightly below these 85 8 and 64 29 average recovery in the case of fmps and environmentally relevant particles respectively conclusion microplastics have a growing concern regarding human health therefore the need for comparable standardized methods is urging to reach this target validation of methods is becoming more and more important based on our research currently available separation equipment lacks consistency and need some improvements to overcome this a small volume glass separator and the related standard operating procedure was developed specially for the preparation of freshwater samples the novel equipment was compared with the most referred sample preparation method masura et al 2015 and showed higher recovery efficiency in the case of all model solutions we used for method validation the best performing and environmentally most relevant model solution was selected and the validation was conducted with environmentally relevant particles as well we found that the svgs has great potential to recover larger and denser microplastics but in the case of smaller particles there is a potential loss detected some sample preparation methods for different environmental matrices were already published in recent years but in this study we presented the first validated freshwater preparation protocol further developments are necessary not only on the technical side but regarding the cooperation in standardisation so microplastic pollution can be monitored and tackled more effectively in the future declaration of competing interest none

16774,the effectiveness of traditional drinking water treatment plants for the removal of microplastics mps in the size range of tens of micrometers is currently uncertain this study investigated the behavior and removal efficiency of four different sized polystyrene mps 10 90 μm in diameter in a simulated cascade of coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and uv based oxidation over technically relevant time frames in the coagulation and sand filtration steps the larger the mp size the better it was removed the coagulant type and water characteristics i e ph and the presence of natural organic matter influenced the coagulation efficiency for mps x ray microcomputed tomography technique and two site kinetic modeling were used to identify the mechanisms involved in sand filtration the mps 20 μm could be completely retained in sand by straining while the attachment to the sand surface was likely responsible for the retention of mps 20 μm however approximately 16 of 10 μm mps injected passed through the sand which were further fragmented by uv oxidation uv h2o2 treatment promoted the mp fragmentation and chemical leaching more significantly than uv treatment resulting in a higher toxicity for uv h2o2 treated water our findings pave the way for deeper understanding of how mps behave and transform in a sequential drinking water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics drinking water treatment system coagulation sand filtration advanced oxidation toxicity 1 introduction microplastics mps defined as plastic particles 5 mm in any their dimensions have received considerable attention as emerging contaminants due to their potential ecological and health risks ma et al 2020 senathirajah et al 2021 the massive use of plastic products their high persistence in the environment and improper disposal lead to the accumulation of mps in a wide range of water bodies including rivers lakes and oceans eerkes medrano et al 2015 eo et al 2019 grbić et al 2020 xu et al 2020 in particular the occurrence of mps in freshwater environments has raised the concern on the drinking water quality because freshwater comprises a major portion of drinking water resources in most countries a mounting body of literature suggests that humans may be exposed to mps through inhalation ingestion and dermal contact enyoh et al 2020 wright and kelly 2017 zarus et al 2020 given that one of the possible sources of mp ingestion is drinking water we need to investigate if drinking water treatment plants can reduce the level of mps in the water when operated efficiently the mps might be treated while passing through a series of drinking water treatment processes that are typically composed of coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection at present few existing studies on mp removal in water treatment plants focus on the coagulation and filtration processes ma et al 2019a 2019b pivokonsky et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 these studies showed that a significant proportion of mps were removed by coagulation and filtration and the removal efficiency depended on the coagulant type background solution chemistry mp properties and filtration method uv based processes are widely applied in water and wastewater treatment systems for disinfection and advanced oxidation vinge et al 2021 however despite the growing number of studies demonstrating that uv light exposure leads to photochemical weathering of mps and release of additives and related degradation products song et al 2017 chen et al 2019 little is known about the removal and transformation of mps during uv based disinfection and its potential hazard to the treated water in addition to treatment method the removal of mps across drinking water treatment processes can be related to the mp size because each treatment unit is designed to treat pollutants with different sizes it is likely that mps 100 µm would be left in the effluents after the conventional treatment processes talvitie et al 2017 therefore additional studies are needed regarding the removal behavior of smaller mps in drinking water treatment plants the present study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the removal efficiency and behavior of four different sized polystyrene ps mps with mean diameters ranging from 10 to 90 μm in a sequential treatment cascade composed of coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and uv based oxidation ps was chosen as the target polymer based on its high prevalence in aquatic environments lenaker et al 2019 the specific objectives were to i assess the effects of process parameters on the removal of mps in the coagulation sedimentation ii identify the mechanisms governing the removal of mps during sand filtration using x ray computed tomography xct analysis and two site kinetic modeling and iii determine the changes in mp characteristics size concentration and morphology and the resulting toxicity of water during uv based oxidation these results are expected to offer valuable insights into how we adjust the current treatment system to improve the removal efficiency of mps 2 material and methods 2 1

the rapid mixing the ph of the final solution was maintained at 4 3 6 0 and 8 5 by prior addition of a predetermined amount of 1 m naoh and hcl the removal efficiency of ps mps was calculated using

which is summarized in table s2 2 2 3 uv based oxidation experiments a 10 μm mp suspension 4 107 particles ml in quartz glass vessels with quartz covers was exposed to uv light xenon arc lamp 300 w for 6 h the temperature was kept at 22 1 c using a water cooling circuit upon irradiation at predetermined time intervals the size distribution and number concentration of mp dispersions were monitored with tunable resistive pulse sensing trps on a qnano izon science additionally to identify potential degradation products in the leachates from uv weathered mps the leachates were separated from mps using centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters whatman followed by extraction with dichloromethane after adding fluorobenzene 1 μg ml as an

1 removal of ps mps in coagulation sedimentation the removal of ps mps over a size range of 10 90 µm during coagulation sedimentation was investigated in di water and river water two types of coagulants alcl3 and fecl3 were used there were no statistically significant differences between the mp removal percentages in di water and river water for both coagulants fig 1 it must be mentioned that dissolved organic matter dom salinity and colloidal matter in raw river waters could interfere with coagulation of mps through interaction with either coagulants or mps xu et al 2021 the impact of water constituents will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs furthermore the larger mps were easier to be removed than the smaller ones in good agreement with prior studies lapointe et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the removal efficiencies for 20 45 and 90 μm mps were 77 4 95 3 but that for 10 μm mps was relatively low 33 0 41 1 in the coagulation process the particle size can affect the collision efficiency and settling behavior jiang and logan 1991 the larger the particle the easier it is to settle therefore such a higher removal of the larger sized mps during coagulation sedimentation was likely caused by the increased attachment probability to flocs resulting in better settling although both alcl3 and fecl3 were efficient in removing ps mps alcl3 showed better coagulation performance compared to fecl3 this is ascribed to the stronger binding affinity of al3 for ps tamami and parvanak 2003 which likely promote mp coagulation via surface charge neutralization consequently alcl3 was chosen as the coagulant in this study to evaluate the effectiveness of al based coagulation sedimentation in removing mps under different operational circumstances the effects of process parameters including coagulant dose sedimentation time and raw water characteristics were examined fig 2 a shows that the removal of mps for all sizes increased with increasing al3 concentration from 0 to 10 mg l and then plateaued at the doses greater than 10 mg l due to charge reversal and restabilization of the colloid complex among the mps 20 μm mps were selected for subsequent experiments when the settling time was varied between 0 5 and 6 h at a fixed dose of alcl3 10 mg l 1 h was sufficient to ensure the highest mp removal efficiency fig 2b in addition to operational parameters coagulation is greatly influenced by raw water characteristics such as ph and water components under optimal conditions with an alcl3 dose of 10 mg l and a settling time of 1 h the maximum mp removal was achieved at slightly acidic ph ph 6 fig 2c which is related to the hydrolyzing behavior of alcl3 with the minimum solubility at ph 6 3 yan et al 2008 al salts are rapidly hydrolyzed in water to give a variety of al hydrolytic species as a function of ph at a ph higher than 6 3 the hydrolysis products of alcl3 are large polymeric species al oh 3 or al oh 4 while at a ph lower than 6 3 they are al3 or small and median polymeric species 27al nmr spectra at different ph values revealed that two resonances corresponding to monomeric and tetrahedral al species appeared at ph 4 3 while at ph 6 0 and 8 5 only the resonance of tetrahedral al species with very weak intensity was detected fig s1 the zeta potentials of mps before coagulation were negative under all examined ph conditions and after the addition of alcl3 they became 11 6 3 2 1 9 4 1 and 7 5 1 7 mv at ph 4 3 6 0 and 8 5 respectively fig s2 the final zeta potential of mps at ph 6 0 was closer to zero than those at ph 4 3 and 8 5 indicating that slightly acidic conditions maximize the aggregation of mps the observation supported that the hydrolysis product distribution of alcl3 was responsible for the mechanisms dominating the mp coagulation at different ph values mps might be removed by charge neutralization at ph 4 3 charge neutralization and sweep flocculation at ph 6 0 and sweep flocculation at ph 8 5 in order to better understand the coagulation behavior of mps observed in natural surface water the effect of typical water chemistry such as electrolytes dom and colloidal particles on the removal of mps was studied using nacl cacl2 ha and 1 μm amidine ps mps at environmentally relevant concentrations fig 2d while nacl and cacl2 had negligible influences ha exhibited an inhibitory effect on the removal efficiency of mps the decrease in mp removal in the presence of ha might be attributed to the reduction of available coagulant species due to the preferential interaction between ha and coagulant however we found that the addition of cacl2 counteracted the inhibitory effect of ha during coagulation likely because ca2 acts as a bridge between ha and mps promoting the formation of larger aggregates ramirez arenas et al 2020 the mp removal also decreased in the presence of 1 μm positively charged amidine ps the attachment of amidine ps to bare ps caused a charge reversal fig s3 which may lead to restabilization of ps mps with a resultant decline of coagulation efficiency overall the removal of mps during the coagulation settling processes was largely controlled by both internal factors coagulation dose and mp size and external factors ph and presence of dom and particulate matter 3 2 removal of ps mps in sand filtration sand filtration is the most common type of

observed while 1 2 and 16 6 of 20 and 10 μm mps broke through the sand column fig 3 a suggesting that the transport of mps in the porous media was sensitive to their sizes minagawa et al 2008 reported that the pore size distribution in sand which has a similar grain size to that used in our study was 1 300 μm with a maximum at 40 3 μm the absence of mps 45 μm in the effluent indicated the dominant contribution of straining in the retention of larger mps in sand on the other hand we speculated that the high retention over 80 of 10 μm mps that are smaller than the maximum pore size might be attributed to the additional involvement of another removal mechanism that is attachment previous studies have shown that the attachment of particles and or particle aggregates onto the grain surface could narrow the pore throats in the porous media and lead to the trapping more particles cai et al 2014 to verify this 2d cross sectional xct images of 10 μm mps retained in sand near to column inlet

of ps mps during uv based oxidation given that coagulation and sand filtration efficiently removed larger size fractions 20 μm the smallest size fraction 10 µm was chosen for uv oxidation experiments we investigated the variations in size distribution and particle concentration of 10 µm mp suspension during uv or uv h2o2 oxidation over time frames up to 6 h notable changes in the certain size ranges as well as of the total particle number concentration were observed in both uv and uv h2o2 conditions compared to that from the first time point 0 h fig 5 the total particle number concentration increased by 4 1 and 13 2 at the end of 6 h after uv and uv h2o2 treatments respectively the percentage increase of total particle number according to uv irradiation time fig s4 could be described by a first order kinetics and the fragmentation rates of ps mps under uv and uv h2o2 conditions were calculated to be 0 0063 and 0 0189 h 1 the concentration of larger sized particles 9 10 μm decreased considerably after 1 h exposure to uv h2o2 while it changed only slightly under uv only for up to 3 h however no particles were found in that size range at 6 h under both conditions we observed a gradual increase in the particle concentration for the 1 2 5 μm size range over time along with a peak shift to smaller particle diameters fig s5 indicating significant fragmentation of mps during uv based oxidation processes further evidence that uv based advanced oxidation can exert a greater impact on mp weathering was provided by sem fig s6 the pristine ps mps had spherical shape with smooth surfaces as the reaction proceeded fragmentation occurred leaving shredded debris the alterations in physical properties i e size and morphology were more pronounced in the uv h2o2 system than that in the uv system at all time points due to the stronger oxidation capacity of uv h2o2 treatment the chemicals leached from weathered mps during uv based oxidation are likely to be released into the treated water indeed the enhanced doc leaching under uv irradiation relative to the dark condition supported the hypothesis that uv light stimulated the release of ps derived organics into the water fig s7 the doc content in the uv treated sample was higher compared to that in the uv h2o2 treated sample fig s8 likely as a result of the greater degree of mineralization upon the uv h2o2 oxidation ranby and lucki 1980 untargeted gc ms analysis of the leachates collected after 6 h of treatment revealed that they contained a complex mixture of organic compounds compared to the dark

total leachate benzaldehyde and methylbenzaldehyde were found only in the uv h2o2 treated sample and acetophenone benzoic acid 1 4 diacetylbenzene and 1 2 3 dihydro 1h inden 5 yl ethanone appeared to be relatively more abundant in the uv h2o2 treated leachate than in the uv treated leachate the carbon atom in the ps chain that is bonded with a phenyl ring is susceptible to photo initiated oxidative degradation accompanied by the formation of a number of species with carbonyl or hydroxyl groups sarwan et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 we therefore hypothesize that these degradation products of ps mps may potentially be responsible for the toxicity of leachate the potential toxicity of uv and uv h2o2 treated leachates was evaluated using the toxi chromotest assay as evident by an inhibition of β galactosidase synthesis in e coli it was previously reported that β galactosidase synthesis is sensitive to organic pollutants dutton et al 1988 the dark control showed negligible enzyme inhibition the enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by the leachates with a greater inhibition of the uv h2o2 treated sample fig 6 this implies that the observed toxicity is likely associated with the leaching chemicals rather than the unaltered mps although the irradiation time in the uv based oxidation process is generally less than 1 h some micropollutants may require a longer irradiation time to be oxidized yang et al 2014 therefore in order to prevent toxic effects due to the weathering of mps during uv oxidation the uv exposure time must be specifically adjusted in accordance with the water matrix and target pollutants 4 conclusion this study investigated the removal behavior of ps mps in a simulated drinking water treatment system including coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and uv based oxidation the sequential process of coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration could completely remove mps 20 μm whereas a small portion of the mps 20 μm passed through the sand media suggesting the need for introducing processes specifically targeted at mps 20 μm in the conventional water treatment systems during the uv based oxidation process uv photolysis and uv h2o2 smaller sized fragments were generated by photochemical weathering of mps which was more evident in the uv h2o2 treated sample meanwhile uv h2o2 treatment substantially promoted the release of a mixture of low molecular weight organic compounds that might stem from radical facilitated polymer chain scission leading to an increase in bacterial toxicity in treated water ready

16774,the effectiveness of traditional drinking water treatment plants for the removal of microplastics mps in the size range of tens of micrometers is currently uncertain this study investigated the behavior and removal efficiency of four different sized polystyrene mps 10 90 μm in diameter in a simulated cascade of coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and uv based oxidation over technically relevant time frames in the coagulation and sand filtration steps the larger the mp size the better it was removed the coagulant type and water characteristics i e ph and the presence of natural organic matter influenced the coagulation efficiency for mps x ray microcomputed tomography technique and two site kinetic modeling were used to identify the mechanisms involved in sand filtration the mps 20 μm could be completely retained in sand by straining while the attachment to the sand surface was likely responsible for the retention of mps 20 μm however approximately 16 of 10 μm mps injected passed through the sand which were further fragmented by uv oxidation uv h2o2 treatment promoted the mp fragmentation and chemical leaching more significantly than uv treatment resulting in a higher toxicity for uv h2o2 treated water our findings pave the way for deeper understanding of how mps behave and transform in a sequential drinking water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics drinking water treatment system coagulation sand filtration advanced oxidation toxicity 1 introduction microplastics mps defined as plastic particles 5 mm in any their dimensions have received considerable attention as emerging contaminants due to their potential ecological and health risks ma et al 2020 senathirajah et al 2021 the massive use of plastic products their high persistence in the environment and improper disposal lead to the accumulation of mps in a wide range of water bodies including rivers lakes and oceans eerkes medrano et al 2015 eo et al 2019 grbić et al 2020 xu et al 2020 in particular the occurrence of mps in freshwater environments has raised the concern on the drinking water quality because freshwater comprises a major portion of drinking water resources in most countries a mounting body of literature suggests that humans may be exposed to mps through inhalation ingestion and dermal contact enyoh et al 2020 wright and kelly 2017 zarus et al 2020 given that one of the possible sources of mp ingestion is drinking water we need to investigate if drinking water treatment plants can reduce the level of mps in the water when operated efficiently the mps might be treated while passing through a series of drinking water treatment processes that are typically composed of coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection at present few existing studies on mp removal in water treatment plants focus on the coagulation and filtration processes ma et al 2019a 2019b pivokonsky et al 2018 zhou et al 2021 these studies showed that a significant proportion of mps were removed by coagulation and filtration and the removal efficiency depended on the coagulant type background solution chemistry mp properties and filtration method uv based processes are widely applied in water and wastewater treatment systems for disinfection and advanced oxidation vinge et al 2021 however despite the growing number of studies demonstrating that uv light exposure leads to photochemical weathering of mps and release of additives and related degradation products song et al 2017 chen et al 2019 little is known about the removal and transformation of mps during uv based disinfection and its potential hazard to the treated water in addition to treatment method the removal of mps across drinking water treatment processes can be related to the mp size because each treatment unit is designed to treat pollutants with different sizes it is likely that mps 100 µm would be left in the effluents after the conventional treatment processes talvitie et al 2017 therefore additional studies are needed regarding the removal behavior of smaller mps in drinking water treatment plants the present study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the removal efficiency and behavior of four different sized polystyrene ps mps with mean diameters ranging from 10 to 90 μm in a sequential treatment cascade composed of coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and uv based oxidation ps was chosen as the target polymer based on its high prevalence in aquatic environments lenaker et al 2019 the specific objectives were to i assess the effects of process parameters on the removal of mps in the coagulation sedimentation ii identify the mechanisms governing the removal of mps during sand filtration using x ray computed tomography xct analysis and two site kinetic modeling and iii determine the changes in mp characteristics size concentration and morphology and the resulting toxicity of water during uv based oxidation these results are expected to offer valuable insights into how we adjust the current treatment system to improve the removal efficiency of mps 2 material and methods 2 1

han river in yangpyeong korea and assayed for water chemistry as summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental design to simulate the drinking water treatment plant we used the most commonly employed processes for this study coagulation sedimentation sand filtration and uv based oxidation in sequence 2 2 1 coagulation sedimentation experiments coagulation sedimentation experiments were performed using di water and raw surface water in a 1 l beaker with a stirrer a mixing speed was maintained at 160 rpm for 2 min and then decreased to 60 rpm for 30 min followed by 1 h of settling the mp concentration was 54 µg ml with 9 1 104 5 8 103 1 0 103 and 1 2 102 particles ml for 10 20 45 and 90 μm mps respectively the selected amounts of coagulant were added to the samples at the beginning of the rapid mixing the ph of the final solution was maintained at 4 3 6 0 and 8 5 by prior addition of a predetermined amount of 1 m naoh and hcl the removal efficiency of ps mps was calculated using

the cylindrical acrylic columns 30 cm long and 3 cm inner diameter were wet packed with cleaned quartz sand effective grain size in the range 0 3 0 45 mm and a uniformity coefficient 2 prior to packing the cleaned sand was dried in an oven at 60 c for 24 h the columns were packed by applying mild vibration onto the column wall a mesh screen with a pore size of 250 µm was placed at each end of the column the porosity of packed column was approximately 0 45 after packing the columns were pre equilibrated with at least 10 pore volumes pvs using di water then 3 pvs of mp suspensions 1 0 103 particles l were injected from the bottom of the column using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 300 ml h followed by elution with 5 pvs of di water for the quantification of mps the column

governing equations with constitutional relationships of the two site model are provided in the supporting information the transport and reaction parameters were adopted from the previous studies which is summarized in table s2 2 2 3 uv based oxidation experiments a 10 μm mp suspension 4 107 particles ml in quartz glass vessels with quartz covers was exposed to uv light xenon arc lamp 300 w for 6 h the temperature was kept at 22 1 c using a water cooling circuit upon irradiation at predetermined time intervals the size distribution and number concentration of mp dispersions were monitored with tunable resistive pulse sensing trps on a qnano izon science additionally to identify potential degradation products in the leachates from uv weathered mps the leachates were separated from mps using centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters whatman followed by extraction with dichloromethane after adding fluorobenzene 1 μg ml as an internal standard is the extract was concentrated to 250 μl under a stream of nitrogen and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890 with 5795 msd masshunter workstation software agilent was used for data analysis and compounds were identified after comparing with their retention index and mass spectra in the nist database 2 3 analyses the zeta

total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu the toxicity of leachates obtained from uv based oxidation experiments was assessed by the toxi chromotest ebpi canada according to manufacturer s instructions kokkali and van delft 2014 prior to toxicity testing sodium thiosulfate 10 mg l was added to remove residual h2o2 fang et al 2019 this is a colorimetric method based on the ability of various

in triplicate and data were presented as the mean standard deviation s d a two tailed student s t test excel was used to determine if the differences were significant p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of ps mps in coagulation sedimentation the removal of ps mps over a size range of 10 90 µm during coagulation sedimentation was investigated in di water and river water two types of coagulants alcl3 and fecl3 were used there were no statistically significant differences between the mp removal percentages in di water and river water for both coagulants fig 1 it must be mentioned that dissolved organic matter dom salinity and colloidal matter in raw river waters could interfere with coagulation of mps through interaction with either coagulants or mps xu et al 2021 the impact of water constituents will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs furthermore the larger mps were easier to be removed than the smaller ones in good agreement with prior studies lapointe et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the removal efficiencies for 20 45 and 90 μm mps were 77 4 95 3 but that for 10 μm mps was relatively low 33 0 41 1 in the coagulation process the particle size can affect the collision efficiency and settling behavior jiang and logan 1991 the larger the particle the easier it is to settle therefore such a higher removal of the larger sized mps during coagulation sedimentation was likely caused by the increased attachment probability to flocs resulting in better settling although both alcl3 and fecl3 were efficient in removing ps mps alcl3 showed better coagulation performance compared to fecl3 this is ascribed to the stronger binding affinity of al3 for ps tamami and parvanak 2003 which likely promote mp coagulation via surface charge neutralization consequently alcl3 was chosen as the coagulant in this study to evaluate the effectiveness of al based coagulation sedimentation in removing mps under different operational circumstances the effects of process parameters including coagulant dose sedimentation time and raw water characteristics were examined fig 2 a shows that the removal of mps for all sizes increased with increasing al3 concentration from 0 to 10 mg l and then plateaued at the doses greater than 10 mg l due to charge reversal and restabilization of the colloid complex among the mps 20 μm mps were selected for subsequent experiments when the settling time was varied between 0 5 and 6 h at a fixed dose of alcl3 10 mg l 1 h was sufficient to ensure the highest mp removal efficiency fig 2b in addition to operational parameters coagulation is greatly influenced by raw water characteristics such as ph and water components under optimal conditions with an alcl3 dose of 10 mg l and a settling time of 1 h the maximum mp removal was achieved at slightly acidic ph ph 6 fig 2c which is related to the hydrolyzing behavior of alcl3 with the minimum solubility at ph 6 3 yan et al 2008 al salts are rapidly hydrolyzed in water to give a variety of al hydrolytic species as a function of ph at a ph higher than 6 3 the hydrolysis products of alcl3 are large polymeric species al oh 3 or al oh 4 while at a ph lower than 6 3 they are al3 or small and median polymeric species 27al nmr spectra at different ph values revealed that two resonances corresponding to monomeric and tetrahedral al species appeared at ph 4 3 while at ph 6 0 and 8 5 only the resonance of tetrahedral al species with very weak intensity was detected fig s1 the zeta potentials of mps before coagulation were negative under all examined ph conditions and after the addition of alcl3 they became 11 6 3 2 1 9 4 1 and 7 5 1 7 mv at ph 4 3 6 0 and 8 5 respectively fig s2 the final zeta potential of mps at ph 6 0 was closer to zero than those at ph 4 3 and 8 5 indicating that slightly acidic conditions maximize the aggregation of mps the observation supported that the hydrolysis product distribution of alcl3 was responsible for the mechanisms dominating the mp coagulation at different ph values mps might be removed by charge neutralization at ph 4 3 charge neutralization and sweep flocculation at ph 6 0 and sweep flocculation at ph 8 5 in order to better understand the coagulation behavior of mps observed in natural surface water the effect of typical water chemistry such as electrolytes dom and colloidal particles on the removal of mps was studied using nacl cacl2 ha and 1 μm amidine ps mps at environmentally relevant concentrations fig 2d while nacl and cacl2 had negligible influences ha exhibited an inhibitory effect on the removal efficiency of mps the decrease in mp removal in the presence of ha might be attributed to the reduction of available coagulant species due to the preferential interaction between

of larger aggregates ramirez arenas et al 2020 the mp removal also decreased in the presence of 1 μm positively charged amidine ps the attachment of amidine ps to bare ps caused a charge reversal fig

the release of a mixture of low molecular weight organic compounds that might stem from radical facilitated polymer chain scission leading to an increase in bacterial toxicity in treated water ready for supply these results highlight that the impact of particle size and operation conditions on the behavior and toxicity of mps in water treatment system deserves future research declaration of
