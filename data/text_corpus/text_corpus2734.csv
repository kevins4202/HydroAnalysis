13670,the spray evaporation is a promising zero discharge technology for desulphurization wastewater treatment in this work a pilot scale platform for the spray evaporation of desulfurization wastewater was built the desulphurization wastewater was atomized by a rotary atomizer and evaporate in the evaporation tower and the wastewater atomization and evaporation characteristics were investigated systematically the results showed that the increase of atomizer rotating speed can improve the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater while the increase of its flow rate and total amount of dissolved solids tds was not conducive to that for the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater the increase of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio the ratio of flue gas volume to desulfurization wastewater volume nm3 m 3 and atomizer rotating speed can promote its rapid evaporation while the increase of wastewater tds reduced the evaporation rate of wastewater droplets on this basis a bypass evaporation tower system was designed and constructed in a 330 mw coal fired power plant to treat the desulphurization wastewater from limestone gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization wfgd system and the influence of wastewater evaporation on the flue gas and particle characteristics was investigated under different boiler loads the results show that this evaporation system can ensure the evaporation effect of desulphurization wastewater under different boiler loads lead to the reduction of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity reduce the concentration of so2 and particles in flue gas and enlarge the particle size at the outlet of evaporation tower this work can provide a reference for the desulphurization wastewater treatment in coal fired power plants keywords desulfurization wastewater rotary atomization evaporation zero liquid discharge coal fired power plant 1 introduction coal is an important part of the world s energy mix especially in china where 60 2 of the total installed capacity are coal fired power plants 1 2 during coal combustion the sulfides contained in it produce sulfur oxides mainly sulfur dioxide which would cause serious air pollution if not treated properly 3 therefore the emission of sulfur dioxide from coal fired power plants is a serious problem that must be considered and solved at present most of the coal fired power plants are equipped with the flue gas desulfurization fgd facilities among which the limestone gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization is the most widely used due to its high removal efficiency and maturity 4 6 as of 2014 more than 90 of the coal fired power plants were equipped with wfgd in china and in the united states 69 of the 108 coal fired power plants will adopt wfgd by 2025 7 8 however to ensure the normal operation of wfgd system a certain amount of desulfurization wastewater needs to be discharged regularly to control the concentration of chloride ion in desulfurization slurry and prevent corrosion of related equipment and materials 9 10 desulfurization wastewater contains a lot of acidic ions heavy metal ions and suspended solids in which the acidic ions such as cl and so4 2 are corrosive to metal materials and the heavy metal elements such as hg cr and ni have great harm to human health so it must be treated before discharge 11 13 with the strengthening of pollutant emission control and the gradual improvement of environmental standards around the world the treatment of desulfurization wastewater has attracted extensive attention in recent years 14 the current desulfurization wastewater treatment technologies mainly include the chemical precipitation 15 18 membrane separation 19 evaporative crystallization 20 electrodialysis technology 21 and biological treatment technology 22 the most commonly used technology in coal fired power plants is chemical precipitation which treats the desulfurization wastewater mainly through neutralization precipitation flocculation and clarification in this process many kinds of chemical reagents are applied to precipitate and remove the ions in the desulfurization wastewater which needs high investment and operation costs besides although the chemical precipitation can remove heavy metal ions in wastewater to the standard level there is no chemical agent that can effectively remove cl therefore the content of cl in the treated wastewater is still very high and it will still cause harm to the environment if directly discharged 23 in order to treat the desulfurization wastewater more economically and effectively the spray evaporation technology was proposed the spray evaporation technology is to use the residual heat of flue gas at the end of the boiler to make the atomized desulfurization wastewater evaporate and then the evaporation products enter the dust removal equipment together with the flue gas to be removed so as to realize zero liquid discharge zld of desulfurization wastewater 24 25 it mainly includes two implementation modes one is to spray the desulfurization wastewater into the main or bypass flue duct after the air preheater to realize the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater flue evaporation technology 26 28 and the other is to set up an bypass evaporation tower in which the atomized desulfurization wastewater is evaporated by introducing partial flue gas before the air preheater evaporation tower technology 29 31 for the flue evaporation technology the desulfurization wastewater is directly sprayed into the flue before the dust removal equipment for evaporation due to the low temperature of flue gas at this location the wastewater may not evaporate completely as the boiler load changes which will lead to adhesion and accumulation of fly ash on the flue and cause corrosion to it at the same time the two fluid spray nozzle is generally used in this technology and it uses compressed air to atomize the desulfurization wastewater due to the large amount of suspended solids in the wastewater this kind of nozzle is easy to be blocked and the atomization effect will be affected thus affecting the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater what s more the promotion of low temperature economizer shortens the available flue length for evaporation which also limits the evaporation capacity of desulfurization wastewater 32 in comparison the flue gas used in the evaporation tower technology is introduced before the air preheater and has higher temperature so the heat and mass transfer between the wastewater droplets and flue gas is enhanced besides the flue gas velocity in the evaporation tower is lower than that in the flue duct which can prolong the residence time of atomized droplets in the evaporation tower and improve the evaporation effect so as to ensure the complete evaporation of desulfurization wastewater therefore the evaporation tower has more advantages in the treatment of desulphurization wastewater and attracted much attention in recent years ma et al 29 investigated the evaporation performance of desulfurization wastewater in bypass evaporation tower and the characteristics of evaporation products by experiment and the influence on the original pollutant removal equipment was also discussed zhang et al 30 studied the evaporation and crystallization process of desulfurization wastewater in the evaporation tower by simulation and the influence of droplet diameter as well as the mass flow temperature and humidity of flue gas on evaporation was analyzed zheng et al 31 studied the variation of ph and total dissolved solids with the concentration of desulfurization wastewater in the circulating evaporation tower however the researches on the evaporation tower technology for desulphurization wastewater treatment are not comprehensive at present lacking systematic studies on the atomization and evaporation characteristics of actual desulfurization wastewater especially the engineering application research in actual coal fired power plants which limits its further promotion and application in this work a pilot scale platform was built to research the atomization and evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater in the process of evaporation tower technology the desulfurization wastewater was atomized by a rotary atomizer the effects of atomizer rotating speed wastewater flow rate and tds on the size distribution and average diameter of desulfurization wastewater droplets were investigated to research the atomization characteristics the atomized droplets evaporated in the evaporation tower the effects of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio atomizer rotating speed and wastewater tds on the temperature distribution in it and the moisture content of ash at the tower bottom and outlet were investigated to research the evaporation characteristics on this basis a similar bypass evaporation tower system was designed and constructed in a 330 mw coal fired power plant to treat the desulfurization wastewater produced by wfgd system the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on the flue gas and particle characteristics was explored under different boiler loads 2 experiment sections 2 1 experimental set up the schematics of atomization test system and spray evaporation system of desulfurization wastewater are shown in fig 1 in this experiment the rotary atomization was applied to atomize desulphurization wastewater and the test system for atomization characteristics mainly consisted of the rotary atomization system and particle dynamic analyzer system pda dantec dynamics co denmark fig 1 a the rotary atomization system included the rotary atomizer desulfurization wastewater tank and metering pump the rotary atomizer was composed of a variable frequency motor and an atomizing disc the atomizing disc was made of wear resistant stainless steel with 12 orifice channels distributed along the circumference in the atomization process the desulfurization wastewater was firstly sent to the atomizer by the metering pump then the motor driven the atomizing disc to rotate at a high speed and the desulfurization wastewater was thrown out from the channels thus atomizing into droplets the wastewater flow rate was controlled by the metering pump and the atomizer rotating speed was controlled by adjusting the frequency of motor the pda system mainly included the laser beam splitter laser transmitter laser receiver photoelectric converter bsa processor and computer which can measure the size distribution and average diameter of atomized droplets through the refraction and reflection of laser the desulfurization wastewater used in the experiment was taken from a coal fired power plant before the experiment it was filtered to remove part of the suspended solids and the compositions of it are shown in table 1 the wastewater spray evaporation system mainly included the gas heater buffer vessel evaporation tower system electrostatic precipitator esp and induced draft fan fig 1 b the air was heated by the gas heater and then entered the buffer vessel in which the fly ash and water vapor were provided by the solid aerosol generator and steam generator to form simulated flue gas the fly ash was taken from a coal fired power plant and the concentration of fly ash and humidity of flue gas were controlled at about 10 g m 3 and 6 respectively after that the simulated flue gas entered into the evaporation tower system which was composed of the rotary atomizer evaporation tower desulfurization wastewater tank and metering pump the desulfurization wastewater was atomized into droplets by the rotary atomizer and sprayed into the evaporation tower and then evaporated in the hot flue gas a total of 6 measuring points were set on the evaporation tower to test the temperature distribution in it the first thermocouple was located 1000 mm below the atomizing disc and the remaining 5 thermocouples were set at an interval of 800 mm during the experiment the inlet flue gas temperature was controlled by the gas heater and the flue gas volume was controlled by the induced draft fan in addition an aspirated isokinetic sampler wj 60b laoying ltd china was applied to collect the ash samples at the inlet and outlet of the evaporation tower the humidity and temperature of flue gas were measured by the humidity and temperature transmitter hmt337 vaisala co ltd finland the composition of flue gas was measured by a flue gas analyzer j2kn ecom co ltd germany the moisture content of ash samples was tested according to the national standard of gb t 211 2017 the morphology and components of which were detected by the field emission scanning electron microscopy ultra plus zeiss ltd germany and x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro panalytical b v netherlands respectively 2 2 structure and flow field distribution of the evaporation tower the structure of evaporation tower is shown in fig 2 a which was 1 6 m in diameter and 6 0 m in height including the gas distributor and tower body the gas distributor mainly consisted of the gas inlet volute inner flow channel outer flow channel and several deflectors and the atomizing disc was located right below the gas distributor the flue gas entered into the volute from the inlet to generate rotary flow and then entered into the inner and outer flow channels where the deflector numbers were both 16 these deflectors were arranged to guide the gas flow so that the flue gas can move downward while rotating in the tower the middle of the tower body was cylindrical and the bottom was conical the flow field distribution in the evaporation tower was represented by the flue gas streamline in it which was simulated using the computational fluid dynamics cfd software fluent as illustrated in fig 2 b in the process of calculation the rng k ε model was applied to calculate the turbulent flow the temperature volume and dynamic viscosity of flue gas at the inlet were set as 340 c 600 nm3 h 1 and 3 09 10 5 kg m 1 s 1 respectively the result shows that the flue gas rotated downward in the tower after passing through the gas distributor the flue gas velocity was fast at the outlet of gas distributor and then decreased rapidly in the tower it can be inferred that when the droplets were sprayed from the atomizing disc as they were close to the outlet of gas distributor a large amount of flue gas with high temperature and speed would directly contact with the droplets which can make them evaporate rapidly after that some unevaporated droplets rotated downward in the tower with the flue gas due to the rotating movement and low velocity the trajectory and residence time of them were prolonged which was conducive to the complete evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets 3 results and discussion 3 1 atomization characteristics of desulfurization wastewater 3 1 1 effect of the atomizer rotating speed the atomization of liquid is the result of energy acting on the interior and surface of it and the common energy forms include the centrifugal force pressure kinetic energy etc the rotary atomization is to make the liquid flow into a high speed rotating atomizing disc and to throw the liquid out under the effect of centrifugal force for atomization during the process the atomizer rotating speed the flow rate and properties of liquid all affect the final atomization effect as illustrated in fig 3 the effect of atomizer rotating speed on the atomization characteristics of desulfurization wastewater was investigated by measuring the size distribution and average diameter of atomized droplets during the experiment the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was set at 50 l h 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the result showed that the droplet size distribution was unimodal in the speed range of 10800 18000 r min 1 and all the droplet sizes were less than 50 μm when the rotating speed was 10 800 r min 1 the peak value of droplet size distribution was at 6 5 μm where the droplet number proportion was 8 7 and it decreased rapidly with the increase of droplet size as the atomizer rotating speed increased gradually the peak value of droplet size distribution was still at 6 5 μm but the proportion of droplet number increased to 8 9 9 2 9 3 and 9 7 when the rotating speed was 12600 14400 16 200 and 18 000 r min 1 respectively in addition the droplet number proportion in the range of 0 6 5 μm gradually increased while that in the range of 6 5 50 μm decreased which indicated that the atomization performance of desulfurization wastewater was improved with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the average diameter of atomized droplets can also support this conclusion and it was expressed by the sauter mean diameter d32 which is widely used to characterize the atomization effect of liquid 33 34 it can be seen from the results that with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the d32 of atomized droplets decreased from 22 84 to 17 63 μm indicating that the atomization effect was improved in the process of rotary atomization the desulfurization wastewater was thrown out by the high speed rotating atomizing disc into the hot flue gas for evaporation the desulfurization wastewater formed a liquid film on the atomizing disc and then was thrown out from the orifice channels to split into many small droplets in the flue gas which increased the surface area of liquid and was conducive to the rapid evaporation of it the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater was determined by the combined action of centrifugal force shear force inside the liquid friction force between the liquid and flue gas viscous force and surface tension of liquid itself the shear force inside the liquid and the friction force between the liquid and flue gas can promote the deformation and splitting of liquid thus atomizing it into droplets while the viscous force and surface tension of liquid itself inhibited that process with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the centrifugal force on the liquid increased the thickness of the liquid film decreased and the velocity of liquid leaving the atomizing disc increased which enhanced the shear force inside the liquid and the friction force between the liquid and flue gas thus promoting the deformation and splitting of liquid and improving the atomization effect 3 1 2 effect of the wastewater flow rate the effect of wastewater flow rate on the atomization characteristics is shown in fig 4 and the rated flow rate of the atomizer is 50 l h 1 during the experiment the atomizer rotating speed was set at 16 200 r min 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the result showed that with the increase of wastewater flow rate from 40 to 120 l h 1 the size distribution and d32 of atomized droplets changed significantly with the increase of wastewater flow rate the peak size of droplets increased from 7 5 8 5 9 5 16 5 and 18 5 μm respectively besides the d32 of atomized droplets also increased from 17 83 to 33 50 μm which almost doubled it showed that the atomization effect was significantly affected by the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater and the atomization effect became worse with the increase of flow rate when the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater increased the amount of liquid flowing into the atomizing disc increased at the same time leading to the increase of the liquid film thickness in it which was not conducive to the deformation and splitting of liquid and made the size of atomized droplets larger in addition due to the small diameter of the atomizing disc 20 cm in this experiment the increase of wastewater flow rate would significantly increase the liquid volume stored in the atomizing disc and the thickness of liquid film also increased significantly so the influence on the atomization effect was very significant on the other hand although the droplet sizes became large with the increase of wastewater flow rate all of them were still less than 50 μm which indicated that the rotary atomization has good adaptability for different wastewater flow rates and can ensure the atomization effect in a certain range 3 1 3 effect of the wastewater tds the wastewater quality also had an effect on its atomization in this experiment the effect of wastewater tds on the atomization characteristics was investigated to explore the influence of wastewater quality on the atomization shown in fig 5 the tds refers to the total amount of dissolved solids in liquid which can represent the total amount of impurity ions in the desulfurization wastewater the higher the tds value the higher the ion content in the wastewater and the worse the wastewater quality during the experiment the atomizer rotating speed was set at 16 200 r min 1 the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was set at 50 l h 1 and the tds was adjusted by diluting or concentrating the desulfurization wastewater taken from the power plant the result showed that the wastewater tds had little effect on the atomization effect and there was no significant change on the size distribution and d32 of atomized droplets with the tds increase from 6000 to 60 000 mg l 1 the droplet size distribution was still unimodal only the peak size of atomized droplets changed from 5 5 7 5 μm and the d32 changed from 17 14 20 08 μm that meant the increase of wastewater tds made the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater get worse but the influence was very slight the increase of tds increased the viscosity and surface tension of desulfurization wastewater and theoretically inhibited the deformation and splitting of liquid thus affecting its atomization effect however it can be inferred from the experimental results that the centrifugal force the shear force inside the liquid and the friction force between the liquid and flue gas played the decisive roles in the rotary atomization process while the properties of liquid itself only had slight influence it meant that the rotary atomization has good adaptability for desulfurization wastewater with different ion concentrations considering the great difference of desulfurization wastewater quality in different coal fired power plants it is very conducive to the application and promotion of this technology 3 2 evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater 3 2 1 effect of the flue gas temperature after being atomized into droplets the desulfurization wastewater was sprayed into the evaporation tower where heat and mass transfer occurred between the droplets and hot flue gas the water in the droplets evaporated and the solute was precipitated out to form solid particles in flue gas some larger fly ash particles and evaporation products would deposit at the tower bottom and the others entered the esp with flue gas to be removed so that the desulfurization wastewater can be effectively treated to realize zero liquid discharge during the process the flue gas temperature and gas liquid ratio would affect the heat and mass transfer between droplets and flue gas thus affecting the evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater besides the purpose of atomizing desulfurization wastewater was to increase its surface area so as to increase the area for heat and mass transfer with flue gas and improve the evaporation effect which means the atomization characteristics of desulfurization wastewater can also affect its evaporation therefore the effects of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio atomizer rotating speed and tds of desulfurization wastewater on its evaporation characteristics were investigated by experiments the effect of flue gas temperature on the evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater is shown in fig 6 in this experiment the gas liquid ratio was set at 12 000 nm3 m 3 the volume of flue gas was 600 nm3 h the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was 50 l h 1 the atomizer rotating speed was 16 200 r min 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater can cause temperature drop in the tower and the moisture content of evaporation products also varied with the evaporation effect so the wastewater evaporation effect was characterized by the temperature distribution in the tower and the moisture content of ash at the tower bottom and outlet the results showed that under different flue gas temperatures at inlet the temperature drops caused by droplets evaporation were all obvious in the upper part of the tower and very slight in the lower part the evaporation process of desulfurization wastewater droplets is generally divided into two stages the first stage is similar to the evaporation of pure water due to the high moisture content of droplets and the second stage is similar to the drying process of wet particulate matters due to the low moisture content of them 35 when the desulfurization wastewater was atomized and sprayed into the upper part of the tower the temperature of flue gas coming from the gas distributor was high the temperature difference between droplets and flue gas was large so that the droplets can absorb heat rapidly and evaporate most of the water in a short time therefore the flue gas temperature dropped sharply within a short distance under the atomizing disc and this area is referred to as the main evaporation area after that a small amount of unevaporated droplets and wet solid particles precipitated from the droplets continued to flow to the lower part of the tower and conducted heat and mass transfer with the flue gas due to the decrease of flue gas temperature the temperature difference between the flue gas and droplets also decreased resulting in the weakening of heat transfer intensity at the same time due to the internal mass transfer resistance the evaporation rate of water in solid particles was far lower than that in original droplets so the flue gas temperature in the lower part of evaporation tower decreased very little however the temperatures at each measuring point in the tower and the moisture contents of bottom and outlet ash were obviously different when the flue gas temperatures were different at inlet as the flue gas temperature at inlet increased from 280 to 380 c the temperatures at all measuring points also gradually increased in addition with the increase of flue gas temperature at the inlet the temperature drop in the main evaporation area temperature difference between the inlet and the measuring point 1 also increased from 133 6 135 141 7 146 and 150 7 c while that in the area below the measuring point 1 temperature difference between the measuring point 1 and outlet decreased gradually from 23 6 18 8 14 8 11 6 and 4 9 c at the same time the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash also decreased it can be explained that with the increase of flue gas temperature the temperature difference between droplets and flue gas also increased and the heat transfer intensity was enhanced as a result the evaporation of atomized droplets in the main evaporation area was more intense and the temperature drop was more obvious on the other hand the more water evaporated in the main evaporation area the lower the water content in the remaining droplets or solid particles and the less water evaporation in the lower part of the tower this led to slighter temperature drops in the lower part of the tower and lower moisture contents in the bottom and outlet ash therefore it can be concluded that the increase of flue gas temperature can improve the evaporation effect of desulfurization wastewater droplets 3 2 2 effect of the gas liquid ratio the gas liquid ratio is another important factor affecting the heat and mass transfer during the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater and the effect of gas liquid ratio on the evaporation characteristics is shown in fig 7 during the experiment the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was set at 50 l h 1 and different gas liquid ratios were achieved by adjusting the volume of flue gas the flue gas temperature at inlet was set at 340 c the atomizer rotating speed was 16 200 r min 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 it can be seen form the results that with the increase of gas liquid ratio the temperature drop in the main evaporation area and the lower part of evaporation tower both decreased and the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash also decreased gradually with the increase of gas liquid ratio the volume of flue gas entering the evaporation tower for heating atomized droplets increased correspondingly for the fixed flow rate of desulfurization wastewater the heat transferred from per unit volume of flue gas to droplets decreased resulting in the decrease of flue gas temperature drop meanwhile due to the decrease of flue gas temperature drop the average temperature in the evaporation tower was higher which increased the temperature difference between the flue gas and droplets and improved the heat and mass transfer between them thus reducing the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash in addition the larger flue gas volume increased the flue gas velocity at the outlet of the gas distributor which was conducive to the dispersion of atomized droplets in the tower and promoted the contact and heat transfer between the atomized droplets and flue gas and more flue gas can take away the vapor evaporated from the droplets in time so as to keep a high vapor concentration difference between the droplet surface and flue gas which was also conducive to the mass transfer between them therefore higher gas liquid ratio can promote the rapid evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets however in practical application excessive extraction of hot flue gas may lead to energy waste and reduce the thermal efficiency of boiler so the energy utilization efficiency should be considered while ensuring the evaporation effect of desulfurization wastewater 3 2 3 effect of the atomizer rotating speed the atomizer rotating speed affects the atomized droplet size of desulfurization wastewater thus affecting its evaporation effect the effect of atomizer rotating speed on the evaporation characteristics was investigated as seen in fig 8 during the experiment the flue gas temperature at inlet was set at 340 c the gas liquid ratio was 12 000 nm3 m 3 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the results showed that the temperature distributions along the evaporation tower were similar under different atomizer rotating speeds they all dropped rapidly in the main evaporation area at first and then decreased slowly in the lower part of the tower however the temperature drop rate and the flue gas temperature at the tower outlet were different when the rotating speed was 10 800 r min 1 the flue gas temperature at measuring point 1 was 218 3 c where the temperature was 121 7 c lower than the inlet and then it dropped to 188 6 c at the outlet of the tower when the speed of atomizer increased to 18 000 r min 1 the flue gas temperature at measuring point 1 dropped to 194 1 c where the temperature was 145 9 c lower than the inlet and then it dropped to 182 1 c at the outlet of the tower it indicated that with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the flue gas temperature dropped faster in the main evaporation area which meant the evaporation of droplets was more intense there and the utilization of flue gas heat in the tower was more sufficient this is due to that the increase of atomizer rotating speed can reduce the size of atomized droplets thus increasing the specific surface area of wastewater it was conductive to the heat and mass transfer between wastewater and hot flue gas so as to make full use of the heat from flue gas and promote the rapid evaporation of wastewater in the tower however when the rotating speed was low the droplet sizes were relatively large more droplets would enter the lower part of the evaporation tower with flue gas before they can completely evaporate in this area the water evaporation rate was relatively slow and the evaporation products with higher moisture content would flow out from the tower before complete drying consequently for the whole evaporation process the evaporation rate of atomized droplets was reduced and the heat of flue gas in the tower was not fully utilized resulting in the lower temperature drop of flue gas in the main evaporation area and higher temperature at the outlet what s more with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash decreased which also indicated that the increase of atomizer rotating speed was beneficial to the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets 3 2 4 effect of the wastewater tds the tds of desulfurization wastewater also affect its atomization effect thus affecting its evaporation the effect of wastewater tds on its evaporation characteristics is shown in fig 9 during the experiment the flue gas temperature at inlet was set at 340 c the gas liquid ratios was 12 000 nm3 m 3 and the atomizer rotating speed was 16 200 r min 1 it can be seen from the results that the wastewater tds had little effect on the temperature distribution in the evaporation tower when the tds of desulfurization wastewater increased from 6000 to 60 000 mg l 1 the variation trends of flue gas temperature along the tower were consistent the temperatures at the outlet of evaporation tower were almost unchanged and there were only some differences in the temperature drop rate along the tower the temperature drop in the main evaporation area was 150 147 4 146 144 7 and 141 c and that from the measuring point 1 to the outlet of tower was 9 3 10 6 11 6 13 4 and 15 9 c when the tds of desulfurization wastewater was 6000 10000 20 000 40 000 and 60 000 mg l 1 respectively it indicated that with the increase of wastewater tds the evaporation of wastewater droplets slowed down the amount of water evaporating in the main evaporation area decreased and that in the lower part of evaporation tower increased it was due to that the increase of tds increased the droplet sizes of desulfurization wastewater thus reducing the specific surface area of wastewater for heat and mass transfer with hot flue gas which was not conducive to the heat absorption and rapid evaporation of wastewater at the same time with the increase of tds the solute mass contained in atomized droplets increased and the size of solid particles precipitated in the evaporation process also increased which increased the resistance of moisture transport from the inside to surface of them and reduced the evaporation rate what s more the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash increased slightly with the increase of tds which also indicated that it is not conducive to the droplet evaporation on the other side it should be noted that the effect of tds on the evaporation of desulfurized wastewater was very slight compared with other factors which meant this technology has good adaptability for different kinds of desulfurization wastewater and can be applied in a variety of working conditions 4 engineering application 4 1 operating conditions of the desulphurization wastewater evaporation system in order to treat the wastewater from wfgd system in a coal fired power plant the desulfurization wastewater evaporation system based on the evaporation tower technology was designed and constructed shown in fig 10 in this power plant the boiler load was 330 mw the scr selective catalytic reduction air preheater esp wfgd system and stack were arranged in turn at the end of the boiler the scr system was applied to remove nox in flue gas the air preheater used the residual heat of flue gas to heat the inlet air of boiler so as to improve the thermal efficiency of it the esp was applied to remove fly ash and the wfgd system was applied to remove so2 in flue gas at last the treated flue gas was discharged through the stack besides a similar evaporation tower system according to the pilot scale platform in this experiment was also applied between the scr and air preheater to treat the desulfurization wastewater from wfgd system in the evaporation tower system the rated flow rate of atomizer and the size of evaporation tower were properly enlarged to meet the treatment capacity of desulfurization wastewater in this power plant the rated flow rate of atomizer was designed as 10 t h 1 and the evaporation tower was 9 m in diameter and 17 m in height a part of flue gas 3 5 was extracted between the scr and air preheater and sent to the top of evaporation tower through bypass flue the desulfurization wastewater was pretreated firstly part of the suspended solids in it were removed by precipitation and the ph was adjusted to weak alkalinity the wastewater quality after pretreatment is shown in table 2 after that the desulfurization wastewater was atomized by the rotary atomizer and sprayed into the evaporation tower where heat and mass transfer occurred between the atomized droplets and hot flue gas the atomizer rotating speed was set at 18 000 r min 1 the droplets evaporated in the tower and some large particles from the evaporation products and fly ash fell to the bottom of the tower while others with smaller sizes would enter the esp following the flue gas and be removed in order to investigate the evaporation effect of desulfurization wastewater the moisture contents of bottom ash were tested under the boiler loads of 200 240 and 300 mw respectively the specific operation conditions and test results are shown in table 3 the results showed that the moisture contents of bottom ash didn t change significantly under different boiler loads and were all below 1 1 which indicated that the evaporation effect was good and this evaporation system can well adapt to different working conditions 4 2 influence of desulphurization wastewater evaporation on flue gas characteristics 4 2 1 flue gas temperature and humidity the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater would affect the characteristics of flue gas the flue gas temperature and humidity before and after the evaporation tower were measured as illustrated in fig 11 it can be seen that the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater in the tower caused the decrease of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity when the boiler load was 200 240 and 300 mw the flue gas temperature at the tower outlet decreased by 132 4 163 8 and 177 2 c and the humidity increased by about 0 8 1 05 and 1 34 after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater respectively it was due to that the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater absorbed the heat from the flue gas and evaporated the water vapor into it while under different boiler loads and treatment capacities of desulfurization wastewater the outlet flue gas temperatures were all higher than the acid dew point of flue gas so it would not lead to corrosion of downstream flue and equipment besides considering that only 3 5 of flue gas in the main flue was extracted to evaporate the wastewater it also had little impact on the temperature and humidity of flue gas in the main flue 4 2 2 gaseous pollutants in the flue gas coal combustion produces a variety of gaseous pollutants of which the sulfur oxides sox and nitrogen oxides nox are the key monitoring objects of environmental protection departments therefore the concentrations of so2 and nox before and after the evaporation tower were measured to explore the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on the gaseous pollutants in flue gas and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater in the tower resulted in the reduction of so2 concentration in flue gas when the boiler load was 200 240 and 300 mw the so2 concentration decreased by 129 112 and 129 mg m 3 accounting for 10 1 8 2 and 9 2 of that in original flue gas respectively while the concentration of nox was almost unchanged after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater it can be inferred that due to the desulfurization wastewater was weakly alkaline after pretreatment when it was sprayed into the evaporation tower in the form of small droplets the so2 in flue gas would contact with the wastewater droplets and neutralize with the alkaline substances in them to form so3 2 or so4 2 which led to a slight decrease of so2 concentration however the nox can t react with the substance in the droplets so the concentration of it was almost unchanged 4 3 influence of desulphurization wastewater evaporation on particle characteristics 4 3 1 particle concentration in the flue gas coal combustion produces a lot of particulate matters which are the main solid pollutants in flue gas in the evaporation process of desulfurization wastewater the solute in the wastewater would precipitate to form solid particles which may affect the particle characteristics in flue gas the particle concentrations in the flue gas before and after the evaporation tower were measured to explore that as shown in fig 13 the results show that the particle concentrations in the flue gas all decreased at the outlet of evaporation tower under different boiler loads when the boiler load was 200 240 and 300 mw it reduced by 47 2 55 7 and 67 7 respectively it can be explained that as the flue gas rotated downward in the tower after passing through the gas distributor fig 2 b the particles with larger sizes in flue gas were thrown to the tower wall under the action of centrifugal force and deposited at the tower bottom under the gravity which was similar to the cyclone separator meanwhile as the increase of boiler load more flue gas entered the tower and the flue gas velocity also increased which enhanced the centrifugal force on the particles and promoted more of them to deposit at the bottom of the tower therefore the higher the boiler load the more obvious the decrease of particle concentration 4 3 2 morphology and components of particle samples the morphology and components of particle samples before and after the evaporation tower were also detected to explore the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on particle characteristics illustrated in fig 14 as seen in fig 14 a the particle samples at the inlet of evaporation tower contained a large number of spherical particles with different sizes their surfaces were smooth and there was no obvious connection between them fig 14 b shows the micro morphology of particle samples at the outlet of evaporation tower it can be seen that after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater a lot of particles connected to each other and formed large size aggregates in which there also had some particles with prismatic structure fig 14 c shows the micro morphology of particle samples at the bottom of evaporation tower and the result showed that it also contained a number of spherical and prismatic particles the components of particle samples at different measuring points are shown in fig 14 d which was analyzed through the xrd the results showed that the particles in the original flue gas was mainly composed of 3al2o3 2sio2 sio2 al2o3 mgo and cao at the inlet of evaporation tower after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater the kcl mgso4 h2o mgso4 caso4 2h2o and caso4 h2o were also detected at the tower bottom and outlet according to the composition of desulfurization wastewater table 2 it can be inferred that after the desulfurization wastewater evaporated in the tower the ions in it precipitated into prismatic particles through crystallization some of which deposited at the bottom of the tower and others flowed out of the evaporation tower with flue gas during the process some fly ash particles would contact with the droplets and agglomerated together after the water in the droplets evaporated the fly ash particles and precipitated prismatic particles connected together to form large size aggregates which was conducive to their subsequent removal in the esp above all this evaporation system can ensure the evaporation effect of desulphurization wastewater under different boiler loads lead to the reduction of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity reduce the concentration of so2 and particles in flue gas and enlarge the particle size at the outlet of evaporation tower considering that only 3 5 of flue gas in the main flue was extracted to evaporate the wastewater it can be concluded that the evaporation tower system had little adverse effect on the flue gas and particle characteristics and can realize zero liquid discharge of desulfurization wastewater in this coal fired power plant 5 conclusions in this work a pilot scale platform for the spray evaporation of desulfurization wastewater was built the atomization and evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater were investigated systematically on this basis a bypass evaporation tower system was designed and constructed to treat the desulphurization wastewater from wfgd system in a 330 mw coal fired power plant and the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on the flue gas and particle characteristics was investigated under different boiler loads the conclusions are presented as follows 1 the increase of atomizer rotating speed can reduce the size of atomized droplets and improve the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater while the increase of its flow rate and tds enlarged the size of atomized droplets which was not conducive to the atomization besides the influence of atomizer rotating speed and wastewater flow rate was obvious on the atomization effect while that of the wastewater tds was relatively slight 2 the increase of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio and atomizer rotating speed can promote the rapid evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets while the increase of wastewater tds was not conducive to the evaporation in addition the effect of tds on the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater was very slight compared with other factors indicating that the evaporation tower technology has good adaptability for different kinds of desulfurization wastewater 3 in the 330 mw coal fired power plant the moisture contents of bottom ash under different boiler loads were all below 1 1 indicating that the evaporation effect was good and this evaporation system can well adapt to different working conditions what s more it can lead to the reduction of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity reduce the concentration of so2 and particles in flue gas and enlarge the particle size at the outlet of evaporation

13670,the spray evaporation is a promising zero discharge technology for desulphurization wastewater treatment in this work a pilot scale platform for the spray evaporation of desulfurization wastewater was built the desulphurization wastewater was atomized by a rotary atomizer and evaporate in the evaporation tower and the wastewater atomization and evaporation characteristics were investigated systematically the results showed that the increase of atomizer rotating speed can improve the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater while the increase of its flow rate and total amount of dissolved solids tds was not conducive to that for the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater the increase of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio the ratio of flue gas volume to desulfurization wastewater volume nm3 m 3 and atomizer rotating speed can promote its rapid evaporation while the increase of wastewater tds reduced the evaporation rate of wastewater droplets on this basis a bypass evaporation tower system was designed and constructed in a 330 mw coal fired power plant to treat the desulphurization wastewater from limestone gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization wfgd system and the influence of wastewater evaporation on the flue gas and particle characteristics was investigated under different boiler loads the results show that this evaporation system can ensure the evaporation effect of desulphurization wastewater under different boiler loads lead to the reduction of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity reduce the concentration of so2 and particles in flue gas and enlarge the particle size at the outlet of evaporation tower this work can provide a reference for the desulphurization wastewater treatment in coal fired power plants keywords desulfurization wastewater rotary atomization evaporation zero liquid discharge coal fired power plant 1 introduction coal is an important part of the world s energy mix especially in china where 60 2 of the total installed capacity are coal fired power plants 1 2 during coal combustion the sulfides contained in it produce sulfur oxides mainly sulfur dioxide which would cause serious air pollution if not treated properly 3 therefore the emission of sulfur dioxide from coal fired power plants is a serious problem that must be considered and solved at present most of the coal fired power plants are equipped with the flue gas desulfurization fgd facilities among which the limestone gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization is the most widely used due to its high removal efficiency and maturity 4 6 as of 2014 more than 90 of the coal fired power plants were equipped with wfgd in china and in the united states 69 of the 108 coal fired power plants will adopt wfgd by 2025 7 8 however to ensure the normal operation of wfgd system a certain amount of desulfurization wastewater needs to be discharged regularly to control the concentration of chloride ion in desulfurization slurry and prevent corrosion of related equipment and materials 9 10 desulfurization wastewater contains a lot of acidic ions heavy metal ions and suspended solids in which the acidic ions such as cl and so4 2 are corrosive to metal materials and the heavy metal elements such as hg cr and ni have great harm to human health so it must be treated before discharge 11 13 with the strengthening of pollutant emission control and the gradual improvement of environmental standards around the world the treatment of desulfurization wastewater has attracted extensive attention in recent years 14 the current desulfurization wastewater treatment technologies mainly include the chemical precipitation 15 18 membrane separation 19 evaporative crystallization 20 electrodialysis technology 21 and biological treatment technology 22 the most commonly used technology in coal fired power plants is chemical precipitation which treats the desulfurization wastewater mainly through neutralization precipitation flocculation and clarification in this process many kinds of chemical reagents are applied to precipitate and remove the ions in the desulfurization wastewater which needs high investment and operation costs besides although the chemical precipitation can remove heavy metal ions in wastewater to the standard level there is no chemical agent that can effectively remove cl therefore the content of cl in the treated wastewater is still very high and it will still cause harm to the environment if directly discharged 23 in order to treat the desulfurization wastewater more economically and effectively the spray evaporation technology was proposed the spray evaporation technology is to use the residual heat of flue gas at the end of the boiler to make the atomized desulfurization wastewater evaporate and then the evaporation products enter the dust removal equipment together with the flue gas to be removed so as to realize zero liquid discharge zld of desulfurization wastewater 24 25 it mainly includes two implementation modes one is to spray the desulfurization wastewater into the main or bypass flue duct after the air preheater to realize the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater flue evaporation technology 26 28 and the other is to set up an bypass evaporation tower in which the atomized desulfurization wastewater is evaporated by introducing partial flue gas before the air preheater evaporation tower technology 29 31 for the flue evaporation technology the desulfurization wastewater is directly sprayed into the flue before the dust removal equipment for evaporation due to the low temperature of flue gas at this location the wastewater may not evaporate completely as the boiler load changes which will lead to adhesion and accumulation of fly ash on the flue and cause corrosion to it at the same time the two fluid spray nozzle is generally used in this technology and it uses compressed air to atomize the desulfurization wastewater due to the large amount of suspended solids in the wastewater this kind of nozzle is easy to be blocked and the atomization effect will be affected thus affecting the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater what s more the promotion of low temperature economizer shortens the available flue length for evaporation which also limits the evaporation capacity of desulfurization wastewater 32 in comparison the flue gas used in the evaporation tower technology is introduced before the air preheater and has higher temperature so the heat and mass transfer between the wastewater droplets and flue gas is enhanced besides the flue gas velocity in the evaporation tower is lower than that in the flue duct which can prolong the residence time of atomized droplets in the evaporation tower and improve the evaporation effect so as to ensure the complete evaporation of desulfurization wastewater therefore the evaporation tower has more advantages in the treatment of desulphurization wastewater and attracted much attention in recent years ma et al 29 investigated the evaporation performance of desulfurization wastewater in bypass evaporation tower and the characteristics of evaporation products by experiment and the influence on the original pollutant removal equipment was also discussed zhang et al 30 studied the evaporation and crystallization process of desulfurization wastewater in the evaporation tower by simulation and the influence of droplet diameter as well as the mass flow temperature and humidity of flue gas on evaporation was analyzed zheng et al 31 studied the variation of ph and total dissolved solids with the concentration of desulfurization wastewater in the circulating evaporation tower however the researches on the evaporation tower technology for desulphurization wastewater treatment are not comprehensive at present lacking systematic studies on the atomization and evaporation characteristics of actual desulfurization wastewater especially the engineering application research in actual coal fired power plants which limits its further promotion and application in this work a pilot scale platform was built to research the atomization and evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater in the process of evaporation tower technology the desulfurization wastewater was atomized by a rotary atomizer the effects of atomizer rotating speed wastewater flow rate and tds on the size distribution and average diameter of desulfurization wastewater droplets were investigated to research the atomization characteristics the atomized droplets evaporated in the evaporation tower the effects of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio atomizer rotating speed and wastewater tds on the temperature distribution in it and the moisture content of ash at the tower bottom and outlet were investigated to research the evaporation characteristics on this basis a similar bypass evaporation tower system was designed and constructed in a 330 mw coal fired power plant to treat the desulfurization wastewater produced by wfgd system the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on the flue gas and particle characteristics was explored under different boiler loads 2 experiment sections 2 1 experimental set up the schematics of atomization test system and spray evaporation system of desulfurization wastewater are shown in fig 1 in this experiment the rotary atomization was applied to atomize desulphurization wastewater and the test system for atomization characteristics mainly consisted of the rotary atomization system and particle dynamic analyzer system pda dantec dynamics co denmark fig 1 a the rotary atomization system included the rotary atomizer desulfurization wastewater tank and metering pump the rotary atomizer was composed of a variable frequency motor and an atomizing disc the atomizing disc was made of wear resistant stainless steel with 12 orifice channels distributed along the circumference in the atomization process the desulfurization wastewater was firstly sent to the atomizer by the metering pump then the motor driven the atomizing disc to rotate at a high speed and the desulfurization wastewater was thrown out from the channels thus atomizing into droplets the wastewater flow rate was controlled by the metering pump and the atomizer rotating speed was controlled by adjusting the frequency of motor the pda system mainly included the laser beam splitter laser transmitter laser receiver photoelectric converter bsa processor and computer which can measure the size distribution and average diameter of atomized droplets through the refraction and reflection of laser the desulfurization wastewater used in the experiment was taken from a coal fired power plant before the experiment it was filtered to remove part of the suspended solids and the compositions of it are shown in table 1 the wastewater spray evaporation system mainly included the gas heater buffer vessel evaporation tower system electrostatic precipitator esp and induced draft fan fig 1 b the air was heated by the gas heater and then entered the buffer vessel in which the fly ash and water vapor were provided by the solid aerosol generator and steam generator to form simulated flue gas the fly ash was taken from a coal fired power plant and the concentration of fly ash and humidity of flue gas were controlled at about 10 g m 3 and 6 respectively after that the simulated flue gas entered into the evaporation tower system which was composed of the rotary atomizer evaporation tower desulfurization wastewater tank and metering pump the desulfurization wastewater was atomized into droplets by the rotary atomizer and sprayed into the evaporation tower and then evaporated in the hot flue gas a total of 6 measuring points were set on the evaporation tower to test the temperature distribution in it the first thermocouple was located 1000 mm below the atomizing disc and the remaining 5 thermocouples were set at an interval of 800 mm during the experiment the inlet flue gas temperature was controlled by the gas heater and the flue gas volume was controlled by the induced draft fan in addition an aspirated isokinetic sampler wj 60b laoying ltd china was applied to collect the ash samples at the inlet and outlet of the evaporation tower the humidity and temperature of flue gas were measured by the humidity and temperature transmitter hmt337 vaisala co ltd finland the composition of flue gas was measured by a flue gas analyzer j2kn ecom co ltd germany the moisture content of ash samples was tested according to the national standard of gb t 211 2017 the morphology and components of which were detected by the field emission scanning electron microscopy ultra plus zeiss ltd germany and x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro panalytical b v netherlands respectively 2 2 structure and flow field distribution of the evaporation tower the structure of evaporation tower is shown in fig 2 a which was 1 6 m in diameter and 6 0 m in height including the gas distributor and tower body the gas distributor mainly consisted of the gas inlet volute inner flow channel outer flow channel and several deflectors and the atomizing disc was located right below the gas distributor the flue gas entered into the volute from the inlet to generate rotary flow and then entered into the inner and outer flow channels where the deflector numbers were both 16 these deflectors were arranged to guide the gas flow so that the flue gas can move downward while rotating in the tower the middle of the tower body was cylindrical and the bottom was conical the flow field distribution in the evaporation tower was represented by the flue gas streamline in it which was simulated using the computational fluid dynamics cfd software fluent as illustrated in fig 2 b in the process of calculation the rng k ε model was applied to calculate the turbulent flow the temperature volume and dynamic viscosity of flue gas at the inlet were set as 340 c 600 nm3 h 1 and 3 09 10 5 kg m 1 s 1 respectively the result shows that the flue gas rotated downward in the tower after passing through the gas distributor the flue gas velocity was fast at the outlet of gas distributor and then decreased rapidly in the tower it can be inferred that when the droplets were sprayed from the atomizing disc as they were close to the outlet of gas distributor a large amount of flue gas with high temperature and speed would directly contact with the droplets which can make them evaporate rapidly after that some unevaporated droplets rotated downward in the tower with the flue gas due to the rotating movement and low velocity the trajectory and residence time of them were prolonged which was conducive to the complete evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets 3 results and discussion 3 1 atomization characteristics of desulfurization wastewater 3 1 1 effect of the atomizer rotating speed the atomization of liquid is the result of energy acting on the interior and surface of it and the common energy forms include the centrifugal force pressure kinetic energy etc the rotary atomization is to make the liquid flow into a high speed rotating atomizing disc and to throw the liquid out under the effect of centrifugal force for atomization during the process the atomizer rotating speed the flow rate and properties of liquid all affect the final atomization effect as illustrated in fig 3 the effect of atomizer rotating speed on the atomization characteristics of desulfurization wastewater was investigated by measuring the size distribution and average diameter of atomized droplets during the experiment the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was set at 50 l h 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the result showed that the droplet size distribution was unimodal in the speed range of 10800 18000 r min 1 and all the droplet sizes were less than 50 μm when the rotating speed was 10 800 r min 1 the peak value of droplet size distribution was at 6 5 μm where the droplet number proportion was 8 7 and it decreased rapidly with the increase of droplet size as the atomizer rotating speed increased gradually the peak value of droplet size distribution was still at 6 5 μm but the proportion of droplet number increased to 8 9 9 2 9 3 and 9 7 when the rotating speed was 12600 14400 16 200 and 18 000 r min 1 respectively in addition the droplet number proportion in the range of 0 6 5 μm gradually increased while that in the range of 6 5 50 μm decreased which indicated that the atomization performance of desulfurization wastewater was improved with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the average diameter of atomized droplets can also support this conclusion and it was expressed by the sauter mean diameter d32 which is widely used to characterize the atomization effect of liquid 33 34 it can be seen from the results that with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the d32 of atomized droplets decreased from 22 84 to 17 63 μm indicating that the atomization effect was improved in the process of rotary atomization the desulfurization wastewater was thrown out by the high speed rotating atomizing disc into the hot flue gas for evaporation the desulfurization wastewater formed a liquid film on the atomizing disc and then was thrown out from the orifice channels to split into many small droplets in the flue gas which increased the surface area of liquid and was conducive to the rapid evaporation of it the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater was determined by the combined action of centrifugal force shear force inside the liquid friction force between the liquid and flue gas viscous force and surface tension of liquid itself the shear force inside the liquid and the friction force between the liquid and flue gas can promote the deformation and splitting of liquid thus atomizing it into droplets while the viscous force and surface tension of liquid itself inhibited that process with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the centrifugal force on the liquid increased the thickness of the liquid film decreased and the velocity of liquid leaving the atomizing disc increased which enhanced the shear force inside the liquid and the friction force between the liquid and flue gas thus promoting the deformation and splitting of liquid and improving the atomization effect 3 1 2 effect of the wastewater flow rate the effect of wastewater flow rate on the atomization characteristics is shown in fig 4 and the rated flow rate of the atomizer is 50 l h 1 during the experiment the atomizer rotating speed was set at 16 200 r min 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the result showed that with the increase of wastewater flow rate from 40 to 120 l h 1 the size distribution and d32 of atomized droplets changed significantly with the increase of wastewater flow rate the peak size of droplets increased from 7 5 8 5 9 5 16 5 and 18 5 μm respectively besides the d32 of atomized droplets also increased from 17 83 to 33 50 μm which almost doubled it showed that the atomization effect was significantly affected by the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater and the atomization effect became worse with the increase of flow rate when the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater increased the amount of liquid flowing into the atomizing disc increased at the same time leading to the increase of the liquid film thickness in it which was not conducive to the deformation and splitting of liquid and made the size of atomized droplets larger in addition due to the small diameter of the atomizing disc 20 cm in this experiment the increase of wastewater flow rate would significantly increase the liquid volume stored in the atomizing disc and the thickness of liquid film also increased significantly so the influence on the atomization effect was very significant on the other hand although the droplet sizes became large with the increase of wastewater flow rate all of them were still less than 50 μm which indicated that the rotary atomization has good adaptability for different wastewater flow rates and can ensure the atomization effect in a certain range 3 1 3 effect of the wastewater tds the wastewater quality also had an effect on its atomization in this experiment the effect of wastewater tds on the atomization characteristics was investigated to explore the influence of wastewater quality on the atomization shown in fig 5 the tds refers to the total amount of dissolved solids in liquid which can represent the total amount of impurity ions in the desulfurization wastewater the higher the tds value the higher the ion content in the wastewater and the worse the wastewater quality during the experiment the atomizer rotating speed was set at 16 200 r min 1 the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was set at 50 l h 1 and the tds was adjusted by diluting or concentrating the desulfurization wastewater taken from the power plant the result showed that the wastewater tds had little effect on the atomization effect and there was no significant change on the size distribution and d32 of atomized droplets with the tds increase from 6000 to 60 000 mg l 1 the droplet size distribution was still unimodal only the peak size of atomized droplets changed from 5 5 7 5 μm and the d32 changed from 17 14 20 08 μm that meant the increase of wastewater tds made the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater get worse but the influence was very slight the increase of tds increased the viscosity and surface tension of desulfurization wastewater and theoretically inhibited the deformation and splitting of liquid thus affecting its atomization effect however it can be inferred from the experimental results that the centrifugal force the shear force inside the liquid and the friction force between the liquid and flue gas played the decisive roles in the rotary atomization process while the properties of liquid itself only had slight influence it meant that the rotary atomization has good adaptability for desulfurization wastewater with different ion concentrations considering the great difference of desulfurization wastewater quality in different coal fired power plants it is very conducive to the application and promotion of this technology 3 2 evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater 3 2 1 effect of the flue gas temperature after being atomized into droplets the desulfurization wastewater was sprayed into the evaporation tower where heat and mass transfer occurred between the droplets and hot flue gas the water in the droplets evaporated and the solute was precipitated out to form solid particles in flue gas some larger fly ash particles and evaporation products would deposit at the tower bottom and the others entered the esp with flue gas to be removed so that the desulfurization wastewater can be effectively treated to realize zero liquid discharge during the process the flue gas temperature and gas liquid ratio would affect the heat and mass transfer between droplets and flue gas thus affecting the evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater besides the purpose of atomizing desulfurization wastewater was to increase its surface area so as to increase the area for heat and mass transfer with flue gas and improve the evaporation effect which means the atomization characteristics of desulfurization wastewater can also affect its evaporation therefore the effects of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio atomizer rotating speed and tds of desulfurization wastewater on its evaporation characteristics were investigated by experiments the effect of flue gas temperature on the evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater is shown in fig 6 in this experiment the gas liquid ratio was set at 12 000 nm3 m 3 the volume of flue gas was 600 nm3 h the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was 50 l h 1 the atomizer rotating speed was 16 200 r min 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater can cause temperature drop in the tower and the moisture content of evaporation products also varied with the evaporation effect so the wastewater evaporation effect was characterized by the temperature distribution in the tower and the moisture content of ash at the tower bottom and outlet the results showed that under different flue gas temperatures at inlet the temperature drops caused by droplets evaporation were all obvious in the upper part of the tower and very slight in the lower part the evaporation process of desulfurization wastewater droplets is generally divided into two stages the first stage is similar to the evaporation of pure water due to the high moisture content of droplets and the second stage is similar to the drying process of wet particulate matters due to the low moisture content of them 35 when the desulfurization wastewater was atomized and sprayed into the upper part of the tower the temperature of flue gas coming from the gas distributor was high the temperature difference between droplets and flue gas was large so that the droplets can absorb heat rapidly and evaporate most of the water in a short time therefore the flue gas temperature dropped sharply within a short distance under the atomizing disc and this area is referred to as the main evaporation area after that a small amount of unevaporated droplets and wet solid particles precipitated from the droplets continued to flow to the lower part of the tower and conducted heat and mass transfer with the flue gas due to the decrease of flue gas temperature the temperature difference between the flue gas and droplets also decreased resulting in the weakening of heat transfer intensity at the same time due to the internal mass transfer resistance the evaporation rate of water in solid particles was far lower than that in original droplets so the flue gas temperature in the lower part of evaporation tower decreased very little however the temperatures at each measuring point in the tower and the moisture contents of bottom and outlet ash were obviously different when the flue gas temperatures were different at inlet as the flue gas temperature at inlet increased from 280 to 380 c the temperatures at all measuring points also gradually increased in addition with the increase of flue gas temperature at the inlet the temperature drop in the main evaporation area temperature difference between the inlet and the measuring point 1 also increased from 133 6 135 141 7 146 and 150 7 c while that in the area below the measuring point 1 temperature difference between the measuring point 1 and outlet decreased gradually from 23 6 18 8 14 8 11 6 and 4 9 c at the same time the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash also decreased it can be explained that with the increase of flue gas temperature the temperature difference between droplets and flue gas also increased and the heat transfer intensity was enhanced as a result the evaporation of atomized droplets in the main evaporation area was more intense and the temperature drop was more obvious on the other hand the more water evaporated in the main evaporation area the lower the water content in the remaining droplets or solid particles and the less water evaporation in the lower part of the tower this led to slighter temperature drops in the lower part of the tower and lower moisture contents in the bottom and outlet ash therefore it can be concluded that the increase of flue gas temperature can improve the evaporation effect of desulfurization wastewater droplets 3 2 2 effect of the gas liquid ratio the gas liquid ratio is another important factor affecting the heat and mass transfer during the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater and the effect of gas liquid ratio on the evaporation characteristics is shown in fig 7 during the experiment the flow rate of desulfurization wastewater was set at 50 l h 1 and different gas liquid ratios were achieved by adjusting the volume of flue gas the flue gas temperature at inlet was set at 340 c the atomizer rotating speed was 16 200 r min 1 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 it can be seen form the results that with the increase of gas liquid ratio the temperature drop in the main evaporation area and the lower part of evaporation tower both decreased and the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash also decreased gradually with the increase of gas liquid ratio the volume of flue gas entering the evaporation tower for heating atomized droplets increased correspondingly for the fixed flow rate of desulfurization wastewater the heat transferred from per unit volume of flue gas to droplets decreased resulting in the decrease of flue gas temperature drop meanwhile due to the decrease of flue gas temperature drop the average temperature in the evaporation tower was higher which increased the temperature difference between the flue gas and droplets and improved the heat and mass transfer between them thus reducing the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash in addition the larger flue gas volume increased the flue gas velocity at the outlet of the gas distributor which was conducive to the dispersion of atomized droplets in the tower and promoted the contact and heat transfer between the atomized droplets and flue gas and more flue gas can take away the vapor evaporated from the droplets in time so as to keep a high vapor concentration difference between the droplet surface and flue gas which was also conducive to the mass transfer between them therefore higher gas liquid ratio can promote the rapid evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets however in practical application excessive extraction of hot flue gas may lead to energy waste and reduce the thermal efficiency of boiler so the energy utilization efficiency should be considered while ensuring the evaporation effect of desulfurization wastewater 3 2 3 effect of the atomizer rotating speed the atomizer rotating speed affects the atomized droplet size of desulfurization wastewater thus affecting its evaporation effect the effect of atomizer rotating speed on the evaporation characteristics was investigated as seen in fig 8 during the experiment the flue gas temperature at inlet was set at 340 c the gas liquid ratio was 12 000 nm3 m 3 and the tds of desulfurization wastewater was about 20 000 mg l 1 the results showed that the temperature distributions along the evaporation tower were similar under different atomizer rotating speeds they all dropped rapidly in the main evaporation area at first and then decreased slowly in the lower part of the tower however the temperature drop rate and the flue gas temperature at the tower outlet were different when the rotating speed was 10 800 r min 1 the flue gas temperature at measuring point 1 was 218 3 c where the temperature was 121 7 c lower than the inlet and then it dropped to 188 6 c at the outlet of the tower when the speed of atomizer increased to 18 000 r min 1 the flue gas temperature at measuring point 1 dropped to 194 1 c where the temperature was 145 9 c lower than the inlet and then it dropped to 182 1 c at the outlet of the tower it indicated that with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the flue gas temperature dropped faster in the main evaporation area which meant the evaporation of droplets was more intense there and the utilization of flue gas heat in the tower was more sufficient this is due to that the increase of atomizer rotating speed can reduce the size of atomized droplets thus increasing the specific surface area of wastewater it was conductive to the heat and mass transfer between wastewater and hot flue gas so as to make full use of the heat from flue gas and promote the rapid evaporation of wastewater in the tower however when the rotating speed was low the droplet sizes were relatively large more droplets would enter the lower part of the evaporation tower with flue gas before they can completely evaporate in this area the water evaporation rate was relatively slow and the evaporation products with higher moisture content would flow out from the tower before complete drying consequently for the whole evaporation process the evaporation rate of atomized droplets was reduced and the heat of flue gas in the tower was not fully utilized resulting in the lower temperature drop of flue gas in the main evaporation area and higher temperature at the outlet what s more with the increase of atomizer rotating speed the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash decreased which also indicated that the increase of atomizer rotating speed was beneficial to the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets 3 2 4 effect of the wastewater tds the tds of desulfurization wastewater also affect its atomization effect thus affecting its evaporation the effect of wastewater tds on its evaporation characteristics is shown in fig 9 during the experiment the flue gas temperature at inlet was set at 340 c the gas liquid ratios was 12 000 nm3 m 3 and the atomizer rotating speed was 16 200 r min 1 it can be seen from the results that the wastewater tds had little effect on the temperature distribution in the evaporation tower when the tds of desulfurization wastewater increased from 6000 to 60 000 mg l 1 the variation trends of flue gas temperature along the tower were consistent the temperatures at the outlet of evaporation tower were almost unchanged and there were only some differences in the temperature drop rate along the tower the temperature drop in the main evaporation area was 150 147 4 146 144 7 and 141 c and that from the measuring point 1 to the outlet of tower was 9 3 10 6 11 6 13 4 and 15 9 c when the tds of desulfurization wastewater was 6000 10000 20 000 40 000 and 60 000 mg l 1 respectively it indicated that with the increase of wastewater tds the evaporation of wastewater droplets slowed down the amount of water evaporating in the main evaporation area decreased and that in the lower part of evaporation tower increased it was due to that the increase of tds increased the droplet sizes of desulfurization wastewater thus reducing the specific surface area of wastewater for heat and mass transfer with hot flue gas which was not conducive to the heat absorption and rapid evaporation of wastewater at the same time with the increase of tds the solute mass contained in atomized droplets increased and the size of solid particles precipitated in the evaporation process also increased which increased the resistance of moisture transport from the inside to surface of them and reduced the evaporation rate what s more the moisture content of bottom and outlet ash increased slightly with the increase of tds which also indicated that it is not conducive to the droplet evaporation on the other side it should be noted that the effect of tds on the evaporation of desulfurized wastewater was very slight compared with other factors which meant this technology has good adaptability for different kinds of desulfurization wastewater and can be applied in a variety of working conditions 4 engineering application 4 1 operating conditions of the desulphurization wastewater evaporation system in order to treat the wastewater from wfgd system in a coal fired power plant the desulfurization wastewater evaporation system based on the evaporation tower technology was designed and constructed shown in fig 10 in this power plant the boiler load was 330 mw the scr selective catalytic reduction air preheater esp wfgd system and stack were arranged in turn at the end of the boiler the scr system was applied to remove nox in flue gas the air preheater used the residual heat of flue gas to heat the inlet air of boiler so as to improve the thermal efficiency of it the esp was applied to remove fly ash and the wfgd system was applied to remove so2 in flue gas at last the treated flue gas was discharged through the stack besides a similar evaporation tower system according to the pilot scale platform in this experiment was also applied between the scr and air preheater to treat the desulfurization wastewater from wfgd system in the evaporation tower system the rated flow rate of atomizer and the size of evaporation tower were properly enlarged to meet the treatment capacity of desulfurization wastewater in this power plant the rated flow rate of atomizer was designed as 10 t h 1 and the evaporation tower was 9 m in diameter and 17 m in height a part of flue gas 3 5 was extracted between the scr and air preheater and sent to the top of evaporation tower through bypass flue the desulfurization wastewater was pretreated firstly part of the suspended solids in it were removed by precipitation and the ph was adjusted to weak alkalinity the wastewater quality after pretreatment is shown in table 2 after that the desulfurization wastewater was atomized by the rotary atomizer and sprayed into the evaporation tower where heat and mass transfer occurred between the atomized droplets and hot flue gas the atomizer rotating speed was set at 18 000 r min 1 the droplets evaporated in the tower and some large particles from the evaporation products and fly ash fell to the bottom of the tower while others with smaller sizes would enter the esp following the flue gas and be removed in order to investigate the evaporation effect of desulfurization wastewater the moisture contents of bottom ash were tested under the boiler loads of 200 240 and 300 mw respectively the specific operation conditions and test results are shown in table 3 the results showed that the moisture contents of bottom ash didn t change significantly under different boiler loads and were all below 1 1 which indicated that the evaporation effect was good and this evaporation system can well adapt to different working conditions 4 2 influence of desulphurization wastewater evaporation on flue gas characteristics 4 2 1 flue gas temperature and humidity the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater would affect the characteristics of flue gas the flue gas temperature and humidity before and after the evaporation tower were measured as illustrated in fig 11 it can be seen that the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater in the tower caused the decrease of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity when the boiler load was 200 240 and 300 mw the flue gas temperature at the tower outlet decreased by 132 4 163 8 and 177 2 c and the humidity increased by about 0 8 1 05 and 1 34 after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater respectively it was due to that the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater absorbed the heat from the flue gas and evaporated the water vapor into it while under different boiler loads and treatment capacities of desulfurization wastewater the outlet flue gas temperatures were all higher than the acid dew point of flue gas so it would not lead to corrosion of downstream flue and equipment besides considering that only 3 5 of flue gas in the main flue was extracted to evaporate the wastewater it also had little impact on the temperature and humidity of flue gas in the main flue 4 2 2 gaseous pollutants in the flue gas coal combustion produces a variety of gaseous pollutants of which the sulfur oxides sox and nitrogen oxides nox are the key monitoring objects of environmental protection departments therefore the concentrations of so2 and nox before and after the evaporation tower were measured to explore the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on the gaseous pollutants in flue gas and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater in the tower resulted in the reduction of so2 concentration in flue gas when the boiler load was 200 240 and 300 mw the so2 concentration decreased by 129 112 and 129 mg m 3 accounting for 10 1 8 2 and 9 2 of that in original flue gas respectively while the concentration of nox was almost unchanged after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater it can be inferred that due to the desulfurization wastewater was weakly alkaline after pretreatment when it was sprayed into the evaporation tower in the form of small droplets the so2 in flue gas would contact with the wastewater droplets and neutralize with the alkaline substances in them to form so3 2 or so4 2 which led to a slight decrease of so2 concentration however the nox can t react with the substance in the droplets so the concentration of it was almost unchanged 4 3 influence of desulphurization wastewater evaporation on particle characteristics 4 3 1 particle concentration in the flue gas coal combustion produces a lot of particulate matters which are the main solid pollutants in flue gas in the evaporation process of desulfurization wastewater the solute in the wastewater would precipitate to form solid particles which may affect the particle characteristics in flue gas the particle concentrations in the flue gas before and after the evaporation tower were measured to explore that as shown in fig 13 the results show that the particle concentrations in the flue gas all decreased at the outlet of evaporation tower under different boiler loads when the boiler load was 200 240 and 300 mw it reduced by 47 2 55 7 and 67 7 respectively it can be explained that as the flue gas rotated downward in the tower after passing through the gas distributor fig 2 b the particles with larger sizes in flue gas were thrown to the tower wall under the action of centrifugal force and deposited at the tower bottom under the gravity which was similar to the cyclone separator meanwhile as the increase of boiler load more flue gas entered the tower and the flue gas velocity also increased which enhanced the centrifugal force on the particles and promoted more of them to deposit at the bottom of the tower therefore the higher the boiler load the more obvious the decrease of particle concentration 4 3 2 morphology and components of particle samples the morphology and components of particle samples before and after the evaporation tower were also detected to explore the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on particle characteristics illustrated in fig 14 as seen in fig 14 a the particle samples at the inlet of evaporation tower contained a large number of spherical particles with different sizes their surfaces were smooth and there was no obvious connection between them fig 14 b shows the micro morphology of particle samples at the outlet of evaporation tower it can be seen that after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater a lot of particles connected to each other and formed large size aggregates in which there also had some particles with prismatic structure fig 14 c shows the micro morphology of particle samples at the bottom of evaporation tower and the result showed that it also contained a number of spherical and prismatic particles the components of particle samples at different measuring points are shown in fig 14 d which was analyzed through the xrd the results showed that the particles in the original flue gas was mainly composed of 3al2o3 2sio2 sio2 al2o3 mgo and cao at the inlet of evaporation tower after the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater the kcl mgso4 h2o mgso4 caso4 2h2o and caso4 h2o were also detected at the tower bottom and outlet according to the composition of desulfurization wastewater table 2 it can be inferred that after the desulfurization wastewater evaporated in the tower the ions in it precipitated into prismatic particles through crystallization some of which deposited at the bottom of the tower and others flowed out of the evaporation tower with flue gas during the process some fly ash particles would contact with the droplets and agglomerated together after the water in the droplets evaporated the fly ash particles and precipitated prismatic particles connected together to form large size aggregates which was conducive to their subsequent removal in the esp above all this evaporation system can ensure the evaporation effect of desulphurization wastewater under different boiler loads lead to the reduction of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity reduce the concentration of so2 and particles in flue gas and enlarge the particle size at the outlet of evaporation tower considering that only 3 5 of flue gas in the main flue was extracted to evaporate the wastewater it can be concluded that the evaporation tower system had little adverse effect on the flue gas and particle characteristics and can realize zero liquid discharge of desulfurization wastewater in this coal fired power plant 5 conclusions in this work a pilot scale platform for the spray evaporation of desulfurization wastewater was built the atomization and evaporation characteristics of desulfurization wastewater were investigated systematically on this basis a bypass evaporation tower system was designed and constructed to treat the desulphurization wastewater from wfgd system in a 330 mw coal fired power plant and the influence of desulfurization wastewater evaporation on the flue gas and particle characteristics was investigated under different boiler loads the conclusions are presented as follows 1 the increase of atomizer rotating speed can reduce the size of atomized droplets and improve the atomization effect of desulfurization wastewater while the increase of its flow rate and tds enlarged the size of atomized droplets which was not conducive to the atomization besides the influence of atomizer rotating speed and wastewater flow rate was obvious on the atomization effect while that of the wastewater tds was relatively slight 2 the increase of flue gas temperature gas liquid ratio and atomizer rotating speed can promote the rapid evaporation of desulfurization wastewater droplets while the increase of wastewater tds was not conducive to the evaporation in addition the effect of tds on the evaporation of desulfurization wastewater was very slight compared with other factors indicating that the evaporation tower technology has good adaptability for different kinds of desulfurization wastewater 3 in the 330 mw coal fired power plant the moisture contents of bottom ash under different boiler loads were all below 1 1 indicating that the evaporation effect was good and this evaporation system can well adapt to different working conditions what s more it can lead to the reduction of flue gas temperature and the increase of humidity reduce the concentration of so2 and particles in flue gas and enlarge the particle size at the outlet of evaporation

13671,the treatment of olive mill wastewater is a problem that still does not have an effective solution in order to minimize this problem there has been an improvement in the olive oil production process moving from three phase processes in oil mills to two phase processes and integrating the later with the oil extraction industry with n hexane this improvement does not totally solve the olive mill wastewater problem on its own it only releases the olive mills from the environmental burden and concentrates the problem in the oil extraction industry in this study it was proposed a treatment of a real effluent from an olive oil extraction industry using the fenton s process integrated with coagulation different coagulant loads were studied to achieve the best conditions for this process for the fenton s process the loads of iron and hydrogen peroxide were optimized the main evaluation parameters present in this study were chemical oxygen demand cod biodegradability and toxicity regarding the toxicity of the treated effluent tests were performed on aliivibrio fischeri the studied effluent has a dark color with an organic load of about 50 g l 1 of cod and high toxicity with 9 of biodegradability coagulation process was studied with a single addition of coagulant 80 mg l 1 leading to 12 5 cod removal while the combination of 20 mg l 1 plus 20 mg l 1 allows a cod reduction of 15 with the best conditions for coagulation double phased addition of a total of 40 g l 1 of coagulant integrated with the fenton reaction 4 g l 1 of hydrogen peroxide 2 g l 1 of iron ii at ph 3 with 60 min of reaction was possible to achieve about 45 of cod removal this allowed to increase the biodegradability to a ratio higher than 40 for further biological treatment application to definitively treat the effluent keywords olive oil extraction industry wastewater fenton s process coagulation toxicity assessment biodegradability 1 introduction the olive oil production represents a very important and constantly growing economic sector for the mediterranean basin being the eu responsible for 64 of the worldwide production 1 the optimum climate conditions and centuries of knowledge led to spain italy greece and portugal covering for 99 of the eu production representing around 2 0 million tons a year 1 2 there are three main olive oil production processes press two phase and three phase separation the pressing process is the most traditional being substituted by the other methods due to the lower production efficiency and great labor costs 3 the two phase and three phase as can be seen in fig 1 continuous methods are then the most common with a nowadays tendency of countries to update its facilities to a two phase process due to the huge volumes of hot water added in the centrifugation decantation step of the three phase process up to 6 m3 per ton of olive oil produced 4 3 from the two phase method a solid waste with around 60 of moisture is formed which can be further used in a drying extraction process for recuperation of the remaining olive oil forming a new olive oil extraction industry wastewater ooeiw despite the improvement towards water usage the problematic involving the olive mill wastewater omw is yet not totally solved and a fully characterization and study of the treatment of this new effluent are still not available 5 the omws are complex effluents with great variability associated with the different characteristics of the olive cultivation and processing but overall is slightly acid ph 5 and have a high organic and phenolic content 6 the phenolic substances are natural antioxidants with high added value but at the same time have a high antibacterial activity and phytotoxicity which hinder the application of omws as soil amendment for agricultural purposes 7 9 different technologies have been applied for the treatment of the traditional omw focusing mostly on the removal of the phenolic compounds and cod and the increase of its biodegradability biological processes are not usually applied directly to the effluent due to its high toxicity thus a prior treatment to remove polyphenols or multiple dilutions are needed which implicate higher costs and complexity nevertheless composting aerobic treatment and more frequently anaerobic digestion have been explored 10 12 filtration methods such as ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are able to achieve a considerable decrease of cod but also have severe fouling problems a low flow operation and high associated costs 13 17 18 successful wastewater treatment includes but is not limited to reductions in bod and suspended solids by up to 85 reduction of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorous of over 50 and over 99 reduction of coliforms pathogenic bacteria and viruses 19 advanced oxidation processes aops are specially promising and extensively researched treatment methods for different industrial effluents they are based upon the formation of highly oxidative species more importantly hydroxyl radicals oh which can efficiently degrade a wide range of compounds different aops have been employed for omw treatment such as photocatalysis 20 21 ozonation 22 peroxone 23 the fenton process is another aop which has been the target of an increasing number of studies involving h2o2 and an iron source which are responsible for the peroxide activation at low ph 2 4 needing no energy input for these purpose and occurring at room temperature and pressure 4 22 24 the fenton process is another aop which has been the target of an increasing number of studies involving h2o2 and an iron source which are responsible for the peroxide activation eq 1 at low ph 2 4 needing no energy input for these purpose and occurring at room temperature and pressure 4 22 24 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o other reactions eqs 2 and 3 are involved in fenton s process global mechanism 2 f e 2 h o f e 3 h o 3 h 2 o 2 h o h 2 o h o 2 as said olive oil process resultant effluents are very difficult to be efficiently treated thus the use of pre treatment processes is commonly applied to enhance and facilitate the effluent degradation coagulation and flocculation are very used methods applied in different highly organic loaded effluents capable of disturb colloidal formations and promote the aggregation of small particles leading to its precipitation and consequently reducing the organic content and turbidity of the solution 25 26 it is a simple design and operation process with low energy requirement with different coagulants flocculants disponible such as aluminum and iron based compounds anionic and cationic polymers e g pdadmac paa pah and its positives results over omw have already been proven 4 11 25 the key parameters of this process are mainly the stirring velocity which has been vastly explored and the ph and coagulant flocculant loading that are intrinsically dependent of the type and characteristics of the applied chemical and its compatibility with the solution 26 27 nowadays olive mills are going to a greener operation pathway that way the olive oil extraction procedure is going towards two phase decantation due to lowest water demand the solid waste produced is then sent to refined oil extraction units where further oil is extracted through drying and solid liquid extraction processes this way although the olive mills are theoretically waste free plants at the refined oil extraction units a highly pollutant effluent is generated from the wastes leaching and during the processing this effluent ooeiw is challenging and its management is crucial to safeguard the environment to the best of our knowledge the treatment of this kind of effluent provided from refined oil extraction industry was never investigated using such approach therefore this study aims to optimize fenton s process and coagulation for the removal of the organic load of this wastewater moreover the optimized conditions were integrated in order to achieve a treatment capable to reduce the toxicity over bacteria aliivibrio fischeri as well as improving biodegradability so that further biological treatment may be implemented some studies have already been developed using similar methodologies even if using olive mill wastewaters and not effluents coming from olive oil mill wastes extraction industries however these works validate the approach proposed in this work for a novel effluent peres and lucas and peres 28 integrated the fenton process and coagulation flocculation with lime to treat a conventional omw and 99 3 of cod was removed also yazdanbakhsh et al 29 studied a combination of coagulation acid cracking and fenton like to treat omw once again through the combination of these processes its efficiency in removing phenols and cod was proven as well as in improving on the biodegradability of the effluent thus a similar approach will be evaluated in this new type of wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 effluent s characterization the effluent was collected from a refined olive oil extraction plant located in portugal this industrial unit receives wet olive mills wastes that are used for refined oil extraction with n hexane through a sequence of drying and liquid solid extraction however while the wastes are stored waiting for being processed dark color and highly charged liquid leaches besides during the wastes processing before extraction a wastewater is produced since currently no treatment approach is available these effluents are collected and stored in tanks samples were collected from the tank and stored in 25 l plastic containers to be processed in the laboratory to simplify the text the effluent will be referred as ooeiw in table 1 are present the most important parameters of the effluent namely the chemical oxygen demand cod ph total phenol concentration tph total solids ts total suspended solids tss and total volatile solids tvs 2 2 treatment procedure 2 2 1 coagulation polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac a highly charged cationic polymer was applied for effluent coagulation in a typical coagulation procedure the amount of a 0 1 pdadmac solution to achieve the established coagulant concentration was mixed to 200 ml of wastewater in a three phase process fast stirring 140 5 rpm during 3 min slow stirring 30 5 rpm during 15 min for solids agglomeration and 30 min of sedimentation being taken samples of the supernatants 27 30 different concentrations of pdadmac 5 100 mg l 1 and phs 3 11 were tested the phased coagulant additions were applied to study in order to optimize the process the phased coagulation addition was performed in two times the first one destabilizes the sample and the second one allows a better aggregation of destabilized particles this kind of addition can enhance the removal of solids from the liquid phase 2 2 2 fenton s reaction the fenton s process was performed in 0 5 l and 1 0 l glass reactors under continuous magnetic stirring 700 rpm to achieve a homogeneous mixture in each reaction the ooeiw was mixed with a certain amount of feso4 representing the desired iron load and the ph was adjusted to 3 through addition of h2so4 due to iron s solubility and to maintain a higher reaction rate the solution was then mixed during 5 min to assure total homogeneity and the addition of 33 w v h2o2 represented the start of the reaction the process occurred during 60 min and the raise of ph to 12 by addition of naoh was applied to quench the remaining h2o2 and stop the reaction samples were taken during reaction to further analysis both the peroxide 1 28 g l 1 and iron 0 1 3 0 g l 1 loads were investigated in this study to analyze and optimize their effects over the effluent treatment 31 33 2 3 analytical methods the ph measurements were done using a crison microph 2002 equipment the chemical oxygen demand cod was measured as a representative of the organic matter present in the samples this parameter was determined by standard method 5220d 34 samples of the fenton s reaction were measured after precipitation to avoid iron particles interference each glass vial was filled with a solution containing 1 2 ml of a digestion solution k2cr2o7 2 8 ml of acidic solution h2so4 and ag2so4 and 1 0 ml of the sample each solution was tested in duplicate and with a control using distilled water the vials were placed in eco25 velp scientifica thermoreactors for 2 h at 150 c after cooled down sample s absorbances were measured at 605 nm in a wtw photolab s6 photometer and cod values were obtained using a calibration curve prepared using potassium hydrogen phthalate within the range 100 4500 mg o2 l 1 the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was obtained by measuring the dissolved oxygen do comparing it at the start and after 5 days of incubation using microorganisms obtained from a garden soil measurements were conducted using a consort c863 multi parameter analyzer and the suspension were kept at 20 c following the standard methods 34 35 total phenol concentration tph was measured using folin ciocalteau colorimetrical method using a t60 pginstruments photometer previously described in martins and quinta ferreira 36 the final tph value is reported as mg l 1 ga eq as gallic acid s standard solutions were used to obtain the calibration curve total solids ts were obtained by drying samples at 105 c until constant weight total suspended solids were obtained by filtering a certain volume of the effluent and consequently dried at 105 c and weighted total volatile solids were calculated by calcination of the effluent s sample at 550 c these procedures were followed according to the standard method 1684 37 the coagulant and solutions zeta potentials were determined by electrophoretic light scattering using a malvern zetasizer nano zs model zen3600 malvern instruments ltd uk the luminesce inhibition of allivibrio fischeri bacteria was used to determine the ecotoxicity of samples a bacteria suspension was inoculated in the samples at 15 c in a lumistherm dr lange hach and after 15 min of incubation the luminescence was directly measured in a lumistox 300 dr lange hach and compared with a blank control consisting in nacl solution 2 with the bacteria tests were conducted in duplicate and the solutions ph were previously corrected to a 6 5 7 5 range 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation 3 1 1 ph effect pdadmac in order to lower the organic load and the high solids content of ooeiw table 1 before the fenton process several experiments were carried out first the effluent ph was changed in order to verify its influence on the sedimentation of the organic load and the potential zeta was evaluated table 2 by observing the values of the zeta potential it can be concluded that it is an anionic effluent moreover its anionic charge increases with increasing ph table 2 therefore the choice of a cationic coagulant is essential to neutralize the dielectric layer pdadmac was chosen due to its high molecular weight and its positive charge this polyelectrolyte was used by zagklis et al 38 in a previous study for the coagulation flocculation of an industrial paint wastewater with good results in the next step for the various ph studied a small amount of pdadamac 5 mg l 1 was added to evaluate its improvement in the removal of cod the results are presented in fig 2 as can be seen from the results in fig 2 the higher ph promotes greater cod removal adding the pdadmac coagulant the effect is even more noticeable in the higher ph range 9 12 achieving a further 2 reduction with the use of the coagulant this is closely linked with the increase of anionic charge of effluent with the ph increase since a great potential difference enhances the charge neutralization and the solid liquid separation 3 1 2 pdadmac load effect based on the previous results and considering the use of pdadmac an advantage in this section higher loads of pdadmac at ph 9 were studied as can be seen in fig 3 the choice of ph 9 results from the fact that higher ph s enhance the polyelectrolyte effect and it is more economically viable than the choice of ph 12 that would entail higher loads of reactants the highest percentage of cod removed is achieved with a load of 80 mg l 1 of pdadmac about 12 5 for pdadmac at concentrations higher than 80 mg l 1 the cod removal decreased instead of increasing this decrease is attributed to the polyelectrolyte itself which as an organic compound contributes to the cod contained in the samples 39 in order to decrease the coagulant load while maintaining the cod removal tests were performed with a phased addition of coagulant strategy fig 4 a maximum total load of 40 mg l 1 of pdadamac was stipulated and different combinations of coagulant addition were made looking at the results in fig 4 a combination of 20 mg l 1 plus 20 mg l 1 allows a cod reduction of 15 a value greater than 12 5 of the load in a single phase of 80 mg l 1 considering the economic variable and the percentage of cod removal the next tests will have as an ideal condition the phased addition of 20 plus 20 mg l 1 of pdadmac 3 2 fenton s process 3 2 1 fe2 effect fenton s process results from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals in the presence of iron ions the hydroxyl radicals have a high oxidizing power which allows the degradation of organic matter 40 despite being a very efficient technology in the treatment of various effluents it also has a disadvantage that must be considered that is the need for removing the dissolved iron from the treated effluent in fact the required amount of catalyst is usually much higher than the legal threshold of iron permitted for an effluent discharge to the natural water courses 41 the study of the iron and the hydrogen peroxide load is extremely important in the fenton reaction these two parameters mostly determine the efficiency of the process in terms of organic matter degradation and the associated cost therefore it is very important to optimize the iron load considering that there is enough catalyst that allows the formation of hydroxyl radicals but not using it in excess to avoid a large formation of iron sludge based on this a study of the influence of the initial concentration of iron on the final cod value was made which was determined by performing a series of experiments with iron concentrations of 0 1 3 g l 1 and maintaining the concentration of h2o2 4 g l 1 during 60 min at ph 3 fig 5 the results show that for a load of 2 5 g l 1 of iron it was managed to obtain the greatest removal of cod around 40 iron values above 2 5 g l 1 markedly worsen cod removal usually the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants increases with the increasing of fe2 concentration 42 43 up to a certain limit excessive iron not only causes serious loss of iron species and increases the operational costs but also enhances the scavenging effect of oh by fe2 44 45 which has a negative effect on the degradation of organic pollutants besides that a high load of iron can also become a secondary source of contamination for the environment 46 47 3 2 2 h2o2 effect the choice of the hydrogen peroxide charge is related to the organic charge of the effluent the greater the organic load of the effluent the greater the amount of hydrogen peroxide needed to treat this effluent however like the iron charge the hydrogen peroxide concentration also has a limit the excessive hydrogen peroxide load not only increases the operational costs but also enhances the scavenging effect of oh by h2o2 48 49 leading to a negative effect on the degradation of organic pollutants it is therefore essential to determine experimentally the appropriate hydrogen peroxide charge to treat this ooeiw fig 6 in fig 6 different loads of hydrogen peroxide were studied keeping the iron load constant 2 g l 1 at ph 3 during 60 min the choice of the 2 g l 1 iron load instead of the best 2 5 g l 1 result fig 5 had to do with the fact that this reaction is extremely exothermic and a smaller amount of iron allowed to study a wider range of hydrogen peroxide concentration without overheating the reactor as can be seen in fig 5 the increase in the charge of hydrogen peroxide allows to increase the removal of cod the scavenging effect is not being identified here this can be explained because by excessively increasing in the hydrogen peroxide charge one may no longer be destroying the organic charge of the effluent but it is certainly diluting it which allows the effect of the dilution to hide the effect scavenging with a load of 28 g l 1it was possible to degrade about 53 of the organic matter while with a load about 2 times below the percentage of cod removal was about 30 which is in accordance with the justification dilution effect and not the formation of further hydroxyl radicals in conclusion the best condition of the fenton process 2 g l 1 of iron and 4 g l 1 of h2o2 after coagulation can remove 30 of cod by itself and overall including coagulation it is possible to remove about 45 of cod considering all the results presented in fig 3 and 4 the ratio between h2o2 fe2 must be carefully analyzed in order to avoid the scavenging effect and minimize operating costs when the effect of the ratio was evaluated for similar proportions between different reagent loads the results were different for example with a load of 8 g l 1of hydrogen peroxide and 2 g l 1 of iron the removal of cod is 33 5 while for a load of 4 g l 1of hydrogen peroxide and 1 g l 1of iron the removal of cod corresponds to about 18 although the ratio h2o2 fe2 is in both cases 2 this means that more than the ratio the amount of reagent used is important since it is an effluent with a very high organic load and more aggressive operating conditions higher reactants loads are required for achieving interesting organic matter removals 3 3 effect of fenton s process on the treated effluents biodegradability toxicity 3 3 1 biodegradability bod5 cod the combination of coagulation and the fenton process does not allow leading to a treated effluent with the characteristics to be discharged into water courses however it may be enough to achieve such biodegradability to be referred for a further biological treatment this integration would allow reducing the treatment costs since the biological processes are conventional wastewater treatments the direct application of activated sludges is impossible for the management of such wastewater due to its biorefractory nature the biodegradability of the treated effluent was evaluated considering the bod5 cod ratio being considered an easily biodegradable effluent when the value is equal to or greater than 40 50 the initial effluents are not biodegradable as seen by the low bod5 cod fig 7 shows the main characteristics of the treated solutions for the best operational conditions the initial effliuent ooeiw has a very low biodegradability impossible to be treated by the conventional wastewater treatment plants clearly biodegradability increased with the application of integrated coagulation and fenton processes however only in the conditions of 4 g l 1 of h2o2 and 2 g l 1 of fe2 was possible to reach a ratio higher than 40 which indicates a treated effluent fully biodegradable as can be seen fixing the hydrogen peroxide the biodegradability increases with the iron load since more hydroxyl radical will be generated promoting the decrease of refractory compounds content leading to the formation of more biodegradable substances 3 3 2 toxicity assessment over bacteria a fischeri toxicity was assessed based on the luminescence inhibition using bacteria a fischeri this bacterium was chosen because it is one of the most indicated in the literature for preliminary toxicity tests due to the resistance under adverse conditions 51 in fig 8 can be found the results of luminescence inhibition for the initial effluent for the effluent after coagulation process and for the treated effluent after coagulation and fenton s process 4 g l h2o2 and 2 g l fe2 as can be seen from the results of fig 8 the initial effluent leads to 100 inhibition of luminescence the same result is obtained for the effluent after the coagulation process it can then be concluded that in terms of luminescence inhibition the coagulation process has no benefit this is related with the toxicity of the compounds present in the effluent that cannot be removed by the separation processes however when the fenton process is applied the luminescence inhibition decreases to 87 toxicity results from the balance between the eliminated compounds and those generated by oxidation in the fenton process in some studies with synthetic effluent it appears that the toxicity of the effluent after the fenton process is superior to the toxicity of the initial effluent 32 52 this means that for this real effluent the compounds eliminated are more toxic than the by products generated probably to decrease significantly the toxicity regarding to a fischeri it will be needed to strongly increase the oxidant amount 4 however it will represent a highly impact in terms of treatment cost 3 3 3 fenton s process costs the impact of the treatments applied in terms of operation costs is important to evaluate since it can dictate the process feasibility the conventional wastewater treatments usually based on activated sludges are considered as low cost however the low biodegradability of this effluent does not allow its direct application the use of advanced oxidation processes such as fenton s reagent is required these approaches are more expensive due to the reactant s requirements on this way it is important to establish an equilibrium between operation costs and treatment efficiency in fact for the future it is possible to considered that the treatment efficiency will be more important than the operation costs due to the legal impositions for a proper wastewater management therefore to establish a provisional estimative of costs for treating this effluent the fenton s process operation costs were evaluated the main cost in the fenton s process relates to the cost of the reagents both for

13671,the treatment of olive mill wastewater is a problem that still does not have an effective solution in order to minimize this problem there has been an improvement in the olive oil production process moving from three phase processes in oil mills to two phase processes and integrating the later with the oil extraction industry with n hexane this improvement does not totally solve the olive mill wastewater problem on its own it only releases the olive mills from the environmental burden and concentrates the problem in the oil extraction industry in this study it was proposed a treatment of a real effluent from an olive oil extraction industry using the fenton s process integrated with coagulation different coagulant loads were studied to achieve the best conditions for this process for the fenton s process the loads of iron and hydrogen peroxide were optimized the main evaluation parameters present in this study were chemical oxygen demand cod biodegradability and toxicity regarding the toxicity of the treated effluent tests were performed on aliivibrio fischeri the studied effluent has a dark color with an organic load of about 50 g l 1 of cod and high toxicity with 9 of biodegradability coagulation process was studied with a single addition of coagulant 80 mg l 1 leading to 12 5 cod removal while the combination of 20 mg l 1 plus 20 mg l 1 allows a cod reduction of 15 with the best conditions for coagulation double phased addition of a total of 40 g l 1 of coagulant integrated with the fenton reaction 4 g l 1 of hydrogen peroxide 2 g l 1 of iron ii at ph 3 with 60 min of reaction was possible to achieve about 45 of cod removal this allowed to increase the biodegradability to a ratio higher than 40 for further biological treatment application to definitively treat the effluent keywords olive oil extraction industry wastewater fenton s process coagulation toxicity assessment biodegradability 1 introduction the olive oil production represents a very important and constantly growing economic sector for the mediterranean basin being the eu responsible for 64 of the worldwide production 1 the optimum climate conditions and centuries of knowledge led to spain italy greece and portugal covering for 99 of the eu production representing around 2 0 million tons a year 1 2 there are three main olive oil production processes press two phase and three phase separation the pressing process is the most traditional being substituted by the other methods due to the lower production efficiency and great labor costs 3 the two phase and three phase as can be seen in fig 1 continuous methods are then the most common with a nowadays tendency of countries to update its facilities to a two phase process due to the huge volumes of hot water added in the centrifugation decantation step of the three phase process up to 6 m3 per ton of olive oil produced 4 3 from the two phase method a solid waste with around 60 of moisture is formed which can be further used in a drying extraction process for recuperation of the remaining olive oil forming a new olive oil extraction industry wastewater ooeiw despite the improvement towards water usage the problematic involving the olive mill wastewater omw is yet not totally solved and a fully characterization and study of the treatment of this new effluent are still not available 5 the omws are complex effluents with great variability associated with the different characteristics of the olive cultivation and processing but overall is slightly acid ph 5 and have a high organic and phenolic content 6 the phenolic substances are natural antioxidants with high added value but at the same time have a high antibacterial activity and phytotoxicity which hinder the application of omws as soil amendment for agricultural purposes 7 9 different technologies have been applied for the treatment of the traditional omw focusing mostly on the removal of the phenolic compounds and cod and the increase of its biodegradability biological processes are not usually applied directly to the effluent due to its high toxicity thus a prior treatment to remove polyphenols or multiple dilutions are needed which implicate higher costs and complexity nevertheless composting aerobic treatment and more frequently anaerobic digestion have been explored 10 12 filtration methods such as ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are able to achieve a considerable decrease of cod but also have severe fouling problems a low flow operation and high associated costs 13 17 18 successful wastewater treatment includes but is not limited to reductions in bod and suspended solids by up to 85 reduction of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorous of over 50 and over 99 reduction of coliforms pathogenic bacteria and viruses 19 advanced oxidation processes aops are specially promising and extensively researched treatment methods for different industrial effluents they are based upon the formation of highly oxidative species more importantly hydroxyl radicals oh which can efficiently degrade a wide range of compounds different aops have been employed for omw treatment such as photocatalysis 20 21 ozonation 22 peroxone 23 the fenton process is another aop which has been the target of an increasing number of studies involving h2o2 and an iron source which are responsible for the peroxide activation at low ph 2 4 needing no energy input for these purpose and occurring at room temperature and pressure 4 22 24 the fenton process is another aop which has been the target of an increasing number of studies involving h2o2 and an iron source which are responsible for the peroxide activation eq 1 at low ph 2 4 needing no energy input for these purpose and occurring at room temperature and pressure 4 22 24 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o other reactions eqs 2 and 3 are involved in fenton s process global mechanism 2 f e 2 h o f e 3 h o 3 h 2 o 2 h o h 2 o h o 2 as said olive oil process resultant effluents are very difficult to be efficiently treated thus the use of pre treatment processes is commonly applied to enhance and facilitate the effluent degradation coagulation and flocculation are very used methods applied in different highly organic loaded effluents capable of disturb colloidal formations and promote the aggregation of small particles leading to its precipitation and consequently reducing the organic content and turbidity of the solution 25 26 it is a simple design and operation process with low energy requirement with different coagulants flocculants disponible such as aluminum and iron based compounds anionic and cationic polymers e g pdadmac paa pah and its positives results over omw have already been proven 4 11 25 the key parameters of this process are mainly the stirring velocity which has been vastly explored and the ph and coagulant flocculant loading that are intrinsically dependent of the type and characteristics of the applied chemical and its compatibility with the solution 26 27 nowadays olive mills are going to a greener operation pathway that way the olive oil extraction procedure is going towards two phase decantation due to lowest water demand the solid waste produced is then sent to refined oil extraction units where further oil is extracted through drying and solid liquid extraction processes this way although the olive mills are theoretically waste free plants at the refined oil extraction units a highly pollutant effluent is generated from the wastes leaching and during the processing this effluent ooeiw is challenging and its management is crucial to safeguard the environment to the best of our knowledge the treatment of this kind of effluent provided from refined oil extraction industry was never investigated using such approach therefore this study aims to optimize fenton s process and coagulation for the removal of the organic load of this wastewater moreover the optimized conditions were integrated in order to achieve a treatment capable to reduce the toxicity over bacteria aliivibrio fischeri as well as improving biodegradability so that further biological treatment may be implemented some studies have already been developed using similar methodologies even if using olive mill wastewaters and not effluents coming from olive oil mill wastes extraction industries however these works validate the approach proposed in this work for a novel effluent peres and lucas and peres 28 integrated the fenton process and coagulation flocculation with lime to treat a conventional omw and 99 3 of cod was removed also yazdanbakhsh et al 29 studied a combination of coagulation acid cracking and fenton like to treat omw once again through the combination of these processes its efficiency in removing phenols and cod was proven as well as in improving on the biodegradability of the effluent thus a similar approach will be evaluated in this new type of wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 effluent s characterization the effluent was collected from a refined olive oil extraction plant located in portugal this industrial unit receives wet olive mills wastes that are used for refined oil extraction with n hexane through a sequence of drying and liquid solid extraction however while the wastes are stored waiting for being processed dark color and highly charged liquid leaches besides during the wastes processing before extraction a wastewater is produced since currently no treatment approach is available these effluents are collected and stored in tanks samples were collected from the tank and stored in 25 l plastic containers to be processed in the laboratory to simplify the text the effluent will be referred as ooeiw in table 1 are present the most important parameters of the effluent namely the chemical oxygen demand cod ph total phenol concentration tph total solids ts total suspended solids tss and total volatile solids tvs 2 2 treatment procedure 2 2 1 coagulation polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac a highly charged cationic polymer was applied for effluent coagulation in a typical coagulation procedure the amount of a 0 1 pdadmac solution to achieve the established coagulant concentration was mixed to 200 ml of wastewater in a three phase process fast stirring 140 5 rpm during 3 min slow stirring 30 5 rpm during 15 min for solids agglomeration and 30 min of sedimentation being taken samples of the supernatants 27 30 different concentrations of pdadmac 5 100 mg l 1 and phs 3 11 were tested the phased coagulant additions were applied to study in order to optimize the process the phased coagulation addition was performed in two times the first one destabilizes the sample and the second one allows a better aggregation of destabilized particles this kind of addition can enhance the removal of solids from the liquid phase 2 2 2 fenton s reaction the fenton s process was performed in 0 5 l and 1 0 l glass reactors under continuous magnetic stirring 700 rpm to achieve a homogeneous mixture in each reaction the ooeiw was mixed with a certain amount of feso4 representing the desired iron load and the ph was adjusted to 3 through addition of h2so4 due to iron s solubility and to maintain a higher reaction rate the solution was then mixed during 5 min to assure total homogeneity and the addition of 33 w v h2o2 represented the start of the reaction the process occurred during 60 min and the raise of ph to 12 by addition of naoh was applied to quench the remaining h2o2 and stop the reaction samples were taken during reaction to further analysis both the peroxide 1 28 g l 1 and iron 0 1 3 0 g l 1 loads were investigated in this study to analyze and optimize their effects over the effluent treatment 31 33 2 3 analytical methods the ph measurements were done using a crison microph 2002 equipment the chemical oxygen demand cod was measured as a representative of the organic matter present in the samples this parameter was determined by standard method 5220d 34 samples of the fenton s reaction were measured after precipitation to avoid iron particles interference each glass vial was filled with a solution containing 1 2 ml of a digestion solution k2cr2o7 2 8 ml of acidic solution h2so4 and ag2so4 and 1 0 ml of the sample each solution was tested in duplicate and with a control using distilled water the vials were placed in eco25 velp scientifica thermoreactors for 2 h at 150 c after cooled down sample s absorbances were measured at 605 nm in a wtw photolab s6 photometer and cod values were obtained using a calibration curve prepared using potassium hydrogen phthalate within the range 100 4500 mg o2 l 1 the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was obtained by measuring the dissolved oxygen do comparing it at the start and after 5 days of incubation using microorganisms obtained from a garden soil measurements were conducted using a consort c863 multi parameter analyzer and the suspension were kept at 20 c following the standard methods 34 35 total phenol concentration tph was measured using folin ciocalteau colorimetrical method using a t60 pginstruments photometer previously described in martins and quinta ferreira 36 the final tph value is reported as mg l 1 ga eq as gallic acid s standard solutions were used to obtain the calibration curve total solids ts were obtained by drying samples at 105 c until constant weight total suspended solids were obtained by filtering a certain volume of the effluent and consequently dried at 105 c and weighted total volatile solids were calculated by calcination of the effluent s sample at 550 c these procedures were followed according to the standard method 1684 37 the coagulant and solutions zeta potentials were determined by electrophoretic light scattering using a malvern zetasizer nano zs model zen3600 malvern instruments ltd uk the luminesce inhibition of allivibrio fischeri bacteria was used to determine the ecotoxicity of samples a bacteria suspension was inoculated in the samples at 15 c in a lumistherm dr lange hach and after 15 min of incubation the luminescence was directly measured in a lumistox 300 dr lange hach and compared with a blank control consisting in nacl solution 2 with the bacteria tests were conducted in duplicate and the solutions ph were previously corrected to a 6 5 7 5 range 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation 3 1 1 ph effect pdadmac in order to lower the organic load and the high solids content of ooeiw table 1 before the fenton process several experiments were carried out first the effluent ph was changed in order to verify its influence on the sedimentation of the organic load and the potential zeta was evaluated table 2 by observing the values of the zeta potential it can be concluded that it is an anionic effluent moreover its anionic charge increases with increasing ph table 2 therefore the choice of a cationic coagulant is essential to neutralize the dielectric layer pdadmac was chosen due to its high molecular weight and its positive charge this polyelectrolyte was used by zagklis et al 38 in a previous study for the coagulation flocculation of an industrial paint wastewater with good results in the next step for the various ph studied a small amount of pdadamac 5 mg l 1 was added to evaluate its improvement in the removal of cod the results are presented in fig 2 as can be seen from the results in fig 2 the higher ph promotes greater cod removal adding the pdadmac coagulant the effect is even more noticeable in the higher ph range 9 12 achieving a further 2 reduction with the use of the coagulant this is closely linked with the increase of anionic charge of effluent with the ph increase since a great potential difference enhances the charge neutralization and the solid liquid separation 3 1 2 pdadmac load effect based on the previous results and considering the use of pdadmac an advantage in this section higher loads of pdadmac at ph 9 were studied as can be seen in fig 3 the choice of ph 9 results from the fact that higher ph s enhance the polyelectrolyte effect and it is more economically viable than the choice of ph 12 that would entail higher loads of reactants the highest percentage of cod removed is achieved with a load of 80 mg l 1 of pdadmac about 12 5 for pdadmac at concentrations higher than 80 mg l 1 the cod removal decreased instead of increasing this decrease is attributed to the polyelectrolyte itself which as an organic compound contributes to the cod contained in the samples 39 in order to decrease the coagulant load while maintaining the cod removal tests were performed with a phased addition of coagulant strategy fig 4 a maximum total load of 40 mg l 1 of pdadamac was stipulated and different combinations of coagulant addition were made looking at the results in fig 4 a combination of 20 mg l 1 plus 20 mg l 1 allows a cod reduction of 15 a value greater than 12 5 of the load in a single phase of 80 mg l 1 considering the economic variable and the percentage of cod removal the next tests will have as an ideal condition the phased addition of 20 plus 20 mg l 1 of pdadmac 3 2 fenton s process 3 2 1 fe2 effect fenton s process results from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals in the presence of iron ions the hydroxyl radicals have a high oxidizing power which allows the degradation of organic matter 40 despite being a very efficient technology in the treatment of various effluents it also has a disadvantage that must be considered that is the need for removing the dissolved iron from the treated effluent in fact the required amount of catalyst is usually much higher than the legal threshold of iron permitted for an effluent discharge to the natural water courses 41 the study of the iron and the hydrogen peroxide load is extremely important in the fenton reaction these two parameters mostly determine the efficiency of the process in terms of organic matter degradation and the associated cost therefore it is very important to optimize the iron load considering that there is enough catalyst that allows the formation of hydroxyl radicals but not using it in excess to avoid a large formation of iron sludge based on this a study of the influence of the initial concentration of iron on the final cod value was made which was determined by performing a series of experiments with iron concentrations of 0 1 3 g l 1 and maintaining the concentration of h2o2 4 g l 1 during 60 min at ph 3 fig 5 the results show that for a load of 2 5 g l 1 of iron it was managed to obtain the greatest removal of cod around 40 iron values above 2 5 g l 1 markedly worsen cod removal usually the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants increases with the increasing of fe2 concentration 42 43 up to a certain limit excessive iron not only causes serious loss of iron species and increases the operational costs but also enhances the scavenging effect of oh by fe2 44 45 which has a negative effect on the degradation of organic pollutants besides that a high load of iron can also become a secondary source of contamination for the environment 46 47 3 2 2 h2o2 effect the choice of the hydrogen peroxide charge is related to the organic charge of the effluent the greater the organic load of the effluent the greater the amount of hydrogen peroxide needed to treat this effluent however like the iron charge the hydrogen peroxide concentration also has a limit the excessive hydrogen peroxide load not only increases the operational costs but also enhances the scavenging effect of oh by h2o2 48 49 leading to a negative effect on the degradation of organic pollutants it is therefore essential to determine experimentally the appropriate hydrogen peroxide charge to treat this ooeiw fig 6 in fig 6 different loads of hydrogen peroxide were studied keeping the iron load constant 2 g l 1 at ph 3 during 60 min the choice of the 2 g l 1 iron load instead of the best 2 5 g l 1 result fig 5 had to do with the fact that this reaction is extremely exothermic and a smaller amount of iron allowed to study a wider range of hydrogen peroxide concentration without overheating the reactor as can be seen in fig 5 the increase in the charge of hydrogen peroxide allows to increase the removal of cod the scavenging effect is not being identified here this can be explained because by excessively increasing in the hydrogen peroxide charge one may no longer be destroying the organic charge of the effluent but it is certainly diluting it which allows the effect of the dilution to hide the effect scavenging with a load of 28 g l 1it was possible to degrade about 53 of the organic matter while with a load about 2 times below the percentage of cod removal was about 30 which is in accordance with the justification dilution effect and not the formation of further hydroxyl radicals in conclusion the best condition of the fenton process 2 g l 1 of iron and 4 g l 1 of h2o2 after coagulation can remove 30 of cod by itself and overall including coagulation it is possible to remove about 45 of cod considering all the results presented in fig 3 and 4 the ratio between h2o2 fe2 must be carefully analyzed in order to avoid the scavenging effect and minimize operating costs when the effect of the ratio was evaluated for similar proportions between different reagent loads the results were different for example with a load of 8 g l 1of hydrogen peroxide and 2 g l 1 of iron the removal of cod is 33 5 while for a load of 4 g l 1of hydrogen peroxide and 1 g l 1of iron the removal of cod corresponds to about 18 although the ratio h2o2 fe2 is in both cases 2 this means that more than the ratio the amount of reagent used is important since it is an effluent with a very high organic load and more aggressive operating conditions higher reactants loads are required for achieving interesting organic matter removals 3 3 effect of fenton s process on the treated effluents biodegradability toxicity 3 3 1 biodegradability bod5 cod the combination of coagulation and the fenton process does not allow leading to a treated effluent with the characteristics to be discharged into water courses however it may be enough to achieve such biodegradability to be referred for a further biological treatment this integration would allow reducing the treatment costs since the biological processes are conventional wastewater treatments the direct application of activated sludges is impossible for the management of such wastewater due to its biorefractory nature the biodegradability of the treated effluent was evaluated considering the bod5 cod ratio being considered an easily biodegradable effluent when the value is equal to or greater than 40 50 the initial effluents are not biodegradable as seen by the low bod5 cod fig 7 shows the main characteristics of the treated solutions for the best operational conditions the initial effliuent ooeiw has a very low biodegradability impossible to be treated by the conventional wastewater treatment plants clearly biodegradability increased with the application of integrated coagulation and fenton processes however only in the conditions of 4 g l 1 of h2o2 and 2 g l 1 of fe2 was possible to reach a ratio higher than 40 which indicates a treated effluent fully biodegradable as can be seen fixing the hydrogen peroxide the biodegradability increases with the iron load since more hydroxyl radical will be generated promoting the decrease of refractory compounds content leading to the formation of more biodegradable substances 3 3 2 toxicity assessment over bacteria a fischeri toxicity was assessed based on the luminescence inhibition using bacteria a fischeri this bacterium was chosen because it is one of the most indicated in the literature for preliminary toxicity tests due to the resistance under adverse conditions 51 in fig 8 can be found the results of luminescence inhibition for the initial effluent for the effluent after coagulation process and for the treated effluent after coagulation and fenton s process 4 g l h2o2 and 2 g l fe2 as can be seen from the results of fig 8 the initial effluent leads to 100 inhibition of luminescence the same result is obtained for the effluent after the coagulation process it can then be concluded that in terms of luminescence inhibition the coagulation process has no benefit this is related with the toxicity of the compounds present in the effluent that cannot be removed by the separation processes however when the fenton process is applied the luminescence inhibition decreases to 87 toxicity results from the balance between the eliminated compounds and those generated by oxidation in the fenton process in some studies with synthetic effluent it appears that the toxicity of the effluent after the fenton process is superior to the toxicity of the initial effluent 32 52 this means that for this real effluent the compounds eliminated are more toxic than the by products generated probably to decrease significantly the toxicity regarding to a fischeri it will be needed to strongly increase the oxidant amount 4 however it will represent a highly impact in terms of treatment cost 3 3 3 fenton s process costs the impact of the treatments applied in terms of operation costs is important to evaluate since it can dictate the process feasibility the conventional wastewater treatments usually based on activated sludges are considered as low cost however the low biodegradability of this effluent does not allow its direct application the use of advanced oxidation processes such as fenton s reagent is required these approaches are more expensive due to the reactant s requirements on this way it is important to establish an equilibrium between operation costs and treatment efficiency in fact for the future it is possible to considered that the treatment efficiency will be more important than the operation costs due to the legal impositions for a proper wastewater management therefore to establish a provisional estimative of costs for treating this effluent the fenton s process operation costs were evaluated the main cost in the fenton s process relates to the cost of the reagents both for hydrogen peroxide and for the iron catalyst table 3 shows the cost of each of the reagents to treat 1 m3 of the studied omw at the best conditions regarding cod removal 4 g l h2o2 and 2 g l fe2 the prices for hydrogen peroxide and iron source provide from the portuguese industry as can be seen the usage of the reagents on the fenton s process for wastewater treatment represents about 2 8 m 3 considering the cod removal obtained through the fenton s process this operation cost represents 0 22 kgcodremoved 1 according to amaral silva et al 53 to threat another type of olive oil production wastewater a cost of 0 62 kgcodremoved 1 was required however in that study was considered also the coagulant and ph correction agents 53 besides this the fenton s process encompasses the needs to account the removal of the sludge produced during this process that also entails management 4 conclusion ooeiw is a complicated wastewater to treat with a high organic load and high toxicity achieving

13672,in membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes understanding the interactive effect of various types of organic components on membrane fouling is crucial in order to identify effective fouling mitigation strategies in this study the effect of humic acid on alginate filtration was examined under both dead end and crossflow constant flux microfiltration conditions using low viscosity and medium viscosity alginate as model foulants the presence of humic acid 100 mg l appeared to accelerate alginate fouling under both dead end and crossflow filtration conditions following cake layer filtration mechanism dead end and a combined intermittent pore blocking and cake layer filtration mechanism crossflow respectively under the crossflow filtration condition the fouling mechanism of the alginate humic acid mixture was dependent with the permeate flux and alginate nature e g less pore blocking with more cake layer fouling were present at a higher permeate flux during filtration medium viscosity alginate humic acid mixture when intermittent relaxation was employed during crossflow filtration the presence of humic acid could alleviate medium viscosity alginate fouling this was attributed by a significant shift of irreversible fouling to reversible cake layer fouling which was readily removed by shear force during relaxation a comparison of membrane performance during intermittent filtration with periodical flushing using clean water naclo 5 and persulfate 100 mg l at 50 c indicates that high temperature clean water flushing was effective in maintaining membrane performance during filtrating alginate humic acid complex which majorly contributed to a reduction of reversible cake layer fouling keywords alginate fouling fouling mechanism fouling resistance humic acid intermittent filtration 1 introduction globally many countries and regions are facing increasing challenges associated with water scarcity and water pollution to protect sustainable environments and human health the un has addressed the sustainable development goal aiming to ensure access to water and sanitation for all by 2030 1 in recent years membrane based separation processes have been widely applied in treating nature water resources e g river water lake water seawater for producing drinking water 2 4 and various types of wastewater e g municipal and industrial wastewater for their safe discharge to environments 5 6 however membrane fouling has been recognized as a major obstacle during membrane filtration of water and wastewater leading to reduced water productivity and increased operation cost 7 this phenomenon is attributed by particles microbial cells colloids and soluble organics inorganics derived from water and wastewater treatment processes which potentially block the membrane pores or and deposit on the membrane surface 8 9 especially plenty of research work has emphasized that the soluble organics including polysaccharides proteins humic acid like substances play major roles in causing membrane fouling in various membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes 10 13 it should be noted that the individual organic contributions to membrane fouling were dissimilar in the reported studies possibly associated with different feed water characteristics operation conditions membrane properties and analytical methods due to the complicated nature of the foulants during membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes the investigation on the interactive effect of these organic components polysaccharides proteins humic acid on membrane fouling has been well performed several findings have emphasized that the complex of two or three of these organic substances could contribute more greatly to membrane fouling compared to that of individual component 14 17 this was thought to be associated with an increased attraction energy between the foulant foulant complex and the membrane surface thus accelerating membrane fouling 13 18 19 on the other hand several studies have revealed that the structure and molecular compositions of the organic matter could have significant impacts on membrane fouling such as alginate vs xanthan gum 20 different alginate blocks 19 humic acid vs fulvic acid 18 however so far the effect of individual organic property on the membrane fouling of the combined organics such as polysaccharides and humic acid has not been well investigated especially under the crossflow filtration mode generally applied in practical membrane processes it is well documented that alginate is a type of polysaccharides which is the most widely used model foulant for investigating polysaccharides fouling behaviour during membrane filtration 13 19 20 generally alginate consists of blocks of 1 4 linked β d mannuronate m and α l guluronate g residues in an arrangement of consecutive g residues consecutive m residues and alternating m and g 21 a higher content of g residues has been reported to increase alginate viscosity which could further influence the mechanical behaviours of alginate solution 21 22 on the other hand researchers have illustrated that high molecular weight of polysaccharides such as xanthan gum and pectin potentially led to severer membrane fouling due to their limited mass transfer along membrane surface 23 24 in this study two

continuously adding the feed solution i e the feed pressure was the water head and the permeate pressure was measured by a pressure gauge figure s1b shows a constant flux crossflow filtration system with a mf membrane pvdf 0 08 μm effective area of 14 5 cm2 the feed was introduced into the filtration cell from a beaker via a gear pump longer china leading to a constant crossflow velocity at 0 1 m s along the membrane the permeate was obtained by a peristatic pump longer china and different permeate fluxes were achieved by regulating the pump flowrate both permeate and retentate solutions were returned to the beaker in order to ensure a fair comparison under different operation conditions the feed pressure and permeate pressure were measured by pressure gauges respectively in both systems the transmembrane pressure tmp was calculated based on the difference between the feed pressure and permeate pressure before filtration experiments the membranes were cleaned by 0 5 of naclo solution and soaked in the clean water for use the clean water filtration test was performed for 10 min before experiment in which the averaged tmp was calculated as tmpm 2 3 cleaning protocols during

illustrate membrane fouling mechanisms the time dependent tmp data indicated by δp were fitted to the four constant flux crossflow models namely complete pore blocking intermediate pore blocking model cake filtration model and standard pore blocking model table 1 the best fitted model was identified based on the minimum mean square error during constant flux crossflow filtration it is not realistic that all pores completely are blocked thus we assumed that the complete pore blocking predicts similar tmp profiles as intermediate pore blocking 26 2 5 fouling resistance analysis at the end of

alginate humic acid under dead end mode in order to examine the effect of humic acid on alginate fouling the alginate solutions at different concentrations 10 20 50 80 100 mg l with without 100 mg l of humic acid were prepared the dead end membrane filtration of these solutions was performed at a constant flux of 20 lmh for 30 min and the tmp profiles vs filtration time were plotted in figure s2 shown in the figure s2 a and b filtration of alginate solution alone at a lower concentration 10 and 20 mg l did not cause tmp increase during 30 min filtration period while the tmp profile followed an almost linear increase trend with filtration of low viscosity alginate at 50 100 mg l or medium viscosity solution at 50 80 mg l and a two stage pattern i e faster linear increase followed by slower linear increase for the medium viscosity solution at 100 mg l the plots of tmp vs time during filtrating the combined alginate humic acid solution also can be divided into two stages at all the tested alginate concentrations figure s2 c and d in terms of constant flux dead end filtration model a liner tmp increase was associated with cake filtration mechanism 28 this indicated that under constant flux dead end filtration mode alginate alone or combined alginate humic acid potentially formed cake layers on the mf membrane which majorly contributed to membrane fouling the initial membrane foulant interaction may be stronger than the subsequent foulant foulant interaction leading to a faster cake layer development it has been well documented that the membrane fouling mechanisms of constant pressure dead end microfiltration of alginate alone or humic acid alone followed pore blocking or combined pore blocking and cake filtration 20 29 30 it is believed that the alginate sodium generally range from 32 400 kda 21 and humic acid majorly from 50 1000 kda 31 that were smaller than the mf membrane pore size could easily block membrane pores especially under the high pressure levels 35 100 kpa in the reported studies 20 29 30 in this study under constant flux filtration the dominant cake layer fouling was identified such dissimilar findings may be associated with 1 the maximum tmp level under the constant flux filtration was below 15 kpa i e less hydraulic driving force 2 the presence of a small quantity of divalent ions in the clean water matrix ca2 5 5 mg l mg2 1 7 mg l 25 may facilitate to form greater sized alginate aggregates via linking the straight chain alginate molecules with divalent ions 30 32 and also may promote to form larger humic acid aggregates by increasing the electrostatic shielding and directly linking with divalent ions 3 the alginate aggregate network could capture the smaller sized humic acid 33 accordingly under a lower driving force under constant flux condition the greater sized alginate aggregates or alginate humic acid aggregates tended to deposit on the membrane surface leading to predominant cake layer fouling furthermore the averaged membrane fouling rate dtmp dt was calculated based on the tmp data in figure s2 and presented in fig 1 with increasing alginate concentration the membrane fouling rate almost linearly increased regardless of alginate viscosity and the presence absence of humic acid the similar finding was also reported previously in constant pressure dead end microfiltration systems 24 34 clearly the alginate with higher viscosity led to much severer membrane fouling especially when the alginate concentration was above 20 mg l the fouling rate of the combined alginate humic acid was higher than that under the situation of alginate alone at the tested five concentration levels it is noted that under such filtration condition 100 mg l of humic acid had negligible membrane fouling figure s2c thus combined alginate and humic acid solution had a higher fouling propensity than the sum of individual alginate fouling and individual humic acid fouling highlighting that the existence of humic acid 100 mg l in the alginate solution could aggravate membrane fouling under dead end filtration mode it has been reported that the alginate aggregate network could capture the humic acid 33 thus possibly the formed alginate humic acid aggregates may have denser structure compared to alginate aggregates leading to higher fouling resistance 3 2 microfiltration of alginate humic acid under crossflow mode 3 2 1 membrane fouling mechanism the effect of humic acid on the alginate filtration in a constant flux crossflow filtration system figure s1b was further examined a series of crossflow filtration experiments with alginate solution 100 mg l in the presence and absence of humic acid 100 mg l were performed at different permeate fluxes 20 65 lmh and the tmp profiles were presented in fig 2 for the low viscosity alginate solution fig 2a and c the tmp increased slowly with time at permeate fluxes of 20 40 lmh and jumped rapidly at permeate fluxes above 40 lmh i e the transit flux at 40 lmh for the medium viscosity alginate solution fig 2b and d the permeate flux of 30 lmh was determined as the transit flux below which tmp raised gradually with time and above which tmp increased sharply with time apparently the presence of humic acid in both types of alginate solutions did not influence the respective transit flux level it was observed that with extending the filtration time the tmp increased initially followed by a plateau pattern under the fluxes of 20 lmh all the test solutions and 30 lmh low viscosity alginate with without humic acid as illustrated by the developed model in a constant flux crossflow filtration system table 1 such tmp development profile was dominantly attributed by intermediate pore blocking fouling mechanism 26 at permeate fluxes of 40 65 lmh during filtration of low viscosity alginate and 30 40 lmh during filtration of medium viscosity alginate both with without humic acid the tmp experienced a fast jump and then a gradual rise which matched to the predicted combined intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration model table 1 while for the medium viscosity alginate with without humic acid the cake filtration mechanism was dominant when the permeate fluxes was above 50 lmh 26 not surprisingly at a lower permeate flux the crossflow shear force readily conquered the drag force accordingly less formation of cake layers on the membrane surface thus the tmp development was attributed by membrane pore blocking 35 once the permeate flux reached at a certain level the smaller sized foulants appeared to be accumulated on the membrane surface due to greater drag force which in turn could limit the following membrane pore blocking 36 accordingly based on the tmp data in fig 2 and equations in table 1 the intermediate pore blocking constant ki indicating pore blocking potential and cake filtration constant kc indicating cake layer development potential were calculated and presented in fig 3 a and b respectively clearly with elevating permeate flux the intermediate pore blocking constant ki displayed an initial increase pattern followed by a decreased trend while cake filtration constant kc increased slowly and then jumped dramatically in addition the higher cake filtration constant kc was occurred during filtration of medium viscosity alginate compared to that with low viscosity alginate these findings revealed that increasing permeate flux and alginate viscosity could alleviate pore blocking but greatly contribute to cake layer formation furthermore the presence of humic acid in the low viscosity alginate solution could cause slightly more pore blocking and less cake build up compared to the low viscosity alginate alone especially with increasing permeate flux compared to the medium viscosity alginate alone the mixture of medium viscosity alginate with humic acid 1 tended to accelerate pore blocking and retard cake layer fouling at lower fluxes 20 40 lmh 2 had increased cake filtration tendency at higher fluxes 50 65 lmh nevertheless the presence of humic acid in the alginate solution could contribute to develop more membrane fouling under a constant flux crossflow filtration system in consistent with the observation in the constant flux dead end filtration system section 3 1 3 2 2 membrane performance under intermittent filtration in membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes intermittent filtration is generally employed as a membrane fouling control approach accordingly in this study the effect of humic acid on alginate microfiltration under intermittent crossflow filtration mode was examined at a constant flux of 40 lmh above this flux the significant tmp evolution with time was noticed for all the four test solution fig 2 such a higher flux was selected in order to simulate membrane fouling during long term operation fig 4 presents the tmp development profiles with filtration time under different filtration relaxation intervals it is noted that for the medium viscosity alginate 60 min filtration was performed to ensure the tmp level below 20 kpa this is because when tmp was above 20 kpa the constant flux could not be maintained due to limited suction force of the permeate pump i e the increasing fouling resistance caused decreasing permeate flux instead of increasing tmp for both low viscosity alginate alone and mixture of low viscosity alginate with humic acid the tmp levels could be restored during relaxation under different filtration relaxation intervals after 120 min filtration the final tmp levels during filtering the mixture of low viscosity alginate with humic acid approached to 4 6 7 4 kpa which was insignificantly higher than those of low viscosity alginate alone 3 5 5 5 kpa p 0 05 while for the medium viscosity alginate the tmp levels could not return to the initial levels when a shorter relaxation duration 1 min or 2 min was employed at the end of 60 min filtration the final tmp during filtration of medium viscosity alginate with humic acid reached at 11 5 21 8 kpa which was greatly lower than those of medium viscosity alginate alone 17 5 26 5 kpa p 0 05 this implies that under intermittent crossflow filtration the presence of humic acid had negligible effect on low viscosity alginate filtration and facilitated alleviating membrane fouling of medium viscosity alginate this observation was dissimilar to that during continuous crossflow filtration in the section 3 2 the presence of humic acid accelerated membrane fouling of the alginate solution at the end of intermittent filtration fig 4 the physically reversible i e cake layer and irreversible resistances were further analysed and presented in fig 5 clearly irreversible membrane fouling was predominant during filtration of alginate solution alone regardless of intermittent filtration interval averagely for the low viscosity alginate solution the irreversible and reversible fouling resistance accounted for 88 and 12 of total fouling resistance respectively for the medium viscosity alginate solution the ratio of irreversible and reversible fouling was 76 and 24 respectively this implies that medium viscosity alginate led to less pore blocking compared to low viscosity alginate which was consistent with the fouling mechanism illustrated by the constant flux crossflow filtration models fig 3 in addition compared to the alginate alone alginate humic acid had significantly higher reversible fouling p 0 02 for low viscosity alginate p 0 04 for medium viscosity alginate the presence of humic acid could significantly alleviate irreversible fouling of the medium viscosity alginate solution p 0 01 while it did not impact irreversible fouling of the low viscosity alginate solution p 0 14 nevertheless alginate humic acid complex could facilitate a shift of irreversible fouling due to intermediate pore blocking to reversible fouling due to cake layer formation with extending filtration relaxation cycles such a change of membrane fouling mechanism allowed the loosely attached cake layer being removed from the membrane by crossflow shear force during relaxation period this could explain the phenomenon that presence of humic acid did not accelerate membrane fouling of alginate solutions under intermittent crossflow filtration fig 4 furthermore more significant shift of irreversible fouling to reversible fouling was noticed during filtration of medium viscosity alginate with humic acid than that during filtration of low viscosity alginate with humic acid solution accordingly the presence of humic acid could contribute more greatly in reducing membrane fouling of medium viscosity alginate 3 2 3 membrane performance with periodical cleaning it has been well documented that heat activation of persulfate facilitated to generate both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals at ph of 9 37 38 which could mitigate membrane fouling by oxidization 39 thus to simulate long term operation after four cycle intermittent filtration of alginate humic acid mixture 50 c persulfate enhanced physical flushing 100 mg l was performed for 10 min in a comparison of that with clean water flushing or 0 5 of naclo enhanced physical flushing at 50 c the tmp profiles with operation time were recorded in fig 6 and the fouling resistance was examined at the end of experiments and presented in fig 7 as shown in fig 6a the flushing protocol had insignificant impact on tmp development during filtration of low viscosity alginate humic acid s accordingly leading to comparable final fouling resistance fig 7 with naclo enhanced flushing a slightly lower irreversible fouling 42 contribution ratio was noticed compared to that with clean water 56 and persulfate enhanced flushing 59 illustrating more effectiveness of naclo in irreversible fouling control while for the medium viscosity alginate humic acid complex the high temperature clean water flushing was more effective in terms of the tmp development profile fig 6b and final fouling resistance fig 7 compared to chemical enhanced flushing at 50 c it appears that naclo enhanced flushing facilitated to achieve a lower irreversible fouling contribution ratio than clean water and persulfate enhanced flushing especially compared to fouling distribution in one filtration cycle reversible and irreversible fouling ratio at 56 and 44 respectively fig 5 when naclo enhanced flushing was employed increasing filtration cleaning cycles caused a shift of irreversible fouling to reversible fouling we hypothesized that in the close loop crossflow filtration system the removed irreversible foulants by naclo may be further compacted to form a dense cake layer due to their smaller sized nature and higher viscosity nature leading to less effective membrane fouling mitigation further study on this issue is needed when persulfate enhanced flushing was employed in the medium viscosity alginate humic acid filtration compared to fouling distribution in one filtration cycle reversible and irreversible fouling ratio at 56 and 44 respectively less reversible fouling 34 and more irreversible fouling 66 were noticed with multi filtration cleaning cycles this suggests that the heat activated persulfate displayed a capacity in alleviating cake layer fouling this finding was also observed in a recently reported study when metal oxide activated peroxymonosulfate was employed for alginate and humic acid fouling control in a dead end pressure driven ultrafiltration system 39 however the oxidized foulants derived from the cake layer could contribute to irreversible fouling likely due to their comparable sizes to the membrane pore sizes as a result persulfate enhanced flushing was less ineffective in mitigating medium viscosity alginate humic acid fouling compared to clean water flushing and naclo enhanced flushing at 50 c future study on visualization and characterization of foulants on the membrane is therefore necessary 4 conclusions this study illustrated the effect of humic acid 100 mg l on low medium viscosity alginate filtration under various microfiltration conditions the membrane fouling mechanisms were examined by analysing filtration resistance distribution and fitting the experimental data to the reported model the conclusions are drawn as following 1 under dead end filtration condition cake layer filtration mechanism was dominant for both alginate alone and alginate humic acid complex 2 under the crossflow filtration condition both alginate filtration and alginate humic acid filtration followed a combined fouling mechanism i e initial pore blocking with subsequent cake layer fouling with increasing permeate flux the pore blocking constant increased first and dropped after reaching the maximum level while cake filtration constant gradually increased 3 the effect of intermittent filtration interval on membrane performance was insignificant regardless of alginate nature and presence absence of humic acid the presence of humic acid in the medium viscosity alginate solution could alleviate irreversible fouling and enhance reversible cake layer fouling compared to alginate alone 4 periodically high temperature 50 c clean water flushing and persulfate enhanced flushing benefited to reduced reversible fouling while naclo enhanced flushing 50 c alleviated irreversible

13672,in membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes understanding the interactive effect of various types of organic components on membrane fouling is crucial in order to identify effective fouling mitigation strategies in this study the effect of humic acid on alginate filtration was examined under both dead end and crossflow constant flux microfiltration conditions using low viscosity and medium viscosity alginate as model foulants the presence of humic acid 100 mg l appeared to accelerate alginate fouling under both dead end and crossflow filtration conditions following cake layer filtration mechanism dead end and a combined intermittent pore blocking and cake layer filtration mechanism crossflow respectively under the crossflow filtration condition the fouling mechanism of the alginate humic acid mixture was dependent with the permeate flux and alginate nature e g less pore blocking with more cake layer fouling were present at a higher permeate flux during filtration medium viscosity alginate humic acid mixture when intermittent relaxation was employed during crossflow filtration the presence of humic acid could alleviate medium viscosity alginate fouling this was attributed by a significant shift of irreversible fouling to reversible cake layer fouling which was readily removed by shear force during relaxation a comparison of membrane performance during intermittent filtration with periodical flushing using clean water naclo 5 and persulfate 100 mg l at 50 c indicates that high temperature clean water flushing was effective in maintaining membrane performance during filtrating alginate humic acid complex which majorly contributed to a reduction of reversible cake layer fouling keywords alginate fouling fouling mechanism fouling resistance humic acid intermittent filtration 1 introduction globally many countries and regions are facing increasing challenges associated with water scarcity and water pollution to protect sustainable environments and human health the un has addressed the sustainable development goal aiming to ensure access to water and sanitation for all by 2030 1 in recent years membrane based separation processes have been widely applied in treating nature water resources e g river water lake water seawater for producing drinking water 2 4 and various types of wastewater e g municipal and industrial wastewater for their safe discharge to environments 5 6 however membrane fouling has been recognized as a major obstacle during membrane filtration of water and wastewater leading to reduced water productivity and increased operation cost 7 this phenomenon is attributed by particles microbial cells colloids and soluble organics inorganics derived from water and wastewater treatment processes which potentially block the membrane pores or and deposit on the membrane surface 8 9 especially plenty of research work has emphasized that the soluble organics including polysaccharides proteins humic acid like substances play major roles in causing membrane fouling in various membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes 10 13 it should be noted that the individual organic contributions to membrane fouling were dissimilar in the reported studies possibly associated with different feed water characteristics operation conditions membrane properties and analytical methods due to the complicated nature of the foulants during membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes the investigation on the interactive effect of these organic components polysaccharides proteins humic acid on membrane fouling has been well performed several findings have emphasized that the complex of two or three of these organic substances could contribute more greatly to membrane fouling compared to that of individual component 14 17 this was thought to be associated with an increased attraction energy between the foulant foulant complex and the membrane surface thus accelerating membrane fouling 13 18 19 on the other hand several studies have revealed that the structure and molecular compositions of the organic matter could have significant impacts on membrane fouling such as alginate vs xanthan gum 20 different alginate blocks 19 humic acid vs fulvic acid 18 however so far the effect of individual organic property on the membrane fouling of the combined organics such as polysaccharides and humic acid has not been well investigated especially under the crossflow filtration mode generally applied in practical membrane processes it is well documented that alginate is a type of polysaccharides which is the most widely used model foulant for investigating polysaccharides fouling behaviour during membrane filtration 13 19 20 generally alginate consists of blocks of 1 4 linked β d mannuronate m and α l guluronate g residues in an arrangement of consecutive g residues consecutive m residues and alternating m and g 21 a higher content of g residues has been reported to increase alginate viscosity which could further influence the mechanical behaviours of alginate solution 21 22 on the other hand researchers have illustrated that high molecular weight of polysaccharides such as xanthan gum and pectin potentially led to severer membrane fouling due to their limited mass transfer along membrane surface 23 24 in this study two types of alginate low viscosity and medium viscosity and humic acid were selected as model foulants the membrane fouling behaviours of combined alginate humic acid solution were monitored under constant flux conditions in both dead end and crossflow microfiltration mf membrane filtration systems the membrane fouling mechanisms were illustrated by fitting the experimental data with the reported membrane fouling models the effects of operation conditions intermittent interval cleaning protocols on the fouling potential of combined alginate humic acid were examined it is expected that

alginate humic acid under dead end mode in order to examine the effect of humic acid on alginate fouling the alginate solutions at different concentrations 10 20 50 80 100 mg l with without 100 mg l of humic acid were prepared the dead end membrane filtration of these solutions was performed at a constant flux of 20 lmh for 30 min and the tmp profiles vs filtration time were plotted in figure s2 shown in the figure s2 a and b filtration of alginate solution alone at a lower concentration 10 and 20 mg l did not cause tmp increase during 30 min filtration period while the tmp profile followed an almost linear increase trend with filtration of low viscosity alginate at 50 100 mg l or medium viscosity solution at 50 80 mg l and a two stage pattern i e faster linear increase followed by slower linear increase for the medium viscosity solution at 100 mg l the plots of tmp vs time during filtrating the combined alginate humic acid solution also can be divided into two stages at all the tested alginate concentrations figure s2 c and d in terms of constant flux dead end filtration model a liner tmp increase was associated with cake filtration mechanism 28 this indicated that under constant flux dead end filtration mode alginate alone or combined alginate humic acid potentially formed cake layers on the mf membrane which majorly contributed to membrane fouling the initial

filtration experiments with alginate solution 100 mg l in the presence and absence of humic acid 100 mg l were performed at different permeate fluxes 20 65 lmh and the tmp profiles were presented in fig 2 for the low viscosity alginate solution fig 2a and c the tmp increased slowly with time at permeate fluxes of 20 40 lmh and jumped rapidly at permeate fluxes above 40 lmh i e the transit flux at 40 lmh for the medium viscosity alginate solution fig 2b and d the permeate flux of 30 lmh was determined as the transit flux below which tmp raised gradually with time and above which tmp increased sharply with time apparently the presence of humic acid in both types of alginate solutions did not influence the respective transit flux level it was observed that with extending the filtration time the tmp increased initially followed by a plateau pattern under the fluxes of 20 lmh all the test solutions and 30 lmh low viscosity alginate with without humic acid as illustrated by the developed model in a constant flux crossflow filtration system table 1 such tmp development profile was dominantly attributed by intermediate pore blocking fouling mechanism 26 at permeate fluxes of 40 65 lmh during filtration of low viscosity alginate and 30 40 lmh during filtration of medium viscosity alginate both with without humic acid the tmp experienced a fast jump and then a gradual rise which matched to the predicted combined intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration model table 1 while for the medium viscosity alginate with without humic acid the cake filtration mechanism was dominant when the permeate fluxes was above 50 lmh 26 not surprisingly at a lower permeate flux the crossflow shear force readily conquered the drag force accordingly less formation of cake layers on the membrane surface thus the tmp development was attributed by membrane pore blocking 35 once the permeate flux reached at a certain level the smaller sized foulants appeared to be accumulated on the membrane surface due to greater drag force which in turn could limit the following membrane pore blocking 36 accordingly based on the tmp data in fig 2 and equations in table 1 the intermediate pore blocking constant ki indicating pore blocking potential and cake filtration constant kc indicating cake layer development potential were calculated and presented in fig 3 a and b respectively clearly with elevating permeate flux the intermediate pore blocking constant ki displayed an initial increase pattern followed by a decreased trend while cake filtration constant kc increased slowly and then jumped dramatically in addition the higher cake filtration constant kc was occurred during filtration of medium viscosity alginate compared to that with low viscosity alginate these findings revealed that increasing permeate flux and alginate viscosity could alleviate pore blocking but greatly contribute to cake layer formation furthermore the presence of humic acid in the low viscosity alginate solution could cause slightly more pore blocking and less cake build up compared to the low viscosity alginate alone especially with increasing permeate flux compared to the medium viscosity alginate alone the mixture of medium viscosity alginate with humic acid 1 tended to accelerate pore blocking and retard cake layer fouling at lower fluxes 20 40 lmh 2 had increased cake filtration tendency at higher fluxes 50 65 lmh nevertheless the presence of humic acid in the alginate solution could contribute to develop more membrane fouling under a constant flux crossflow filtration system in consistent with the observation in the constant flux dead end filtration system section 3 1 3 2 2 membrane performance under intermittent filtration in membrane based water and wastewater treatment processes intermittent filtration is generally employed as a membrane fouling control approach accordingly in this study the effect of humic acid on alginate microfiltration under intermittent crossflow filtration mode was examined at a constant flux of 40 lmh above this flux the significant tmp evolution with time was noticed for all the four test solution fig 2 such a higher flux was selected in order to simulate membrane fouling during long term operation fig 4 presents the tmp development profiles with filtration time under different filtration relaxation intervals it is noted that for the medium viscosity alginate 60 min filtration was performed to ensure the tmp level below 20 kpa this is because when tmp was above 20 kpa the constant flux could not be maintained due to limited suction force of the permeate pump i e the increasing fouling resistance caused decreasing permeate flux instead of increasing tmp for both low viscosity alginate alone and mixture of low viscosity alginate with humic acid the tmp levels could be restored during relaxation under different filtration relaxation intervals after 120 min filtration the final tmp levels during filtering the mixture of low viscosity alginate with humic acid approached to 4 6 7 4 kpa which was insignificantly higher than those of low viscosity alginate alone 3 5 5 5 kpa p 0 05 while for the medium viscosity alginate the tmp levels could not return to the initial levels when a shorter relaxation duration 1 min or 2 min was employed at the end of 60 min filtration the final tmp during filtration of medium viscosity alginate with humic acid reached at 11 5 21 8 kpa which was greatly lower than those of medium viscosity alginate alone 17 5 26 5 kpa p 0 05 this implies that under intermittent crossflow filtration the presence of humic acid had negligible effect on low viscosity alginate filtration and facilitated alleviating membrane fouling of medium viscosity alginate this observation was dissimilar to that during continuous crossflow filtration in the section 3 2 the presence of humic acid accelerated membrane fouling of the alginate solution at the end of intermittent filtration fig 4 the physically reversible i e cake layer and irreversible resistances were further analysed and presented in fig 5 clearly irreversible membrane fouling was predominant during filtration of alginate solution alone regardless of intermittent filtration interval averagely for the low viscosity alginate solution the irreversible and reversible fouling resistance accounted for 88 and 12 of total fouling resistance respectively for the medium viscosity alginate solution the ratio of irreversible and reversible fouling was 76 and 24 respectively this implies that medium viscosity alginate led to less pore blocking compared to low viscosity alginate which was consistent with the fouling mechanism illustrated by the constant flux crossflow filtration models fig 3 in addition compared to the alginate alone alginate humic acid had significantly higher reversible fouling p 0 02 for low viscosity alginate p 0 04 for medium viscosity alginate the presence of humic acid could significantly alleviate irreversible fouling of the medium viscosity alginate solution p 0 01 while it did not impact irreversible fouling of the low viscosity alginate solution p 0 14 nevertheless alginate humic acid complex could facilitate a shift of irreversible fouling due to intermediate pore blocking to reversible fouling due to cake layer formation with extending filtration relaxation cycles such a change of membrane fouling mechanism allowed the loosely attached cake layer being removed from the membrane by crossflow shear force during relaxation period this could explain the phenomenon that presence of humic acid did not accelerate membrane fouling of alginate solutions under intermittent crossflow filtration fig 4 furthermore more significant shift of irreversible fouling to reversible fouling was noticed during filtration of medium viscosity alginate with humic acid than that during filtration of low viscosity alginate with humic acid solution accordingly the presence of humic acid could contribute more greatly in reducing membrane fouling of medium viscosity alginate 3 2 3 membrane performance with periodical cleaning it has been well documented that heat activation of persulfate facilitated to generate both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals at ph of 9 37 38 which could mitigate membrane fouling by oxidization 39 thus to simulate long term operation after four cycle intermittent filtration of alginate humic acid mixture 50 c persulfate enhanced physical flushing 100 mg l was performed for 10 min in a comparison of that with clean water flushing or 0 5 of naclo enhanced physical flushing at 50 c the tmp profiles with operation time were recorded in fig 6 and the fouling resistance was examined at the end of experiments and presented in fig 7 as shown in fig 6a the flushing protocol had insignificant impact on tmp development during filtration of low viscosity alginate humic acid s accordingly leading to comparable final fouling resistance fig 7 with naclo enhanced flushing a slightly lower irreversible fouling 42 contribution ratio was noticed compared to that with clean water 56 and persulfate enhanced flushing 59 illustrating more effectiveness of naclo in irreversible fouling control while for the medium viscosity alginate humic acid complex the high temperature clean water flushing was more effective in terms of the tmp development profile fig 6b and final fouling resistance fig 7 compared to chemical enhanced flushing at 50 c it appears that naclo enhanced flushing facilitated to achieve a lower irreversible fouling contribution ratio than clean water and persulfate enhanced flushing especially compared to fouling distribution in one filtration cycle reversible and irreversible fouling ratio at 56 and 44 respectively fig 5 when naclo enhanced flushing was employed increasing filtration cleaning cycles caused a shift of irreversible fouling to reversible fouling we hypothesized that in the close loop crossflow filtration system the removed irreversible foulants by naclo may be further compacted to form a dense cake layer due to their smaller sized nature and higher viscosity nature leading to less effective membrane fouling mitigation further study on this issue is needed when persulfate enhanced flushing was employed in the medium viscosity alginate humic acid filtration compared to fouling distribution in one filtration cycle reversible and irreversible fouling ratio at 56 and 44 respectively less reversible fouling 34 and more irreversible fouling 66 were noticed with multi filtration cleaning cycles this suggests that the heat activated persulfate displayed a capacity in alleviating cake layer fouling this finding was also observed in a recently reported study when metal oxide activated peroxymonosulfate was employed for alginate and humic acid fouling control in a dead end pressure driven ultrafiltration system 39 however the oxidized foulants derived from the cake layer could contribute to irreversible fouling likely due to their comparable sizes to the membrane pore sizes as a result persulfate enhanced flushing was less ineffective in mitigating medium viscosity alginate humic acid fouling compared to clean water flushing and naclo enhanced flushing at 50 c future study on visualization and characterization of foulants on the membrane is therefore necessary 4 conclusions this study illustrated the effect of humic acid 100 mg l on low medium viscosity alginate filtration under various microfiltration conditions the membrane fouling mechanisms were examined by analysing filtration resistance distribution and fitting the experimental data to the reported model the conclusions are drawn as following 1 under dead end filtration condition cake layer filtration mechanism was dominant for both alginate alone and alginate humic acid complex 2 under the crossflow filtration condition both alginate filtration and alginate humic acid filtration followed a combined fouling mechanism i e initial pore blocking with subsequent cake layer fouling with increasing permeate flux the pore blocking constant increased first and dropped after reaching the maximum level while cake filtration constant gradually increased 3 the effect of intermittent filtration interval on membrane performance was insignificant regardless of alginate nature and presence absence of humic acid the presence of humic acid in the medium viscosity alginate solution could alleviate irreversible fouling and enhance reversible cake layer fouling compared to alginate alone 4 periodically high temperature 50 c clean water flushing and persulfate enhanced flushing benefited to reduced reversible fouling while naclo enhanced flushing 50 c alleviated irreversible

13673,wastewater containing heavy metals has caused many serious problems to land and marine environments these heavy metal laden wastewaters containing organic complexing agents are the consequence of using large scale industrial applications for dissolving metals ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta is a widely used complexing agent in plating metal finishing and chemical cleaning industries however due to the dramatic increase in the solubility of metal ions edta has negative impact on heavy metals removed in wastewaters by conventional precipitation processes this study aims to find the optimal conditions of combined hybrid process of advanced oxidation and coagulation to treat metals edta containing cu ni plating wastewater from an electroplating manufacturer in vietnam the effects of ph h2o2 dose fe2 dose ozone reaction time and poly acrylic acid paa dose were investigated results indicated that the 3 stage treatment process at the optimal conditions could remove 99 7 of ni and 99 72 of cu the effluent of wastewater after the whole treatment process met the vietnamese national regulation on industrial wastewater qcvn 40 2011 btnmt for nh4 cu and ni at column a and cod at column b in short the combined advanced oxidation processes and coagulation flocculation could successfully be applied for plating wastewater treatment keywords advanced oxidation processes aops metals edta plating wastewater treatment coagulation fenton ozone 1 introduction the global water sources have been severely polluted by heavy metal ions and organic compounds which are generated daily from industrial agricultural traffic and residential activities 1 specifically heavy metal ions in wastewater produced from metal smelting electrolysis electroplating and other industrial activities cannot be degraded using microorganisms and consequently they contaminate the soil water and air many techniques adsorption photocatalyst precipitation coagulation flocculation etc have been successfully developed for removing these heavy metals from water and wastewater nevertheless the co existence of complexing agents ethylenediaminetetraacetate pesticides fertilizers detergents plasticizers pharmaceuticals oils etc make the composition of heavy metal containing wastewater more complicated 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta is a widely used complexing agent in plating metal finishing and chemical cleaning industries heavy metals can easily form stable metal complexes with varying structures and levels of toxicity 2 15 the formation of toxic metal organ ligands of metals and edta results in a difficulty in removing heavy metals from wastewater when using various conventional precipitation processes this is due to the dramatic increase in the solubility of metal ions over the last few decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed for oxidizing many organic compounds into inorganic forms amongst these studied aops the fenton process has proved its efficiency for the abatement of toxic pollutants in electroplating industrial effluents 3 alternatively hydroxyl radicals can be highly reactive not selective easily generated powerful oxidants short lived harmless and control the rate of reaction 1 in fenton reaction hydroxyl radicals generated from a mixed solution of ferrous ions and h2o2 have strong oxidizing properties which can efficiently oxidize many organic metals compounds into inorganic forms 1 16 however the sole application of fenton reaction does in fact suffer from poor oxidation efficiency due to the complexity and recalcitrant nature of the reaction byproducts 3 recently studies on improving the integrated system for better removal efficiency of potential toxic organic pollutants to meet the wastewater discharge standards have attracted much interest ozonation and its combining techniques e g o3 h2o2 o3 fe2 and o3 fe2 h2o2 have proved their effectiveness in the destruction of non biodegradable toxic contaminants through two mechanisms direct reaction e0 2 08 v and hydroxyl radical induced oxidation e0 2 80 v zhao et al 2017 therefore the combined employment of fenton and ozone based aops is indeed a potential approach for the removal of metal complexes in electroplating wastewater which achieves the advantage of complementarity fenton is more effective for de complexation while ozone is more effective for mineralization thus fenton process is applied for de complexing the edta metal complexes and decomposing of more stable organic compounds then ozone helps to degrade the remaining and weaker compounds furthermore in previous studies the target wastewater contained only a single metal zhao et al 2017 3 4 a study to investigate the removal efficiencies of multi complex of edta metals optimal conditions mechanisms of chelates degradation and intermediates of treatment process is crucial in the present work two selected target pollutants are cu and ni which are representative pollutants in electroplating effluents from an electroplating company in vietnam firstly factors affecting the fenton ozone as well as coagulation flocculation processes e g such as h2o2 dosage ph o3 dosage fe2 dosage flocculants dosage and order of reactions were investigated to ascertain the best conditions for abating of cu and ni from plating wastewater subsequently other water parameters were also analyzed including cod nh4 and no3 to evaluate treatment efficiency finally the removal mechanism of heavy metals was proposed and discussed towards a better understanding and improvement of aops

commercial paa powder anionic flocculants commercially named a400 ozone generator z 2 cuongthinh technology jsc capacity of the ozone generator 2 g per hour real plating wastewater was taken from an electroplating in bac ninh province vietnam plating wastewater was taken from a company in bac ninh province and the following quality parameters were required cu 100 301 mg l ni 44 51 mg l cod 2520 4000 no3 1 2 3 5 mg l and nh4 31 102 mg l a synthetic wastewater sample containing suitable amounts of edta cu ni and nh4 was prepared to compare the efficiency with the real electroplating wastewater 2 2 methods 2 2 1 fenton ozone reaction and coagulation process design the fenton ozone based oxidation and coagulation process experimental set up is shown in fig 1 a volume of real plating wastewater was placed into a 2 liter beaker and wastewater was treated following the 3 stage procedure 1 coagulation flocculation adjusting ph values where the suitable amounts of chemicals were added the mixture was stirred then rapidly settled and filtered 2 adjusting ph values the effluent and amounts of fe2 solution and h2o2 were put together and then stirred at 100 cycles per min for a certain time the mixture was then aerated with ozone for another specific time and 3 lastly the solution ph was adjusted and paa was supplied stirred flocs were settled and filtered the effluent was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper and concentrations of cu and ni were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometer aa6800 shimadzu at faculty of environmental sciences university of science vietnam national university hanoi other parameters such as cod nh4 no3 were measured using analytical standard methods 2 2 2 factors affecting the performance of the fenton ozone process the relevant factors include h2o2 dosage fe2 dosage fenton effluent ph o3 dosage and reaction time to assess the efficiency in removing heavy metals via the fenton ozone process the details are described below effects of h2o2 dosage were examined 1 l of real plating wastewater was placed into a 2 l reactor then 1200 mg of fe2 taken from feso4 7h2o powder was added solution ph was not adjusted subsequently different volumes of h2o2 30 solution 0 5 10 20 25 and 30 ml were added the mixtures were stirred for 10 min then ozonation occurred for 40 min the effluents were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper and parameters cu ni cod nh4 no3 were measured to document the effects of fe2 dosage amounts of fe2 solution 150 250 300 500 600 700 800 900 1200 1500 1800 mg fe were put into wastewater this was followed up by using the most suitable dosage of h2o2 solution obtained from the previous experiment being added solution ph was not adjusted next the subsequent steps were carried out as per the same procedure according to the h2o2 dosage influence tests for investigating the effects of fenton solution ph on the removal efficiency of fenton ozone reaction the most suitable dosages of h2o2 fe2 solutions were prepared the fenton solution ph being adjusted to 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 subsequent steps were carried out as the same procedure as according to the h2o2 dosage influence tests effects of o3 dosage to the aops of plating wastewater were observed the most suitable conditions dosages of h2o2 fe2 ph were prepared the mixture was stirred for 10 min specific amounts of ozone dose of 40 83 125 166 208 250 833 5 mg l were aerated in the mixture for 40 min subsequent steps were carried out as the same procedure as per according to the h2o2 dosage influence tests effects of reaction time were studied in terms of the most suitable conditions such as dosages of h2o2 fe2 solution ph the mixture was stirred for various amounts of time 2 5 10 and 20 min the most suitable dose of ozone was aerated at different amounts of time 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min subsequent steps were carried out as the same procedure as done in the previous tests 2 2 3 factors affecting the coagulation flocculation process factors such as dose of fe2 and paa and ph regarding the coagulation and flocculation process were explored the details are described below for examining the effects of fe2 and paa doses to coagulation flocculation process amounts of fe2 and paa solution 0 2 0 5 0 8 1 and 2 ml were added after the fenton ozone process to implement coagulation flocculation the sizes and shapes of flocs and settling efficiencies were inspected during the experiments subsequent steps were carried out in the same way as the previous tests in section 2 2 2 effects of ph on efficiency of coagulation flocculation practices were explored various ph values 7 8 9 10 and 11 were used for the experiments the size and shapes of flocs and settling efficiencies were inspected during the experiments subsequent steps were carried out in the same way as the previous tests in section 2 2 2 2 2 4 testing the removal efficiencies with the synthesized wastewater using the fenton ozone reaction process the same procedure to treat the real plating wastewater was applied for toxicants abatement from synthesized wastewater which was prepared in section 2 1 a liter of synthetic wastewater various dosages of fe2 h2o2 fenton solution ph value o3 fe2 paa and coagulation flocculation solution ph value served to compare the removal efficiencies with the treatment of real plating wastewater 2 2 5 changes in oxidation redox potential orp during the fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes the changes in oxidation redox potential orp during the fenton ozone process were observed in order to understand the reaction and to better calculate the optimal amounts of reagents and duration of the fenton ozone process an orp hand held equipment known as hanna hi 991003 was used for observation during the test in various stages of the fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes the aops were carried out following the 3 stage processes of fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation as fig 1 at the optimal conditions achieved from sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 changes in the orp values of the mixture were monitored during the treatment process at certain times

acetonitrile and phosphoric acid v v 99 9 0 1 and b de ionized water and phosphoric acid v v 99 9 0 1 at the ratio 50 a and 50 b intermediates of the treatment process after fenton reaction and after ozone reaction were analyzed using gc ms 6890 5973i agilent equipped with column db 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm temperature program 50 hole in 5 min increased at the rate of 5 c min to 100 c hold in 1 min then increased at the rate of 10 c min to 250 c hold in 5 min the samples were prepared following the steps 1 the solution was extracted using ethyl acetate several times 5 ml each time while using na2so4 to remove water collecting the extracting solution and concentrating to near dry in a rotary evaporator at 40 c then adding 1 ml of ethyl acetate to the solution and transferring to 1 5 ml vial dried by pure nitrogen gas 2 subsequently 20 μl pyridine 400 μl dioxane and 100 μl silane reagent n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide trimethylchlorosilane mixture v v 99 1 were added to the above sample vial 3 ﬁnally the mixture was voltex shaken in 30 s and derivatized for 20 min at 60 c all samples in this study were analyzed in duplicate and mean values were presented data processing was completed with microsoft excel 2016 whereas diagramming and correlation analysis were done with origin pro 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance optimization of fenton ozone oxidation treatment 3 1 1 effects of h2o2 dosage in the fenton ozone process the effects of h2o2 dosage on the metal concentration in the effluent are illustrated in fig 2 when the dose of h2o2 rose from 1 to 20 ml l the higher dose of h2o2 resulted in better removal efficiencies from 62 63 to 99 55 for cu and 63 86 to 99 48 for ni respectively these removal efficiencies reached equilibrium at a dose of 20 ml l subsequently the rise from 20 to 25 ml l of the dose did not result in notable changes of removal performance for both cu 99 76 and ni 99 27 hence the selected dosage of h2o2 for further experiments was 20 ml l according to theoretical and practical studies the dosage of the fenton reagents is calculated with reference to the cod concentration of the influent of fenton treatment concisely the mole number of the desired h2o2 was calculated by the mole ratio of the h2o2 mole to cod mole 0 5 1 to 1 1 5 however the actual dosages of the fenton reagents not only depend on the concentrations of cod but also heavy metals and other substances the experimental results indicated that the mole number of consumed h2o2 in this study was v o l u m e m l d e n s i t y g m l p e r c e n t a g e m o l e c u l a r w e i g h t 20 1 45 30 34 100 0 256 m o l the molar ratio of h2o2 to cod in this study was 0 256 4000 1000 32 0 256 0 125 1 2 this molar ratio was higher than the research conducted on perylene pigment wastewater treatment by fenton enhanced biological processes 1 1 5 this could be explained by the fenton ozone process which is not selective thus the target pollutants of the reaction include all pollutants such as heavy metals organic matter ions and other substances 1 3 1 2 effects of fe2 addition in the fenton ozone process in the fenton reaction the molar number of required fe2 mass was calculated by the mass ratio of the mass of fe2 to the mass of h2o2 0 3 10 to 1 10 5 6 fig 3 shows the experimental results of the fe2 dosage in the fenton proces based on the dose ranging from 150 to 1200 mg l the increase in fe2 dosage led to better removal efficiency 56 8 98 39 for cu and 64 12 97 02 for ni nevertheless when the dose increased to 1500 and 1800 mg l this resulted in a slight decline in the removal efficiencies 96 13 for cu and 95 41 for ni at fe2 dose of 1800 mg l this could be explained by the redundancy of fe2 in affecting the fenton ozone process as an amount of fe2 which was added to the coagulation flocculation process it appears that a part of this amount could still have existed in the solution furthermore the exuberance of fe2 could possibly lead to chemical waste and in turn the increase in cod concentration thus the dosage of fe2 in the fenton ozone process chosen was 1200 mg l the observed best ratio of mole number of fe2 to mole number of h2o2 in this study was 1200 56 0 256 1 12 this outcome agreed with theoretical and previous studies with mole number of fe2 mole number of h2o2 in the 0 3 10 to 1 10 range 5 6 3 1 3 effects of effluent ph on the removal of heavy metals using the fenton ozone process the effects of fenton solution ph values between 2 and 11 on the removal efficiencies of heavy metals when employing the fenton ozone reaction process are described in fig 4 these outcomes illustrated that ph values have great impacts on the removal of heavy metals through the fenton ozone reaction based on the results in fig 6 optimal ph values for the removal of heavy metals were 3 and 6 both lower and higher ph values caused declines in removal efficiencies predominantly the subsequent step after fenton reaction was to combine the fenton and ozone processes after the introduction of fe2 and h2o2 many investigators claimed that the most suitable ph values for fenton oxidation were around 3 notwithstanding any objective impurities 3 7 12 on the other hand during the ozonation process the indirect reactions of hydroxyl radicals under neutral and high ph values are more efficient than the direct reactions of ozone molecules in acidic conditions 3 8 this might explain why there were two different optimal ph values for combining the fenton and ozonation processes these explanations confirmed the experimental results that treatment performance was efficient when first separating the fenton reaction and then continuing with the fenton ozone reaction the same conclusion was also achieved by zhao et al 3 for the removal of ni edta by fenton and ozone based oxidation processes 3 1 4 effects of o3 dosage the impacts of o3 dosage on the removal performance of cu and ni by fenton ozone process are depicted in fig 5 removal efficiencies of cu and ni improved from 80 3 to 98 and 67 9 to 81 respectively when the o3 dose rose from 40 to 125 mg l when the dosage of o3 increased to 166 mg l the efficiency in removing ni increased to 98 68 while removal efficiency of cu was 98 46 according to previous studies larger doses of o3 will achieve a stronger driving force for the gaseous liquid mass transfer supporting the reaction to fully proceed with h2o2 and fe2 9 10 the doses of o3 which were above 166 mg l did not lead to any significant improvement in metal abatement performance consequently the optimal dose of o3 chosen from these experiments was 166 mg l the experimental results revealed that the most suitable conditions for the fenton ozone oxidation treatment were 1200 mg l fe feso4 7h2o 20 ml l h2o2 stirring for 10 min ozone aeration ozonation in 20 min adjusted ph level 6 8 and then continuous ozone aeration ozonation in 25 min the result obtained from experiments in section 2 2 2 regarding effects of reaction time data is not shown 3 2 performance optimization of coagulation flocculation process physico chemical 1 and 2 3 2 1 effects of ph documented results regarding ph affecting the coagulation flocculation process s removal of heavy metals are presented in fig 6 solution ph has great impacts on the efficiency of the coagulation flocculation 2 process abatement efficacy of cu achieved the best values from ph 8 to above while from ph 10 to above most of the ni was removed due to the existence of both cu and ni in the real plating wastewater in this study ph 10 was chosen as the most appropriate ph value for conducting the coagulation flocculation process the reported optimal ph values for different kinds of metals were as follows ni 10 5 11 cu 8 8 2 al 11 cr 8 5 9 fe3 3 4 fe2 8 9 pb 9 10 zn 9 10 ag 12 cd 9 11 11 3 2 2 effects of fe2 dosage in the coagulation flocculation process 1 an amount of fe2 was added to the wastewater samples as coagulant to elucidate the effects of fe2 dosage on removal efficiency of heavy metals through this process various doses of fe2 were applied 500 1000 1200 and 1500 mg l the experimental results in fig 7 indicated that removal efficiencies of cu and ni 84 3 and 49 8 respectively were best reached at a dose of fe2 1200 mg l hence a dose of 1200 mg l fe2 was selected for the following experiments furthermore the progress made in removing cu proved to be more efficient than for ni this might be due to the stability constant of ni complex being of higher value than cu 3 2 3 doses of paa in the physico chemical 1 and 2 the doses of paa solution were determined by observing the formation of macro flocs during the coagulation and flocculation process experimental results indicated that the amount of paa solution for the process below is as follows coagulation and flocculation in physico chemical 1 paa 2 4 ml coagulation and flocculation in physico chemical 2 paa 3 2 ml the observation showed that treated wastewater after the coagulation and flocculation processes was much cleaner than the untreated wastewater 3 3 other water quality parameters table 1 displayed the removal efficiencies of other water quality parameters by the treatment process including coagulation flocculation fenton ozone coagulation flocculation these processes are compared to the vietnamese national technical regulations issued by the ministry of natural resources and environment qcvn 40 2011 btnmt from the results documented in table 1 coagulation and flocculation 1 can remove the following 68 cod 16 5 nh4 84 cu and 52 ni consequently the utilization of coagulation flocculation 1 in the first stage is essential for easily removing a large amount of contaminants such as free ions and unstable complexes in order to prepare for the next stage of the fenton ozone process since fenton ozone is not a selective process this kind of treatment would help to reduce the amounts of chemicals consumed 1 13 as expected the fenton ozone method is the main process employed to remove and degrade the contaminants which cannot be abated by coagulation flocculation 1 above after the fenton ozone process water quality parameters were cod 240 mg l nh4 3 06 mg l cu 8 6 mg l and ni 9 35 mg l the moderately high concentrations of cu and ni measured after the advanced oxidation process could be explained by the existence of free cu2 and ni2 or the unstable complexes of cu and ni this was demonstrated by the removal efficiencies during the coagulation flocculation 2 in order to abate all the contaminants this was done by increasing the ph and adding flocculants paa concentrations of cod nh4 no3 cu and ni after the whole treatment process were 140 2 42 1 2 0 84 and 0 15 mg l respectively in comparison to the vietnamese national technical regulations the treatment process does meet the regulation qcvn 40 2011 btnmt for nh4 cu and ni at column a and cod at column b 14 the experimental results indicated that at the first stage the increase of ph supported precipitation and coagulation flocculation processes and led to significantly reduction of metals 84 3 cu and 49 4 ni and chemical oxygen demand cod of wastewater 68 table 1 if these amounts were not removed they would have led to large consumptions of fe and h2o2 in the fenton ozone processes and a decrease in the efficiency of edta cu and edta ni chelates de complexation process therefore the 3 stage technology in this study is an acceptable solution when it comes to application of coagulation flocculation and fenton ozone processes for plating wastewater treatment 3 4 removal efficiencies using synthesized wastewater with the fenton ozone reaction process the experiments for testing the treatment process used synthesized wastewater containing na2edta cuso4 5h2o niso4 6h2o and nh4cl the initial water quality parameters of the synthesized wastewater were cod 3440 mg l nh4 150 mg l cu 300 mg l and ni 50 mg l the best conditions for real plating wastewater treatment are noted in sections 3 1 and 3 2 these were applied to treat synthesized wastewater and the outcomes are shown in table 2 surprisingly the treatment process s efficiency in removing impurities was much poorer than that of real plating wastewater treatment this could be explained by the hypothesis that during the electrolysis of the plating procedure the organic metal complexes of edta cu and edta ni the electrolysis process might weaken the stability of complexes 3 5 changes in oxidation redox potential orp and solution ph during the fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes to optimize and calculate the optimal chemicals in aops the oxidation reduction potential orp and ph values in the fenton ozone solution were determined the results are shown in table 3 which depicts that the influent wastewater for orp and ph values were 435 mv and 3 08 respectively after the coagulation flocculation process the orp value fell to 273 mv as the process removed a certain amount of oxidants in the solution meanwhile the ph value increased to 9 27 due to the ph adjustment to 10 before the coagulation flocculation process was conducted this was done to meet the optimal conditions required for the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants during the fenton ozone process chemicals fe2 and h2o2 and ozone gas were added contributing to the rise of orp values 520 mv after fenton and 516 mv after the ozone process in the oxidation process ph was adjusted to the optimal values at around 3 and 6 for the last treatment step solution ph was adjusted to ph 10 for coagulation and flocculation 2 observed consequences of orp and ph values were 27 mv and 8 88 respectively these outcomes are suitable with the aops and treated wastewater was alkaline and environmentally friendly with reference to the orp with a negative value 3 6 mechanism for degrading edta ni and edta cu in plating wastewater by fenton ozone the removal mechanisms of ni and cu from plating wastewater are proposed in fig 8 according to huang et al 4 a glycine pathway was considered the main route for the de complexation of metal edta in their study several intermediates during the process have been proposed such as ethylenediamine glycine formamide acetic acid oxalic acid formic acid co2 and h2o 4 in present study the hplc spectrums have supported the mechanisms the peaks at retention time s rt of 2 749 and 3 733 min represent edta cu and edta ni these significantly declined during the treatment process especially the intensity peak at rt 2 749 min reduced significantly in the coagulation flocculation 1 fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation 2 fig 9 the increase in peak intensity at rt 3 733 min represents the addition of organic matter to the solution the results of gc ms of intermediates in solution after fenton reaction were shown in fig 10 and appendix the intermediates in the sample after fenton reaction were detected such as n trimetylsilyl acetamine at rt 6 099 min trimethylsilyl chloroacetate at rt 6 544 min silane trimethylphenoxy at rt 10 532 12 331 and 13 732 min propanoic acid at rt 10 960 min acetic acid at rt 11 518 min benzoic acid at rt 16 646 min butanedioic acid at rt 18 504 min butanoic acid at rt 20 652 min parabanic acid at rt 21 252 min table 4 and appendix the intermediates reduced and mostly disappeared after ozone treatment process this was shown in gc ms spectrum of after ozone reaction sample was almost same as the bank spectrum of di water appendix these results demonstrated that the degradation of edta cu and edta ni by fenton ozone generate intermediates the decomposition of the organic compounds took place continuously and completely finished at the optimal conditions of fenton ozone processes these results were also agreed with the hypothesis that fenton is more effective for de complexation and ozone is more effective for mineralization firstly fenton reaction is responsible for de complexing the edta metal complexes and decomposing of more stable organic compounds such as ethylenediamine glycine formamide subsequently ozone helps to degrade the remaining and weaker compounds such as n trimetylsilyl acetamine trimethylsilyl chloroacetate silane trimethylphenoxy propanoic acid acetic acid benzoic acid butanedioic acid butanoic acid parabanic acid hence the integrated combination of fenton and ozone methods have achieved the advantage of complementarity 4 conclusion and recommendations in this study the combined fenton ozone based oxidation and coagulation process could effectively remove metals edta plating wastewater the optimal 3 stage reaction conditions for treating the real plating wastewater was applicable optimal conditions for plating wastewater treatment were found 1 coagulation and sedimentation adjusted to ph 10 1200 mg fe and 2 4 ml paa rapid sedimentation 2 fenton ozone 1200 mg fe 20 ml h2o2 stirring for 10 min ozone aeration ozonation in 20 min adjusted ph level 6 8 continuous ozone aeration ozonation in 25 min and 3 coagulation and sedimentation ph 10 3 2 ml paa rapid sedimentation this technique is highly efficient for the removal of metals in real plating wastewater rather than in the synthesized experiments these aops could treat complex metals in wastewater with different characteristics and concentrations of heavy metals in the treated effluent met the vietnam national technical regulations for discharge mechanisms of the degradation of edta metal complexes were proposed the intermediates of decomposition process of the chelates were detected by gc ms and they mostly disappeared in the after ozone reaction for further studies it is crucial to analyze the elemental and

13673,wastewater containing heavy metals has caused many serious problems to land and marine environments these heavy metal laden wastewaters containing organic complexing agents are the consequence of using large scale industrial applications for dissolving metals ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta is a widely used complexing agent in plating metal finishing and chemical cleaning industries however due to the dramatic increase in the solubility of metal ions edta has negative impact on heavy metals removed in wastewaters by conventional precipitation processes this study aims to find the optimal conditions of combined hybrid process of advanced oxidation and coagulation to treat metals edta containing cu ni plating wastewater from an electroplating manufacturer in vietnam the effects of ph h2o2 dose fe2 dose ozone reaction time and poly acrylic acid paa dose were investigated results indicated that the 3 stage treatment process at the optimal conditions could remove 99 7 of ni and 99 72 of cu the effluent of wastewater after the whole treatment process met the vietnamese national regulation on industrial wastewater qcvn 40 2011 btnmt for nh4 cu and ni at column a and cod at column b in short the combined advanced oxidation processes and coagulation flocculation could successfully be applied for plating wastewater treatment keywords advanced oxidation processes aops metals edta plating wastewater treatment coagulation fenton ozone 1 introduction the global water sources have been severely polluted by heavy metal ions and organic compounds which are generated daily from industrial agricultural traffic and residential activities 1 specifically heavy metal ions in wastewater produced from metal smelting electrolysis electroplating and other industrial activities cannot be degraded using microorganisms and consequently they contaminate the soil water and air many techniques adsorption photocatalyst precipitation coagulation flocculation etc have been successfully developed for removing these heavy metals from water and wastewater nevertheless the co existence of complexing agents ethylenediaminetetraacetate pesticides fertilizers detergents plasticizers pharmaceuticals oils etc make the composition of heavy metal containing wastewater more complicated 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta is a widely used complexing agent in plating metal finishing and chemical cleaning industries heavy metals can easily form stable metal complexes with varying structures and levels of toxicity 2 15 the formation of toxic metal organ ligands of metals and edta results in a difficulty in removing heavy metals from wastewater when using various conventional precipitation processes this is due to the dramatic increase in the solubility of metal ions over the last few decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed for oxidizing many organic compounds into inorganic forms amongst these studied aops the fenton process has proved its efficiency for the abatement of toxic pollutants in electroplating industrial effluents 3 alternatively hydroxyl radicals can be highly reactive not selective easily generated powerful oxidants short lived harmless and control the rate of reaction 1 in fenton reaction hydroxyl radicals generated from a mixed solution of ferrous ions and h2o2 have strong oxidizing properties which can efficiently oxidize many organic metals compounds into inorganic forms 1 16 however the sole application of fenton reaction does in fact suffer from poor oxidation efficiency due to the complexity and recalcitrant nature of the reaction byproducts 3 recently studies on improving the integrated system for better removal efficiency of potential toxic organic pollutants to meet the wastewater discharge standards have attracted much interest ozonation and its combining techniques e g o3 h2o2 o3 fe2 and o3 fe2 h2o2 have proved their effectiveness in the destruction of non biodegradable toxic contaminants through two mechanisms direct reaction e0 2 08 v and hydroxyl radical induced oxidation e0 2 80 v zhao et al 2017 therefore the combined employment of fenton and ozone based aops is indeed a potential approach for the removal of metal complexes in electroplating wastewater which achieves the advantage of complementarity fenton is more effective for de complexation while ozone is more effective for mineralization thus fenton process is applied for de complexing the edta metal complexes and decomposing of more stable organic compounds then ozone helps to degrade the remaining and weaker compounds furthermore in previous studies the target wastewater contained only a single metal zhao et al 2017 3 4 a study to investigate the removal efficiencies of multi complex of edta metals optimal conditions mechanisms of chelates degradation and intermediates of treatment process is crucial in the present work two selected target pollutants are cu and ni which are representative pollutants in electroplating effluents from an electroplating company in vietnam firstly factors affecting the fenton ozone as well as coagulation flocculation processes e g such as h2o2 dosage ph o3 dosage fe2 dosage flocculants dosage and order of reactions were investigated to ascertain the best conditions for abating of cu and ni from plating wastewater subsequently other water parameters were also analyzed including cod nh4 and no3 to evaluate treatment efficiency finally the removal mechanism of heavy metals was proposed and discussed towards a better understanding and improvement of aops processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the materials and chemicals used in this study include feso4 7h2o 99 h2o2 solution 30 and poly acrylic acid paa solution 0 1 solution prepared from commercial paa powder anionic flocculants commercially named a400 ozone generator z 2 cuongthinh technology jsc capacity of the ozone generator 2 g per hour real plating wastewater was taken from an electroplating in bac ninh province vietnam plating wastewater was taken from a company in bac ninh province and the following quality parameters were required cu 100 301 mg l ni 44 51 mg l cod 2520 4000 no3 1 2 3 5 mg l and nh4 31 102 mg l a synthetic wastewater sample containing suitable amounts of edta cu ni and nh4 was prepared to compare the efficiency with the real electroplating wastewater 2 2 methods 2 2 1 fenton ozone reaction and coagulation process design the fenton ozone based oxidation and coagulation process experimental set up is shown in fig 1 a volume of real plating wastewater was placed into a 2 liter beaker and wastewater was treated following the 3 stage procedure 1 coagulation flocculation adjusting ph values where the suitable amounts of chemicals were added the mixture was stirred then rapidly settled and filtered 2 adjusting ph values the effluent and amounts of fe2 solution and h2o2 were put together and then stirred at 100 cycles per min for a certain time the mixture was then aerated with ozone for another specific time and 3 lastly the solution ph was adjusted and paa was supplied stirred flocs were settled and filtered the effluent was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper and concentrations of cu and ni were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometer aa6800 shimadzu at faculty of environmental sciences university of science vietnam national university hanoi other parameters such as cod nh4 no3 were measured using analytical standard methods 2 2 2 factors affecting the performance of the fenton ozone process the relevant factors include h2o2 dosage fe2 dosage fenton effluent ph o3 dosage and reaction time to assess the efficiency in removing heavy metals via the fenton ozone process the details are described below effects of h2o2 dosage were examined 1 l of real plating wastewater was placed into a 2 l reactor then 1200 mg of fe2 taken from feso4 7h2o powder was added solution ph was not adjusted subsequently different volumes of h2o2 30 solution 0 5 10 20 25 and 30 ml were added the mixtures were stirred for 10 min then ozonation occurred for 40 min the effluents were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper and parameters cu ni cod nh4 no3 were measured to document the effects of fe2 dosage amounts of fe2 solution 150 250 300 500 600 700 800 900 1200 1500 1800 mg fe were put into wastewater this was followed up by using the most suitable dosage of h2o2 solution obtained from the previous experiment being added solution ph was not adjusted next the subsequent steps were carried out as per the same procedure according to the h2o2 dosage influence tests for investigating the effects of fenton solution ph on the removal efficiency of fenton ozone reaction the most suitable dosages of h2o2 fe2 solutions were prepared the fenton solution ph being adjusted to 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 subsequent steps were carried out as the same procedure as according to the h2o2 dosage influence tests effects of o3 dosage to the aops of plating wastewater were observed the most suitable conditions dosages of h2o2 fe2 ph were prepared the mixture was stirred for 10 min specific amounts of ozone dose of 40 83 125 166 208 250 833 5 mg l were aerated in the mixture for 40 min subsequent steps were carried out as the same procedure as per according to the h2o2 dosage influence tests effects of reaction time were studied in terms of the most suitable conditions such as dosages of h2o2 fe2 solution ph the mixture was stirred for various amounts of time 2 5 10 and 20 min the most suitable dose of ozone was aerated at different amounts of time 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min subsequent steps were carried out as the same procedure as done in the previous tests 2 2 3 factors affecting the coagulation flocculation process factors such as dose of fe2 and paa and ph regarding the coagulation and flocculation process were explored the details are described below for examining the effects of fe2 and paa doses to coagulation flocculation process amounts of fe2 and paa solution 0 2 0 5 0 8 1 and 2 ml were added after the fenton ozone process to implement coagulation flocculation the sizes and shapes of flocs and settling efficiencies were inspected during the experiments subsequent steps were carried out in the same way as the previous tests in section 2 2 2 effects of ph on efficiency of coagulation flocculation practices were explored various ph values 7 8 9 10 and 11 were used for the experiments the size and shapes of flocs and settling efficiencies were inspected during the experiments subsequent steps were carried out in the same way as the previous tests in section 2 2 2 2 2 4 testing the removal efficiencies with the synthesized wastewater using the fenton ozone reaction process the same procedure to treat the real plating wastewater was applied for toxicants abatement from synthesized wastewater which was prepared in section 2 1 a liter of synthetic wastewater various dosages of fe2 h2o2 fenton solution ph value o3 fe2 paa and coagulation flocculation solution ph value served to compare the removal efficiencies with the treatment of real plating wastewater 2 2 5 changes in oxidation redox potential orp during the fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes the changes in oxidation redox potential orp during the fenton ozone process were observed in order to understand the reaction and to better calculate the optimal amounts of reagents and duration of the fenton ozone process an orp hand held equipment known as hanna hi 991003 was used for observation during the test in various stages of the fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes the aops were carried out following the 3 stage processes of fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation as fig 1 at the optimal conditions achieved from sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 changes in the orp values of the mixture were monitored during the treatment process at certain times to include the influent wastewater after coagulation and flocculation 1 after fenton after ozone after coagulation and flocculation 2 2 2 6 analysis of heavy metals other water quality parameters oxidation reduction potential orp concentrations of cu and ni in the samples were measured using atomic absorption spectrometer aa6800 shimadzu other water quality parameters namely cod nh4 no3 were also measured following analytical standard methods tcvn 6491 1999 tcvn 6180 1996 iso 7890 3 1988 e tcvn 6179 1 1996 iso 7150 1 1984 e and using uh5300 uv vis hitachi japan oxidation reduction potential orp in the fenton ozone solution was measured using the previously mentioned hanna hi 991003 equipment treated wastewater samples at different stages of coagulation flocculation fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes were analyzed using hplc shimazu lc 20a equipped with ods c18 hplc column detector uv vis spd 20a at a wave length of 210 nm and utilized mobile phase was a acetonitrile and phosphoric acid v v 99 9 0 1 and b de ionized water and phosphoric acid v v 99 9 0 1 at the ratio 50 a and 50 b intermediates of the treatment process after fenton reaction and after ozone reaction were analyzed using gc ms 6890 5973i agilent equipped with column db 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 μm temperature program 50 hole in 5 min increased at the rate of 5 c min to 100 c hold in 1 min then increased at the rate of 10 c min to 250 c hold in 5 min the samples were prepared following the steps 1 the solution was extracted using ethyl acetate several times 5 ml each time while using na2so4 to remove water collecting the extracting solution and concentrating to near dry in a rotary evaporator at 40 c then adding 1 ml of ethyl acetate to the solution and transferring to 1 5 ml vial dried by pure nitrogen gas 2 subsequently 20 μl pyridine 400 μl dioxane and 100 μl silane reagent n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide trimethylchlorosilane mixture v v 99 1 were added to the above sample vial 3 ﬁnally the mixture was voltex shaken in 30 s and derivatized for 20 min at 60 c all samples in this study were analyzed in duplicate and mean values were presented data processing was completed with microsoft excel 2016 whereas diagramming and correlation analysis were done with origin pro 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance optimization of fenton ozone oxidation treatment 3 1 1 effects of h2o2 dosage in the fenton ozone process the effects of h2o2 dosage on the metal concentration in the effluent are illustrated in fig 2 when the dose of h2o2 rose from 1 to 20 ml l the higher dose of h2o2 resulted in better removal efficiencies from 62 63 to 99 55 for cu and 63 86 to 99 48 for ni respectively these removal efficiencies reached equilibrium at a dose of 20 ml l subsequently the rise from 20 to 25 ml l of the dose did not result in notable changes of removal performance for both cu 99 76 and ni 99 27 hence the selected dosage of h2o2 for further experiments was 20 ml l according to theoretical and practical studies the dosage of the fenton reagents is calculated with reference to the cod concentration of the influent of fenton treatment concisely the mole number of the desired h2o2 was calculated by the mole ratio of the h2o2 mole to cod mole 0 5 1 to 1 1 5 however the actual dosages of the fenton reagents not only depend on the concentrations of cod but also heavy metals and other substances the experimental results indicated that the mole number of consumed h2o2 in this study was v o l u m e m l d e n s i t y g m l p e r c e n t a g e m o l e c u l a r w e i g h t 20 1 45 30 34 100 0 256 m o l the molar ratio of h2o2 to cod in this study was 0 256 4000 1000 32 0 256 0 125 1 2 this molar ratio was higher than the research conducted on perylene pigment wastewater treatment by fenton enhanced biological processes 1 1 5 this could be explained by the fenton ozone process which is not selective thus the target pollutants of the reaction include all pollutants such as heavy metals organic matter ions and other substances 1 3 1 2 effects of fe2 addition in the fenton ozone process in the fenton reaction the molar number of required fe2 mass was calculated by the mass ratio of the mass of fe2 to the mass of h2o2 0 3 10 to 1 10 5 6 fig 3 shows the experimental results of the fe2 dosage in the fenton proces based on the dose ranging from 150 to 1200 mg l the increase in fe2 dosage led to better removal efficiency 56 8 98 39 for cu and 64 12 97 02 for ni nevertheless when the dose increased to 1500 and 1800 mg l this resulted in a slight decline in the removal efficiencies 96 13 for cu and 95 41 for ni at fe2 dose of 1800 mg l this could be explained by the redundancy of fe2 in affecting the fenton ozone process as an amount of fe2 which was added to the coagulation flocculation process it appears that a part of this amount could still have existed in the solution furthermore the exuberance of fe2 could possibly lead to chemical waste and in turn the increase in cod concentration thus the dosage of fe2 in the fenton ozone process chosen was 1200 mg l the observed best ratio of mole number of fe2 to mole number of h2o2 in this study was 1200 56 0 256 1 12 this outcome agreed with theoretical and previous studies with mole number of fe2 mole number of h2o2 in the 0 3 10 to 1 10 range 5 6 3 1 3 effects of effluent ph on the removal of heavy metals using the fenton ozone process the effects of fenton solution ph values between 2 and 11 on the removal efficiencies of heavy metals when employing the fenton ozone reaction process are described in fig 4 these outcomes illustrated that ph values have great impacts on the removal of heavy metals through the fenton ozone reaction based on the results in fig 6 optimal ph values for the removal of heavy metals were 3 and 6 both lower and higher ph values caused declines in removal efficiencies predominantly the subsequent step after fenton reaction was to combine the fenton and ozone processes after the introduction of fe2 and h2o2 many investigators claimed that the most suitable ph values for fenton oxidation were around 3 notwithstanding any objective impurities 3 7 12 on the other hand during the ozonation process the indirect reactions of hydroxyl radicals under neutral and high ph values are more efficient than the direct reactions of ozone molecules in acidic conditions 3 8 this might explain why there were two different optimal ph values for combining the fenton and ozonation processes these explanations confirmed the experimental results that treatment performance was efficient when first separating the fenton reaction and then continuing with the fenton ozone reaction the same conclusion was also achieved by zhao et al 3 for the removal of ni edta by fenton and ozone based oxidation processes 3 1 4 effects of o3 dosage the impacts of o3 dosage on the removal performance of cu and ni by fenton ozone process are depicted in fig 5 removal efficiencies of cu and ni improved from 80 3 to 98 and 67 9 to 81 respectively when the o3 dose rose from 40 to 125 mg l when the dosage of o3 increased to 166 mg l the efficiency in removing ni increased to 98 68 while removal efficiency of cu was 98 46 according to previous studies larger doses of o3 will achieve a stronger driving force for the gaseous liquid mass transfer supporting the reaction to fully proceed with h2o2 and fe2 9 10 the doses of o3 which were above 166 mg l did not lead to any significant improvement in metal abatement performance consequently the optimal dose of o3 chosen from these experiments was 166 mg l the experimental results revealed that the most suitable conditions for the fenton ozone oxidation treatment were 1200 mg l fe feso4 7h2o 20 ml l h2o2 stirring for 10 min ozone aeration ozonation in 20 min adjusted ph level 6 8 and then continuous ozone aeration ozonation in 25 min the result obtained from experiments in section 2 2 2 regarding effects of reaction time data is not shown 3 2 performance optimization of coagulation flocculation process physico chemical 1 and 2 3 2 1 effects of ph documented results regarding ph affecting the coagulation flocculation process s removal of heavy metals are presented in fig 6 solution ph has great impacts on the efficiency of the coagulation flocculation 2 process abatement efficacy of cu achieved the best values from ph 8 to above while from ph 10 to above most of the ni was removed due to the existence of both cu and ni in the real plating wastewater in this study ph 10 was chosen as the most appropriate ph value for conducting the coagulation flocculation process the reported optimal ph values for different kinds of metals were as follows ni 10 5 11 cu 8 8 2 al 11 cr 8 5 9 fe3 3 4 fe2 8 9 pb 9 10 zn 9 10 ag 12 cd 9 11 11 3 2 2 effects of fe2 dosage in the coagulation flocculation process 1 an amount of fe2 was added to the wastewater samples as coagulant to elucidate the effects of fe2 dosage on removal efficiency of heavy metals through this process various doses of fe2 were applied 500 1000 1200 and 1500 mg l the experimental results in fig 7 indicated that removal efficiencies of cu and ni 84 3 and 49 8 respectively were best reached at a dose of fe2 1200 mg l hence a dose of 1200 mg l fe2 was selected for the following experiments furthermore the progress made in removing cu proved to be more efficient than for ni this might be due to the stability constant of ni complex being of higher value than cu 3 2 3 doses of paa in the physico chemical 1 and 2 the doses of paa solution were determined by observing the formation of macro flocs during the coagulation and flocculation process experimental results indicated that the amount of paa solution for the process below is as follows coagulation and flocculation in physico chemical 1 paa 2 4 ml coagulation and flocculation in physico chemical 2 paa 3 2 ml the observation showed that treated wastewater after the coagulation and flocculation processes was much cleaner than the untreated wastewater 3 3 other water quality parameters table 1 displayed the removal efficiencies of other water quality parameters by the treatment process including coagulation flocculation fenton ozone coagulation flocculation these processes are compared to the vietnamese national technical regulations issued by the ministry of natural resources and environment qcvn 40 2011 btnmt from the results documented in table 1 coagulation and flocculation 1 can remove the following 68 cod 16 5 nh4 84 cu and 52 ni consequently the utilization of coagulation flocculation 1 in the first stage is essential for easily removing a large amount of contaminants such as free ions and unstable complexes in order to prepare for the next stage of the fenton ozone process since fenton ozone is not a selective process this kind of treatment would help to reduce the amounts of chemicals consumed 1 13 as expected the fenton ozone method is the main process employed to remove and degrade the contaminants which cannot be abated by coagulation flocculation 1 above after the fenton ozone process water quality parameters were cod 240 mg l nh4 3 06 mg l cu 8 6 mg l and ni 9 35 mg l the moderately high concentrations of cu and ni measured after the advanced oxidation process could be explained by the existence of free cu2 and ni2 or the unstable complexes of cu and ni this was demonstrated by the removal efficiencies during the coagulation flocculation 2 in order to abate all the contaminants this was done by increasing the ph and adding flocculants paa concentrations of cod nh4 no3 cu and ni after the whole treatment process were 140 2 42 1 2 0 84 and 0 15 mg l respectively in comparison to the vietnamese national technical regulations the treatment process does meet the regulation qcvn 40 2011 btnmt for nh4 cu and ni at column a and cod at column b 14 the experimental results indicated that at the first stage the increase of ph supported precipitation and coagulation flocculation processes and led to significantly reduction of metals 84 3 cu and 49 4 ni and chemical oxygen demand cod of wastewater 68 table 1 if these amounts were not removed they would have led to large consumptions of fe and h2o2 in the fenton ozone processes and a decrease in the efficiency of edta cu and edta ni chelates de complexation process therefore the 3 stage technology in this study is an acceptable solution when it comes to application of coagulation flocculation and fenton ozone processes for plating wastewater treatment 3 4 removal efficiencies using synthesized wastewater with the fenton ozone reaction process the experiments for testing the treatment process used synthesized wastewater containing na2edta cuso4 5h2o niso4 6h2o and nh4cl the initial water quality parameters of the synthesized wastewater were cod 3440 mg l nh4 150 mg l cu 300 mg l and ni 50 mg l the best conditions for real plating wastewater treatment are noted in sections 3 1 and 3 2 these were applied to treat synthesized wastewater and the outcomes are shown in table 2 surprisingly the treatment process s efficiency in removing impurities was much poorer than that of real plating wastewater treatment this could be explained by the hypothesis that during the electrolysis of the plating procedure the organic metal complexes of edta cu and edta ni the electrolysis process might weaken the stability of complexes 3 5 changes in oxidation redox potential orp and solution ph during the fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation processes to optimize and calculate the optimal chemicals in aops the oxidation reduction potential orp and ph values in the fenton ozone solution were determined the results are shown in table 3 which depicts that the influent wastewater for orp and ph values were 435 mv and 3 08 respectively after the coagulation flocculation process the orp value fell to 273 mv as the process removed a certain amount of oxidants in the solution meanwhile the ph value increased to 9 27 due to the ph adjustment to 10 before the coagulation flocculation process was conducted this was done to meet the optimal conditions required for the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants during the fenton ozone process chemicals fe2 and h2o2 and ozone gas were added contributing to the rise of orp values 520 mv after fenton and 516 mv after the ozone process in the oxidation process ph was adjusted to the optimal values at around 3 and 6 for the last treatment step solution ph was adjusted to ph 10 for coagulation and flocculation 2 observed consequences of orp and ph values were 27 mv and 8 88 respectively these outcomes are suitable with the aops and treated wastewater was alkaline and environmentally friendly with reference to the orp with a negative value 3 6 mechanism for degrading edta ni and edta cu in plating wastewater by fenton ozone the removal mechanisms of ni and cu from plating wastewater are proposed in fig 8 according to huang et al 4 a glycine pathway was considered the main route for the de complexation of metal edta in their study several intermediates during the process have been proposed such as ethylenediamine glycine formamide acetic acid oxalic acid formic acid co2 and h2o 4 in present study the hplc spectrums have supported the mechanisms the peaks at retention time s rt of 2 749 and 3 733 min represent edta cu and edta ni these significantly declined during the treatment process especially the intensity peak at rt 2 749 min reduced significantly in the coagulation flocculation 1 fenton ozone and coagulation flocculation 2 fig 9 the increase in peak intensity at rt 3 733 min represents the addition of organic matter to the solution the results of gc ms of intermediates in solution after fenton reaction were shown in fig 10 and appendix the intermediates in the sample after fenton reaction were detected such as n trimetylsilyl acetamine at rt 6 099 min trimethylsilyl chloroacetate at rt 6 544 min silane trimethylphenoxy at rt 10 532 12 331 and 13 732 min propanoic acid at rt 10 960 min acetic acid at rt 11 518 min benzoic acid at rt 16 646 min butanedioic acid at rt 18 504 min butanoic acid at rt 20 652 min parabanic acid at rt 21 252 min table 4 and appendix the intermediates reduced and mostly disappeared after ozone treatment process this was shown in gc ms spectrum of after ozone reaction sample was almost same as the bank spectrum of di water appendix these results demonstrated that the degradation of edta cu and edta ni by fenton ozone generate intermediates the decomposition of the organic compounds took place continuously and completely finished at the optimal conditions of fenton ozone processes these results were also agreed with the hypothesis that fenton is more effective for de complexation and ozone is more effective for mineralization firstly fenton reaction is responsible for de complexing the edta metal complexes and decomposing of more stable organic compounds such as ethylenediamine glycine formamide subsequently ozone helps to degrade the remaining and weaker compounds such as n trimetylsilyl acetamine trimethylsilyl chloroacetate silane trimethylphenoxy propanoic acid acetic acid benzoic acid butanedioic acid butanoic acid parabanic acid hence the integrated combination of fenton and ozone methods have achieved the advantage of complementarity 4 conclusion and recommendations in this study the combined fenton ozone based oxidation and coagulation process could effectively remove metals edta plating wastewater the optimal 3 stage reaction conditions for treating the real plating wastewater was applicable optimal conditions for plating wastewater treatment were found 1 coagulation and sedimentation adjusted to ph 10 1200 mg fe and 2 4 ml paa rapid sedimentation 2 fenton ozone 1200 mg fe 20 ml h2o2 stirring for 10 min ozone aeration ozonation in 20 min adjusted ph level 6 8 continuous ozone aeration ozonation in 25 min and 3 coagulation and sedimentation ph 10 3 2 ml paa rapid sedimentation this technique is highly efficient for the removal of metals in real plating wastewater rather than in the synthesized experiments these aops could treat complex metals in wastewater with different characteristics and concentrations of heavy metals in the treated effluent met the vietnam national technical regulations for discharge mechanisms of the degradation of edta metal complexes were proposed the intermediates of decomposition process of the chelates were detected by gc ms and they mostly disappeared in the after ozone reaction for further studies it is crucial to analyze the elemental and

13674,acyclovir acv prescribed for treating a wide range of viral infections has found its way into the aquatic environment it is emerging as a major concern for water bodies and biota due to its ecotoxicological effects the objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive critical review of available chemical biological and hybrid techniques of acv removal from water compare their relative efficacies under different environmental conditions and to draw attention towards emerging areas of research necessitating future studies though the present review is dedicated to acv removal however the removal strategies are similar and can be extrapolated for the removal of other micro pollutants this work also provides an overview of the literature on the occurrence of acv in industrial effluents wwtps surface waters groundwater and reservoirs at the end the paper explores inadequately researched gray areas that require further studies on mathematical modeling and simulation thermodynamics reaction pathways during degradative removal toxicological studies on transformation products tps and on complete mineralization as tps have been reported to be more toxic

plant keywords antiviral drug herpes virus transformation products treatment techniques wastewater 1 introduction for the treatment and prophylaxis of viral infections and prevention of epidemics antiviral drugs are playing an important role among the emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps identified in wastewater also the low biodegradability of these antiviral drugs puts them into the category of hazardous therapeutic compounds causing chronic toxicity towards daphnids fish prawns and algae and humans with a low potential to bio accumulate magnify 1 antiviral drugs are ranked eighth among toxic drugs for aquatic animals 2 acv has been the primary choice of clinicians for herpes simplex virus hsv cold sores varicella zoster virus vzv hepatitis b virus hbv epstein barr virus and cytomegalovirus treatment it is also used to treat chickenpox and genital herpes besides its various applications to humans it is may also be used as a veterinary drug to treat viral infections like the canine parvovirus 3 it is poorly soluble in water and has a short life span in the human body 4 lipid solubility data of acv are inadequate 5 and information about its bioaccumulation could not be found much therefore a high dose of acv is generally prescribed to the patients 6 which may cause cephalalgia diarrhea neurotoxicity emesis phlebo phlogosis swoon and urticaria 7 the simultaneous existence of relevant viruses along with small concentrations of acv in water bodies may make the virus resistant 8 as the utilization of acv is continuously expanding it has been detected in several water bodies 2 9 drinking water 2 and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents 9 10 principal sources of acv ingress into water bodies are manufacturing process domestic veterinary and hospital wastes another source may be due to the lack of awareness of the disposal techniques of expired medicines the possible schematic route of acv from the source to the receptor is represented in fig 1 due to its persistent nature it remains in the environment harming aquatic human and other living beings although its concentration is low in water bodies it is unsafe to the aquatic life exhibiting toxicity even at low concentrations and more so due to the risk of enhanced drug resistance among humans and other livings beings at such concentrations remediation of large volumes of water containing a very low concentration of acv is relatively more expensive as compared to the preventive route of the treatment of industrial wastewater before its discharge into the environment several techniques have been adopted for acv removal like adsorption 8 11 12 advanced oxidation process employing various techniques like photolysis 13 uv h2o2 14 catalytic ozonation 15 photocatalytic degradation 16 and biological treatment techniques 10 17 though some of these technologies can degrade acv but cannot mineralize it completely hence it is essential to completely mineralize it before discharging into the environment moreover acv is structurally akin to guanine which is more toxic than acv itself 18 on the degradation of acv guanine moiety may remain unchanged or acv transforms to guanine as an intermediate product 10 19 there is a growing concern for the management of wwtp sludge because of the non uniform concentration of acv going with it the present scheme of treatment at wwtp is unable to regulate the disposal of acv and its metabolites 9 carboxymethoxy methyl guanine 8 hydroxy 9 2 hydroxyethyl guanine carboxy acv in which it is discharged in sewage effluents to rivers or streams with high biodiversity considering the widespread applications of acv 20 inadequate studies have been conducted on the removal of acv using different techniques more data are required on the adverse impacts of acv on the aquatic environment a strong emphasis is required for research on techniques that completely mineralize acv which gets transformed into more dangerous or pharmaceutically active metabolites during treatment in sewage biomass 21 though biological treatment techniques are efficient and environmentally compatible the process is time consuming and the recurrent replacement of activated carbon in wwtp periodically makes the process expensive 17 22 the adsorptive adsorption aided removal processes should be made more economical by exploiting natural or low cost adsorbents since acv is rarely present as a single contaminant in wastewater there may be many other ppcps present together which may synergistically have a more adverse effect on the ecological system therefore extensive studies are required to treat the multicomponent mixtures of ppcps containing acv considering the scarcity of literature on efficient removal processes for acv it is necessary to develop newer economical techniques and or to modify the existing ones among all the existing techniques the advanced oxidation process aop has been proven efficient 14 but it also suffers from a limitation that it is not economical as the oxone used is relatively expensive powdered activated charcoal has been found efficient adsorbent 8 but needs suitable modification to achieve complete mineralization the prescription of acv has grown rapidly in the recent past due to its efficacy in treating hsv infected diseases and a host of other infections where it is used in combination with other pharmaceutical drugs as a result its occurrence in water bodies e g lakes and rivers has increased many folds also studies on the removal of acv have been reported on biological treatment based wwtp and combined aop biofiltering processes considering the wide pharmaceutical applications of acv in human and veterinary sectors 23 there is an urgent need for research for developing its efficient removal techniques from the aqueous environment effective research requires a potent review of literature combined with its critical evaluation in a single document such a review ought to have implicit notes on future perspectives of research that indicate the direction of research that one may pursue a perusal of existing literature indicates that such a review is imperative to plug the gaps in the existing strategies for its removal from wastewaters therefore this paper aims to present a potent review on acv in the aquatic environment several studies have been made for acv removal from wastewater using various conventional and biological techniques e g ozonation 24 adsorption 25 photolysis 13 photocatalysis 18 and biological treatment 17 however these processes have some limitations therefore newer techniques need to be explored for the complete mineralization of acv homogeneous fenton process and low cost adsorbents impregnated with selective catalytic metal along with appropriate oxidizing substance have proven efficient in removing several bio refractory compounds e g ciprofloxacin 26 ibuprofen 27 tetracycline 28 etc reactive adsorption an effective mineralization technique 29 30 also known as wet catalytic peroxide oxidation 31 has not been tried for the removal of acv it can have distinct advantages over the homogeneous fenton process as it does not generate sludge due to ph adjustment hydrogen peroxide is a comparatively inexpensive reactant as compared to some other oxidants like peroxymonosulfate however it is more expensive than the pure adsorption process but the working expenses are offset by higher percent removal achieved in comparatively lesser time which lowers the fixed capital costs 32 the molecular structure of acv is shown in fig 2 some of the significant properties of acv are presented in table 1 along with some of its applications 2 methodology the reviewed literature of this paper was selected from a wide variety of sources keeping in mind the utility of the matter for established and novice researchers alike the databases which were used to search the relevant papers were sciencedirect springerlink wiley taylor and francis acs databases crossref and google scholar the keywords used for searches were acyclovir removal wastewater wastewater treatment analytical methods occurrence pharmaceuticals etc the sources used included journal papers books book chapters scientific reports and standards the period of searched literature was limited up to december 2019 and articles published in english were only considered 3 utilization and disposal of acyclovir acv the first antiviral drug for the treatment of hsv and vzv infections got approved in 1981 while other drugs namely penciclovir famciclovir and valaciclovir got approved in the mid 90 s acv has wonderful advantages in the treatment of viral infections like mouth blisters keratitis corneal visual deficiency encephalitis etc moreover it has been found efficient in the treatment of corneal ulcers which was clinically challenging to other drugs idoxuridine or vidarabine acv has not shown any adverse influence in rabbit eyes although it has detrimental effects on human conjunctiva 33 intravenous acv has been reported to be an effective antiviral for mucocutaneous hsv infection in patients having poor immunity 34 it is available in the market in various forms but is widely used in its oral form since acv is sparingly soluble in water and has a short life span in the human body a high dose is generally prescribed to humans 6 it has been reported that only 15 20 of the administered dose of acv is metabolized or bioaccumulated in the human body and the rest 80 85 unmetabolized acv is discharged into the aquatic environment metabolites are mainly discharged through renal excretion with approximately 2 5 3 h of half life 35 36 it may increase viral resistance cause nephrotoxicity neurotoxicity coma hallucinations seizures lethargy and tremors and may lead to significant harmful effects in the human nervous system for prophylactic treatment the standard oral dose is 1 2 g day 400 mg directed three times each day globally 3 7 million people 67 of the population got infected with hsv 1 and 417 million people with hsv 2 virus before their 50 s in 2012 africa was the highest among all accounting for 87 of infected with hsv 1 and 31 5 with hsv 2 of the global patients 37 in the year 2000 the us alone was accounting approximately 54 of the total sale of these antiviral drugs 20 the sales and consumption of these antiviral drugs were continuously increasing as shown in fig 3 the dramatic increase in antiviral consumption for the treatment of infections caused by hsv and vzv is mainly due to the high pervasiveness of genital herpes advances in organ transplant prescriptions and the extent of the hiv scourge acv and valaciclovir are utilized in large amount to mitigate the effects of cytomegalovirus bug consequently the cumulative utilization of these antivirals is considerably high wwtp encounter increased inhibition of microbial activity due to the increasing inflow of antivirals as a result of the growing severity of viral infections and the resulting expanding usage of antivirals for safe disposal acv tablets can be discarded based on the scale of production of the waste in the following order large scale destruction high temperature incineration medium scale waste generation high temperature incineration encapsulation inertization landfill deposit and small scale destruction return to manufacturer supplier or pre treated product landfill disposal 38 4 toxicological effects of acv and its tps one of the tps of acv n 4 carbamoyl 2 imino 5 oxoimidazolidin formamido n methoxyacetic acid cofa was found to be toxic to green algae similarly another tp carboxy acv was found more toxic to d magna than acv itself though no acute fish and daphnia toxicities were observed up to 100 mg l and 92 1 mg l of acv respectively 39 impacts of chronic exposure to low levels of these compounds are still unknown for aquatic organisms 5 occurrence of acyclovir in water urbanization and industrialization are the root cause of pollution generating various diseases to cure or prevent such diseases various pharmaceutical drugs are administered the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment was first reported in 1976 clofibric acid was reported in treated wastewater of kansas city us in the concentrations ranging from 0 8 to 2 μg l 40 thereafter many researchers have identified the fate of ppcps in fresh wastewater across the globe 41 1 44 tables 2 and 3 present the occurrence of acv and its tps detected in wwtps surface and groundwaters and industrial effluents it is obvious from tables 2 and 3 that carboxy acv a tp of acv has been reported in industrial effluents wwtps river water and reservoirs 10 45 tps of administered acv may arise at two different stages firstly the drug undergoes a biological transformation during the metabolic activity of humans animals in the second stage transformations occur during the biological and or other wastewater treatment processes surprisingly in certain instances the concentration of biologically transformed products was found more than the parent compound 45 however industrial effluents and discarded drugs may transform at the wastewater treatment stage or due to inherently present oxidants in the wastewater discharge route carboxy acv was also detected in finished drinking water with a peak concentration of 40 ng l 10 the highest concentrations of acv in wwtp effluents and surface water have been reported to be 1360 ng l and 1590 ng l respectively 9 though the highest concentration of effluents seems lower than the surface water however the total concentration of acv and its tps put together may be higher the existence of hsv along with small concentrations of acv in water bodies has the potential of developing drug resistance among the virus in question 8 acv tps may also be found in drinking water due to chemical treatment and or chemical disinfection therefore the removal of acv is vital and essential 6 analytical methods for acv determination to estimate the exact concentration of acv in water and other matrices for clinical and other applications various techniques have been developed to determine and quantify acv e g lc ms ms 51 hplc 52 53 radioimmunoassay 54 near infrared spectroscopy 55 uplc 5 uv spectrophotometer 56 liquid chromatography 57 and surface enhanced raman spectroscopy 58 fig 4 represents majorly used analytical techniques for acv detection in aqueous medium and biological fluids nevertheless the methodologies referred to above have their limitations near infrared spectroscopy gives quick acv determination without extravagant pretreatment steps however the requisite calibrations are tedious 55 even though chromatography based techniques have high sensitivity and separation power these methods have a few limitations that include long and monotonous sample preparation cumbersome testing process challenges of progressively monitoring the process and high cost of processing radio immunoassay is a sensitive procedure but it involves the development of antiserum or monoclonal antibodies that are expensive and tedious another viable technique is raman recognition and utilized broadly to find out auxiliary varieties of macromolecules although surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers is an effective technique for selective and sensitive analysis of acv however due to the inherent complexities involved in the sers technique no universal substrate can be used to detect all the chemical compounds 58 for routine and research analytical work the spectrophotometric analysis is preferred as it has reasonable sensitivity inherent simplicity quick and economical however it cannot be used to analyze trace concentrations spectrophotometric analysis can be preferred over others for aqueous solutions for routine analysis whereas for biological fluids chromatography based techniques mainly hplc are suggested as they are relatively more sensitive and accurate sers technique has also proven efficient however due to its complexities it should be avoided for analysis of biological fluids for multi component analysis near infrared spectroscopy is suggested because of its rapidity and relatively little interference reported lc ms ms can be used to cross confirm the results of other techniques for very low level concentrations 7 overview of acyclovir removal techniques extensive work has been carried out on emerging contaminants and ppcps but little attention has been paid to acv removal a few common techniques have been applied for acv removal from wastewater viz adsorption 8 11 25 ozonation 24 photolysis 13 photocatalysis 1 16 18 59 and biological treatment 10 17 several hybrid techniques have also been proven efficient for acv removal 22 50 48 60 a pictorial representation of commonly used acv removal techniques is shown in fig 5 fig 6 compares the concentration ranges of acv for which different removal techniques have been used to have alternative acv removal techniques it is imperative to explore newer techniques for acv removal for example reactive adsorption thermal and non thermal plasma techniques table 4 presents various physical and chemical treatment techniques and table 5 illustrates biological and hybrid treatment processes that have been used earlier for acv removal it may be seen from table 4 that though the chemical treatment methods have been proved efficient for the removal of acv from wastewater yet complete mineralization is not reported a review of the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals onto activated carbon has been reported earlier 69 the main benefit of removing acv using adsorption is that it does not generate toxic by products however adsorption does not destroy the contaminants but only concentrates them on a solid surface besides proper disposal of spent adsorbing solids remains a challenge a simulation study on the adsorption of acv on magnetic nanoparticles was accomplished by hosseini nasr et al 12 in the case of smaller nanoparticle adsorbents acv was found to have interaction with fe 3 ions while in larger nanoparticle interaction was with fe 2 ozonation of acv and carboxy acv may lead to the formation of cofa more toxic products at ph 8 24 therefore ozonation as a single stage treatment of acv should be avoided titanium doped mesoporous ϒ al2o3 was used efficiently for the removal of acv using the catalytic ozonation process 15 though 65 toc removal was achieved complete mineralization was not reported acv was found to be intact when tio2 was used as a catalyst under visible light irradiation a small change in the concentration of acv was observed within 5 h even after 7 h of irradiation the toc concentration does not degrade whereas the complete degradation of acv could be achieved within 90 min 18 complete mineralization could not be achieved due to the formation of the persistent intermediates under visible light irradiation lower toxicity of the samples treated with uv254 h2o2 was observed along with higher acv removal in comparison to uv254 on living organisms 1 in freshwater photodegradation of acv was enhanced by nitration bicarbonation and dissolved organic matter 13 in seawater cl br and ionic strength does not affect the photolysis of acv photoelectrocatalysis using tio2 nanotube photo anodes has shown excellent results of 96 2 acv removal accomplished within 370 s 62 ozonation followed by activated carbon adsorption has been proved to be a reassuring technique however it has a high treatment cost 70 higher biotransformation of acv is reported in aerobic and anoxic conditions as compared to the anaerobic systems 68 table 5 biological treatment achieved degradation of less than 20 of acv in an anaerobic sludge system 67 acv gets transformed into carboxy acv irrespective of the initial concentration of acv and the presence of the ammonium salt it also does not depend on the type of metabolism it is subjected through 66 in research by 60 pharmaceutical degradation of acv was accomplished by a combination of mbr and ozonation the recycling mode of the ozonation reactor in mbr effluent made this hybrid process efficient to remove 99 of acv in the final effluent complete removal of acv has been achieved using biological processes 50 among combined removal techniques bio and photo transformation processes for acv were investigated by 19 b in such a treatment process biotransformation is the key removal mechanism for acv removal it was found that the staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr technique has high removal efficiency for the trace organic compounds as compared to asp 48 this makes it advantageous as it would decrease the burden on ro for removal of trace organic concentrations from the secondary treated wastewater if it is used as upstream for drinking water systems based on the recycling of municipal sewage treatment in sum while the adsorption separates and concentrates acv it does not mineralize it and the sorption time varies from 75 min 24 h with different adsorbents as they have varied affinities with the solute the process primarily appears to be physisorption requiring high contact time which could be driven by the low solubility of acv in water the controlled temperature was found to be 39 45 c modification of the adsorbent surface may increase rate and adsorption capacity resulting in a reduction of sorption time for industrial wastewater which has a low volume but highly concentrated it makes sense to concentrate through sorption and then chemically oxidize using any suitable aop spent adsorbent may be regenerated and recovered acv may further be concentrated to prepare veterinary drug for sewage where large volumes are involved separation or any other pre chemical treatment may not be economically feasible due to many competing species a practical approach would be to explore the effect of individual disinfectants commonly used for achieving coliform norms and devising a hybrid disinfection strategy to remove acv effectively such hybrid strategies have shown high efficacy in achieving total coliform norms with a simultaneous thm removal 71 73 incomplete degradation of acv by various techniques like ozonation photolysis chemical and biological degradation may lead to the formation of the more toxic compound s therefore it is necessary to completely mineralize acv before its discharge the extent of mineralization of bio refractory compounds has been estimated by toc analysis only however it needs to be analyzed by carrying out both cod and toc analyses of the sample at different intervals cod provides an oxidative state of available carbon in the sample however toc does not give this information ftir analysis of aqueous samples may also be carried out to ascertain the changing functional groups in the sample with time considering the formation of toxic intermediates during treatment the efficacy of different removal techniques must be compared by the estimation of the extent of mineralization achieved at different intervals 8 grey area and future perspectives there have been significant developments in detecting quantifying and removal of acv many problems however have remained unaddressed or partly comprehended some of them are mentioned in the following subsections 8 1 scarcity of data despite the extensive amount of usage of antivirals the available data and study are limited 74 the persistent nature of acv distinguishes them from other emerging contaminants ingested acv does not completely metabolize in the body therefore its presence in the aquatic environment affects aquatic life very little is known about the harmful effects of acv on humans through the water apparently in the absence of data on the adverse effects of acv on the endocrinal glands of humans acv has not been included in the list of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs by the un who and usepa to assess the losses of acv to the environment and to devise appropriate treatment systems for the plant effluent it is essential to provide public access to the production and consumption data along with information on the composition of waste streams emanating out from the manufacturing unit 8 2 occurrence the release of acv and its metabolites in the environment is of significant concern owing to the prospective ecosystem changes and imminent growth of antiviral resistance among the target organisms therefore intensive studies need to be made on the occurrence of acv and its metabolites in potential sources and water bodies expected to contain the contaminants 8 2 1 effluents of bulk drug manufacturing units the pharmaceutical industry utilizes the active pharmaceutical ingredients that are degradation resistant extremely persistent in the aqueous environment and or capable of adversely affecting aquatic organisms and human health acv is one such drug that needs to be quantified in industrial effluents 8 2 2 hospital and municipal wastewater a few research have reported the treatment of hospital wastewater containing various pharmaceuticals 75 76 however studies reporting the occurrence of acv in hospital and or municipal wastewater are limited 46 looking at the growth in humans and veterinary applications of acv in viral infections detailed further studies are required 8 2 3 lakes receiving urban and industrial wastewater many countries have recognized the pollution in surface and groundwater generated by pharmaceutical products as an environmental issue 77 78 thus research should be carried out on the presence of acv in lakes and rivers receiving urban and industrial wastewater 8 3 removal techniques 8 3 1 biological methods inhibition of biological processes due to the presence of acv in wastewater has already been reported 10 66 however the treatment of acv using specific microbial and fungal species strains has scarcely been reported so far it is imperative to discover suitable microbial strain for the degradation of acv into environmentally compatible products similar studies on the degradation of acv using a consortium of aerobic and or anaerobic microorganisms are also desirable studies on the growth of the microorganism population in the presence of acv and the impact of the wastewater matrix on the removal process should be made to know the process of adaptation 17 since biological processes are time consuming techniques should be improvised optimized to reduce the contact time studies on finding suitable enzymes for faster degradation of acv and determination of the kinetics are to be made 8 3 2 chemical oxidation chlorination and ozonation are principally used for disinfection these compounds can also oxidize emerging contaminants ozonation has efficacy towards the removal of bio refractory compounds 75 hydroxyl radicals are strong oxidizing reagents and exhibit faster oxidation responses than standard oxidants such as kmo4 or h2o2 79 literature for removal of acv using ozonation is scarce 24 hence studies on the removal of acv using ozone can be useful chlorination has been reported to efficiently remove antibiotics 80 therefore a study on chlorination of acv may also be attempted though h2o2 is not a strong oxidant however it is a benevolent compound as it gets converted into water and reactive nascent oxygen through a slow decomposition reaction oxidation of acv using h2o2 has not been reported so far a study on degradation and mineralization of acv using h2o2 may be carried out and optimal concentration of h2o2 for maximum acv degradation be estimated 8 3 3 adsorption activated carbon ac has proven efficient for acv removal 8 11 ac is supposed to be more efficient because of its higher surface area the removal efficiency of ac can be further enhanced by functionalizing it with some acid base or metallic compounds the efficacy of the adsorption process is profoundly affected by the type and properties of the adsorbent and waste stream compositions biochars has an almost ac like porous framework and can therefore act as an effective adsorbent to remove acv from wastewater other adsorptive materials that can be used for the treatment of acv contaminated water are clay minerals singe and multi walled carbon nanotubes functionalized carbon nanotubes solvent impregnated resins silica and alumina the solution ph plays a critical role in adsorptive removal of contaminants therefore it must be a parameter of such studies additional studies are required for the development of low cost efficient methods for regeneration of spent adsorbents the adsorption kinetics determines the size and in turn the capital cost of the treatment system required for commercial uses along with the removal rate 81 therefore adsorption kinetics should also be considered 8 3 4 photolysis solar photolysis photochemical degradation of compounds generates hydroxyl radicals without using chemicals and is mildly affected by ph variation different studies indicate that acv may undergo photodegradation as it contains aromatic rings and certain functional groups that enable uv solar radiation to be absorbed or to generate photosensitive species responses that may cause photodegradation in aqueous media 13 64 more focus is to be paid on solar photolysis than uv photolysis as uv irradiation is an expensive process uv is used for disinfection of sewage a marginally higher contact time doze and or use of polychromatic uv may be explored as a viable option for acv removal in wwtp solar rays have earlier been proved successful for the removal of acv 64 hence applying long lasting advanced uv sources such as light emitting diodes leds can indeed reduce the costs of conventional uv lamps significantly therefore studies on led irradiation for removal of acv may be attempted moreover the impact of dissolved organic matter on the removal and mineralization of acv by uv or uv h2o2 processes need to be investigated 8 3 5 advanced oxidation processes aops have been effectively used to oxidize several organic compounds making the process versatile in usage slower degradation may result from either a low or an overdose of photocatalyst 82 therefore experiments focusing on optimum catalyst dose need to be conducted for acv degradation tio2 can boost hydroxyl radical formation thereby improving the rate of the degradation process photocatalytic oxidation using different catalysts like zno cds wo3 and their suitable alloys can be developed and used such catalysts may also be applied as coatings on suitable matrices making them reusable due to the high electrical conductivity of the ions present in the electrolyte electrochemical oxidation has been proved to be a promising technique in the removal of acv though there are some drawbacks of using electrochemical oxidation for instance it has relatively high electrode costs and the concern of the formation of toxic tps therefore more studies overcoming these limitations are required one of the advanced oxidation processes cavitation effectively degrades bio refractory pollutants present in water using hydroxyl radicals cavitation involves the instantaneous formation of high energy micro cavities releasing up to 1018 kw m3 energy in a short duration of few milliseconds in liquid bulk 83 both types of cavitation viz acoustic or hydrodynamic can be applied for acv degradation fenton process has a drawback of generating undesirable iron sludge therefore studies on processes reducing sludge formation are imperative 8 3 6 reactive adsorption extensive work has been done on the removal of phenol 84 85 and dyes 30 using reactive adsorption but detailed studies on reactive adsorption of acv in batch mode have scarcely been reported complete mineralization of contaminants with a faster rate and less energy consumption has been observed using the reactive adsorption technique 30 therefore reactive adsorption can be proved to be a promising technique for the complete mineralization of acv as well however no work could be found in literature reporting relevant studies on packed bed also a more accurate prediction of breakthrough curves is eminent an approach must be developed to estimate modeling parameters for example diffusivity and mass transfer coefficient of the particle additional research can be done on the kinetics and thermodynamics of reactive adsorption of acv exploring catalysts based on metal components other than fe is required with high reactivity and low leaching rate for an effective and economical wastewater treatment process 8 3 7 thermal and non thermal plasma techniques plasma and non thermal plasma treatment of acv has been scarcely reported non thermal plasma produces in situ oxidizing species e g ozone hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide etc which helps in the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater 86 at low initial concentration the non thermal plasma technique has achieved 98 mineralization of verapamil 87 hence the treatment of acv may also be aimed at using a non thermal plasma technique the mineralization process is comparatively slower than the removal process and improves with an increase in input energy in the case of higher acv concentration in effluent the addition of catalysts or combining plasma with ozonation may enhance mineralization 8 3 8 membrane treatment technology ultrafiltration nano filtration and reverse osmosis have successfully been used to remove various organic bio refractory compounds from wastewater and may be tried for treatment of acv in the wastewater the reject stream contains highly concentrated water that is later discharged into the environment 88 hence there is a scope for in depth studies for the treatment of reject waste stream using a combination of sorption followed by chemical degradation 8 3 9 hybrid techniques integrated biological and chemical processes have proven efficient for the removal of bio refractory compounds in recent researches 89 90 acv degradation using a single treatment technique may not prove to be efficient for its removal ozonation when applied in the recirculation stream of mbr its removal efficiency for acv was found to be improved from 20 to 60 60 previous studies based on degradative removal have mainly focused on the removal aspect of acv only however removal may not result in complete mineralization and toxicity removal such techniques may leave behind degradation transformation products that may be less or more toxic than acv itself therefore future studies need to be focused on the complete mineralization of acv using combinational or hybrid techniques 8 4 green and economical technology development surface modification of adsorbents is an efficient way of increasing adsorptive capacity or inducing degradative potential for contaminants maximization of adsorbent ability by altering its surface structure with new functional groups to attain high selectivity and specificity are key to efficient contaminant removal several adsorbents have been used earlier in raw form or modified form 8 11 25 for the removal of acv to make the process more economical a study is required to exploit different natural adsorbents low cost adsorbents locally available biomass waste materials waste sludge high surface area nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphene sheets etc 81 commercially available high surface area pre functionalized adsorbing materials may also be studied the economics of removal techniques are site specific also therefore the selection of removal techniques must be done accordingly 8 5 reaction pathway elucidation elucidation of the reaction pathway is an important study to be conducted for different processes of degradation of acv from different degradation pathways one may detect the tps formed using hrms esi ms and nmr although 14 have elucidated the degradation pathway of acv using oxone and 59 explained photocatalytic degradation pathway degradation intermediates and reaction pathways for other techniques are also required tps may also be quantified by using techniques such as hplc understanding the chemistry of the formation of tps of acv and their process conditions need separate studies 8 6 removal of multicomponent mixture acv is barely present as a single contaminant in wastewater synergistic adverse effects of other ppcps present together may be higher on the ecological system the removal of a binary mixture of dyes has been carried out earlier 91 biotransformation studies on wastewater containing acv and penciclovir have also been reported 10 chemical and biological activities of multicomponent mixtures may result in such complicated effects that cannot be readily extrapolated from individual compounds composition and activity 43 therefore the multicomponent mixture of acv containing other ppcps need further detailed studies currently the focus of research on drug resistance is limited to the effect of a drug when it is present alone short or long term impacts of different multicomponent mixtures of acv present along with other pharmaceuticals on human health are not yet identified synergistic antagonistic impacts of pharmaceuticals with acv should be anticipated following what has been reported in ecotoxicological studies on aquatic life in combination with organic contaminant mixtures 43 studies on synergistic and antagonistic effects of different combinations of pharmaceutical drugs used as antiepileptic nsaid antibiotics antidepressants vasodilators etc along with acv may bring about interesting results 8 7 mathematical modeling studies modeling studies on the removal of different organic contaminants from water in batch and continuous systems have been reported earlier 84 92 93 modeling for removal of acv and contaminants from a multicomponent mixture is also imperative there is a need to create thermodynamic models capable of analyzing simultaneous physisorption and chemisorption and to create isotherm models capable of describing the chemisorption mathematical models predicting the effects of wastewater characteristics and operating conditions on the removal of acv ought to be developed mathematical models are also required to evaluate the impact of the initial concentration of influent acv on treatment plant efficiency mathematical models predicting health effects on the people consuming water contaminated with acv will also be useful such a model will promptly estimate possible epidemic occurrence the scope of ecological effects resulting because of an abrupt deluge of antiviral into nature may also be modeled 8 8 toxicological studies the growing application of acv warrants a systematic study on toxicological studies on the aquatic and terrestrial environment assessment of the toxicity levels of degradation products at different levels of treatment need to be conducted by biologists 8 9 miscellaneous there is ample scope for the development of simple inexpensive analytical methods that may effectively detect and accurately quantify acv in higher concentrations along with its metabolites it has also been reported that analytical techniques for some of the tps of certain pharmaceuticals are not available 39 hence analytical quantitative detection techniques need to be developed for such tps considering the quantity of waste generation and the costs associated with their safe disposal process wastes need to be converted into wealth thus another part of future studies is to assess the commercial importance of undesirable products for producing valuable organic substances and industrially important inorganic chemical byproducts by their further processing there is a vast scope for research in different separation processes for producing pure chemicals here carboxy acv a tp formed due to biodegradation of acv can be degraded to cofa by ozonation the degradation process for cofa is not available 22 hence studies are required to find techniques for effective degradation and mineralization of cofa 9 conclusion the occurrence of small concentrations of acv has been found in different water bodies across the globe and has attracted the attention of researchers even trace concentrations of acv in the aquatic environment have highly adverse health effects on living beings in general and drug resistance in particular based on available dose response data acv has not been enlisted as an edc or a carcinogen however more studies in this respect are warranted its presence in water bodies is of immediate concern due to its ecotoxicological effects on the environment though analytical techniques for quantification of acv are available the development of simple and economical methods for the higher concentration of acv is required a review of various acv removal techniques indicates that in most of the work removal was possible through partial degradation considering the growing use of acv and the toxic nature of its tps and its resultant occurrence in industrial and municipal wastewaters there is an urgent need for the development of techniques that can efficiently mineralize acv present in water the presence of acv with some other drugs in water has its synergistic effects these need to be worked out being a relatively newer molecule among antimicrobial drugs and its wide applications among all antiviral drugs wide ranging research studies are needed on toxicological and thermodynamic aspects and modeling and simulation studies however there is a need to improve research and development activities in line with the adoption mode of action and consequences of acv for new and economical treatment technologies for a viable removal technology to find application sight specific factors such as electricity costs space and solar energy availability must be considered declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgment this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors however one of authors ag

13674,acyclovir acv prescribed for treating a wide range of viral infections has found its way into the aquatic environment it is emerging as a major concern for water bodies and biota due to its ecotoxicological effects the objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive critical review of available chemical biological and hybrid techniques of acv removal from water compare their relative efficacies under different environmental conditions and to draw attention towards emerging areas of research necessitating future studies though the present review is dedicated to acv removal however the removal strategies are similar and can be extrapolated for the removal of other micro pollutants this work also provides an overview of the literature on the occurrence of acv in industrial effluents wwtps surface waters groundwater and reservoirs at the end the paper explores inadequately researched gray areas that require further studies on mathematical modeling and simulation thermodynamics reaction pathways during degradative removal toxicological studies on transformation products tps and on complete mineralization as tps have been reported to be more toxic

plant keywords antiviral drug herpes virus transformation products treatment techniques wastewater 1 introduction for the treatment and prophylaxis of viral infections and prevention of epidemics antiviral drugs are playing an important role among the emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps identified in wastewater also the low biodegradability of these antiviral drugs puts them into the category of hazardous therapeutic compounds causing chronic toxicity towards daphnids fish prawns and algae and humans with a low potential to bio accumulate magnify 1 antiviral drugs are ranked eighth among toxic drugs for aquatic animals 2 acv has been the primary choice of clinicians for herpes simplex virus hsv cold sores varicella zoster virus vzv hepatitis b virus hbv epstein barr virus and cytomegalovirus treatment it is also used to treat chickenpox and genital herpes besides its various applications to humans it is may also be used as a veterinary drug to treat viral infections like the canine parvovirus 3 it is poorly soluble in water and has a short life span in the human body 4 lipid solubility data of acv are inadequate 5 and information about its bioaccumulation could not be found much therefore a high dose of acv is generally prescribed to the patients 6 which may cause cephalalgia diarrhea neurotoxicity emesis phlebo phlogosis swoon and urticaria 7 the simultaneous existence of relevant viruses along with small concentrations of acv in water bodies may make the virus resistant 8 as the utilization of acv is continuously expanding it has been detected in several water bodies 2 9 drinking water 2 and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents 9 10 principal sources of acv ingress into water bodies are manufacturing process domestic veterinary and hospital wastes another source may be due to the lack of awareness of the disposal techniques of expired medicines the possible schematic route of acv from the source to the receptor is represented in fig 1 due to its persistent nature it remains in the environment harming aquatic human and other living beings although its concentration is low in water bodies it is unsafe to the aquatic life exhibiting toxicity even at low concentrations and more so due to the risk of enhanced drug resistance among humans and other livings beings at such concentrations remediation of large volumes of water containing a very low concentration of acv is relatively more expensive as compared to the preventive route of the treatment of industrial wastewater before its discharge into the environment several techniques have been adopted for acv removal like adsorption 8 11 12 advanced oxidation process employing various techniques like photolysis 13 uv h2o2 14 catalytic ozonation 15 photocatalytic degradation 16 and biological treatment techniques 10 17 though some of these technologies can degrade acv but cannot mineralize it completely hence it is essential to completely mineralize it before discharging into the environment moreover acv is structurally akin to guanine which is more toxic than acv itself 18 on the degradation of acv guanine moiety may remain unchanged or acv transforms to guanine as an intermediate product 10 19 there is a growing concern for the management of wwtp sludge because of the non uniform concentration of acv going with it the present scheme of treatment at wwtp is unable to regulate the disposal of acv and its metabolites 9 carboxymethoxy methyl guanine 8 hydroxy 9 2 hydroxyethyl guanine carboxy acv in which it is discharged in sewage effluents to rivers or streams with high biodiversity considering the widespread applications of acv 20 inadequate studies have been conducted on the removal of acv using different techniques more data are required on the adverse impacts of acv on the aquatic environment a strong emphasis is required for research on techniques that completely mineralize acv which gets transformed into more dangerous or pharmaceutically active metabolites during treatment in sewage biomass 21 though biological treatment techniques are efficient and environmentally compatible the process is time consuming and the recurrent replacement of activated carbon in wwtp periodically makes the process expensive 17 22 the adsorptive adsorption aided removal processes should be made more economical by exploiting natural or low cost adsorbents since acv is rarely present as a single contaminant in wastewater there may be many other ppcps present together which may synergistically have a more adverse effect on the ecological system therefore extensive studies are required to treat the multicomponent mixtures of ppcps containing acv considering the scarcity of literature on efficient removal processes for acv it is necessary to develop newer economical techniques and or to modify the existing ones among all the existing techniques the advanced oxidation process aop has been proven efficient 14 but it also suffers from a limitation that it is not economical as the oxone used is relatively expensive powdered activated charcoal has been found efficient adsorbent 8 but needs suitable modification to achieve complete mineralization the prescription of acv has grown rapidly in the recent past due to its efficacy in treating hsv infected diseases and a host of other infections where it is used in combination with other pharmaceutical drugs as a result its occurrence in water bodies e g lakes and rivers has increased many folds also studies on the removal of acv have been reported on biological treatment based wwtp and combined aop biofiltering processes considering the wide pharmaceutical applications of acv in human and veterinary sectors 23 there is an urgent need for research for developing its efficient removal techniques from the aqueous environment effective research requires a potent review of literature combined with its critical evaluation in a single document such a review ought to have implicit notes on future perspectives of research that indicate the direction of research that one may pursue a perusal of existing literature indicates that such a review is imperative to plug the gaps in the existing strategies for its removal from wastewaters therefore this paper aims to present a potent review on acv in the aquatic environment several studies have been made for acv removal from wastewater using various conventional and biological techniques e g ozonation 24 adsorption 25 photolysis 13 photocatalysis 18 and biological treatment 17 however these processes have some limitations therefore newer techniques need to be explored for the complete mineralization of acv homogeneous fenton process and low cost adsorbents impregnated with selective catalytic metal along with appropriate oxidizing substance have proven efficient in removing several bio refractory compounds e g ciprofloxacin 26 ibuprofen 27 tetracycline 28 etc reactive adsorption an effective mineralization technique 29 30 also known as wet catalytic peroxide oxidation 31 has not been tried for the removal of acv it can have distinct advantages over the homogeneous fenton process as it does not generate sludge due to ph adjustment hydrogen peroxide is a comparatively inexpensive reactant as compared to some other oxidants like peroxymonosulfate however it is more expensive than the pure adsorption process but the working expenses are offset by higher percent removal achieved in comparatively lesser time which lowers the fixed capital costs 32 the molecular structure of acv is shown in fig 2 some of the significant properties of acv are presented in table 1 along with some of its applications 2 methodology the reviewed literature of this paper was selected from a wide variety of sources keeping in mind the utility of the matter for established and novice researchers alike the databases which were used to search the relevant papers were sciencedirect springerlink wiley taylor and francis acs databases crossref and google scholar the keywords used for searches were acyclovir removal wastewater wastewater treatment analytical methods occurrence pharmaceuticals etc the sources used included journal papers books book chapters scientific reports and standards the period of searched literature was limited up to december 2019 and articles published in english were only considered 3 utilization and disposal of acyclovir acv the first antiviral drug for the treatment of hsv and vzv infections got approved in 1981 while other drugs namely penciclovir famciclovir and valaciclovir got approved in the mid 90 s acv has wonderful advantages in the treatment of viral infections like mouth blisters keratitis corneal visual deficiency encephalitis etc moreover it has been found efficient in the treatment of corneal ulcers which was clinically challenging to other drugs idoxuridine or vidarabine acv has not shown any adverse influence in rabbit eyes although it has detrimental effects on human conjunctiva 33 intravenous acv has been reported to be an effective antiviral for mucocutaneous hsv infection in patients having poor immunity 34 it is available in the market in various forms but is widely used in its oral form since acv is sparingly soluble in water and has a short life span in the human body a high dose is generally prescribed to humans 6 it has been reported that only 15 20 of the administered dose of acv is metabolized or bioaccumulated in the human body and the rest 80 85 unmetabolized acv is discharged into the aquatic environment metabolites are mainly discharged through renal excretion with approximately 2 5 3 h of half life 35 36 it may increase viral resistance cause nephrotoxicity neurotoxicity coma hallucinations seizures lethargy and tremors and may lead to significant harmful effects in the human nervous system for prophylactic treatment the standard oral dose is 1 2 g day 400 mg directed three times each day globally 3 7 million people 67 of the population got infected with hsv 1 and 417 million people with hsv 2 virus before their 50 s in 2012 africa was the highest among all accounting for 87 of infected with hsv 1 and 31 5 with hsv 2 of the global patients 37 in the year 2000 the us alone was accounting approximately 54 of the total sale of these antiviral drugs 20 the sales and consumption of these antiviral drugs were continuously increasing as shown in fig 3 the dramatic increase in antiviral consumption for the treatment of infections caused by hsv and vzv is mainly due to the high pervasiveness of genital herpes advances in organ transplant prescriptions and the extent of the hiv scourge acv and valaciclovir are utilized in large amount to mitigate the effects of cytomegalovirus bug consequently the cumulative utilization of these antivirals is considerably high wwtp encounter increased inhibition of microbial activity due to the increasing inflow of antivirals as a result of the growing severity of viral infections and the resulting expanding usage of antivirals for safe disposal acv tablets can be discarded based on the scale of production of the waste in the following order large scale destruction high temperature incineration medium scale waste generation high temperature incineration encapsulation inertization landfill deposit and small scale destruction return to manufacturer supplier or pre treated product landfill disposal 38 4 toxicological effects of acv and its tps one of the tps of acv n 4 carbamoyl 2 imino 5 oxoimidazolidin formamido n methoxyacetic acid cofa was found to be toxic to green algae similarly another tp carboxy acv was found more toxic to d magna than acv itself though no acute fish and daphnia toxicities were observed up to 100 mg l and 92 1 mg l of acv respectively 39 impacts of chronic exposure to low levels of these compounds are still unknown for aquatic organisms 5 occurrence of acyclovir in water urbanization and industrialization are the root cause of pollution generating various diseases to cure or prevent such diseases various pharmaceutical drugs are administered the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment was first reported in 1976 clofibric acid was reported in treated wastewater of kansas city us in the concentrations ranging from 0 8 to 2 μg l 40 thereafter many researchers have identified the fate of ppcps in fresh wastewater across the globe 41 1 44 tables 2 and 3 present the occurrence of acv and its tps detected in wwtps surface and groundwaters and industrial effluents it is obvious from tables 2 and 3 that carboxy acv a tp of acv has been reported in industrial effluents wwtps river water and reservoirs 10 45 tps of administered acv may arise at two different stages firstly the drug undergoes a biological transformation during the metabolic activity of humans animals in the second stage transformations occur during the biological and or other wastewater treatment processes surprisingly in certain instances the concentration of biologically transformed products was found more than the parent compound 45 however industrial effluents and discarded drugs may transform at the wastewater treatment stage or due to inherently present oxidants in the wastewater discharge route carboxy acv was also detected in finished drinking water with a peak concentration of 40 ng l 10 the highest concentrations of acv in wwtp effluents and surface water have been reported to be 1360 ng l and 1590 ng l respectively 9 though the highest concentration of effluents seems lower than the surface water however the total concentration of acv and its tps put together may be higher the existence of hsv along with small concentrations of acv in water bodies has the potential of developing drug resistance among the virus in question 8 acv tps may also be found in drinking water due to chemical treatment and or chemical disinfection therefore the removal of acv is vital and essential 6 analytical methods for acv determination to estimate the exact concentration of acv in water and other matrices for clinical and other applications various techniques have been developed to determine and quantify acv e g lc ms ms 51 hplc 52 53 radioimmunoassay 54 near infrared spectroscopy 55 uplc 5 uv spectrophotometer 56 liquid chromatography 57 and surface enhanced raman spectroscopy 58 fig 4 represents majorly used analytical techniques for acv detection in aqueous medium and biological fluids nevertheless the methodologies referred to above have their limitations near infrared spectroscopy gives quick acv determination without extravagant pretreatment steps however the requisite calibrations are tedious 55 even though chromatography based techniques have high sensitivity and separation power these methods have a few limitations that include long and monotonous sample preparation cumbersome testing process challenges of progressively monitoring the process and high cost of processing radio immunoassay is a sensitive procedure but it involves the development of antiserum or monoclonal antibodies that are expensive and tedious another viable technique is raman recognition and utilized broadly to find out auxiliary varieties of macromolecules although surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers is an effective technique for selective and sensitive analysis of acv however due to the inherent complexities involved in the sers technique no universal substrate can be used to detect all the chemical compounds 58 for routine and research analytical work the spectrophotometric analysis is preferred as it has reasonable sensitivity inherent simplicity quick and economical however it cannot be used to analyze trace concentrations spectrophotometric analysis can be preferred over others for aqueous solutions for routine analysis whereas for biological fluids chromatography based techniques mainly hplc are suggested as they are relatively more sensitive and accurate sers technique has also proven efficient however due to its complexities it should be avoided for analysis of biological fluids for multi component analysis near infrared spectroscopy is suggested because of its rapidity and relatively little interference reported lc ms ms can be used to cross confirm the results of other techniques for very low level concentrations 7 overview of acyclovir removal techniques extensive work has been carried out on emerging contaminants and ppcps but little attention has been paid to acv removal a few common techniques have been applied for acv removal from wastewater viz adsorption 8 11 25 ozonation 24 photolysis 13 photocatalysis 1 16 18 59 and biological treatment 10 17 several hybrid techniques have also been proven efficient for acv removal 22 50 48 60 a pictorial representation of commonly used acv removal techniques is shown in fig 5 fig 6 compares the concentration ranges of acv for which different removal techniques have been used to have alternative acv removal techniques it is imperative to explore newer techniques for acv removal for example reactive adsorption thermal and non thermal plasma techniques table 4 presents various physical and chemical treatment techniques and table 5 illustrates biological and hybrid treatment processes that have been used earlier for acv removal it may be seen from table 4 that though the chemical treatment methods have been proved efficient for the removal of acv from wastewater yet complete mineralization is not reported a review of the adsorptive removal of pharmaceuticals onto activated carbon has been reported earlier 69 the main benefit of removing acv using adsorption is that it does not generate toxic by products however adsorption does not destroy the contaminants but only concentrates them on a solid surface besides proper disposal of spent adsorbing solids remains a challenge a simulation study on the adsorption of acv on magnetic nanoparticles was accomplished by hosseini nasr et al 12 in the case of smaller nanoparticle adsorbents acv was found to have interaction with fe 3 ions while in larger nanoparticle interaction was with fe 2 ozonation of acv and carboxy acv may lead to the formation of cofa more toxic products at ph 8 24 therefore ozonation as a single stage treatment of acv should be avoided titanium doped mesoporous ϒ al2o3 was used efficiently for the removal of acv using the catalytic ozonation process 15 though 65 toc removal was achieved complete mineralization was not reported acv was found to be intact when tio2 was used as a catalyst under visible light irradiation a small change in the concentration of acv was observed within 5 h even after 7 h of irradiation the toc concentration does not degrade whereas the complete degradation of acv could be achieved within 90 min 18 complete mineralization could not be achieved due to the formation of the persistent intermediates under visible light irradiation lower toxicity of the samples treated with uv254 h2o2 was observed along with higher acv removal in comparison to uv254 on living organisms 1 in freshwater photodegradation of acv was enhanced by nitration bicarbonation and dissolved organic matter 13 in seawater cl br and ionic strength does not affect the photolysis of acv photoelectrocatalysis using tio2 nanotube photo anodes has shown excellent results of 96 2 acv removal accomplished within 370 s 62 ozonation followed by activated carbon adsorption has been proved to be a reassuring technique however it has a high treatment cost 70 higher biotransformation of acv is reported in aerobic and anoxic conditions as compared to the anaerobic systems 68 table 5 biological treatment achieved degradation of less than 20 of acv in an anaerobic sludge system 67 acv gets transformed into carboxy acv irrespective of the initial concentration of acv and the presence of the ammonium salt it also does not depend on the type of metabolism it is subjected through 66 in research by 60 pharmaceutical degradation of acv was accomplished by a combination of mbr and ozonation the recycling mode of the ozonation reactor in mbr effluent made this hybrid process efficient to remove 99 of acv in the final effluent complete removal of acv has been achieved using biological processes 50 among combined removal techniques bio and photo transformation processes for acv were investigated by 19 b in such a treatment process biotransformation is the key removal mechanism for acv removal it was found that the staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr technique has high removal efficiency for the trace organic compounds as compared to asp 48 this makes it advantageous as it would decrease the burden on ro for removal of trace organic concentrations from the secondary treated wastewater if it is used as upstream for drinking water systems based on the recycling of municipal sewage treatment in sum while the adsorption separates and concentrates acv it does not mineralize it and the sorption time varies from 75 min 24 h with different adsorbents as they have varied affinities with the solute the process primarily appears to be physisorption requiring high contact time which could be driven by the low solubility of acv in water the controlled temperature was found to be 39 45 c modification of the adsorbent surface may increase rate and adsorption capacity resulting in a reduction of sorption time for industrial wastewater which has a low volume but highly concentrated it makes sense to concentrate through sorption and then chemically oxidize using any suitable aop spent adsorbent may be regenerated and recovered acv may further be concentrated to prepare veterinary drug for sewage where large volumes are involved separation or any other pre chemical treatment may not be economically feasible due to many competing species a practical approach would be to explore the effect of individual disinfectants commonly used for achieving coliform norms and devising a hybrid disinfection strategy to remove acv effectively such hybrid strategies have shown high efficacy in achieving total coliform norms with a simultaneous thm removal 71 73 incomplete degradation of acv by various techniques like ozonation photolysis chemical and biological degradation may lead to the formation of the more toxic compound s therefore it is necessary to completely mineralize acv before its discharge the extent of mineralization of bio refractory compounds has been estimated by toc analysis only however it needs to be analyzed by carrying out both cod and toc analyses of the sample at different intervals cod provides an oxidative state of available carbon in the sample however toc does not give this information ftir analysis of aqueous samples may also be carried out to ascertain the changing functional groups in the sample with time considering the formation of toxic intermediates during treatment the efficacy of different removal techniques must be compared by the estimation of the extent of mineralization achieved at different intervals 8 grey area and future perspectives there have been significant developments in detecting quantifying and removal of acv many problems however have remained unaddressed or partly comprehended some of them are mentioned in the following subsections 8 1 scarcity of data despite the extensive amount of usage of antivirals the available data and study are limited 74 the persistent nature of acv distinguishes them from other emerging contaminants ingested acv does not completely metabolize in the body therefore its presence in the aquatic environment affects aquatic life very little is known about the harmful effects of acv on humans through the water apparently in the absence of data on the adverse effects of acv on the endocrinal glands of humans acv has not been included in the list of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs by the un who and usepa to assess the losses of acv to the environment and to devise appropriate treatment systems for the plant effluent it is essential to provide public access to the production and consumption data along with information on the composition of waste streams emanating out from the manufacturing unit 8 2 occurrence the release of acv and its metabolites in the environment is of significant concern owing to the prospective ecosystem changes and imminent growth of antiviral resistance among the target organisms therefore intensive studies need to be made on the occurrence of acv and its metabolites in potential sources and water bodies expected to contain the contaminants 8 2 1 effluents of bulk drug manufacturing units the pharmaceutical industry utilizes the active pharmaceutical ingredients that are degradation resistant extremely persistent in the aqueous environment and or capable of adversely affecting aquatic organisms and human health acv is one such drug that needs to be quantified in industrial effluents 8 2 2 hospital and municipal wastewater a few research have reported the treatment of hospital wastewater containing various pharmaceuticals 75 76 however studies reporting the occurrence of acv in hospital and or municipal wastewater are limited 46 looking at the growth in humans and veterinary applications of acv in viral infections detailed further studies are required 8 2 3 lakes receiving urban and industrial wastewater many countries have recognized the pollution in surface and groundwater generated by pharmaceutical products as an environmental issue 77 78 thus research should be carried out on the presence of acv in lakes and rivers receiving urban and industrial wastewater 8 3 removal techniques 8 3 1 biological methods inhibition of biological processes due to the presence of acv in wastewater has already been reported 10 66 however the treatment of acv using specific microbial and fungal species strains has scarcely been reported so far it is imperative to discover suitable microbial strain for the degradation of acv into environmentally compatible products similar studies on the degradation of acv using a consortium of aerobic and or anaerobic microorganisms are also desirable studies on the growth of the microorganism population in the presence of acv and the impact of the wastewater matrix on the removal process should be made to know the process of adaptation 17 since biological processes are time consuming techniques should be improvised optimized to reduce the contact time studies on finding suitable enzymes for faster degradation of acv and determination of the kinetics are to be made 8 3 2 chemical oxidation chlorination and ozonation are principally used for disinfection these compounds can also oxidize emerging contaminants ozonation has efficacy towards the removal of bio refractory compounds 75 hydroxyl radicals are strong oxidizing reagents and exhibit faster oxidation responses than standard oxidants such as kmo4 or h2o2 79 literature for removal of acv using ozonation is scarce 24 hence studies on the removal of acv using ozone can be useful chlorination has been reported to efficiently remove antibiotics 80 therefore a study on chlorination of acv may also be attempted though h2o2 is not a strong oxidant however it is a benevolent compound as it gets converted into water and reactive nascent oxygen through a slow decomposition reaction oxidation of acv using h2o2 has not been reported so far a study on degradation and mineralization of acv using h2o2 may be carried out and optimal concentration of h2o2 for maximum acv degradation be estimated 8 3 3 adsorption activated carbon ac has proven efficient for acv removal 8 11 ac is supposed to be more efficient because of its higher surface area the removal efficiency of ac can be further enhanced by functionalizing it with some acid base or metallic compounds the efficacy of the adsorption process is profoundly affected by the type and properties of the adsorbent and waste stream compositions biochars has an almost ac like porous framework and can therefore act as an effective adsorbent to remove acv from wastewater other adsorptive materials that can be used for the treatment of acv contaminated water are clay minerals singe and multi walled carbon nanotubes functionalized carbon nanotubes solvent impregnated resins silica and alumina the solution ph plays a critical role in adsorptive removal of contaminants therefore it must be a parameter of such studies additional studies are required for the development of low cost efficient methods for regeneration of spent adsorbents the adsorption kinetics determines the size and in turn the capital cost of the treatment system required for commercial uses along with the removal rate 81 therefore adsorption kinetics should also be considered 8 3 4 photolysis solar photolysis photochemical degradation of compounds generates hydroxyl radicals without using chemicals and is mildly affected by ph variation different studies indicate that acv may undergo photodegradation as it contains aromatic rings and certain functional groups that enable uv solar radiation to be absorbed or to generate photosensitive species responses that may cause photodegradation in aqueous media 13 64 more focus is to be paid on solar photolysis than uv photolysis as uv irradiation is an expensive process uv is used for disinfection of sewage a marginally higher contact time doze and or use of polychromatic uv may be explored as a viable option for acv removal in wwtp solar rays have earlier been proved successful for the removal of acv 64 hence applying long lasting advanced uv sources such as light emitting diodes leds can indeed reduce the costs of conventional uv lamps significantly therefore studies on led irradiation for removal of acv may be attempted moreover the impact of dissolved organic matter on the removal and mineralization of acv by uv or uv h2o2 processes need to be investigated 8 3 5 advanced oxidation processes aops have been effectively used to oxidize several organic compounds making the process versatile in usage slower degradation may result from either a low or an overdose of photocatalyst 82 therefore experiments focusing on optimum catalyst dose need to be conducted for acv degradation tio2 can boost hydroxyl radical formation thereby improving the rate of the degradation process photocatalytic oxidation using different catalysts like zno cds wo3 and their suitable alloys can be developed and used such catalysts may also be applied as coatings on suitable matrices making them reusable due to the high electrical conductivity of the ions present in the electrolyte electrochemical oxidation has been proved to be a promising technique in the removal of acv though there are some drawbacks of using electrochemical oxidation for instance it has relatively high electrode costs and the concern of the formation of toxic tps therefore more studies overcoming these limitations are required one of the advanced oxidation processes cavitation effectively degrades bio refractory pollutants present in water using hydroxyl radicals cavitation involves the instantaneous formation of high energy micro cavities releasing up to 1018 kw m3 energy in a short duration of few milliseconds in liquid bulk 83 both types of cavitation viz acoustic or hydrodynamic can be applied for acv degradation fenton process has a drawback of generating undesirable iron sludge therefore studies on processes reducing sludge formation are imperative 8 3 6 reactive adsorption extensive work has been done on the removal of phenol 84 85 and dyes 30 using reactive adsorption but detailed studies on reactive adsorption of acv in batch mode have scarcely been reported complete mineralization of contaminants with a faster rate and less energy consumption has been observed using the reactive adsorption technique 30 therefore reactive adsorption can be proved to be a promising technique for the complete mineralization of acv as well however no work could be found in literature reporting relevant studies on packed bed also a more accurate prediction of breakthrough curves is eminent an approach must be developed to estimate modeling parameters for example diffusivity and mass transfer coefficient of the particle additional research can be done on the kinetics and thermodynamics of reactive adsorption of acv exploring catalysts based on metal components other than fe is required with high reactivity and low leaching rate for an effective and economical wastewater treatment process 8 3 7 thermal and non thermal plasma techniques plasma and non thermal plasma treatment of acv has been scarcely reported non thermal plasma produces in situ oxidizing species e g ozone hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide etc which helps in the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater 86 at low initial concentration the non thermal plasma technique has achieved 98 mineralization of verapamil 87 hence the treatment of acv may also be aimed at using a non thermal plasma technique the mineralization process is comparatively slower than the removal process and improves with an increase in input energy in the case of higher acv concentration in effluent the addition of catalysts or combining plasma with ozonation may enhance mineralization 8 3 8 membrane treatment technology ultrafiltration nano filtration and reverse osmosis have successfully been used to remove various organic bio refractory compounds from wastewater and may be tried for treatment of acv in the wastewater the reject stream contains highly concentrated water that is later discharged into the environment 88 hence there is a scope for in depth studies for the treatment of reject waste stream using a combination of sorption followed by chemical degradation 8 3 9 hybrid techniques integrated biological and chemical processes have proven efficient for the removal of bio refractory compounds in recent researches 89 90 acv degradation using a single treatment technique may not prove to be efficient for its removal ozonation when applied in the recirculation stream of mbr its removal efficiency for acv was found to be improved from 20 to 60 60 previous studies based on degradative removal have mainly focused on the removal aspect of acv only however removal may not result in complete mineralization and toxicity removal such techniques may leave behind degradation transformation products that may be less or more toxic than acv itself therefore future studies need to be focused on the complete mineralization of acv using combinational or hybrid techniques 8 4 green and economical technology development surface modification of adsorbents is an efficient way of increasing adsorptive capacity or inducing degradative potential for contaminants maximization of adsorbent ability by altering its surface structure with new functional groups to attain high selectivity and specificity are key to efficient contaminant removal several adsorbents have been used earlier in raw form or modified form 8 11 25 for the removal of acv to make the process more economical a study is required to exploit different natural adsorbents low cost adsorbents locally available biomass waste materials waste sludge high surface area nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphene sheets etc 81 commercially available high surface area pre functionalized adsorbing materials may also be studied the economics of removal techniques are site specific also therefore the selection of removal techniques must be done accordingly 8 5 reaction pathway elucidation elucidation of the reaction pathway is an important study to be conducted for different processes of degradation of acv from different degradation pathways one may detect the tps formed using hrms esi ms and nmr although 14 have elucidated the degradation pathway of acv using oxone and 59 explained photocatalytic degradation pathway degradation intermediates and reaction pathways for other techniques are also required tps may also be quantified by using techniques such as hplc understanding the chemistry of the formation of tps of acv and their process conditions need separate studies 8 6 removal of multicomponent mixture acv is barely present as a single contaminant in wastewater synergistic adverse effects of other ppcps present together may be higher on the ecological system the removal of a binary mixture of dyes has been carried out earlier 91 biotransformation studies on wastewater containing acv and penciclovir have also been reported 10 chemical and biological activities of multicomponent mixtures may result in such complicated effects that cannot be readily extrapolated from individual compounds composition and activity 43 therefore the multicomponent mixture of acv containing other ppcps need further detailed studies currently the focus of research on drug resistance is limited to the effect of a drug when it is present alone short or long term impacts of different multicomponent mixtures of acv present along with other pharmaceuticals on human health are not yet identified synergistic antagonistic impacts of pharmaceuticals with acv should be anticipated following what has been reported in ecotoxicological studies on aquatic life in combination with organic contaminant mixtures 43 studies on synergistic and antagonistic effects of different combinations of pharmaceutical drugs used as antiepileptic nsaid antibiotics antidepressants vasodilators etc along with acv may bring about interesting results 8 7 mathematical modeling studies modeling studies on the removal of different organic contaminants from water in batch and continuous systems have been reported earlier 84 92 93 modeling for removal of acv and contaminants from a multicomponent mixture is also imperative there is a need to create thermodynamic models capable of analyzing simultaneous physisorption and chemisorption and to create isotherm models capable of describing the chemisorption mathematical models predicting the effects of wastewater characteristics and operating conditions on the removal of acv ought to be developed mathematical models are also required to evaluate the impact of the initial concentration of influent acv on treatment plant efficiency mathematical models predicting health effects on the people consuming water contaminated with acv will also be useful such a model will promptly estimate possible epidemic occurrence the scope of ecological effects resulting because of an abrupt deluge of antiviral into nature may also be modeled 8 8 toxicological studies the growing application of acv warrants a systematic study on toxicological studies on the aquatic and terrestrial environment assessment of the toxicity levels of degradation products at different levels of treatment need to be conducted by biologists 8 9 miscellaneous there is ample scope for the development of simple inexpensive analytical methods that may effectively detect and accurately quantify acv in higher concentrations along with its metabolites it has also been reported that analytical techniques for some of the tps of certain pharmaceuticals are not available 39 hence analytical quantitative detection techniques need to be developed for such tps considering the quantity of waste generation and the costs associated with their safe disposal process wastes need to be converted into wealth thus another part of future studies is to assess the commercial importance of undesirable products for producing valuable organic substances and industrially important inorganic chemical byproducts by their further processing there is a vast scope for research in different separation processes for producing pure chemicals here carboxy acv a tp formed due to biodegradation of acv can be degraded to cofa by ozonation the degradation process for cofa is not available 22 hence studies are required to find techniques for effective degradation and mineralization of cofa 9 conclusion the occurrence of small concentrations of acv has been found in different water bodies across the globe and has attracted the attention of researchers even trace concentrations of acv in the aquatic environment have highly adverse health effects on living beings in general and drug resistance in particular based on available dose response data acv has not been enlisted as an edc or a carcinogen however more studies in this respect are warranted its presence in water bodies is of immediate concern due to its ecotoxicological effects on the environment though analytical techniques for quantification of acv are available the development of simple and economical methods for the higher concentration of acv is required a review of various acv removal techniques indicates that in most of the work removal was possible through partial degradation considering the growing use of acv and the toxic nature of its tps and its resultant occurrence in industrial and municipal wastewaters there is an urgent need for the development of techniques that can efficiently mineralize acv present in water the presence of acv with some other drugs in water has its synergistic effects these need to be worked out being a relatively newer molecule among antimicrobial drugs and its wide applications among all antiviral drugs wide ranging research studies are needed on toxicological and thermodynamic aspects and modeling and simulation studies however there is a need to improve research and development activities in line with the adoption mode of action and consequences of acv for new and economical treatment technologies for a viable removal technology to find application sight specific factors such as electricity costs space and solar energy availability must be considered declaration of competing interest the authors
