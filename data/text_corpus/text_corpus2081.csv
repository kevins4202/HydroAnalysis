10405,the performance of irrigation schemes around the world has been below expectations the assessment of irrigation performance is an essential step towards improving agricultural water use one of the primary performance indicators is the relative irrigation supply ris the ratio between the amount of water delivered and the crop net irrigation requirements this study presents a worldwide analysis of irrigation scheme performance by evaluating key attributes that influence the ris the analysis was based on a review of reports and scientific papers that yielded 264 cases belonging to 25 countries in six world regions the database was subjected to two types of statistical analysis k means clustering and analysis of covariance ancova the cluster grouped irrigation schemes which were characterized by low ris and advanced irrigation technology the ancova showed that the ris co varied significantly with the variation in precipitation delivery schedule on farm irrigation systems distribution network and region but not with the crop the ancova also showed that modern pressurized on farm irrigation systems and on demand distribution systems significantly improve ris the ancova general linear model had a good capacity to predict ris with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 83 keywords irrigation performance assessment relative irrigation supply localized irrigation

molden 2007 bodirsky et al 2015 davis et al 2016 gerten et al 2020 pastor et al 2019 furthermore the performance of irrigation schemes around the world has so far been below expected levels improving agricultural water use is therefore a necessary condition for sustainable development as optimal irrigation management is strongly associated with yield stability income gains and higher employment rates hussain 2007 the improvement of irrigation schemes must encompass both the delivery and the on farm systems localized irrigation has become the world s most valued irrigation technology however both its potential for saving water perry et al 2017 van der kooij et al 2013 and its adaptability for smallholders in developing countries venot et al 2018 wanvoeke et al 2015 are being questioned there is less of a debate on the benefits of flexible delivery in fact many irrigation schemes around the world are being modernized with the aim of improving their efficiency reliability and above all the flexibility of their delivery schedules burt and styles 2000 however flexible delivery services are usually associated with more sophisticated and expensive distribution systems and control equipment the assessment of irrigation scheme performance is therefore an essential primary step towards improving agricultural water use particularly for making decisions on modernization investments and management changes bos et al 2005 molden et al 1998 stressed the importance of benchmarking irrigation scheme performance to evaluate their internal and external processes in relation to best practice schemes usually within a peer group of schemes this allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices borgia et al 2012 garcía bolaños et al 2011 indicators are used to characterize the performance of complex irrigation systems cropping patterns and organizational settings through few and apprehensible input data available one of the primary performance indicators used to determine the suitability of the water irrigation supply for agricultural production is the relative irrigation supply ris defined as the ratio between the amount of water delivered and the crop s net irrigation requirement the ris gives an indication of the condition of over or under irrigation depending on how closely supply and demand are matched molden et al 1998 applying an amount of water greater or less than the net irrigation requirements does not imply good or bad irrigation deficit irrigation ris 1 may be an intended strategy fereres and soriano 2007 applying more water than the required to ensure potential crop evapotranspiration ris 1 may be necessary to leach salts ayers and westcot 1985 letey et al 2011 or a planned groundwater recharge strategy to guarantee the water supply during periods of water shortage however the net irrigation requirement is an objective water depth useful as a reference in contextual performance assessments either as target irrigation depth or as a baseline on which over or under irrigation strategies are based the objective of this study was to carry out an analysis of irrigation performance across world regions by evaluating the key irrigation scheme attributes that may influence the ris indicator the analysis used data extracted from an extensive and systematic review of published reports and scientific papers the goals were to understand where we currently stand with respect to the productive utilization of land and water to compare the relative performance of the various types of systems and to identify possible avenues for performance improvement 2 material and methods 2 1 literature search and review the analysis consisted of a bibliographic review of scientific documents and technical reports conducted through the search engines google scholar https scholar google com and scopus https www scopus com the first step was to make a search of documents that contained the exact phrase relative irrigation supply in any part of the document the second step was to filter all the documents providing quantitative information related to relative irrigation supply the search and filter yielded 343 documents out of which only 29 presented quantitative ris data for one or several cases the information on the irrigation schemes found in the selected papers was organized in a matrix with quantitative and categorical variables in columns and cases in rows one case consisted of one ris value for a given irrigation scheme and year plus the records of the variables the variables commonly found in the selected papers were classified as documentary reference authors year of publication title sources and keywords geographical country region latitude and longitude climatic annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration irrigation water source type of collective distribution system on farm irrigation systems delivery schedule crops and crop management irrigation depth relative water supply relative irrigation supply with irrigation water supply measured at the system entrance or the farms inlet water delivery capacity years of evaluation the common specific variables that we considered relevant as descriptive of the irrigation schemes and indicative of their performance were relative irrigation supply precipitation latitude region type of distribution system delivery schedule on farm irrigation systems and crops table 1 precipitation and latitude were continuous predictors and the rest were categorical predictors not all of the relevant variables were available for the selected cases if the records of three or less of them were missing they were treated as missing data in the statistical analyses if more than three records of relevant variables were missing the case was discarded the final database comprised 264 cases 2 2 statistical analyses the statistical analysis had two objectives the first one was to group the cases with similar characteristics according to the set of relevant variables and their relation with ris for this purpose we conducted a k means cluster analysis preceded by a partial least square pls regression the second objective was to find the relationship between ris and the independent variables describing the irrigation schemes for this objective we used a general linear model of covariance ancova both statistical analyses were performed using the statistics software package statistica tibco software 2017 the k means clustering is a vector quantification method which aims to divide n observations our cases into k groups in which each observation belongs to the group with the nearest mean which acts as a prototype of the group the coordinates used for the k means clustering were previously obtained from a pls regression pls reduces the large number of predictor variables to a few components similarly to what is done by the principal component analysis pls is used when the number of predictor variables is large the amount of data is limited and there is multi collinearity between the predictor variables the objective function of the k means clustering was to minimize the variance within the clusters defined as the squared distance between each centre and its assigned data points macqueen 1967 the dataset used for the pls and cluster analyses contained 234 cases resulting from the elimination from the full database 264 cases of the cases with more than two missing data and 6 outliers cases falling outside the limits of normality the ancova was applied to evaluate the relationship between the ris dependent variable and the categorical predictors region crops on farm irrigation system delivery schedule and distribution network having precipitation as a covariate categorical predictors that had an effect on ris were subjected to a tukey s post hoc analysis to test for differences between levels in order to meet the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions the ancova was performed ignoring the 6 outliers detected in the pls analysis cases with any missing data were also eliminated so that the resulting dataset used contained 115 cases 3 results the database comprised 264 cases pertaining to 25 countries in 6 regions fig 1 the largest data set belonged to europe 124 cases followed by the middle east and north africa region 47 cases southeast asia 38 cases latin america 28 cases sub saharan africa 21 cases and hindustan 6 cases we did not find any cases in north america where the ris indicator is rarely used in their irrigation literature the final dataset is available as supplementary material 3 1 k means clustering the pls identified two significant components that together explained 41 9 of the variance in ris table 2 component 1 explained 31 4 of the variance of ris and component 2 explained 10 5 the contribution of other components was not significant the attributes contributing positively to component 1 were in this order pipe distribution network sprinkler plus localized on farm irrigation system on demand delivery schedule latitude and tree crops table 3 the attributes contributing negatively were in this order rice crops surface and surface plus sprinkler on farm irrigation system open channel distribution network and arranged delivery schedule table 3 negative values of component 1 were associated with low values of ris and technologies that in principle favour the efficient use of water while positive values were associated with higher ris and on farm irrigation systems with less efficient technologies therefore it could be interpreted that component 1 represented the irrigation technology level the main attributes positively contributing to component 2 were tree crops open distribution network and precipitation whereas the main negative contributors were a combination of open and closed conduits in the distribution network greenhouse crops and tree plus arable crops table 3 we could not find such a clear interpretation of component 2 as we did for component 1 which was expectable given its scant contribution to the explanation of the variance table 2 the k means clustering allowed the grouping of the cases into three distinctive clusters fig 2 cluster a was in the quadrant of positive component 1 and component 2 cluster b was located in the quadrant corresponding to positive component 1 and negative component 2 and cluster c was in the negative side of component 1 table 4 summarizes the main characteristics of the three clusters identified cluster c grouped the cases with the more advanced irrigation technologies localized and sprinkler irrigation frequently associated with pipe distribution networks and on demand delivery most of them located in europe mean ris in cluster c was 0 79 clusters a and b were less distinctive they included the cases with rice as the main crop localized irrigation and on demand delivery were uncommon reported only in a few cases in southern italy in clusters a and b ris took higher values means of 2 34 and 1 90 in clusters a and b respectively and were much more variable than in cluster c fig 2 also shows six outliers detected by the pls these six cases belonged to southern italy and were characterized by a mix of surface and sprinkler on farm irrigation systems a rotation water delivery schedule a combination of pipes and open channels in the distribution network and a mix of fruit trees and arable crops zema et al 2018 3 2 ancova the model explained 83 of the variance r2 in ris precipitation delivery schedule on farm irrigation systems distribution network and region were significantly related to ris whereas no effect of crop was detected table 5 regarding the on farm irrigation system the average ris in the cases using a combination of localized and sprinkler systems was below one 0 62 and significantly lower than in any other irrigation system fig 3 the cases with localized or sprinkler on farm systems showed similar average ris and close to unity 1 08 and 1 57 respectively by contrast the cases with surface irrigation presented the highest average ris on average water supply was more than twice the net irrigation requirements the group of cases with on demand delivery showed a mean ris below one 0 95 which was significantly lower than the ris of the group of cases with arranged rotation or fixed rotation delivery schedules fig 4 interestingly the mean ris for the cases under fixed rotation 2 11 was less than that of the cases with more flexible delivery mean ris of 2 68 for arranged rotation the analysis revealed that the type of water distribution network also significantly influences the ris fig 5 the irrigation schemes with pipe distribution systems gave the lowest mean ris 0 79 networks composed of open channels and closed pipes had a mean ris of 2 14 and distribution networks only with open channels showed an average of ris of 2 59 although the mean ris of these two groups were not statistically different the results in fig 4 were coherent with those in fig 5 since on demand delivery usually requires closed distribution networks whereas most open channel networks are operated under rotation schedules however this comparison should be taken with caution because while in the 63 cases of piped distribution systems the water supply was measured at the farm entrance in the cases with distribution systems composed of open channels or of open channels and pipes the water supply was measured either at the farm entrance 17 cases or at the system head 35 cases we recognize that the measurements at the system head integrate some upstream water losses that do not take place when the measurements are taken at the farm entrance in the cases with open channel distribution system the measurement of the water supply at the head of the system or at the farm entrance did not imply significant differences in ris however the 10 cases with open channels combined with pipes and water supply measured at the system head presented an average ris that was significantly higher than the average ris of the 7 cases with the same type of distribution system but water supply measured at the farm entrance a ris of 2 9 vs a ris of 1 1 ris differed between regions with europe and southeast asia showing the lowest 1 07 and the highest 4 73 ris values respectively fig 6 the eu dataset presented 4 outliers that were 4 of the 10 cases reported by zema et al 2018 it should be remembered that the other 6 cases were not included in the ancova after being signalled as outliers by the pls finally ris increased with precipitation as shown in fig 7 higher ris when rainfall is significant is an expected result for instance if it rains after a well timed irrigation then ris appears high but irrigation scheduling was actually good the ancova indicated that the ris did not statistically differ between types of crops table 5 nonetheless in fig 8 we present the median values of ris and their variation for the 4 types of crops considered in the analysis the median value of ris of the cases in which rice was the main crop was higher than the ris in those in which it was not the lack of a crop effect could be because rice is commonly associated to tropical regions e g southeast asia and sub saharan africa and regions of high rainfall two variables whose effects were already detected by the ancova the general linear model ancova resulted in the ris predictive equation 1 ris α βpp β1x1 β2x2 βnxn where α is the intercept p is annual precipitation mm βp is the regression coefficient for p and β1 2 n are the regression coefficients for corresponding effects x1 2 n that for categorical attributes may take the values of 1 or 0 if the effect applies or not respectively the coefficients were adjusted using 86 randomly selected cases out of the 115 cases used in the ancova coefficients are shown in table 6 the remaining 29 cases were used for validation of the model fig 9 shows the ris calculated with eq 1 vs the values observed for the 86 cases used in the adjustment of the ancova general linear model and the 29 cases used in the validation represented with filled and open symbols respectively the ancova model had a good capacity to predict ris with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 83 the root mean square error of the calculated ris was 0 53 and 0 63 for the datasets used for adjusting and validating the model respectively 4 discussion the pls technique was applied to a large dataset of cases using ris as a dependent variable and key irrigation scheme features as predictor ones the clusters of similar cases that were identified based on the principal components obtained by the pls regression were characterized by their technological level fig 2 table 4 moreover the ancova detected significant differences in ris between groups of cases sharing key irrigation scheme technological features table 5 therefore ris an indicator of relatively recent usage molden et al 1998 has proven to be able to detect the differential performance of irrigation schemes around the world although it does not capture all the nuances that the well established irrigation efficiency does burt et al 1997 israelsen 1950 it is easier to determine and it offers a first general approximation of irrigation performance namely it points to the possibility of significant water losses or overirrigation ris 1 or underirrigation ris 1 the on farm irrigation system clearly affected the ris sprinkler and localized systems performed similarly and much better than the surface system fig 3 the superiority of the two pressurized systems vs surface irrigation was expected and in consonance with the results in other regional comparative assessments gonçalves et al 2015 however serra wittling et al 2019 reported that in all the french experiments comparing localized with sprinkler systems the former never used more water than the latter and in most experiments it used significantly less this was not contradictory with our results although it was interesting that in the irrigation schemes in which sprinkler and localized systems coexisted ris was lower than in the irrigation schemes with only one of two systems fig 3 the other noteworthy finding that could have a common basis was that the use of water with sprinkler irrigation that serra wittling et al 2019 reported to be normally higher than with drip irrigation ceased to be so as rainfall decreased while we observed that the ris increased as rainfall increased fig 7 although modern on farm irrigation technology is being questioned lately alonso et al 2019 perry et al 2017 wanvoeke et al 2015 our analysis showed that application uniformity and the ability to apply the required water depth characteristic of sprinkler and localized irrigation systems clearly helped to adjust the irrigation supply to the needs to expect benefits beyond the precise and uniform application of water e g to expect a reduction in consumptive use is to misunderstand irrigation engineering and agronomy moreover rebound effects are to be expected berbel and mateos 2014 pfeiffer and lin 2014 to blame irrigation technology for failure in environments where the conditions for its appropriation are not met is to ignore the basic principles for the selection of an appropriate technology burt and styles 2000 irrigation technology cannot substitute rural development or water governance planning it is true that modern technology like localized irrigation does not imply good performance venot et al 2018 but our global analysis showed a closer match between water supply and requirements where modern technology has been adopted as usual the challenges lie in selecting the appropriate technology and closing the irrigation performance gap by promoting professional advisory services mateos et al 2018 the global analysis also reflected the effect on the ris of the characteristics of the collective distribution system plusquellec 2009 stated that one of the main actions towards improving water productivity is the upgrading of hydraulic infrastructure replacing open channel networks by pressurized pipe lines even though our study lacks the necessary depth to analyse the water productivity mentioned by plusquellec 2009 it shows clearly that the adjustment between the water supply and the irrigation requirements in piped distribution networks was better than in open channel networks fig 5 however the substitution of open channels by pressurized pipes can be very expensive the group of european cases in our analysis showed the lowest ris fig 6 but this was thanks to considerable public investment in irrigation modernization berbel et al 2019 we do not advocate the systematic replacement of open channels by pipes but making a tailor made examination hsiao et al 2007 proposed a chain of efficiency framework to identify the component steps whose improvement would have the greatest impact on overall efficiency this could be a good approach for some irrigation schemes although the hydraulic complexity of others might require a deep understanding of their hydraulic connectivity mateos 2008 flexible delivery schedules could enhance on farm efficiency by allowing the farmers to apply the right amount of water at the right time adapted to the crop and the irrigation method and to limit uncertainties that induce over irrigation clemmens and molden 2007 our global analysis showed this effect fig 4 however greater flexibility is usually associated with pressurized pipe networks which as mentioned above are expensive two alternatives are the examination of existing open channels to exploit their full capacity for flexible delivery lozano et al 2010 lozano and mateos 2008 and the suggestion by clemmens 2006 to break complex networks down at key intermediate locations to reduce chaos and improve the delivery service to users on the same causality chain flexibility should be correlated with the economic performance of irrigation schemes styles and mariño 2002 clemmens 2006 although our database did not include economic performance to prove it the response of the ris with respect to the region fig 6 showed that the regions with acute water scarcity e g mena or the regions with substantial investments in modernization e g eu presented the lowest values of ris while the regions with limited access to irrigation technologies e g ssa al and sea showed a higher ris ris tended to increase with precipitation fig 7 and it had also a negative relationship with latitude fig 10 this pointed to the effect of climate factors but it could be an interaction with the fact that the countries with less access to irrigation technology are closer to the equator than the countries with more developed irrigation technology another reason could be the prevalence of rice cultivation in the tropical areas which is associated with high ris values besides the ancova and the cluster analysis that revealed a distinctive irrigation performance in relation to the key attributes of irrigation schemes the most relevant contribution in this global analysis was that of the general linear model in which the predictive capability of eq 1 was remarkable fig 9 a similar approach has recently been made by the u s government accountability office 2019 responding to congressional requests on the impact of irrigation technology on situations of water scarcity we believe that our glm may be useful for national and international development agencies aiming at making decisions on irrigation interventions 5 conclusion the relative irrigation supply indicator served to discriminate the performance of very different irrigation schemes worldwide the pls regression and the k means cluster analysis demonstrated that low ris values are one of the characteristics of the most technologically advanced irrigation schemes the ancova helped to understand which attributes of the irrigation schemes are contributing to ris being higher or lower the ancova demonstrated that modern pressurized on farm irrigation systems and on demand distribution systems significantly improve ris however the variation in the ris under the conditions in which it takes higher values was considerable indicating that there may be opportunities for improving some systems under those conditions thus closing the performance gap the predictive capability of the ancova general linear model eq 1 should be useful for national and international development agencies making decisions on appropriate on farm irrigation technology or on the modernization of collective irrigation systems in

in the ancova after being signalled as outliers by the pls finally ris increased with precipitation as shown in fig 7 higher ris when rainfall is significant is an expected result for instance if it rains after a well timed irrigation then ris appears high but irrigation scheduling was actually good the ancova indicated that the ris did not statistically differ between types of crops table 5 nonetheless in fig 8 we present the median values of ris and their variation for the 4 types of crops considered in the analysis the median value of ris of the cases in which rice was the main crop was higher than the ris in those in which it was not the lack of a crop effect could be because rice is commonly associated to tropical regions e g southeast asia and sub saharan africa and regions of high rainfall two variables whose effects were already detected by the ancova the general linear model ancova resulted in the ris predictive equation 1 ris α βpp β1x1 β2x2 βnxn where α is the intercept p is annual precipitation mm βp is the regression coefficient for p and β1 2 n are the regression coefficients for corresponding effects x1 2 n that for categorical attributes may take the values of 1 or 0 if the effect applies or not respectively the coefficients were adjusted using 86 randomly selected cases out of the 115 cases used in the ancova coefficients are shown in table 6 the remaining 29 cases were used for validation of the model fig 9 shows the ris calculated with eq 1 vs the values observed for the 86 cases used in the adjustment of the ancova general linear model and the 29 cases used in the validation represented with filled and open symbols respectively the ancova model had a good capacity to predict ris with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 83 the root mean square error of the calculated ris was 0 53 and 0 63 for the datasets used for adjusting and validating the model respectively 4 discussion the pls technique was applied to a large dataset of cases using ris as a dependent variable and key irrigation scheme features as predictor ones the clusters of similar cases that were identified based on the principal components obtained by the pls regression were characterized by their technological level fig 2 table 4 moreover the ancova detected significant differences in ris between groups of cases sharing key irrigation scheme technological features table 5 therefore ris an indicator of relatively recent usage molden et al 1998 has proven to be able to detect the differential performance of irrigation schemes around the world although it does not capture all the nuances that the well established irrigation efficiency does burt et al 1997 israelsen 1950 it is easier to determine and it offers a first general approximation of irrigation performance namely it points to the possibility of significant water losses or overirrigation ris 1 or underirrigation ris 1 the on farm irrigation system clearly affected the ris sprinkler and localized systems performed similarly and much better than the surface system fig 3 the superiority of the two pressurized systems vs surface irrigation was expected and in consonance with the results in other regional comparative assessments gonçalves et al 2015 however serra wittling et al 2019 reported that in all the french experiments comparing localized with sprinkler systems the former never used more water than the latter and in most experiments it used significantly less this was not contradictory with our results although it was interesting that in the irrigation schemes in which sprinkler and localized systems coexisted ris was lower than in the irrigation schemes with only one of two systems fig 3 the other noteworthy finding that could have a common basis was that the use of water with sprinkler irrigation that serra wittling et al 2019 reported to be normally higher than with drip irrigation ceased to be so as rainfall decreased while we observed that the ris increased as rainfall increased fig 7 although modern on farm irrigation technology is being questioned lately alonso et al 2019 perry et al 2017 wanvoeke et al 2015 our analysis showed that application uniformity and the ability to apply the required water depth characteristic of sprinkler and localized irrigation systems clearly helped to adjust the irrigation supply to the needs to expect benefits beyond the precise and uniform application of water e g to expect a reduction in consumptive use is to misunderstand irrigation engineering and agronomy moreover rebound effects are to be expected berbel and mateos 2014 pfeiffer and lin 2014 to blame irrigation technology for failure in environments where the conditions for its appropriation are not met is to ignore the basic principles for the selection of an appropriate technology burt and styles 2000 irrigation technology cannot substitute rural development or water governance planning it is true that modern technology like localized irrigation does not imply good performance venot et al 2018 but our global analysis showed a closer match between water supply and requirements where modern technology has been adopted as usual the challenges lie in selecting the appropriate technology and closing the irrigation performance gap by promoting professional advisory services mateos et al 2018 the global analysis also reflected the effect on the ris of the characteristics of the collective distribution system plusquellec 2009 stated that one of the main actions towards improving water productivity is the upgrading of hydraulic infrastructure replacing open channel networks by pressurized pipe lines even though our study lacks the necessary depth to analyse the water productivity mentioned by plusquellec 2009 it shows clearly that the adjustment between the water supply and the irrigation requirements in piped distribution networks was better than in open channel networks fig 5 however the substitution of open channels by pressurized pipes can be very expensive the group of european cases in our analysis showed the lowest ris fig 6 but this was thanks to considerable public investment in irrigation modernization berbel et al 2019 we do not advocate the systematic replacement of open channels by pipes but making a tailor made examination hsiao et al 2007 proposed a chain of efficiency framework to identify the component steps whose improvement would have the greatest impact on overall efficiency this could be a good approach for some irrigation schemes although the hydraulic complexity of others might require a deep understanding of their hydraulic connectivity mateos 2008 flexible delivery schedules could enhance on farm efficiency by allowing the farmers to apply the right amount of water at the right time adapted to the crop and the irrigation method and to limit uncertainties that induce over irrigation clemmens and molden 2007 our global analysis showed this effect fig 4 however greater flexibility is usually associated with pressurized pipe networks which as mentioned above are expensive two alternatives are the examination of existing open channels to exploit their full capacity for flexible delivery lozano et al 2010 lozano and mateos 2008 and the suggestion by clemmens 2006 to break complex networks down at key intermediate locations to reduce chaos and improve the delivery service to users on the same causality chain flexibility should be correlated with the economic performance of irrigation schemes styles and mariño 2002 clemmens 2006 although our database did not include economic performance to prove it the response of the ris with respect to the region fig 6 showed that the regions with acute water scarcity e g mena or the regions with substantial investments in modernization e g eu presented the lowest values of ris while the regions with limited access to irrigation technologies e g ssa al and sea showed a higher ris ris tended to increase with precipitation fig 7 and it had also a negative relationship with latitude fig 10 this pointed to the effect of climate factors but it could be an interaction with the fact that the countries with less access to irrigation technology are closer to the equator than the countries with more developed irrigation technology another reason could be the prevalence of rice cultivation in the tropical areas which is associated with high ris values besides the ancova and the cluster analysis that revealed a distinctive irrigation performance in relation to the key attributes of irrigation schemes the most relevant contribution in this global analysis was that of the general linear model in which the predictive capability of eq 1 was remarkable fig 9 a similar approach has recently been made by the u s government accountability office 2019 responding to congressional requests on the impact of irrigation technology on situations of water scarcity we believe that our glm may be useful for national and international development agencies aiming at making decisions on irrigation interventions 5 conclusion the relative irrigation supply indicator served to discriminate the performance of very different irrigation schemes worldwide the pls regression and the k means cluster analysis demonstrated that low ris values are one of the characteristics of the most technologically advanced irrigation schemes the ancova helped to understand which attributes of the irrigation schemes are contributing to ris being higher or lower the ancova demonstrated that modern pressurized on farm irrigation systems and on demand distribution systems significantly improve ris however the variation in the ris under the conditions in which it takes higher values was considerable indicating that there may be opportunities for improving some systems under those conditions thus closing the performance gap the predictive capability of the ancova general linear model eq 1 should be useful for national and international development agencies making decisions on appropriate on farm irrigation technology or on the modernization of collective irrigation systems in

10406,rainwater is a primary water source for the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau where an improved efficiency of rainwater utilization is crucial for sustainable agricultural development a new system comprised of rainwater harvesting concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipe and mulching rim was designed to sustain soil moisture at a proper level in rain fed orchards in the hilly and gully loess region of china this study monitored changes in soil moisture and distribution over soil profiles using four treatments a rim1 with two rainwater harvesting areas two infiltration pipes and film mulching b rim2 with one rainwater harvesting area one infiltration pipe and film mulching c film mulching fm only and d traditional apple orchard as a control treatment ck as a baseline in this experiment the results showed that mean soil moisture content smc in a range of soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for rim1 and rim2 treatments increased by 43 01 and 34 78 in 2018 and 30 55 and 26 41 in 2019 respectively dividing the soil vertical profile into three layers i e an easy changing layer 0 60 cm an increasing or decreasing layer 60 180 cm and a relatively steady layer 180 300 cm this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture the rim1 and rim2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of wetted areas over the whole soil layers the soil moisture was replenished to a horizontal distance of 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the rim1 treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1 5 m apart from the trunk under the rim2 treatment while the seasonal variation of smc in the easy changing soil layer 0 60 cm corresponded to precipitation consistently the smc in the deep soil layers 60 300 cm was not sensitive to precipitation as a result the treatments of rim1 rim2 and fm improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with those under the control treatment in particular the rim1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study the results highlighted the efficiency of the rim system in enhancing the soil moisture which may be useful to improve an orchard production for rain fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of china keywords rainwater harvesting systems precipitation soil moisture rain fed orchards loess plateau 1 introduction soil moisture plays an important role in the water cycle in arid and semi arid regions feng et al 2012 gao et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the interrelationships between the biosphere and the atmosphere are mediated by soil moisture conditions vivoni et al 2008 in particular extremely limited precipitation in arid and semi arid regions results in a slow recharge to a deep soil layer and subsequently a water deficit for deep rooted trees pan et al 2015 therefore the soil moisture deficiency has strong impacts on the growth of fruit trees resulting in affecting fruit yield and quality in rainfed drylands li et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 china is the largest producer and consumer of apple in the world czernyszewicz 2016 in particular approximately 50 of apple production is supplied in the loess plateau in virtue of the suitable climatic conditions for apple planting huang et al 2001 most regions in the loess plateau are recognized as typical semi arid rain fed agricultural production areas shi et al 2019 many studies have demonstrated that agriculture production in the rainfed areas is significantly affected by climate variability due to the agricultural characteristics that the depth to groundwater table is usually about 20 300 m li and huang 2008 dryland farming is the typical agricultural practice and crop production entirely depends on natural precipitation without irrigation he et al 2016 soil moisture has become a primary factor that restricts the sustainable development of apple production in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau zhang et al 2011 as soil moisture consumption of apple trees is generally higher than that of other annual crops huang et al 2018 wang et al 2015b c the conversion of farmland to apple orchards may cause a higher requirement to consume deep soil moisture resulting in dried soil layer and subsequently affecting regional water cycle huang et al 2018 further long term apple planting may cause a decrease in groundwater level due to the reduced amount of groundwater recharge huang et al 2018 in literature it is demonstrated that apple orchards operated for 17 and 25 years decreased soil moisture in soil deeper than 3 m liu et al 2019 especially soil moisture within the apple orchards in the loess hilly and gully region was generally lower than 80 of field capacity zhang et al 2011 moreover the strong transpiration of apple trees accelerates soil moisture depletion gradually huang et al 2001 resulting in more severe soil moisture scarcity that causes restrictions on the further development of the apple industry in the loess plateau song et al 2018 to solve the problem of soil moisture scarcity numerous water saving techniques have been developed and applied in orchards around the world such as drip trickle irrigation agrawal and singhal 2015 micro irrigation darouich et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 and sprinkler systems agrawal and singhal 2015 darouich et al 2017 deng et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 however the applications of these techniques have been limited to test bed areas at a site specific scale rather than a large scale application such as the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau due to the complexity of the terrain and economic conditions song et al 2017 many techniques have been studied to enhance the soil moisture management for orchards on the loess plateau li et al 2016 song et al 2017 suo et al 2019 wang et al 2015a currently many studies on soil moisture saving and conservation technologies for apple orchards in the loess plateau have focused mainly on land surface cover technology chuai et al 2013 gao et al 2010 micro catchment and promote infiltration technology mao et al 2013 and a rainwater utilization system song et al 2017 the applications of these technical measures in the loess plateau improved the efficiency of soil moisture use and yield of apple orchards as rainfall infiltration recharge is the main source of soil moisture in apple orchards on the loess plateau zhang et al 2011 it is a key issue in soil moisture management how to fully utilize rainwater resources to replenish the soil moisture deficit of orchards hence a new system comprised of rainwater harvesting concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipe and mulching rim has been designed to be adapted to topographical characteristics of apple orchards and meteorological factors of the study area e g precipitation and air temperature this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of the rim system with regard to improving soil moisture conditions by thoughtful analyzing soil moisture regulations for different treatments applied to rain fed orchards on the loess gully and hilly region of china the spatial characteristics and seasonal variation of soil moisture were also examined for each treatment in experimental orchards furthermore the apple yield and crop water productivity for all treatments were evaluated to quantitatively validate the efficiency of the rim system the objective of this study is to explore an efficient way to enhance rainwater management and subsequently to increase the crop water productivity and yield of orchards in arid semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the rim system was applied to apple orchards in the zhifanggou watershed of ansai county shaanxi province china 109 13 03 109 16 46 e 36 46 28 36 46 42 n the zhifanggou watershed is a typical catchment located in the hilly gullied loess area which has a drainage area of 8 7 km2 qiu et al 2012 slope ranging from 0 to 65 and the altitude ranging from 1010 to 1431 m zhao et al 2016 the watershed is typically affected by a semiarid climate with an annual mean air temperature of 8 8 c 23 6 to 36 8 c and an average of 157 frost free days xu et al 2018 the average annual precipitation is 543 mm and approximately 70 of annual precipitation occurs from june to september due to the monsoon climate luo et al 2019 the annual potential evaporation ranges from 1010 to 1400 mm zhao et al 2017 the soil type within the study area is huangmian soil calcaric cambisols fao 1990 which is comprised of sand 21 6 silt 63 3 and clay 16 4 respectively ye et al 2018 the soil bulk density within the soil depth of 0 60 cm is 1 21 1 44 g cm3 in the experimental field the fushi apple orchard malus pumila mill a drainage area of 980 m2 with a stand age of 12 years old trees in july 2017 was selected to take into account the distribution canopy structure tree architecture of the apple trees and the orchard area for this study the trees were planted on a level terrace with a 5 m spacing within and between rows the topographical characteristics of the apple orchard are a level terrace at the south north direction and a very flat area slope 0 daily precipitation was collected by adjacent meteorological stations to measure the influence of precipitation on soil moisture fig 1 2 2 design of rim systems the complete rim system consists of three parts 1 rainwater harvesting area to collect rainfall 2 concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipes to promote rainfall infiltration and 3 film mulching to preserve soil moisture fig 2 rainwater harvesting area is a circular area in which the height increases from the center to margin and it collects a quarter of rainfall under the canopy for the convenience of collecting rainwater under the canopy the vertical projection areas of the canopy were divided into four areas at the center of trunks where each divided area is regarded as a rainwater harvesting area the material of the concentrating infiltration pipe is a pvc pipe with a dimension of 60 cm length by 12 cm diameter holes 2 cm apart with a diameter of 0 5 cm were drilled on the wall of the tube at different locations to promote infiltration over soil depths the infiltration pipe was placed vertically at the center of each rainwater harvesting area the surrounding space around this tube was filled with undisturbed soil as black plastic mulch is more effective to reduce evaporation zheng et al 2017 a black polyethylene film 1 2 m wide and 0 01 mm thick was used as soil surface mulch which covered the width of the canopy 2 3 experimental design and test method this study established four treatments as shown in fig 3 a rim1 comprised of two rainwater harvesting areas two infiltration pipes and film mulching were installed under the canopy b rim2 comprised of one rainwater harvesting area one infiltration pipe and film mulching were installed under the canopy c fm with only film mulching without infiltration pipe under the canopy and d ck without treatment under the canopy as a baseline depending on the spatial distribution of apple trees the experiments were conducted with different layouts of sample points with four trees for each treatment refer to fig 3 all treatments were implemented in september 2017 for various experiments the center of the rainwater harvesting area the location of concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipe is placed 1 5 m away from the trunk to measure the soil moisture content smc of each treatment soil moisture from the surface to a depth of 3 m was monitored from april to october in 2018 and 2019 smc volumetric was measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico bt tdr germany and the location of the 3 m trime access tubes is shown in fig 2 the distances between 3 m trime access tubes and the tree trunk were 0 8 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m in particular the tubes at 2 5 m were affected by the two trees fig 2 all of the access tubes were installed in september 2017 the smcs from the surface to a depth of 300 cm were measured at every 20 cm increments for each treatment the monthly smcs were measured over the apple growing season from april to october in 2018 and 2019 the smc was measured once a month on a day in the middle of each month the apple growing season was divided into five periods in a year depending on the characteristics of apple growth sprout period april blooming period may fruit expanding period june august fruit coloring period september and fruit maturation period october zhang et al 2019 the yield of apples from each treatment was evaluated after harvesting in the middle of october 2018 and 2019 the crop water productivity cwp kg mm 1 ha 1 was also calculated as follows suo et al 2019 1 c w p y p δ s where y is the yield of apple kg ha 1 p is the precipitation during the growth period of fruit trees mm and δ s is the difference of soil water storage between the end and start of the growth period of fruit trees mm the soil water storage d w mm was calculated as follows 2 d w θ v h where θ v is the average of soil moisture content in three locations for each tree and h is the soil layer thickness mm the underground water table was at more than 50 m below the ground level in the experiments investigated in this study furthermore there is no surface runoff during this study period thus the recharge of underground water and surface runoff were neglected moreover the deep percolation was also neglected due to the limited precipitation and root zone water uptake in this region 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using spss v 17 0 ibm company and microsoft excel 2016 microsoft redmond usa software duncan s multiple range tests with a significant level at p 0 05 were conducted to identify significant differences of smc the apple yield and the crop water productivity between the treatments 3 results 3 1 the difference of average annual smc of each treatment in 0 300 cm soil layer table 1 shows the average annual smcs in a soil layer depth between 0 and 300 cm for each treatment the average annual smcs for rim1 and rim2 treatments were significantly higher than that of ck treatment during the growing season in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 while no significant difference in the smcs for fm and ck treatments was found in this study compared with the smcs of ck treatment during the growing season the average annual smcs of rim1 and rim2 increased by 43 01 and 30 55 in 2018 respectively while by 34 78 and 26 41 in 2019 in addition the coefficient of variation cv for the average annual smcs driven by different treatments ranged from 8 75 to 20 33 most treatments were mediate variation intensity while showing a lower variation intensity from the rim2treatment in 2018 3 2 smc in the soil profile the average smcs during the growing season in 2018 and 2019 showed the same vertical change over the soil layer of 0 300 cm fig 4 a 4c the smc for rim1 and rim2decreased first at shallow soil layers then increased at the mediate soil layers and finally tended to be stable in deeper soil layers while the fm and ck shows a gradually decreasing w shaped fluctuation the smcs within the upper soil layer of 0 60 cm strongly affected by meteorological conditions showed no prominent difference between the four treatments in contrast the smcs within the soil layer of 60 180 cm for the rim1 and rim2treatments increased rapidly over deeper soil depths while the fm and ck treatments showed a smaller change in the smcs the smcs within the soil layer of 180 300 cm for the fm and ck treatments were continued to decrease over the soil layer while the rim1 and rim2treatments showed a weak fluctuation in the smcs as expected the upper soil layers 0 60 cm showed the largest coefficient of variation cv while the cv decreased over the soil layers for all treatments fig 4b 4d the cv of smc for the different soil layers ranged from 4 70 to 30 71 which belongs to a low variation and middle variation intensity in the present study the vertical changes of the smc were divided into three layers in the soil profile based on smc changes and coefficient of variation i e an easy changing layer 0 60 cm increasing or decreasing layer 60 180 cm and relatively steady layer 180 300 cm 3 3 the spatial variation characteristics of smc the vertical and horizontal distributions of the smc that is the average during this study period for the four treatments showed significant differences with consistent spatial characteristics for different growing seasons under the same treatment as shown in fig 5 in the rim1treatment fig 5a soil moisture was replenished to a greater spatial extent it is noteworthy that the soil moisture at 0 8 m apart from the trunk was not replenished over the whole vertical soil layer from 0 cm to 300 cm while soil moisture at 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer of 60 300 cm was replenished more the rim2 treatment fig 5b showed a similar vertical smc distribution as that of rim1 for the soil layer of 0 300 cm at 0 8 m apart from the trunk the soil moisture 1 5 m apart from the trunk was replenished in the soil layer of 60 300 cm while no replenishment at 2 5 m apart from the trunk was found in the soil layer of 60 180 cm for the fm treatment fig 5c the smc at different distances to trunk showed higher values in the soil layer of 0 20 cm there were two soil layers 40 80 cm and 140 300 cm that showed the higher smcs 1 5 m apart from the trunk for the ck treatment fig 5d smcs at 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk showed relatively high values in the soil layers of 0 140 cm and 0 20 cm respectively while there were no significantly higher smcs at 0 8 m apart from the trunk 3 4 the seasonal variation of smc the smc that is the average at different locations for each month significantly varied with seasonal changes along the soil layers for each treatment fig 6 over the growing seasons in 2018 the smc variation in the soil layer of 0 60 cm was consistent with the precipitation for each treatment the smc usually decreased in the order of fruit expanding period fruit coloring period sprout period fruit maturation period and blooming period in the soil layer of 60 100 cm the smcs during the blooming and fruit expanding period were lower than those during other three periods except for the ck treatment that showed lower smcs during the blooming and fruit maturation period in the soil layer of 100 300 cm the smcs during the fruit coloring period for all treatments were significantly higher than those for other periods the smcs in the soil layer of 0 60 cm during the growing seasons in 2019 varied with the four treatments investigated in this study the smcs for the fm and ck treatments showed the same change during fruit coloring period fruit maturation period fruit expanding period blooming period and sprout period the smcs of rim1 decreased in the order of fruit coloring period fruit maturation period sprout period fruit expanding period and blooming period the order of changes in the smc for rim2from large to small is fruit coloring period fruit expanding period fruit maturation period blooming period and sprout period the smc change in the soil layer of 60 100 cm for the fm and ck treatments was consistent with that in the soil layer of 0 60 cm the order of smc changes in the soil layer of 0 60 cm for rim1 was sprout period fruit maturation period fruit coloring period fruit expanding period and blooming period while fruit expanding period fruit maturation period fruit coloring period blooming period and sprout period for rim2 in the soil layer of 100 300 cm the smcs of all treatments were higher during the fruit expanding period than those during other periods except for the rim1 treatment the highest smc during the blooming period the replenishment of soil moisture during the rainy season occurred at different degrees along the soil layers for each treatment specifically soil moisture was replenished in the deep soil layer 60 300 cm by the rim1 and rim2 treatments while the replenishment was concentrated in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm by the fm and ck treatments 3 5 fruit yield and crop water productivity as shown in fig 7 a the yields of apple in the rim1 rim2 and fm treatments were significantly higher than that in the ck treatment p 0 05 the highest yield occurred in the rim1 treatment 22 860 kg ha 1 and 23 550 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively while the yields of 18 970 kg ha 1 and 19 100 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 for the ck treatment the rim1 treatment improved the apple yield by 20 51 and 23 30 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with those of the ck treatment the rim2 and fm treatments also improved the apple yield by 12 60 and 7 54 in 2018 and 12 41 and 6 54 in 2019 fig 7b illustrates the crop water productivity for all treatments investigated in this study as for the apple yield the crop water productivity for the rim1 treatment was significantly higher than that for the ck treatment p 0 05 in addition the rim2 and fm also improved the crop water productivity compared with the ck treatment but statistically not significant p 0 05 compared with ck treatment the rim1 treatment improved the crop water productivity by 30 75 and 21 88 in 2018 and 2019 while the rim2 and fm treatments did by 11 31 and 5 43 in 2018 and 9 02 and 3 84 in 2019 respectively these results indicate that the rim1 rim2 and fm treatments can efficiently improve the apple yield and the crop water productivity by the enhanced smc driven by the rim system 4 discussion 4 1 the affecting factors of the smc in rain fed orchards shallow soil moisture is strongly affected by rainfall transpiration and surface evaporation resulting in high fluctuation of the smc in arid and semi arid areas seneviratne et al 2010 song et al 2017 yang et al 2014 in this study the four treatments were under the same plant growth conditions i e the same meteorological conditions soil factors and field management therefore three main factors could influence the spatial distribution of soil moisture i e root system film mulching and infiltration pipe in this study the smc is strongly correlated with root systems as plant roots regulate their water absorption function to accommodate soil moisture environments with changes in plant rhizosphere green and clothier 1999 in this study the smc 0 8 m apart from the trunk in the soil layer of 0 120 cm was relatively low under the ck treatment fig 5d related studies showed that the lowest smc occurred in the same soil layer where the roots absorb most soil moisture for plant growth and transpiration wang et al 2015b therefore such phenomena may be caused by soil moisture absorption by apple roots mainly concentrated in this specific vertical and horizontal ranges recent research demonstrated that the roots of fruit trees were mainly concentrated within the soil layer of 0 100 cm in which the water absorption of about 94 33 occurred by apple roots concentrated in the soil layer of 0 80 cm ma and wang 2012 zhang et al 2002 in the horizontal dimension there were two peak areas 50 70 cm and 170 230 cm apart from the trunk with dense roots distribution hao et al 1998 this result is consistent with the study in this paper previous studies have shown that mulching techniques increase the smc and crop water productivity cao et al 2012 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2015a the effects of film mulching on the smc were analyzed by comparing the spatial distribution of smc under the fm and ck treatments fig 5c and 5d results showed that the smc in the soil layer of 0 20 cm was higher in the whole spatial extent fig 5c the fm treatment replenished water to the lower smc area driven by roots absorption fig 5c and 5d this result indicates that the film mulching can reduce soil evaporation resulting in an increase in the smc in the surface layer and apple trees rhizosphere the rim systems can significantly increase the extent of wetted areas in the whole spatial profile especially the spatial extent increment of wetted areas by rim1 was significantly larger than that by rim2 fig 5a and 5b the effects of replenishment by the rim system were prominent in the soil layer of 60 300 cm and the horizontal distance from the trunks between 1 0 m and 2 5 m this result may be caused by the fact that rainwater directly flows down into the infiltration pipe through a pipe wall with multi holed in which the infiltration pipe is placed relatively deep resulting in insufficient soil moisture replenishment in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm similar results have been found in the work of song et al 2017 in arid and semi arid areas the water uptake of fruit trees is mainly influenced by the smc lobet et al 2014 our results indicate that the rim systems enhance the ability of soil moisture infiltration to deeper soil layers thus the rim system is useful to mitigate the soil desiccation for apple orchards in the hilly and gully region of loess plateau 4 2 the relationships between seasonal variations of soil moisture and rainfall as rainfall is the main source of soil moisture in the loess plateau liu et al 2018 the seasonal fluctuation of soil moisture corresponds to rainfall temperature and light intensity etc to examine the seasonal dynamics in the smc previous studies divided a time window into different periods based on the seasonal change of soil moisture for example the annual variation of soil moisture was divided into four periods han et al 1990 1989 i e consuming period accumulating period lowering period and stable period in addition chen et al 2003 divided into five periods to investigate the seasonal variation of the smc accumulating period decreasing period restoring period stable period and consuming period in contrast wang et al 2006 divided into three periods to examine seasonal smcs of apple orchards a slow accumulation in autumn and winter an intense consumption in early summer and late spring and a fluctuation period in summer except for june to september the division of other stages is basically consistent with this study during the soil moisture consuming period soil evaporation and transpiration increased with an increase in air temperature meanwhile fruit trees begin to grow which may lead to a decrease in the smc due to a large depletion of soil moisture during this period during the soil moisture supplying period a large supply of soil moisture is driven by rainfall infiltration concentrated over this period we need to note that the rim system has the primary capacities of rainwater harvesting infiltration promoting and moisture holding thus the soil moisture rapidly increased during this period during the soil moisture fade away period more water demands occur for the fruits ripe process under less rainfall which is the main reason for soil moisture fade away previous studies showed that there are two high peak periods for the water consumption processes of apple trees the critical period of water requirement from april to june and the water consumption period of plant strong transpiration from july and august heng and yang 1980 it is consistent with the soil moisture variation under the ck treatment in this study while distinguishable from other treatments that replenish the soil moisture the smc corresponded to the precipitation and evaporation in the same season jia et al 1997 the annual variation of smc in the soil layer of 0 300 cm for all treatments was similar to each other while the monthly smc in the soil layer of 0 300 cm did not correspond to precipitation refer to fig 8 the fluctuation of smc in 2019 was larger than that in 2018 as heavier rainfall occurred in 2018 compared with rainfall in 2019 hess et al 2018 concluded that rainfall intensification may increase deep percolation and deep soil water content in cropping systems hess et al 2018 this study also showed that the variation of smc in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm was consistently dependent on precipitation indicating that the smc in the upper soil layer is more sensitive to rainfall which is the main influence factor on the smc in this layer below 60 cm the effect of rainfall on soil moisture becomes weaker xiao et al 2013 showed that the rainfall significantly replenishes the smc in the soil layer of 0 30 cm in terraced orchard while weaker effects on other soil layers xiao et al 2013 this study also proved that the rainfall is the main driver that influenced the soil moisture in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm the rim system enhances the soil moisture infiltration to deeper soil layers and efficiently distributes rainfall to preserve the soil moisture i e storing rainfall during the rainy seasons and replenishing during the consuming period therefore the rim system can improve the efficiency of soil moisture use in the loess hilly and gully region of china 4 3 the relationship between smc and plant growth there are many factors that affect plant growth and yield in particular rainwater and smc are crucial factors in the rain fed area tallon and si 2004 the rim system suggested in this study improved the apple yield and the crop water productivity in the apple orchard as the rim system considerably contributed to enhancing the ability to sustainably supply water demands for the plant growth by decreasing soil evaporation and increasing soil moisture storage moreover the rim system not only increased the size and depth of the wetted soil region but also enhanced the regulation of soil moisture reservoirs consequently it is a useful method to adapt the growth rhythm of apple trees to local climate conditions the morphological physiological and biochemical characteristics of plants are usually modified by the smc subsequently affecting plant growth and development sharma et al 2018 the intensity of tree growth also depends on the soil moisture many studies have shown that water stress is significantly related to stem diameter a net increase of total leaf area per plant and a net increase of plant dry weight fouad et al 1991 insufficient water supply i e high water stress may result in reducing tree growth yield and fruit quality al yahyai 2012 plant growth is inhibited when plants undergo a short term water deficit while plants overcompensate when the water supply is restored kou et al 2014 the shoot growth of apple trees is slow under soil moisture deficiency mpelasoka et al 2015 while developing stronger under sufficient soil moisture treder et al 1998 the process of water uptake in the root system is the key to effective water management gong et al 2006 in the plant root system the main component is fine roots 2 mm that actively interact between plant and soil song et al 2018 soil moisture availability is a crucial factor in the amount of root produced sokalska et al 2009 many studies have demonstrated that the fine root growth and distribution in the soil profile are positively correlated with changes in the smc powers et al 2005 shan et al 2009 zhou and shangguan 2007 moreover the more heavily watered treatment the higher the root growth abrisqueta et al 1994 more roots were concentrated in depths with a higher smc and then trees may modify their water uptake strategy according to the soil moisture profile within the rhizosphere green and clothier 1999 literatures have shown that the soil depth of 0 3 m can be considered as an active root zone for apple trees and an increase in smc corresponds to an increase in root biomass and root water uptake song et al 2017 however the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of soil moisture for the fine roots are not significant gan et al 2010 as this study demonstrated that the rim system enhance the smc and the crop water productivity in the apple orchard based on the four experimental designs it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate how these management practices affect the root growth and development 5 conclusions experimental applications of the rim system resulted in significant improvement in the smc for rain fed orchards in the loess plateau during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 the annual average soil moisture of the rim treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment in the soil layer of 0 300 cm compared with the ck treatment the annual average smc driven by the rim1 treatment increased by 43 01 and 34 78 respectively and by 30 55 and 26 41 by the rim2 treatment the vertical soil layers were divided into three parts 1 easy changing layer 0 60 cm 2 increasing or decreasing layer 60 180 cm and 3 relatively steady layer 180 300 cm the rim system induced an increase in the spatial extent of wetted areas under the same conditions especially the effects of the rim system on soil moisture replenishment were prominent over both horizontal and vertical soil layers in particular vertically at the deeper layers the increasing or decreasing layer and the relatively steady layer and horizontally at 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk this study also found that precipitation is a primary driver that influenced the smc in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm in contrast the smc was not sensitive to precipitation in the deep soil layers 60 300 cm and the seasonal variation of smc varied with all treatments investigated in this study compared with the ck treatment the rim1 rim2 and fm treatments improved the yield of apple and the crop water productivity in particular the rim1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study these results demonstrate that the rim system is useful to efficiently utilize rainwater resources for rainfed orchards in the hilly and gully regions of loess

10406,rainwater is a primary water source for the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau where an improved efficiency of rainwater utilization is crucial for sustainable agricultural development a new system comprised of rainwater harvesting concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipe and mulching rim was designed to sustain soil moisture at a proper level in rain fed orchards in the hilly and gully loess region of china this study monitored changes in soil moisture and distribution over soil profiles using four treatments a rim1 with two rainwater harvesting areas two infiltration pipes and film mulching b rim2 with one rainwater harvesting area one infiltration pipe and film mulching c film mulching fm only and d traditional apple orchard as a control treatment ck as a baseline in this experiment the results showed that mean soil moisture content smc in a range of soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for rim1 and rim2 treatments increased by 43 01 and 34 78 in 2018 and 30 55 and 26 41 in 2019 respectively dividing the soil vertical profile into three layers i e an easy changing layer 0 60 cm an increasing or decreasing layer 60 180 cm and a relatively steady layer 180 300 cm this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture the rim1 and rim2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of wetted areas over the whole soil layers the soil moisture was replenished to a horizontal distance of 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the rim1 treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1 5 m apart from the trunk under the rim2 treatment while the seasonal variation of smc in the easy changing soil layer 0 60 cm corresponded to precipitation consistently the smc in the deep soil layers 60 300 cm was not sensitive to precipitation as a result the treatments of rim1 rim2 and fm improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with those under the control treatment in particular the rim1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study the results highlighted the efficiency of the rim system in enhancing the soil moisture which may be useful to improve an orchard production for rain fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of china keywords rainwater harvesting systems precipitation soil moisture rain fed orchards loess plateau 1 introduction soil moisture plays an important role in the water cycle in arid and semi arid regions feng et al 2012 gao et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the interrelationships between the biosphere and the atmosphere are mediated by soil moisture conditions vivoni et al 2008 in particular extremely limited precipitation in arid and semi arid regions results in a slow recharge to a deep soil layer and subsequently a water deficit for deep rooted trees pan et al 2015 therefore the soil moisture deficiency has strong impacts on the growth of fruit trees resulting in affecting fruit yield and quality in rainfed drylands li et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 china is the largest producer and consumer of apple in the world czernyszewicz 2016 in particular approximately 50 of apple production is supplied in the loess plateau in virtue of the suitable climatic conditions for apple planting huang et al 2001 most regions in the loess plateau are recognized as typical semi arid rain fed agricultural production areas shi et al 2019 many studies have demonstrated that agriculture production in the rainfed areas is significantly affected by climate variability due to the agricultural characteristics that the depth to groundwater table is usually about 20 300 m li and huang 2008 dryland farming is the typical agricultural practice and crop production entirely depends on natural precipitation without irrigation he et al 2016 soil moisture has become a primary factor that restricts the sustainable development of apple production in the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau zhang et al 2011 as soil moisture consumption of apple trees is generally higher than that of other annual crops huang et al 2018 wang et al 2015b c the conversion of farmland to apple orchards may cause a higher requirement to consume deep soil moisture resulting in dried soil layer and subsequently affecting regional water cycle huang et al 2018 further long term apple planting may cause a decrease in groundwater level due to the reduced amount of groundwater recharge huang et al 2018 in literature it is demonstrated that apple orchards operated for 17 and 25 years decreased soil moisture in soil deeper than 3 m liu et al 2019 especially soil moisture within the apple orchards in the loess hilly and gully region was generally lower than 80 of field capacity zhang et al 2011 moreover the strong transpiration of apple trees accelerates soil moisture depletion gradually huang et al 2001 resulting in more severe soil moisture scarcity that causes restrictions on the further development of the apple industry in the loess plateau song et al 2018 to solve the problem of soil moisture scarcity numerous water saving techniques have been developed and applied in orchards around the world such as drip trickle irrigation agrawal and singhal 2015 micro irrigation darouich et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 and sprinkler systems agrawal and singhal 2015 darouich et al 2017 deng et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 however the applications of these techniques have been limited to test bed areas at a site specific scale rather than a large scale application such as the hilly and gully region of the loess plateau due to the complexity of the terrain and economic conditions song et al 2017 many techniques have been studied to enhance the soil moisture management for orchards on the loess plateau li et al 2016 song et al 2017 suo et al 2019 wang et al 2015a currently many studies on soil moisture saving and conservation technologies for apple orchards in the loess plateau have focused mainly on land surface cover technology chuai et al 2013 gao et al 2010 micro catchment and promote infiltration technology mao et al 2013 and a rainwater utilization system song et al 2017 the applications of these technical measures in the loess plateau improved the efficiency of soil moisture use and yield of apple orchards as rainfall infiltration recharge is the main source of soil moisture in apple orchards on the loess plateau zhang et al 2011 it is a key issue in soil moisture management how to fully utilize rainwater resources to replenish the soil moisture deficit of orchards hence a new system comprised of rainwater harvesting concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipe and mulching rim has been designed to be adapted to topographical characteristics of apple orchards and meteorological factors of the study area e g precipitation and air temperature this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of the rim system with regard to improving soil moisture conditions by thoughtful analyzing soil moisture regulations for different treatments applied to rain fed orchards on the loess gully and hilly region of china the spatial characteristics and seasonal variation of soil moisture were also examined for each treatment in experimental orchards furthermore the apple yield and crop water productivity for all treatments were evaluated to quantitatively validate the efficiency of the rim system the objective of this study is to explore an efficient way to enhance rainwater management and subsequently to increase the crop water productivity and yield of orchards in arid semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the rim system was applied to apple orchards in the zhifanggou watershed of ansai county shaanxi province china 109 13 03 109 16 46 e 36 46 28 36 46 42 n the zhifanggou watershed is a typical catchment located in the hilly gullied loess area which has a drainage area of 8 7 km2 qiu et al 2012 slope ranging from 0 to 65 and the altitude ranging from 1010 to 1431 m zhao et al 2016 the watershed is typically affected by a semiarid climate with an annual mean air temperature of 8 8 c 23 6 to 36 8 c and an average of 157 frost free days xu et al 2018 the average annual precipitation is 543 mm and approximately 70 of annual precipitation occurs from june to september due to the monsoon climate luo et al 2019 the annual potential evaporation ranges from 1010 to 1400 mm zhao et al 2017 the soil type within the study area is huangmian soil calcaric cambisols fao 1990 which is comprised

mill a drainage area of 980 m2 with a stand age of 12 years old trees in july 2017 was selected to take into account the distribution canopy structure tree architecture of the apple trees and the orchard area for this study the trees were planted on a level terrace with a 5 m spacing within and between rows the topographical characteristics of the apple orchard are a level terrace at the south north direction and a very flat area slope 0 daily precipitation was collected by adjacent meteorological stations to measure the influence of precipitation on soil moisture fig 1 2 2 design of rim systems the complete rim system consists of three parts 1 rainwater harvesting area to collect rainfall 2 concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipes to promote rainfall infiltration and 3 film mulching to preserve soil moisture fig 2 rainwater harvesting area is a circular area in which the height increases from the center to margin and it collects a quarter of rainfall under the canopy for the convenience of collecting rainwater under the canopy the vertical projection areas of the canopy were divided into four areas at the center of trunks where each divided area is regarded as a rainwater harvesting area the material of the concentrating infiltration pipe is a pvc pipe with a dimension of 60 cm length by 12 cm diameter holes 2 cm apart with a diameter of 0 5 cm were drilled on the wall of the tube at different locations to promote infiltration over soil depths the infiltration pipe was placed vertically at the center of each rainwater harvesting area the surrounding space around this tube was filled with undisturbed soil as black plastic mulch is more effective to reduce evaporation zheng et al 2017 a black polyethylene film 1 2 m wide and 0 01 mm thick was used as soil surface mulch which covered the width of the canopy 2 3 experimental design and test method this study established four treatments as shown in fig 3 a rim1 comprised of two rainwater harvesting areas two infiltration pipes and film mulching were installed under the canopy b rim2 comprised of one rainwater harvesting area one infiltration pipe and film mulching were installed under the canopy c fm with only film mulching without infiltration pipe under the canopy and d ck without treatment under the canopy as a baseline depending on the spatial distribution of apple trees the experiments were conducted with different layouts of sample points with four trees for each treatment refer to fig 3 all treatments were implemented in september 2017 for various experiments the center of the rainwater harvesting area the location of concentrating infiltration with multi holed pipe is placed 1 5 m away from the trunk to measure the soil moisture content smc of each treatment soil moisture from the surface to a depth of 3 m was monitored from april to october in 2018 and 2019 smc volumetric was measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico bt tdr germany and the location of the 3 m trime access tubes is shown in fig 2 the distances between 3 m trime access tubes and the tree trunk were 0 8 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m in particular the tubes at 2 5 m were affected by the two trees fig 2 all of the access tubes were installed in september 2017 the smcs from the surface to a depth of 300 cm were measured at every 20 cm increments for each treatment the monthly smcs were measured over the apple growing season from april to october in 2018 and 2019 the smc was measured once a month on a day in the middle of each month the apple growing season was divided into five periods in a year depending on the characteristics of apple growth sprout period april blooming period may fruit expanding period june august fruit coloring period september and fruit maturation period october zhang et al 2019 the yield of apples from each treatment was evaluated after harvesting in the middle of october 2018 and 2019 the crop water productivity cwp kg mm 1 ha 1 was also calculated as follows suo et al 2019 1 c w p y p δ s where y is the yield of apple kg ha 1 p is the precipitation during the growth period of fruit trees mm and δ s is the difference of soil water storage between the end and start of the growth period of fruit trees mm the soil water storage d w mm was calculated as follows 2 d w θ v h where θ v is the average of soil moisture content in three locations for each tree and h is the soil layer thickness mm the underground water table was at more than 50 m below the ground level in the experiments investigated in this study furthermore there is no surface runoff during this study period thus the recharge of underground water and surface runoff were neglected moreover the deep percolation was also neglected due to the limited precipitation and root zone water uptake in this region 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using spss v 17 0 ibm company and microsoft excel 2016 microsoft redmond usa software duncan s multiple range tests with a significant level at p 0 05 were conducted to identify significant differences of smc the apple yield and the crop water productivity between the treatments 3 results 3 1 the difference of average annual smc of each treatment in 0 300 cm soil layer table 1 shows the average annual smcs in a soil layer depth between 0 and 300 cm for each treatment the average annual smcs for rim1 and rim2 treatments were significantly higher than that of ck treatment during the growing season in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 while no significant difference in the smcs for fm and ck treatments was found in this study compared with the smcs of ck treatment during the growing season the average annual smcs of rim1 and rim2 increased by 43 01 and 30 55 in 2018 respectively while by 34 78 and 26 41 in 2019 in addition the coefficient of variation cv for the average annual smcs driven by different treatments ranged from 8 75 to 20 33 most treatments were mediate variation intensity while showing a lower variation intensity from the rim2treatment in 2018 3 2 smc in the soil profile the average smcs during the growing season in 2018 and 2019 showed the same vertical change over the soil layer of 0 300 cm fig 4 a 4c the smc for rim1 and rim2decreased first at shallow soil layers then increased at the mediate soil layers and finally tended to be stable in deeper soil layers while the fm and ck shows a gradually decreasing w shaped fluctuation the smcs within the upper soil layer of 0 60 cm strongly affected by meteorological conditions showed no prominent difference between the four treatments in contrast the smcs within the soil layer of 60 180 cm for the rim1 and rim2treatments increased rapidly over deeper soil depths while the fm and ck treatments showed a smaller change in the smcs the smcs within the soil layer of 180 300 cm for the fm and ck treatments were continued to decrease over the soil layer while the rim1 and rim2treatments showed a weak fluctuation in the smcs as expected the upper soil layers 0 60 cm showed the largest coefficient of variation cv while the cv decreased over the soil layers for all treatments fig 4b 4d the cv of smc for the different soil layers ranged from 4 70 to 30 71 which belongs to a low variation and middle variation intensity in the present study the vertical changes of the smc were divided into three layers in the soil profile based on smc changes and coefficient of variation i e an easy changing layer 0 60 cm increasing or decreasing layer 60 180 cm and relatively steady layer 180 300 cm 3 3 the spatial variation characteristics of smc the vertical and horizontal distributions of the smc that is the average during this study period for the four treatments showed significant differences with consistent spatial characteristics for different growing seasons under the same treatment as shown in fig 5 in the rim1treatment fig 5a soil moisture was replenished to a greater spatial extent it is noteworthy that the soil moisture at 0 8 m apart from the trunk was not replenished over the whole vertical soil layer from 0 cm to 300 cm while soil moisture at 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer of 60 300 cm was replenished more the rim2 treatment fig 5b showed a similar vertical smc distribution as that of rim1 for the soil layer of 0 300 cm at 0 8 m apart from the trunk the soil moisture 1 5 m apart from the trunk was replenished in the soil layer of 60 300 cm while no replenishment at 2 5 m apart from the trunk was found in the soil layer of 60 180 cm for the fm treatment fig 5c the smc at different distances to trunk showed higher values in the soil layer of 0 20 cm there were two soil layers 40 80 cm and 140 300 cm that showed the higher smcs 1 5 m apart from the trunk for the ck treatment fig 5d smcs at 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk showed relatively high values in the soil layers of 0 140 cm and 0 20 cm respectively while there were no significantly higher smcs at 0 8 m apart from the trunk 3 4 the seasonal variation of smc the smc that is the average at different locations for each month significantly varied with seasonal changes along the soil layers for each treatment fig 6 over the growing seasons in 2018 the smc variation in the soil layer of 0 60 cm was consistent with the precipitation for each treatment the smc usually decreased in the order of fruit expanding period fruit coloring period sprout period fruit maturation period and blooming period in the soil layer of 60 100 cm the smcs during the blooming and fruit expanding period were lower than those during other three periods except for the ck treatment that showed lower smcs during the blooming and fruit maturation period in the soil layer of 100 300 cm the smcs during the fruit coloring period for all treatments were significantly higher than those for other periods the smcs in the soil layer of 0 60 cm during the growing seasons in 2019 varied with the four treatments investigated in this study the smcs for the fm and ck treatments showed the same change during fruit coloring period fruit maturation period fruit expanding period blooming period and sprout period the smcs of rim1 decreased in the order of fruit coloring period fruit maturation period sprout period fruit expanding period and blooming period the order of changes in the smc for rim2from large to small is fruit coloring period fruit expanding period fruit maturation period blooming period and sprout period the smc change in the soil layer of 60 100 cm for the fm and ck treatments was consistent with that in the soil layer of 0 60 cm the order of smc changes in the soil layer of 0 60 cm for rim1 was sprout period fruit maturation period fruit coloring period fruit expanding period and blooming period while fruit expanding period fruit maturation period fruit coloring period blooming period and sprout period for rim2 in the soil layer of 100 300 cm the smcs of all treatments were higher during the fruit expanding period than those during other periods except for the rim1 treatment the highest smc during the blooming period the replenishment of soil moisture during the rainy season occurred at different degrees along the soil layers for each treatment specifically soil moisture was replenished in the deep soil layer 60 300 cm by the rim1 and rim2 treatments while the replenishment was concentrated in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm by the fm and ck treatments 3 5 fruit yield and crop water productivity as shown in fig 7 a the yields of apple in the rim1 rim2 and fm treatments were significantly higher than that in the ck treatment p 0 05 the highest yield occurred in the rim1 treatment 22 860 kg ha 1 and 23 550 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively while the yields of 18 970 kg ha 1 and 19 100 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 for the ck treatment the rim1 treatment improved the apple yield by 20 51 and 23 30 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with those of the ck treatment the rim2 and fm treatments also improved the apple yield by 12 60 and 7 54 in 2018 and 12 41 and 6 54 in 2019 fig 7b illustrates the crop water productivity for all treatments investigated in this study as for the apple yield the crop water productivity for the rim1 treatment was significantly higher than that for the ck treatment p 0 05 in addition the rim2 and fm also improved the crop water productivity compared with the ck treatment but statistically not significant p 0 05 compared with ck treatment the rim1 treatment improved the crop water productivity by 30 75 and 21 88 in 2018 and 2019 while the rim2 and fm treatments did by 11 31 and 5 43 in 2018 and 9 02 and 3 84 in 2019 respectively these results indicate that the rim1 rim2 and fm treatments can efficiently improve the apple yield and the crop water productivity by the enhanced smc driven by the rim system 4 discussion 4 1 the affecting factors of the smc in rain fed orchards shallow soil moisture is strongly affected by rainfall transpiration and surface evaporation resulting in high fluctuation of the smc in arid and semi arid areas seneviratne et al 2010 song et al 2017 yang et al 2014 in this study the four treatments were under the same plant growth conditions i e the same meteorological conditions soil factors and field management therefore three main factors could influence the spatial distribution of soil moisture i e root system film mulching and infiltration pipe in this study the smc is strongly correlated with root systems as plant roots regulate their water absorption function to accommodate soil moisture environments with changes in plant rhizosphere green and clothier 1999 in this study the smc 0 8 m apart from the trunk in the soil layer of 0 120 cm was relatively low under the ck treatment fig 5d related studies showed that the lowest smc occurred in the same soil layer where the roots absorb most soil moisture for plant growth and transpiration wang et al 2015b therefore such phenomena may be caused by soil moisture absorption by apple roots mainly concentrated in this specific vertical and horizontal ranges recent research demonstrated that the roots of fruit trees were mainly concentrated within the soil layer of 0 100 cm in which the water absorption of about 94 33 occurred by apple roots concentrated in the soil layer of 0 80 cm ma and wang 2012 zhang et al 2002 in the horizontal dimension there were two peak areas 50 70 cm and 170 230 cm apart from the trunk with dense roots distribution hao et al 1998 this result is consistent with the study in this paper previous studies have shown that mulching techniques increase the smc and crop water productivity cao et al 2012 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2015a the effects of film mulching on the smc were analyzed by comparing the spatial distribution of smc under the fm and ck treatments fig 5c and 5d results showed that the smc in the soil layer of 0 20 cm was higher in the whole spatial extent fig 5c the fm treatment replenished water to the lower smc area driven by roots absorption fig 5c and 5d this result indicates that the film mulching can reduce soil evaporation resulting in an increase in the smc in the surface layer and apple trees rhizosphere the rim systems can significantly increase the extent of wetted areas in the whole spatial profile especially the spatial extent increment of wetted areas by rim1 was significantly larger than that by rim2 fig 5a and 5b the effects of replenishment by the rim system were prominent in the soil layer of 60 300 cm and the horizontal distance from the trunks between 1 0 m and 2 5 m this result may be caused by the fact that rainwater directly flows down into the infiltration pipe through a pipe wall with multi holed in which the infiltration pipe is placed relatively deep resulting in insufficient soil moisture replenishment in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm similar results have been found in the work of song et al 2017 in arid and semi arid areas the water uptake of fruit trees is mainly influenced by the smc lobet et al 2014 our results indicate that the rim systems enhance the ability of soil moisture infiltration to deeper soil layers thus the rim system is useful to mitigate the soil desiccation for apple orchards in the hilly and gully region of loess plateau 4 2 the relationships between seasonal variations of soil moisture and rainfall as rainfall is the main source of soil moisture in the loess plateau liu et al 2018 the seasonal fluctuation of soil moisture corresponds to rainfall temperature and light intensity etc to examine the seasonal dynamics in the smc previous studies divided a time window into different periods based on the seasonal change of soil moisture for example the annual variation of soil moisture was divided into four periods han et al 1990 1989 i e consuming period accumulating period lowering period and stable period in addition chen et al 2003 divided into five periods to investigate the seasonal variation of the smc accumulating period decreasing period restoring period stable period and consuming period in contrast wang et al 2006 divided into three periods to examine seasonal smcs of apple orchards a slow accumulation in autumn and winter an intense consumption in early summer and late spring and a fluctuation period in summer except for june to september the division of other stages is basically consistent with this study during the soil moisture consuming period soil evaporation and transpiration increased with an increase in air temperature meanwhile fruit trees begin to grow which may lead to a decrease in the smc due to a large depletion of soil moisture during this period during the soil moisture supplying period a large supply of soil moisture is driven by rainfall infiltration concentrated over this period we need to note that the rim system has the primary capacities of rainwater harvesting infiltration promoting and moisture holding thus the soil moisture rapidly increased during this period during the soil moisture fade away period more water demands occur for the fruits ripe process under less rainfall which is the main reason for soil moisture fade away previous studies showed that there are two high peak periods for the water consumption processes of apple trees the critical period of water requirement from april to june and the water consumption period of plant strong transpiration from july and august heng and yang 1980 it is consistent with the soil moisture variation under the ck treatment in this study while distinguishable from other treatments that replenish the soil moisture the smc corresponded to the precipitation and evaporation in the same season jia et al 1997 the annual variation of smc in the soil layer of 0 300 cm for all treatments was similar to each other while the monthly smc in the soil layer of 0 300 cm did not correspond to precipitation refer to fig 8 the fluctuation of smc in 2019 was larger than that in 2018 as heavier rainfall occurred in 2018 compared with rainfall in 2019 hess et al 2018 concluded that rainfall intensification may increase deep percolation and deep soil water content in cropping systems hess et al 2018 this study also showed that the variation of smc in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm was consistently dependent on precipitation indicating that the smc in the upper soil layer is more sensitive to rainfall which is the main influence factor on the smc in this layer below 60 cm the effect of rainfall on soil moisture becomes weaker xiao et al 2013 showed that the rainfall significantly replenishes the smc in the soil layer of 0 30 cm in terraced orchard while weaker effects on other soil layers xiao et al 2013 this study also proved that the rainfall is the main driver that influenced the soil moisture in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm the rim system enhances the soil moisture infiltration to deeper soil layers and efficiently distributes rainfall to preserve the soil moisture i e storing rainfall during the rainy seasons and replenishing during the consuming period therefore the rim system can improve the efficiency of soil moisture use in the loess hilly and gully region of china 4 3 the relationship between smc and plant growth there are many factors that affect plant growth and yield in particular rainwater and smc are crucial factors in the rain fed area tallon and si 2004 the rim system suggested in this study improved the apple yield and the crop water productivity in the apple orchard as the rim system considerably contributed to enhancing the ability to sustainably supply water demands for the plant growth by decreasing soil evaporation and increasing soil moisture storage moreover the rim system not only increased the size and depth of the wetted soil region but also enhanced the regulation of soil moisture reservoirs consequently it is a useful method to adapt the growth rhythm of apple trees to local climate conditions the morphological physiological and biochemical characteristics of plants are usually modified by the smc subsequently affecting plant growth and development sharma et al 2018 the intensity of tree growth also depends on the soil moisture many studies have shown that water stress is significantly related to stem diameter a net increase of total leaf area per plant and a net increase of plant dry weight fouad et al 1991 insufficient water supply i e high water stress may result in reducing tree growth yield and fruit quality al yahyai 2012 plant growth is inhibited when plants undergo a short term water deficit while plants overcompensate when the water supply is restored kou et al 2014 the shoot growth of apple trees is slow under soil moisture deficiency mpelasoka et al 2015 while developing stronger under sufficient soil moisture treder et al 1998 the process of water uptake in the root system is the key to effective water management gong et al 2006 in the plant root system the main component is fine roots 2 mm that actively interact between plant and soil song et al 2018 soil moisture availability is a crucial factor in the amount of root produced sokalska et al 2009 many studies have demonstrated that the fine root growth and distribution in the soil profile are positively correlated with changes in the smc powers et al 2005 shan et al 2009 zhou and shangguan 2007 moreover the more heavily watered treatment the higher the root growth abrisqueta et al 1994 more roots were concentrated in depths with a higher smc and then trees may modify their water uptake strategy according to the soil moisture profile within the rhizosphere green and clothier 1999 literatures have shown that the soil depth of 0 3 m can be considered as an active root zone for apple trees and an increase in smc corresponds to an increase in root biomass and root water uptake song et al 2017 however the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of soil moisture for the fine roots are not significant gan et al 2010 as this study demonstrated that the rim system enhance the smc and the crop water productivity in the apple orchard based on the four experimental designs it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate how these management practices affect the root growth and development 5 conclusions experimental applications of the rim system resulted in significant improvement in the smc for rain fed orchards in the loess plateau during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 the annual average soil moisture of the rim treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment in the soil layer of 0 300 cm compared with the ck treatment the annual average smc driven by the rim1 treatment increased by 43 01 and 34 78 respectively and by 30 55 and 26 41 by the rim2 treatment the vertical soil layers were divided into three parts 1 easy changing layer 0 60 cm 2 increasing or decreasing layer 60 180 cm and 3 relatively steady layer 180 300 cm the rim system induced an increase in the spatial extent of wetted areas under the same conditions especially the effects of the rim system on soil moisture replenishment were prominent over both horizontal and vertical soil layers in particular vertically at the deeper layers the increasing or decreasing layer and the relatively steady layer and horizontally at 1 5 m and 2 5 m apart from the trunk this study also found that precipitation is a primary driver that influenced the smc in the upper soil layer 0 60 cm in contrast the smc was not sensitive to precipitation in the deep soil layers 60 300 cm and the seasonal variation of smc varied with all treatments investigated in this study compared with the ck treatment the rim1 rim2 and fm treatments improved the yield of apple and the crop water productivity in particular the rim1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study these results demonstrate that the rim system is useful to efficiently utilize rainwater resources for rainfed orchards in the hilly and gully regions of loess

10407,drought monitoring and assessment are of great importance due to the costly damage caused by drought datasets drought indexes and drought relationships are three critical areas of drought research satellite retrieved soil moisture sm products derived from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci show application potential in drought monitoring however the products are missing certain data in some areas the model assimilated sm product derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas was used to supplement these missing data the main goals of this paper are to characterize agricultural drought after the utility and applicability of the combined sm product and the monthly scaled soil water deficit index swdi have been evaluated and to investigate the relationships among meteorological agricultural and vegetation droughts first we provided a long series of highly accurate sm products through simple calculations the drought index swdi was extended to a monthly scale for long term drought analysis by using the combined sm product the probability of detection pod between the swdi and in situ drought records performed fairly well half of the 566 stations had pods higher than 0 9 and one third of these stations had pod values equal to 1 through correlation analysis and grey incidence analysis gia between the standardized precipitation index spi and swdi we found that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was shorter under drier conditions than wetter conditions and at the regional scale the response time ranged from 1 month to 2 5 months correlation analysis between the swdi and vegetation condition index vci indicated that there was no delay effect from agricultural to vegetation drought on a monthly scale in most parts of china except in several provinces distributed in the south additionally there was a significant time lag in forests while grassland and agriculture were more inclined to have no time lag or the response time was less than 1 month keywords agricultural drought soil water deficit index soil moisture esa cci gldas 1 introduction drought as the most damaging climate related hazard has a great impact on hydrology meteorology ecology and society wilhite and glantz 1985 vicca et al 2016 drought may have a wide range of influences on human lives and result in large economic losses woodhouse and overpeck 1998 mishra and singh 2010 china including four geographical regions the north the south the northwest and the qinghai tibet plateau shown in fig 1 has experienced frequent droughts over decades and these drought events have caused serious losses zhao et al 2017 for example the 2011 summer drought over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin influenced 30 million people and caused an economic loss of approximately 15 billion rmb yuan et al 2015 the droughts that occurred in northern china in 2009 and in southwestern china from 2009 to 2010 affected approximately 300 million acres of farmland and in 2009 the economic loss caused by droughts exceeded 100 billion rmb national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2010 in china despite the growing importance of industry agriculture has a central role in ensuring the food security and welfare of the country s population of 1 3 billion people piao et al 2010 however droughts affect approximately one sixth of china s cultivated land area each year and reduce the production of grain li et al 2010 therefore understanding and assessing droughts especially agricultural droughts are of primary importance drought is usually classified into four categories meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 many drought indexes have been proposed for these four drought types for example the pdsi palmer 1965 spi mckee et al 1993 and spei vicente serrano et al 2010 have been used for meteorological drought the sri shukla and wood 2008 and swsi shafer and dezman 1982 have been used for hydrological drought the cmi palmer 1968 and smi hunt et al 2009 kędzior and zawadzki 2017 have been for agricultural drought and the improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri guo et al 2019 has been for socio economic drought various drought indexes often reflect a single drought type however the causes of drought formation are extremely complex and the physical factors that contribute to droughts are still poorly understood van dijk et al 2013 the formation mechanisms of different drought types are different therefore analysing the relationship among different types of drought is of great significance for drought warning hao et al 2018 and disaster control wu et al 2017 established a nonlinear function model to analyse the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought and found that there was a clear nonlinear relationship between these drought types han et al 2019 used cross wavelet transformation to analyse the relationship between meteorological drought and groundwater drought in the pearl river basin it was found that there was an 8 month delayed response between these two drought types and the response in spring and summer was shorter than that in autumn and winter xu et al 2019 investigated the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought by analysing the correlation between the spi and sri under the impact of human activities however the loss caused by drought is usually reflected in agricultural loss therefore analysis of the relationship between agricultural drought and other types of drought is necessary to reduce the losses caused by drought the vci kogan 1990 is a drought index that is used to estimate the impact of drought on vegetation conditions and was proven to be useful in analysing the temporal and spatial evolution of regional drought as well as in qualitatively estimating crop production liu and kogan 1996 therefore the vci can reflect the severity of agricultural drought through the condition of the vegetation to some extent in addition martínez fernández et al 2015 analysed a new approach to define the swdi by using a satellite based soil water series for agricultural drought monitoring soon thereafter the utility of the satellite based weekly scaled swdi in analysing agricultural drought was evaluated and the weekly swdi was found to accurately track agricultural drought martínez fernández et al 2016 mishra et al 2017 bai et al 2018 however due to the short length of the satellite based data soil moisture active passive smap used in these studies the swdi was calculated from 2015 therefore it is necessary to extend the time length of satellite data for long term agricultural drought analysis traditional drought monitoring and assessments are usually based on in situ measurements which require considerable resources and time and cannot meet the spatial resolution demands required for monitoring drought therefore satellite based data or assimilated data with larger spatial scales have been widely used in recent years luo and wood 2007 aghakouchak et al 2015 nicolai shaw et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 du et al 2019 liu et al 2019 satellite based data or assimilated data have the advantages of covering an entire region in situ data are usually used to validate and improve the accuracy of these satellite based or assimilated data the main goals of this study are to evaluate the utility and applicability of the combined sm product and the monthly scaled swdi for monitoring agricultural drought characteristics in china and to investigate the relationships among meteorological agricultural and vegetation droughts the specific objectives are to 1 provide a long series of highly accurate sm data through simple calculation using combined esa cci sm products and gldas sm products 2 determine whether the combined sm product can be used to accurately monitor agricultural drought by assessing the potential applicability of the monthly scaled swdi in analysing long term agricultural drought in china 3 characterize agricultural drought in four geographical regions in different seasons and 4 investigate the relationships among meteorological drought agricultural drought and vegetation drought by comparing the relationships among the spi swdi and vci 2 materials 2 1 ground observation datasets the in situ precipitation data were derived from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the dataset includes monthly precipitation from 1951 to 2019 from 613 rain gauges in china in this study we chose the data from 1998 to 2017 from 520 rain gauges which had the best data quality to calculate the spi at different time scales spi 1 to spi 12 the in situ sm data were also derived from the cma http data cma cn the cma has 10 day sm data from 1998 to 2013 from more than 700 stations however the dataset has some large gaps caused by missing data the sm data from 133 stations with better data quality were filtered to evaluate the precision and utility of the product obtained by combining the esa cci sm and gldas sm products the dataset of in situ drought records was derived from the cma http data cma cn which contains records of agricultural disaster events such as drought floods and cold damage recorded by 583 agricultural stations in china the records include information such as the type time and intensity of the disaster drought records from 566 stations on a 10 day temporal scale from 2000 to 2011 including the time and intensity of drought were used in this study to evaluate the monthly scaled swdi if a drought occurs on any ten days of a month the month is defined as a drought month and the drought intensity corresponds to the most severe drought intensity of three ten day periods 2 2 satellite sm products the satellite sm product esa cci sm v04 4 originates from esa cci https www esa soilmoisture cci org the product consists of three surface sm datasets active product and passive product which were created by fusing scatterometer and radiometer sm products respectively the combined product is a blended product based on the former two datasets the product provides global surface sm from 1978 to 2018 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 day an et al 2016 and dorigo et al 2015 verified the quality of these products using the triple collocation technique in china and at the global scale however the product lacks data in many areas especially in western and northern china we combined the gldas sm data with the esa cci sm product to solve this problem see section 3 1 2 2 3 global land data assimilation system the gldas product gldas 2 1 noah 0 25 degrees monthly was derived from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https earthdata nasa gov and was generated through the temporal averaging of gldas 2 1 noah 3 hly data simulated with the noah model 3 3 in land information system lis version 7 the dataset contains 36 parameters from january 2000 to the present including sm soil temperature and evapotranspiration this product contains the sm of four soil layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm spennemann et al 2015 kędzior and zawadzki 2016 chen et al 2013 we chose the sm of the first layer 0 10 cm to combine with satellite sm to represent the land surface sm 2 4 land cover the land cover data esa cci lc 2010 v2 0 7 were derived from the esa cci land cover project https www esa landcover cci org this product provides 3 epoch series of global land cover maps at 300 m spatial resolution where each epoch covers a 5 year period 2008 2012 2003 2007 1998 2002 using the 2003 2012 global land cover map as a baseline the 2010 2005 and 2000 land cover maps were derived from this 3 epoch series the time series of this study was from 2000 to 2017 so we chose the land cover map for 2010 in this study we mainly focused on the relationship between agricultural drought and vegetation drought therefore according to the correspondence between the ipcc land categories and the classes of the cci land cover map we reclassified the land cover into four categories forest agriculture grass and other 2 5 soil data the china soil map based harmonized world soil database v1 1 which is available from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china westdc http westdc westgis ac cn is derived from the harmonized world soil database v1 1 constructed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao and the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa in austria the data source in china is the 1 1 million soil data provided by the nanjing soil institute in china through the second national land survey fischer et al 2008 this dataset contains various physical characteristics of soil and we chose the contents of sand clay and organic carbon to calculate the soil water parameters through the pedotransfer function ptf 2 6 normalized difference vegetation index the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset is the mod13c2 version 6 product which is derived from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https earthdata nasa gov this product provides a vegetation index vi value on a per grid basis there are two primary vegetation layers the ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi the spatial and temporal resolution of the product is 0 05 and 1 month respectively in this study the ndvi was used to calculate the vci which is a vegetation drought index 3 methods 3 1 soil water deficit index the swdi is considered to be an effective agricultural drought index that captures drought conditions by quantifying the associated sm deficit it can be calculated through land surface sm and soil water parameters as shown in eq 1 1 swdi θ 0 8 θ fc θ awc 10 where θ represents the land surface sm m3 m3 θfc and θawc represent the sm m3 m3 at field capacity fc and at available water capacity awc respectively and 0 8 is the reduction factor for θfc which represents that drought occurs when θ is less than 0 8 times θfc pan et al 2014 set the normal level of sm to more than 0 8 times θfc when studying the effect of drought on six plant species from the tibetan plateau hedysarum multijugum maxim berberis diaphana maxim etc wu 2013 found that the photosynthetic physiological response of three selected tree species prunus sibirica hippophae rhamnoides and pinus tabulaeformis reached an optimal value at 0 8 times θfc and decreased when sm decreased θawc is calculated by subtracting θfc from sm at the wilting point θwp as shown in eq 2 2 θ awc θ f c θ w p when the swdi is positive the sm is more than 0 8 times the field capacity indicating that no agricultural drought occurs therefore 0 is considered a threshold between drought and non drought conditions in this study the swdi was calculated on a monthly time scale and the drought classification based on the swdi was similar to that described in martínez fernández et al 2016 and mishra et al 2017 as shown in table 1 3 1 1 rescaling the satellite sm data in this study the agricultural drought index was calculated on a monthly scale for two reasons 1 to reflect the variations in sm and agricultural drought characteristics in the long term time series regarding the issue of capturing long term drought characteristics we believe that monthly scales are sufficient to reflect the seasonal changes in drought rhee et al 2010 wu et al 2011 dai et al 2020 2 to analyse the relationship between agricultural drought and meteorological drought studies on meteorological drought are mainly at the monthly scale mckee et al 1993 zhou et al 2019 therefore the monthly scaled index was used in this paper for agricultural drought analysis the satellite sm esa cci sm has a daily time scale therefore we rescaled the sm data to a monthly time scale as shown in eq 3 3 θ m θ i d i where di is 1 if grid i has data on that day and 0 otherwise θi represents the daily sm data in grid i m3 m3 and θm represents the monthly average satellite sm in grid i m3 m3 3 1 2 combination of satellite sm data and gldas sm data as shown in fig 2 the esa cci sm product is missing much data in winter the areas where the data are missing are almost consistent with the distribution of the areas covered with snow che et al 2008 and frozen soil which are areas in which sm data cannot be retrieved in winter liu et al 2013 therefore the sm data derived from gldas were used to supplement the satellite retrieved esa cci sm product the gldas sm data have been proven to be accurate in the frozen period of the tibetan plateau bao et al 2017 the gldas sm product has a monthly time scale additionally the unit of these data is kg m2 and it should be converted to volumetric moisture content m3 m3 to calculate the swdi see eqs 4 and 5 federer et al 1993 han et al 2016 4 bd 0 167 1 526 1 526 o m 0 167 1 o m 5 θ g θ i 0 1 b d 1000 where bd represents the soil bulk density g cm3 om represents the soil organic matter content g g and it can be converted from organic carbon using a factor of 0 58 pribyl 2010 shangguan et al 2014 θi represents the weight moisture content of the 0 10 cm soil layer derived from gldas kg m2 θg represents the volumetric moisture content m3 m3 0 1 m represents the thickness of the soil layer 10 cm and 1000 is a factor used to convert g cm3 to kg m3 the gldas sm product was found to underestimate surface sm chen et al 2013 the swdi directly calculated through the gldas sm data cannot capture drought conditions well thus we combined the satellite sm data with the gldas sm data eqs 6 9 6 k i j θ s θ g 7 k i j a v e r a g e k ij 8 k j a v e r a g e k i j 9 θ c k j θ g n o d a t a k ij θ s d a t a where kij is the quotient of θs divided by θg in grid i in month j kij represents the average of kij in each grid in month j and j ranges from january to december kj represents the average ratio of the satellite sm data θs and gldas sm data θg in month j and θc represents the combined sm m3 m3 3 1 3 calculation of soil water parameters soil water parameters θfc and θwp are critical for calculating the swdi there are several approaches that can be used to estimate these two parameters the first method laboratory analysis which is costly and time consuming can be used to obtain a water retention curve through experiments van genuchten 1980 in the second method the 5th percentile and 95th percentile based on long term sm time series represent θfc and θwp respectively hunt et al 2009 however this method requires long term sm data for validation and correction the third function is the pedotransfer function ptf saxton and rawls 2006 in this study we applied the ptf from saxton and rawls 2006 to estimate the soil water parameters eqs 10 13 10 θ w p 0 024 s 0 487 c 0 006 o m 0 005 s o m 0 013 c o m 0 068 s c 0 031 11 θ w p θ w p 0 14 θ w p 0 02 12 θ fc 0 251 s 0 195 c 0 011 o m 0 006 s o m 0 027 c o m 0 452 s c 0 299 13 θ fc θ f c 1 283 θ f c 2 0 374 θ f c 0 015 where s and c represent the weight content of sand and clay in soil respectively om represents the weight content of organic matter in soil which can be converted from organic carbon by a factor of 0 58 3 2 vegetation condition index the vci was proposed by kogan 1990 the vci permits not only the description of vegetation but also the estimation of spatial and temporal vegetation changes and weather impacts on vegetation the calculation of the vci is shown in eq 14 14 v c i 100 n d v i n d v i min n d v i max n d v i min where ndvi ndvimax and ndvimin are the respective monthly ndvi multiyear maximum ndvi and multiyear minimum ndvi for each grid the vci ranges from 0 to 100 indicating that the vegetation condition changes from extremely unfavourable to optimal the drought classification based on the vci is shown in table 1 3 3 standardized precipitation index the spi was proposed by mckee et al 1993 and it is widely used to characterize meteorological drought on a range of timescales hayes et al 1999 bloomfield and marchant 2013 asadi zarch et al 2015 in this study the spi swdi and vci are compared to analyse the relationships among meteorological drought agricultural drought and vegetation drought 3 4 grey incidence analysis with a time lag gia is used to estimate the correlation between a system s behaviour and other relevant factors if the trend of the two factors is consistent the degree of grey incidence will be large otherwise the degree of grey incidence will be small hao et al 2009 2012 hu et al 2016 the calculation of the grey incidence coefficient is as follows the system series x0 15 x 0 x 0 t t 1 2 n the relevant factor series xi is as follows 16 x i x i t τ i 1 2 n t 1 2 n τ 1 2 k where τ is the time lag between x0 and xi and we use the normalized value of x0 and xi to eliminate their dimensions eqs 17 20 17 x 0 x 0 t x 0 x 0 t 1 2 n 18 x i x i t τ x i x i i 1 2 n t 1 2 n τ 1 2 k 19 x 0 1 n t 1 n x 0 t 20 x i 1 n t 1 n x i t τ the grey incidence coefficient of x0 and xi at time t can be calculated as shown in eq 21 and the grey incidence

rmse relative bias bias and pod are used to measure the performance of two time series the calculation equations for these indexes are shown in table 2 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the combined sm data the sm data were derived from 133 selected stations in the growing season may june july and september and used to evaluate the combined sm product some of the sm data in august and other non growing season months were missing and could not be used in the evaluation the pearson cc r rmse and bia values were calculated in may june july and september at each station from 2000 to 2013 table 3 the in situ and combined sm data series at four representative stations with different rmses are shown in fig 3 of the stations 11 02 21 19 performed fairly well 0 7 r 1 55 93 62 71 performed well 0 3 r 0 7 and 19 49 33 05 performed poorly r 0 3 in terms of absolute bias most stations 79 66 83 90 had values less than 0 4 of the stations 18 64 31 36 performed fairly well absolute bias 0 1 21 19 26 27 performed well absolute bias 0 2 26 27 39 83 performed fairly well absolute bias 0 4 and 16 10 20 34 performed poorly absolute bias 0 4 the root mean square error rmse we calculated was similar to that calculated by bai et al 2018 among 133 stations the rmse for approximately 10 of stations was less than 0 04 m3 m3 and at 67 80 72 03 of stations it varied from 0 04 m3 m3 to 0 10 m3 m3 compared with the recent state of the art satellite retrieved sm product smap bai et al 2018 the combined sm product not only guarantees similar accuracy but also has the advantage of a long time series fig 3 shows the sm data series from may 2005 to september 2013 from four representative stations that had rmse 0 04 rmse 0 10 and rmse 0 10 we can see that the combined sm and in situ sm agree well at stations 52 855 r 0 41 and 53 505 r 0 55 even though the rmse performed poorly 4 2 evaluation of the monthly scaled swdi three typical drought events were used in this study to verify whether the monthly scaled swdi could accurately capture agricultural drought figs 4 and 5 first we used severe meteorological drought events that occurred in northern china from march to july 2001 an et al 2014 for evaluation as shown in fig 4 the start and end times of agricultural drought swdi are consistent with the meteorological drought records there was a clear trend of drought development march 2001 to june 2001 and mitigation june 2001 to august 2001 the most severe drought occurred in june 2001 and in this month more than 40 of the area suffered severe drought and extreme drought fig 5 the second drought event we selected occurred in yunnan guizhou sichuan and guangxi provinces ygsgs from winter 2009 to spring 2010 yang et al 2012 li et al 2013 the monthly scaled swdi indicated that the drought event began in november 2009 and the most severe drought occurred in january and february 2010 fig 4 in these two months approximately 20 of the area suffered severe drought and extreme drought fig 5 the third meteorological drought event that we used occurred in qinghai and tibet in the summer and autumn of 2015 as recorded by the meteorological drought yearbook 2016 however fig 4 shows that agricultural drought began in september 2015 although the lower precipitation in this summer led to meteorological drought high temperatures in spring and summer increased the snowmelt runoff which supplemented sm and delayed the occurrence of agricultural drought in contrast agricultural drought continued in the winter of 2015 when meteorological drought conditions were mitigated mainly because of low temperatures yang and ma 2012 and chen et al 2015 found that soil water freezing due to low temperature causes the sm to decrease suddenly in some areas of the qinghai tibet plateau although plants are dormant in winter some vegetation and crops such as winter wheat still grow in winter the decrease in sm caused by low temperatures on the plateau would affect the growth of winter wheat in this section in situ drought records were used to calculate the pod with the monthly scaled swdi as shown in fig 6 the pod at 78 stations does not perform well below 0 5 accounting for approximately 13 7 53 stations 9 4 62 stations 11 0 and 93 stations 16 4 perform well with pod values between 0 5 and 0 7 0 7 and 0 8 and 0 8 and 0 9 respectively 280 stations perform fairly well with pod values higher than 0 9 which accounts for the largest proportion 49 5 especially the pod at 89 stations 15 7 which is equal to 1 the averaged pod in every province has a decreasing trend from the southeast to northwest except for four provinces i e taiwan has no station xinjiang qinghai and inner mongolia the average pod in all other provinces is higher than 0 7 the stations with poor pod are mainly distributed in the northern and northwestern parts of china twenty eight stations were filtered with pod 0 5 and the bias and rmse were calculated in section 4 1 twenty two of these 28 stations had positive bias the average bia of these 22 stations was 0 28 which means that the in situ sm was generally larger than the combined sm at these stations this resulted in a more severe agricultural drought condition assessed by the swdi than the in situ drought records and led to poor pod performance in northern and northwestern china in general the monthly scaled swdi performed fairly well in pod with in situ drought records in most parts of china 4 3 spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of monthly scaled swdi in china china was divided into four regions south north northwest and qinghai tibet plateau in this section as shown in fig 1 precipitation lines of 800 mm and 400 mm are the boundaries between humid and semihumid regions and between semihumid and semiarid regions respectively zheng et al 2010 li et al 2016 these two lines are the dividing lines between south china and north china and between north china and northwest china respectively the boundary of the qinghai tibet plateau is the dividing line of the first and second terrain steps in china han et al 2008 in general as shown in fig 7 drought conditions in spring and winter are more severe than those in summer and autumn except for summer the qinghai tibet plateau is most vulnerable to agricultural drought among the four regions followed by the northwest and north and the south is the least vulnerable there are three main factors that influence drought conditions precipitation temperature and solar radiation temperature and solar radiation affect drought conditions by influencing evapotranspiration much higher evapotranspiration caused by higher solar radiation and much lower precipitation are the main reasons for the most serious drought conditions on the qinghai tibet plateau however in hot summers snowmelt runoff caused by higher temperatures will supplement sm which can mitigate drought conditions on the plateau in contrast the soil water content is much lower in the cold winters on the plateau which causes the drought conditions to become much more severe the agricultural drought conditions on the qinghai tibet plateau are sensitive to temperature and radiation in south and north china the precipitation in summer and autumn is greater than that in spring and winter and drought conditions in spring and winter are more severe than those in summer and autumn therefore drought conditions are more sensitive to precipitation in the north and south the northwest region is a perennial arid area and the drought conditions in the four seasons are basically unchanged the reason for this pattern is that the increase decrease in precipitation in summer winter and the solar radiation and temperature increase decrease accordingly which cause the input of sm precipitation to be approximately equal to the output evapotranspiration 4 4 relationship among meteorological drought spi agricultural drought swdi and vegetation drought vci first the averaged pearson cc between different time scaled spi spi 1 to spi 12 and 1 month scaled swdi was calculated in different months january to december in the four geographical regions the correlation performed better in the north and south where agricultural drought conditions were more sensitive to precipitation section 4 3 the correlation performed much worse on the qinghai tibet plateau mainly because the temperature and high radiation were the two sensitive factors on the plateau for the twelve months except for the qinghai tibet plateau the correlation performed better in spring and winter when agricultural drought and meteorological drought both occurred frequently generally the maximum pearson cc red five pointed star in fig 8 in different months ranged from 1 month scaled to 4 month scaled spi spi 1 to spi 4 in the northwest and qinghai tibet plateau where the drought conditions were much worse the time scale of the spi with maximum pearson cc was generally shorter than that in the north and south this result indicates that it takes less time for meteorological drought to develop into agricultural drought under drier conditions in winter and spring when drought occurs severely the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought tends to be longer than that in summer this result is mainly because the duration of drought would be longer in winter and spring fig 9 shows the response time of agricultural drought to meteorological drought at 480 stations the response time ranged from 0 months to 4 months a total of 176 68 63 58 and 115 stations had response times of 0 1 2 3 and 4 months respectively at the regional spatial scale the average response times in the four regions were 1 12 months for the north 1 74 months for the northwest 1 34 months for the qinghai tibet plateau and 2 26 months for the south this result shows that the response time is longer in humid and semi humid regions where the drought conditions are better the result is consistent with fig 8 the assessment of agricultural drought based on the swdi focuses on the variation in sm and the vci evaluates vegetation drought through the variation in vegetation conditions when drought occurs the sm decreases and the vegetation condition deteriorates we believe that in some areas there are delay effects between the decrease in sm and the deterioration of vegetation pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2013 therefore the pearson cc between the swdi with vci rsv0 and1 month delayed vci rsv1 was calculated to analyse the relationship and the delayed effect of soil water deficit on vegetation drought the correlation between the swdi and vci is shown in fig 10 in the southwest and tibet these two series show a significant positive correlation in contrast in some areas of xinjiang province they show a strong negative correlation in the north and southeast the correlation is neither significantly positive nor strongly negative the results show a strong correlation with land cover fig 11 the land cover of agriculture is probably affected by human activities reap and sow therefore the vegetation condition did not correlate well with sm in agricultural areas for forest the variation in vegetation condition lags with the variation in sm as shown in fig 10 b therefore the pearson cc in the north and southeast does not perform well where the land cover is mainly agriculture and forest significant positive correlations were mainly observed in areas where the land is covered by grass or a mix of grass forest and agriculture this result is mainly because there is no delayed effect of agricultural drought on vegetation drought in areas with grass in xinjiang province the negative correlation was mainly observed in two basins the tarim basin and junggar basin where the land cover is mainly desert and barren land in addition the land cover in the tianshan and kunlun mountains has a small amount of grass and agriculture thus the correlation was positive there the r10 rsv1 minus rsv0 was calculated to analyse whether vegetation drought vci has a delayed effect on agricultural drought swdi and which parts of china have a delayed effect when r10 is positive the vegetation drought is more inclined to be delayed by 1 month with agricultural drought in the area and there is no delayed response when r10 is negative the distribution of r10 is shown in fig 10 b vegetation drought is delayed by approximately 1 month with agricultural drought in a few provinces of china including yunnan guangxi guangdong fujian and the southern part of sichuan hunan province the soil water content in these areas is higher than that in other regions because of the high precipitation therefore the occurrence of meteorological drought precipitation deficit would not directly reduce the soil water content to the threshold of agricultural drought soil water deficit for example drought occurred in the ygsg from winter 2009 to spring 2010 the duration of the drought was 6 months and the agricultural drought started in november 2009 the vegetation drought was delayed by 1 month starting in december 2009 we further analysed the delayed response of vegetation conditions to agricultural drought under different types of land cover agriculture forest and grassland we reclassified r10 into 9 classes fig 12 and found that there was a significant time lag in the forest while grass and agriculture were less inclined to have a time lag the reason is that the roots of the forest are developed thus trees are more resistant to the reduction of surface sm grass and agricultural vegetation do not have roots that develop like those of forests thus the variation in surface sm and vegetation conditions is relatively consistent in these two land cover areas for grass and agricultural land there is the possibility that the response of vegetation conditions to agricultural drought is less than 1 month li et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 advantages and disadvantages of combined sm products in situ measurement is usually the most accurate method for drought monitoring however in situ datasets are limited by their spatial resolution especially in remote areas therefore this method is often used to validate the accuracy of other drought indexes or to improve the spatial resolution of other data zhao et al 2017 the combined sm product has the advantages of 1 a long term series 2 acceptable accuracy and utility and 3 covering the entire region solving the problem of the spatial distribution of in situ data in section 4 1 the evaluation of the combined sm product showed that the rmse at most stations was higher than 0 04 m3 m3 which is usually considered the target for sm dataset validations the average pod between the swdi and in situ drought records was calculated as rmse 0 04 m3 m3 and rmse 0 04 m3 m3 respectively in may june july and september table 4 some of the sm data in august and other non growing season months were missing the results show that when most of the sm data are within the acceptable range rmse 0 10 m3 m3 the accuracy of the swdi will be reduced by less than 10 when detecting actual drought events however the in situ sm data used in this paper had a relatively short time span from 2000 to 2013 and the stations we filtered for better data quality were mainly distributed in northern china therefore the evaluation of the combined sm product was not complete not only in the length of the time series but also in the spatial distribution this characteristic brings some uncertainty to the calculation of the swdi to minimize the effects of the uncertainty associated with input sm data for the swdi the in situ sm data must be supplemented not only in the time series but also in the number of available stations moreover for better accuracy and applicability of sm data the reanalysed sm product could be obtained by comparing and merging multisource datasets including satellite based products esa cci smap and smos model assimilation data gldas and in situ datasets cma chen et al 2011 5 2 the limitations of the swdi in section 4 2 the swdi performed well in monitoring and detecting agricultural drought however the swdi has two limitations and it does not consider ecological conditions first the reasons such as vegetation characteristics and meteorological factors for different drought characteristics for different land cover types should be further investigated to improve the performance of the agricultural drought index for example in areas with forest cover trees can be more resistant to drought because their developed roots can use sm in the deep soil layer therefore the multilayer soil water content has application potential in different regions that could reflect vegetation characteristics to some extent second in the correlation analysis between the swdi and vci we found that the pearson cc between these two series did not perform well there are two reasons for this result 1 agricultural drought conditions were assessed by the swdi and the swdi was calculated using sm data without considering the vegetation condition 2 the vci is based on vegetation and is primarily useful for the summer growing season mishra and singh 2010 because sm is affected by vegetation cover a et al 2019 it would be better for the agricultural drought index to take vegetation condition data such as the leaf area index lai and ndvi into consideration to monitor agricultural drought wu et al 2013 zuo et al 2019 in cold seasons when much vegetation is largely dormant the vci cannot reflect drought conditions well heim 2002 however certain crops winter wheat and vegetation grow in cold seasons therefore a threshold could be set for the lai and ndvi and if any area has lai and ndvi values lower than the threshold it can be ignored in the analysis of agricultural drought conditions this would better reflect agricultural drought conditions in both the growing and cold seasons in addition the calculation of the drought index can consider the use of water supply precipitation irrigation etc and demand evapotranspiration climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions etc or water energy balance precipitation evapotranspiration sm etc to make the index more comprehensive and reasonable zhang et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2019a 5 3 further research on the relationships of different types of drought the relationships among meteorological drought agricultural drought and vegetation drought were investigated in this paper however in some areas human water management such as irrigation and reservoir operations greatly affects drought characteristics and drought evolution he et al 2017 found that irrigation in the central valley increased hydrological drought duration and deficit by 50 and 50 100 respectively fang et al 2019 found that irrigation practices alleviate crop vulnerability under drought stress on the loess plateau the results of the relationship between meeteorological drought and agricultural drought in section 4 4 include the effect of human water management for example the satellite retrieved sm product the esa cci sm product contains the variation in sm caused by irrigation and other human water management the variation in sm caused by irrigation could delay and mitigate the effect of meteorological drought on agricultural drought therefore the effect of human water management should be quantified in further research to monitor drought characteristics more accurately in irrigation areas and reservoir areas in recent years with the development of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence spatiotemporal dynamics with three dimensions latitude longitude and time of drought have gradually become a hotpot in drought research herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the 3 d spatiotemporal dynamics of drought could capture the migration trajectories and migration directions of drought which have great significance for drought warning and drought prediction furthermore when analysing drought 3 d dynamics other factors such as precipitation sm evapotranspiration and temperature could be taken into account in the process of the dynamics to properly capture the dynamic evolution among the different types of drought this approach will provide more accurate and targeted information for decision makers regarding when and where drought occurs different types of drought have different characteristics and properties under agricultural drought the growth of crops and vegetation is greatly affected by sm the dominant temporal scale for the agricultural drought index is weekly martínez fernández et al 2016 mishra et al 2017 bai et al 2018 however in this paper the monthly agricultural drought index was used for comparison with the meteorological drought which was assessed by monthly scaled spi to solve this problem of multiple time scales due to different drought properties the dynamic evolution of drought needs to consider the transformation of the time scale for example the monthly scale of meteorological drought can be transformed to a weekly scale when evolving to agricultural drought li et al 2014 a multiscalar daily weekly and monthly drought index such as the spi and szi zhang et al 2019b could be developed for monitoring different types of drought 6 conclusions the accuracy of drought indexes and the relationship among multiple droughts are two crucial areas of drought research in this paper the sm product which was combined from the esa cci sm product and the gldas sm product shows great application potential in analysing agricultural drought the monthly scaled swdi calculated using the combined sm product can accurately capture features of agricultural drought in most parts of china through comparison with in situ drought records the poor performance of the monthly swdi was mainly due to underestimation of the combined sm data the qinghai tibet plateau showed the worst agricultural drought conditions and the main influential factor was temperature on the plateau north and south china are sensitive to precipitation the northwest is a perennial arid area where the drought conditions in the four seasons are basically unchanged winter and spring are more vulnerable to agricultural drought than summer and autumn the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought is shorter under drier conditions at the regional spatial scale the response time ranges from 1 month to 2 5 months a significant correlation between agricultural drought and vegetation drought was mainly observed in areas covered by grass or a mix of grass forest and agriculture there was a significant time lag in the forest while grass and agriculture were more inclined to have no time lag or one that was less than 1

10407,drought monitoring and assessment are of great importance due to the costly damage caused by drought datasets drought indexes and drought relationships are three critical areas of drought research satellite retrieved soil moisture sm products derived from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci show application potential in drought monitoring however the products are missing certain data in some areas the model assimilated sm product derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas was used to supplement these missing data the main goals of this paper are to characterize agricultural drought after the utility and applicability of the combined sm product and the monthly scaled soil water deficit index swdi have been evaluated and to investigate the relationships among meteorological agricultural and vegetation droughts first we provided a long series of highly accurate sm products through simple calculations the drought index swdi was extended to a monthly scale for long term drought analysis by using the combined sm product the probability of detection pod between the swdi and in situ drought records performed fairly well half of the 566 stations had pods higher than 0 9 and one third of these stations had pod values equal to 1 through correlation analysis and grey incidence analysis gia between the standardized precipitation index spi and swdi we found that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was shorter under drier conditions than wetter conditions and at the regional scale the response time ranged from 1 month to 2 5 months correlation analysis between the swdi and vegetation condition index vci indicated that there was no delay effect from agricultural to vegetation drought on a monthly scale in most parts of china except in several provinces distributed in the south additionally there was a significant time lag in forests while grassland and agriculture were more inclined to have no time lag or the response time was less than 1 month keywords agricultural drought soil water deficit index soil moisture esa cci gldas 1 introduction drought as the most damaging climate related hazard has a great impact on hydrology meteorology ecology and society wilhite and glantz 1985 vicca et al 2016 drought may have a wide range of influences on human lives and result in large economic losses woodhouse and overpeck 1998 mishra and singh 2010 china including four geographical regions the north the south the northwest and the qinghai tibet plateau shown in fig 1 has experienced frequent droughts over decades and these drought events have caused serious losses zhao et al 2017 for example the 2011 summer drought over the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin influenced 30 million people and caused an economic loss of approximately 15 billion rmb yuan et al 2015 the droughts that occurred in northern china in 2009 and in southwestern china from 2009 to 2010 affected approximately 300 million acres of farmland and in 2009 the economic loss caused by droughts exceeded 100 billion rmb national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2010 in china despite the growing importance of industry agriculture has a central role in ensuring the food security and welfare of the country s population of 1 3 billion people piao et al 2010 however droughts affect approximately one sixth of china s cultivated land area each year and reduce the production of grain li et al 2010 therefore understanding and assessing droughts especially agricultural droughts are of primary importance drought is usually classified into four categories meteorological drought hydrological drought agricultural drought and socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 many drought indexes have been proposed for these four drought types for example the pdsi palmer 1965 spi mckee et al 1993 and spei vicente serrano et al 2010 have been used for meteorological drought the sri shukla and wood 2008 and swsi shafer and dezman 1982 have been used for hydrological drought the cmi palmer 1968 and smi hunt et al 2009 kędzior and zawadzki 2017 have been for agricultural drought and the improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri guo et al 2019 has been for socio economic drought various drought indexes often reflect a single drought type however the causes of drought formation are extremely complex and the physical factors that contribute to droughts are still poorly understood van dijk et al 2013 the formation mechanisms of different drought types are different therefore analysing the relationship among different types of drought is of great significance for drought warning hao et al 2018 and disaster control wu et al 2017 established a nonlinear function model to analyse the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought and found that there was a clear nonlinear relationship between these drought types han et al 2019 used cross wavelet transformation to analyse the relationship between meteorological drought and groundwater drought in the pearl river basin it was found that there was an 8 month delayed response between these two drought types and the response in spring and summer was shorter than that in autumn and winter xu et al 2019 investigated the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought by analysing the correlation between the spi and sri under the impact of human activities however the loss caused by drought is usually reflected in agricultural loss therefore analysis of the relationship between agricultural drought and other types of drought is necessary to reduce the losses caused by drought the vci kogan 1990 is a drought index that is used to estimate the impact of drought on vegetation conditions and was proven to be useful in analysing the temporal and spatial evolution of regional drought as well as in qualitatively estimating crop production liu and kogan 1996 therefore the vci can reflect the severity of agricultural drought through the condition of the vegetation to some extent in addition martínez fernández et al 2015 analysed a new approach to define the swdi by using a satellite based soil water series for agricultural drought monitoring soon thereafter the utility of the satellite based weekly scaled swdi in analysing agricultural drought was evaluated and the weekly swdi was found to accurately track agricultural drought martínez fernández et al 2016 mishra et al 2017 bai et al 2018 however due to the short length of the satellite based data soil moisture active passive smap used in these studies the swdi was calculated from 2015 therefore it is necessary to extend the time length of satellite data for long term agricultural drought analysis traditional drought monitoring and assessments are usually based on in situ measurements which require considerable resources and time and cannot meet the spatial resolution demands required for monitoring drought therefore satellite based data or assimilated data with larger spatial scales have been widely used in recent years luo and wood 2007 aghakouchak et al 2015 nicolai shaw et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 du et al 2019 liu et al 2019 satellite based data or assimilated data have the advantages of covering an entire region in situ data are usually used to validate and improve the accuracy of these satellite based or assimilated data the main goals of this study are to evaluate the utility and applicability of the combined sm product and the monthly scaled swdi for monitoring agricultural drought characteristics in china and to investigate the relationships among meteorological agricultural and vegetation droughts the specific objectives are to 1 provide a long series of highly accurate sm data through simple calculation using combined esa cci sm products and gldas sm products 2 determine whether the combined sm product can be used to accurately monitor agricultural drought by assessing the potential applicability of the monthly scaled swdi in analysing long term agricultural drought in china 3 characterize agricultural drought in four geographical regions in different seasons and 4 investigate the relationships among meteorological drought agricultural drought and vegetation drought by comparing the relationships among the spi swdi and vci 2 materials 2 1 ground observation datasets the in situ precipitation data were derived from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the dataset includes monthly precipitation from 1951 to 2019 from 613 rain gauges in china in this study we chose the data from 1998 to 2017 from 520 rain gauges which had the best data quality to calculate the spi at different time scales spi 1 to spi 12 the in situ sm data were also derived from the cma http data cma cn the cma has 10 day sm data from 1998 to 2013 from more than 700 stations however the dataset has some large gaps caused by missing data the sm data from 133 stations with better data quality were filtered to evaluate the precision and utility of the product obtained by combining the esa cci sm and gldas sm products the dataset of in situ drought records was derived from the cma http data cma cn which contains records of agricultural disaster events such as drought floods and cold damage recorded by 583 agricultural stations in china the records include information such as the type time and intensity of the disaster drought records from 566 stations on a 10 day temporal scale from 2000 to 2011 including the time and intensity of drought were used in this study to evaluate the monthly scaled swdi if a drought occurs on any ten days of a month the month is defined as a drought month and the drought intensity corresponds to the most severe drought intensity of three ten day periods 2 2 satellite sm products the satellite sm product esa cci sm v04 4 originates from esa cci https www esa soilmoisture cci org the product consists of three surface sm datasets active product and passive product which were created by fusing scatterometer and radiometer sm products respectively the combined product is a blended product based on the former two datasets the product provides global surface sm from 1978 to 2018 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 day an et al 2016 and dorigo et al 2015 verified the quality of these products using the triple collocation technique in china and at the global scale however the product lacks data in many areas especially in western and northern china we combined the gldas sm data with the esa cci sm product to solve this problem see section 3 1 2 2 3 global land data assimilation system the gldas product gldas 2 1 noah 0 25 degrees monthly was derived from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https earthdata nasa gov and was generated through the temporal averaging of gldas 2 1 noah 3 hly data simulated with the noah model 3 3 in land information system lis version 7 the dataset contains 36 parameters from january 2000 to the present including sm soil temperature and evapotranspiration this product contains the sm of four soil layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm spennemann et al 2015 kędzior and zawadzki 2016 chen et al 2013 we chose the sm of the first layer 0 10 cm to combine with satellite sm to represent the land surface sm 2 4 land cover the land cover data esa cci lc 2010 v2 0 7 were derived from the esa cci land cover project https www esa landcover cci org this product provides 3 epoch series of global land cover maps at 300 m spatial resolution where each epoch covers a 5 year period 2008 2012 2003 2007 1998 2002 using the 2003 2012 global land cover map as a baseline the 2010 2005 and 2000 land cover maps were derived from this 3 epoch series the time series of this study was from 2000 to 2017 so we chose the land cover map for 2010 in this study we mainly focused on the relationship between agricultural drought and vegetation drought therefore according to the correspondence between the ipcc land categories and the classes of the cci land cover map we reclassified the land cover into four categories forest agriculture grass and other 2 5 soil data the china soil map based harmonized world soil database v1 1 which is available from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china westdc http westdc westgis ac cn is derived from the harmonized world soil database v1 1 constructed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao and the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa in austria the data source in china is the 1 1 million soil data provided by the nanjing soil institute in china through the second national land survey fischer et al 2008 this dataset contains various physical characteristics of soil and we chose the contents of sand clay and organic carbon to calculate the soil water parameters through the pedotransfer function ptf 2 6 normalized difference vegetation index the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset is the mod13c2 version 6 product which is derived from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa https earthdata nasa gov this product provides a vegetation index vi value on a per grid basis there are two primary vegetation layers the ndvi and the enhanced vegetation index evi the spatial and temporal resolution of the product is 0 05 and 1 month respectively in this study the ndvi was used to calculate the vci which is a vegetation drought index 3 methods 3 1 soil water deficit index the swdi is considered to be an effective agricultural drought index that captures drought conditions by quantifying the associated sm deficit it can be calculated through land surface sm and soil water parameters as shown in eq 1 1 swdi θ 0 8 θ fc θ awc 10 where θ represents the land surface sm m3 m3 θfc and θawc represent the sm m3 m3 at field capacity fc and at available water capacity awc respectively and 0 8 is the reduction factor for θfc which represents that drought occurs when θ is less than 0 8 times θfc pan et al 2014 set the normal level of sm to more than 0 8 times θfc when studying the effect of drought on six plant species from the tibetan plateau hedysarum multijugum maxim berberis diaphana maxim etc wu 2013 found that the photosynthetic physiological response of three selected tree species prunus sibirica hippophae rhamnoides and pinus tabulaeformis reached an optimal value at 0 8 times θfc and decreased when sm decreased θawc is calculated by subtracting θfc from sm at the wilting point θwp as shown in eq 2 2 θ awc θ f c θ w p when the swdi is positive the sm is more than 0 8 times the field capacity indicating that no agricultural drought occurs therefore 0 is considered a threshold between drought and non drought conditions in this study the swdi was calculated on a monthly time scale and the drought classification based on the swdi was similar to that described in martínez fernández et al 2016 and mishra et al 2017 as shown in table 1 3 1 1 rescaling the satellite sm data in this study the agricultural drought index was calculated on a monthly scale for two reasons 1 to reflect the variations in sm and agricultural drought characteristics in the long term time series regarding the issue of capturing long term drought characteristics we believe that monthly scales are sufficient to reflect the seasonal changes in drought rhee et al 2010 wu et al 2011 dai et al 2020 2 to analyse the relationship between agricultural drought and meteorological drought studies on meteorological drought are mainly at the monthly scale mckee et al 1993 zhou et al 2019 therefore the monthly scaled index was used in this paper for agricultural drought analysis the satellite sm esa cci sm has a daily time scale therefore we rescaled the sm data to a monthly time scale as shown in eq 3 3 θ m θ i d i where di is 1 if grid i has data on that day and 0 otherwise θi represents the daily sm data in grid i m3 m3 and θm represents the monthly average satellite sm in grid i m3 m3 3 1 2 combination of satellite sm data and gldas sm data as shown in fig 2 the esa cci sm product is missing much data in winter the areas where the data are missing are almost consistent with the distribution of the areas covered with snow che et al 2008 and frozen soil which are areas in which sm data cannot be retrieved in winter liu et al 2013 therefore the sm data derived from gldas were used to supplement the satellite retrieved esa cci sm product the gldas sm data have been proven to be accurate in the frozen period of the tibetan plateau bao et al 2017 the gldas sm product has a monthly time scale additionally the unit of these data is kg m2 and it should be converted to volumetric moisture content m3 m3 to calculate the swdi see eqs 4 and 5 federer et al 1993 han et al 2016 4 bd 0 167 1 526 1 526 o m 0 167 1 o m 5 θ g θ i 0 1 b d 1000 where bd represents the soil bulk density g cm3 om represents the soil organic matter content g g and it can be converted from organic carbon using a factor of 0 58 pribyl 2010 shangguan et al 2014 θi represents the weight moisture content of the 0 10 cm soil layer derived from gldas kg m2 θg represents the volumetric moisture content m3 m3 0 1 m represents the thickness of the soil layer 10 cm and 1000 is a factor used to convert g cm3 to kg m3 the gldas sm product was found to underestimate surface sm chen et al 2013 the swdi directly calculated through the gldas sm data cannot capture drought conditions well thus we combined the satellite sm data with the gldas sm data eqs 6 9 6 k i j θ s θ g 7 k i j a v e r a g e k ij 8 k j a v e r a g e k i j 9 θ c k j θ g n o d a t a k ij θ s d a t a where kij is the quotient of θs divided by θg in grid i in month j kij represents the average of kij in each grid in month j and j ranges from january to december kj represents the average ratio of the satellite sm data θs and gldas sm data θg in month j and θc represents the combined sm m3 m3 3 1 3 calculation of soil water parameters soil water parameters θfc and θwp are critical for calculating the swdi there are several approaches that can be used to estimate these two parameters the first method laboratory analysis which is costly and time consuming can be used to obtain a water retention curve through experiments van genuchten 1980 in the second method the 5th percentile and 95th percentile based on long term sm time series represent θfc and θwp respectively hunt et al 2009 however this method requires long term sm data for validation and correction the third function is the pedotransfer function ptf saxton and rawls 2006 in this study we applied the ptf

weight content of organic matter in soil which can be converted from organic carbon by a factor of 0 58 3 2 vegetation condition index the vci was proposed by kogan 1990 the vci permits not only the description of vegetation but also the estimation of spatial and temporal vegetation changes and weather impacts on vegetation the calculation of the vci is shown in eq 14 14 v c i 100 n d v i n d v i min n d v i max n d v i min where ndvi ndvimax and ndvimin are the respective monthly ndvi multiyear maximum ndvi and multiyear minimum ndvi for each grid the vci ranges from 0 to 100 indicating that the vegetation condition changes from extremely unfavourable to optimal the drought classification based on the vci is shown in table 1 3 3 standardized precipitation index the spi was proposed by mckee et al 1993 and it is widely used to characterize meteorological drought on a range of timescales hayes et al 1999 bloomfield and marchant 2013 asadi zarch et al 2015 in this study the spi swdi and vci are compared to analyse the relationships among meteorological drought agricultural drought and vegetation drought 3 4 grey incidence analysis with a time lag gia is used to estimate the correlation between a system s behaviour and other relevant factors if the trend of the two factors is consistent the degree of grey incidence will be large otherwise the degree of grey incidence will be small hao et al 2009 2012 hu et al 2016 the calculation of the grey incidence coefficient is as follows the system series x0 15 x 0 x 0 t t 1 2 n the relevant factor series xi is as follows 16 x i x i t τ i 1 2 n t 1 2 n τ 1 2 k where τ is the time lag between x0 and xi and we use the normalized value of x0 and xi to eliminate their dimensions eqs 17 20 17 x 0 x 0 t x 0 x 0 t 1 2 n 18 x i x i t

rmse relative bias bias and pod are used to measure the performance of two time series the calculation equations for these indexes are shown in table 2 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the combined sm data the sm data were derived from 133 selected stations in the growing season may june july and september and used to evaluate the combined sm product some of the sm data in august and other non growing season months were missing and could not be used in the evaluation the pearson cc r rmse and bia values were calculated in may june july and september at each station from 2000 to 2013 table 3 the in situ and combined sm data series at four representative stations with different rmses are shown in fig 3 of the stations 11 02 21 19 performed fairly well 0 7 r 1 55 93 62 71 performed well 0 3 r 0 7 and 19 49 33 05 performed poorly r 0 3 in terms of absolute bias most stations 79 66 83 90 had values less than 0 4 of the stations 18 64 31 36 performed fairly well absolute bias 0 1 21 19 26 27 performed well absolute bias 0 2 26 27 39 83 performed fairly well absolute bias 0 4 and 16 10 20 34 performed poorly absolute bias 0 4 the root mean square error rmse we calculated was similar to that calculated by bai et al 2018 among 133 stations the rmse for approximately 10 of stations was less than 0 04 m3 m3 and at 67 80 72 03 of stations it varied from 0 04 m3 m3 to 0 10 m3 m3 compared with the recent state of the art satellite retrieved sm product smap bai et al 2018 the combined sm product not only guarantees similar accuracy but also has the advantage of a long time series fig 3 shows the sm data series from may 2005 to september 2013 from four representative stations that had rmse 0 04 rmse 0 10 and rmse 0 10 we can see that the combined sm and in situ sm agree well at stations 52 855 r 0 41 and 53 505 r 0 55 even though the rmse performed poorly 4 2 evaluation of the monthly scaled swdi three typical drought events were used in this study to verify whether the monthly scaled swdi could accurately capture agricultural drought figs 4 and 5 first we used severe meteorological drought events that occurred in northern china from march to july 2001 an et al 2014 for evaluation as shown in fig 4 the start and end times of agricultural drought swdi are consistent with the meteorological drought records there was a clear trend of drought development march 2001 to june 2001 and mitigation june 2001 to august 2001 the most severe drought occurred in june 2001 and in this month more than 40 of the area suffered severe drought and extreme drought fig 5 the second drought event we selected occurred in yunnan guizhou sichuan and guangxi provinces ygsgs from winter 2009 to spring 2010 yang et al 2012 li et al 2013 the monthly scaled swdi indicated that the drought event began in november 2009 and the most severe drought occurred in january and february 2010 fig 4 in these two months approximately 20 of the area suffered severe drought and extreme drought fig 5 the third meteorological drought event that we used occurred in qinghai and tibet in the summer and autumn of 2015 as recorded by the meteorological drought yearbook 2016 however fig 4 shows that agricultural drought began in september 2015 although the lower precipitation in this summer led to meteorological drought high temperatures in spring and summer increased the snowmelt runoff which supplemented sm and delayed the occurrence of agricultural drought in contrast agricultural drought continued in the winter of 2015 when meteorological drought conditions were mitigated mainly because of low temperatures yang and ma 2012 and chen et al 2015 found that soil water freezing due to low temperature causes the sm to decrease suddenly in some areas of the qinghai tibet plateau although plants are dormant in winter some vegetation and crops such as winter wheat still grow in winter the decrease in sm caused by low temperatures on the plateau would affect the growth of winter wheat in this section in situ drought records were used to calculate the pod with the monthly scaled swdi as shown in fig 6 the pod at 78 stations does not perform well below 0 5 accounting for approximately 13 7 53 stations 9 4 62 stations 11 0 and 93 stations 16 4 perform well with pod values between 0 5 and 0 7 0 7 and 0 8 and 0 8 and 0 9 respectively 280 stations perform fairly well with pod values higher than 0 9 which accounts for the largest proportion 49 5 especially the pod at 89 stations 15 7 which is equal to 1 the averaged pod in every province has a decreasing trend from the southeast to northwest except for four provinces i e taiwan has no station xinjiang qinghai and inner mongolia the average pod in all other provinces is higher than 0 7 the stations with poor pod are mainly distributed in the northern and northwestern parts of china twenty eight stations were filtered with pod 0 5 and the bias and rmse were calculated in section 4 1 twenty two of these 28 stations had positive bias the average bia of these 22 stations was 0 28 which means that the in situ sm was generally larger than the combined sm at these stations this resulted in a more severe agricultural drought condition assessed by the swdi than the in situ drought records and led to poor pod performance in northern and northwestern china in general the monthly scaled swdi performed fairly well in pod with in situ drought records in most parts of china 4 3 spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of monthly scaled swdi in china china was divided into four regions south north northwest and qinghai tibet plateau in this section as shown in fig 1 precipitation lines of 800 mm and 400 mm are the boundaries between humid and semihumid regions and between semihumid and semiarid regions respectively zheng et al 2010 li et al 2016 these two lines are the dividing lines between south china and north china and between north china and northwest china respectively the boundary of the qinghai tibet plateau is the dividing line of the first and second terrain steps in china han et al 2008 in general as shown in fig 7 drought conditions in spring and winter are more severe than those in summer and autumn except for summer the qinghai tibet plateau is most vulnerable to agricultural drought among the four regions followed by the northwest and north and the south is the least vulnerable there are three main factors that influence drought conditions precipitation temperature and solar radiation temperature and solar radiation affect drought conditions by influencing evapotranspiration much higher evapotranspiration caused by higher solar radiation and much lower precipitation are the main reasons for the most serious drought conditions on the qinghai tibet plateau however in hot summers snowmelt runoff caused by higher temperatures will supplement sm which can mitigate drought conditions on the plateau in contrast the soil water content is much lower in the cold winters on the plateau which causes the drought conditions to become much more severe the agricultural drought conditions on the qinghai tibet plateau are sensitive to temperature and radiation in south and north china the precipitation in summer and autumn is greater than that in spring and winter and drought conditions in spring and winter are more severe than those in summer and autumn therefore drought conditions are more sensitive to precipitation in the north and south the northwest region is a perennial arid area and the drought conditions in the four seasons are basically unchanged the reason for this pattern is that the increase decrease in precipitation in summer winter and the solar radiation and temperature increase decrease accordingly which cause the input of sm precipitation to be approximately equal to the output evapotranspiration 4 4 relationship among meteorological drought spi agricultural drought swdi and vegetation drought vci first the averaged pearson cc between different time scaled spi spi 1 to spi 12 and 1 month scaled swdi was calculated in different months january to december in the four geographical regions the correlation performed better in the north and south where agricultural drought conditions were more sensitive to precipitation section 4 3 the correlation performed much worse on the qinghai tibet plateau mainly because the temperature and high radiation were the two sensitive factors on the plateau for the twelve months except for the qinghai tibet plateau the correlation performed better in spring and winter when agricultural drought and meteorological drought both occurred frequently generally the maximum pearson cc red five pointed star in fig 8 in different months ranged from 1 month scaled to 4 month scaled spi spi 1 to spi 4 in the northwest and qinghai tibet plateau where the drought conditions were much worse the time scale of the spi with maximum pearson cc was generally shorter than that in the north and south this result indicates that it takes less time for meteorological drought to develop into agricultural drought under drier conditions in winter and spring when drought occurs severely the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought tends to be longer than that in summer this result is mainly because the duration of drought would be longer in winter and spring fig 9 shows the response time of agricultural drought to meteorological drought at 480 stations the response time ranged from 0 months to 4 months a total of 176 68 63 58 and 115 stations had response times of 0 1 2 3 and 4 months respectively at the regional spatial scale the average response times in the four regions were 1 12 months for the north 1 74 months for the northwest 1 34 months for the qinghai tibet plateau and 2 26 months for the south this result shows that the response time is longer in humid and semi humid regions where the drought conditions are better the result is consistent with fig 8 the assessment of agricultural drought based on the swdi focuses on the variation in sm and the vci evaluates vegetation drought through the variation in vegetation conditions when drought occurs the sm decreases and the vegetation condition deteriorates we believe that in some areas there are delay effects between the decrease in sm and the deterioration of vegetation pasho et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2013 therefore the pearson cc between the swdi with vci rsv0 and1 month delayed vci rsv1 was calculated to analyse the relationship and the delayed effect of soil water deficit on vegetation drought the correlation between the swdi and vci is shown in fig 10 in the southwest and tibet these two series show a significant positive correlation in contrast in some areas of xinjiang province they show a strong negative correlation in the north and southeast the correlation is neither significantly positive nor strongly negative the results show a strong correlation with land cover fig 11 the land cover of agriculture is probably affected by human activities reap and sow therefore the vegetation condition did not correlate well with sm in agricultural areas for forest the variation in vegetation condition lags with the variation in sm as shown in fig 10 b therefore the pearson cc in the north and southeast does not perform well where the land cover is mainly agriculture and forest significant positive correlations were mainly observed in areas where the land is covered by grass or a mix of grass forest and agriculture this result is mainly because there is no delayed effect of agricultural drought on vegetation drought in areas with grass in xinjiang province the negative correlation was mainly observed in two basins the tarim basin and junggar basin where the land cover is mainly desert and barren land in addition the land cover in the tianshan and kunlun mountains has a small amount of grass and agriculture thus the correlation was positive there the r10 rsv1 minus rsv0 was calculated to analyse whether vegetation drought vci has a delayed effect on agricultural drought swdi and which parts of china have a delayed effect when r10 is positive the vegetation drought is more inclined to be delayed by 1 month with agricultural drought in the area and there is no delayed response when r10 is negative the distribution of r10 is shown in fig 10 b vegetation drought is delayed by approximately 1 month with agricultural drought in a few provinces of china including yunnan guangxi guangdong fujian and the southern part of sichuan hunan province the soil water content in these areas is higher than that in other regions because of the high precipitation therefore the occurrence of meteorological drought precipitation deficit would not directly reduce the soil water content to the threshold of agricultural drought soil water deficit for example drought occurred in the ygsg from winter 2009 to spring 2010 the duration of the drought was 6 months and the agricultural drought started in november 2009 the vegetation drought was delayed by 1 month starting in december 2009 we further analysed the delayed response of vegetation conditions to agricultural drought under different types of land cover agriculture forest and grassland we reclassified r10 into 9 classes fig 12 and found that there was a significant time lag in the forest while grass and agriculture were less inclined to have a time lag the reason is that the roots of the forest are developed thus trees are more resistant to the reduction of surface sm grass and agricultural vegetation do not have roots that develop like those of forests thus the variation in surface sm and vegetation conditions is relatively consistent in these two land cover areas for grass and agricultural land there is the possibility that the response of vegetation conditions to agricultural drought is less than 1 month li et al 2014 5 discussion 5 1 advantages and disadvantages of combined sm products in situ measurement is usually the most accurate method for drought monitoring however in situ datasets are limited by their spatial resolution especially in remote areas therefore this method is often used to validate the accuracy of other drought indexes or to improve the spatial resolution of other data zhao et al 2017 the combined sm product has the advantages of 1 a long term series 2 acceptable accuracy and utility and 3 covering the entire region solving the problem of the spatial distribution of in situ data in section 4 1 the evaluation of the combined sm product showed that the rmse at most stations was higher than 0 04 m3 m3 which is usually considered the target for sm dataset validations the average pod between the swdi and in situ drought records was calculated as rmse 0 04 m3 m3 and rmse 0 04 m3 m3 respectively in may june july and september table 4 some of the sm data in august and other non growing season months were missing the results show that when most of the sm data are within the acceptable range rmse 0 10 m3 m3 the accuracy of the swdi will be reduced by less than 10 when detecting actual drought events however the in situ sm data used in this paper had a relatively short time span from 2000 to 2013 and the stations we filtered for better data quality were mainly distributed in northern china therefore the evaluation of the combined sm product was not complete not only in the length of the time series but also in the spatial distribution this characteristic brings some uncertainty to the calculation of the swdi to minimize the effects of the uncertainty associated with input sm data for the swdi the in situ sm data must be supplemented not only in the time series but also in the number of available stations moreover for better accuracy and applicability of sm data the reanalysed sm product could be obtained by comparing and merging multisource datasets including satellite based products esa cci smap and smos model assimilation data gldas and in situ datasets cma chen et al 2011 5 2 the limitations of the swdi in section 4 2 the swdi performed well in monitoring and detecting agricultural drought however the swdi has two limitations and it does not consider ecological conditions first the reasons such as vegetation characteristics and meteorological factors for different drought characteristics for different land cover types should be further investigated to improve the performance of the agricultural drought index for example in areas with forest cover trees can be more resistant to drought because their developed roots can use sm in the deep soil layer therefore the multilayer soil water content has application potential in different regions that could reflect vegetation characteristics to some extent second in the correlation analysis between the swdi and vci we found that the pearson cc between these two series did not perform well there are two reasons for this result 1 agricultural drought conditions were assessed by the swdi and the swdi was calculated using sm data without considering the vegetation condition 2 the vci is based on vegetation and is primarily useful for the summer growing season mishra and singh 2010 because sm is affected by vegetation cover a et al 2019 it would be better for the agricultural drought index to take vegetation condition data such as the leaf area index lai and ndvi into consideration to monitor agricultural drought wu et al 2013 zuo et al 2019 in cold seasons when much vegetation is largely dormant the vci cannot reflect drought conditions well heim 2002 however certain crops winter wheat and vegetation grow in cold seasons therefore a threshold could be set for the lai and ndvi and if any area has lai and ndvi values lower than the threshold it can be ignored in the analysis of agricultural drought conditions this would better reflect agricultural drought conditions in both the growing and cold seasons in addition the calculation of the drought index can consider the use of water supply precipitation irrigation etc and demand evapotranspiration climatically appropriate precipitation for existing conditions etc or water energy balance precipitation evapotranspiration sm etc to make the index more comprehensive and reasonable zhang et al 2015 zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2019a 5 3 further research on the relationships of different types of drought the relationships among meteorological drought agricultural drought and vegetation drought were investigated in this paper however in some areas human water management such as irrigation and reservoir operations greatly affects drought characteristics and drought evolution he et al 2017 found that irrigation in the central valley increased hydrological drought duration and deficit by 50 and 50 100 respectively fang et al 2019 found that irrigation practices alleviate crop vulnerability under drought stress on the loess plateau the results of the relationship between meeteorological drought and agricultural drought in section 4 4 include the effect of human water management for example the satellite retrieved sm product the esa cci sm product contains the variation in sm caused by irrigation and other human water management the variation in sm caused by irrigation could delay and mitigate the effect of meteorological drought on agricultural drought therefore the effect of human water management should be quantified in further research to monitor drought characteristics more accurately in irrigation areas and reservoir areas in recent years with the development of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence spatiotemporal dynamics with three dimensions latitude longitude and time of drought have gradually become a hotpot in drought research herrera estrada et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the 3 d spatiotemporal dynamics of drought could capture the migration trajectories and migration directions of drought which have great significance for drought warning and drought prediction furthermore when analysing drought 3 d dynamics other factors such as precipitation sm evapotranspiration and temperature could be taken into account in the process of the dynamics to properly capture the dynamic evolution among the different types of drought this approach will provide more accurate and targeted information for decision makers regarding when and where drought occurs different types of drought have different characteristics and properties under agricultural drought the growth of crops and vegetation is greatly affected by sm the dominant temporal scale for the agricultural drought index is weekly martínez fernández et al 2016 mishra et al 2017 bai et al 2018 however in this paper the monthly agricultural drought index was used for comparison with the meteorological drought which was assessed by monthly scaled spi to solve this problem of multiple time scales due to different drought properties the dynamic evolution of drought needs to consider the transformation of the time scale for example the monthly scale of meteorological drought can be transformed to a weekly scale when evolving to agricultural drought li et al 2014 a multiscalar daily weekly and monthly drought index such as the spi and szi zhang et al 2019b could be developed for monitoring different types of drought 6 conclusions the accuracy of drought indexes and the relationship among multiple droughts are two crucial areas of drought research in this paper the sm product which was combined from the esa cci sm product and the gldas sm product shows great application potential in analysing agricultural drought the monthly scaled swdi calculated using the combined sm product can accurately capture features of agricultural drought in most parts of china through comparison with in situ drought records the poor performance of the monthly swdi was mainly due to underestimation of the combined sm data the qinghai tibet plateau showed the worst agricultural drought conditions and the main influential factor was temperature on the plateau north and south china are sensitive to precipitation the northwest is a perennial arid area where the drought conditions in the four seasons are basically unchanged winter and spring are more vulnerable to agricultural drought than summer and autumn the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought is shorter under drier conditions at the regional spatial scale the response time ranges from 1 month to 2 5 months a significant correlation between agricultural drought and vegetation drought was mainly observed in areas covered by grass or a mix of grass forest and agriculture there was a significant time lag in the forest while grass and agriculture were more inclined to have no time lag or one that was less than 1

10408,mulching and deficit irrigation are often used to alleviate the contradiction between the water supply and consumption in the apple industry in the loess plateau of china however the effects of the combination of mulching and deficit irrigation on the soil environment and the growth and productivity of apple trees are not clear field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 which included three mulching methods horticultural fabric mulching fm corn straw mulching sm and clear tillage treatment with no mulching tl and three irrigation strategies full irrigation w1 moderate deficit irrigation w2 and severe deficit irrigation w3 the results showed that both sm and fm significantly increased the soil water content swc especially in the early stage of the growth period sm significantly reduced and stabilized the soil temperature during the whole growth season and effectively delayed the onset of flowering while fm had no significant effect on the soil temperature both mulching and irrigation significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate pn of leaves and sm inhibited the occurrence of midday depression a significant improvement of the yield was found in the sm and fm treatments and there was little difference between them differences of the yield under different irrigation amounts were only reflected in the tl treatment in 2019 as a high soil moisture content under mulch counteracts part of the irrigation effect taken together the results indicate that sm and fm have the potential to increase apple yields in the loess plateau by improving the soil environment and regulating the growth and physiology of apple trees keywords loess plateau of china mulching deficit irrigation soil water heat apple growth yield 1 introduction the semiarid region of the loess plateau of china is the largest apple producing area in the world due to its high altitude abundant sunshine deep soils and large day night temperature differences huang and gallichand 2006 however drought and soil erosion in the loess plateau have led to a severe water shortage in this region where the average annual rainfall is only 200 600 mm zhong et al 2019 apple trees have a high demand for transpiration which aggravates the contradiction between the water supply and consumption in apple orchards therefore water shortage is severely restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry which is mainly located in rainfed areas song et al 2018 maintaining sufficient soil storage for apple growth can be achieved by two measures increasing the water input and reducing the water consumption on one hand introducing irrigation and ensuring adequate infiltration of rainfall can increase the water input on the other hand it is possible to conserve water through the reduction of non productive water evaporation chen et al 2015 ram et al 2013 and the reduction of luxury crop transpiration collins et al 2010 du et al 2006 lópez lópez et al 2018 as a farmland management practice and effective water conservation technique soil surface mulching is widely used in arid and semi arid areas chakraborty et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 zribi et al 2015 in general a large amount of water is lost through soil evaporation and crop transpiration deng et al 2006 qin et al 2013 mulching forms an isolation layer between the soil surface and the atmosphere which can effectively reduce the exchange of water vapor between the soil surface and the atmosphere zribi et al 2015 in this area the traditional planting model is clear tillage with bare farmland so mulching can effectively reduce the soil evaporation by reducing the surface exposure and soil disturbance consequently the evaporation of water from the mulched soil decreases relative to that from bare soil and more water is available for beneficial crop transpiration hou et al 2010 sarkar et al 2007 the soil temperature is a key environmental factor that has an impact on crop growth by regulating the water absorption and nutrient uptake in root zones in previous studies it has been shown that mulching can also effectively affect the soil temperature awe et al 2015 olasantan 1999 sarkar et al 2007 xie et al 2006 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2009 however different mulching methods have different effects on the soil temperature depending on the materials used film mulching was reported to increase the soil temperature due to absorbing more solar radiation and reducing the soil heat loss anikwe et al 2007 gu et al 2019 hou et al 2010 li et al 2013a b while organic mulch such as straw woodchips and crop residues was reported to effectively decrease the soil temperature by retaining incoming solar radiation cook et al 2006 rashid et al 2019 in addition in previous studies soil surface mulching was also reported to improve the soil physical properties chen et al 2014 smets et al 2008 and soil fertility jordán et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2013 alter the soil microbiology carney and matson 2005 steinmetz et al 2016 adjust the infiltration of rainfall li et al 2018 prosdocimi et al 2016 song et al 2018 and affect the crop growth physiology and ultimately yield and wue abd el wahed and ali 2013 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 however mulching also has some negative effects such as plastic wastes and more greenhouse gas emissions in the film mulching cuello et al 2015 pests and soil acidification in some organic mulchings kader et al 2017 high labor demand in gravel mulching suo et al 2019 therefore the appropriate mulching method should be determined according to the mulching materials soil crops and economic cost in arid and semi arid areas deficit irrigation is widely used to alleviate the contradiction between water scarcity and yield improvement some studies have demonstrated that crops have a certain adaptability to water deficits and a moderate water deficit may not significantly reduce the crop yield garcía tejero et al 2010 zhong et al 2019 to evaluate the response of fruit tree growth to deficit irrigation scholars have done much research including on apples zhong et al 2019 almonds lópez lópez et al 2018 oranges zapata sierra and manzano agugliaro 2017 grapes faci et al 2014 and pear jujubes cui et al 2008 el jaouhari et al 2018 found that moderate deficit irrigation 75 etc can improve wue and quality parameters firmness and brix without significant loss of yield while the severe deficit 50 etc was insufficient to maintain an acceptable fruit size similar results were observed in alikhani koupaei et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 reported that 75 etc treatment reduced transpiration and vegetative growth which may be due to the accumulation of abscisic acid aba zhong et al 2019 found that moderate water stress inhibits overgrowth by balancing vegetative with reproductive growth and has little effect on the normal growth and development of fruits as water conservation and water saving measures mulching and deficit irrigation have been studied in numerous field experiments respectively however few studies were available on the combination of deficit irrigation and mulching for fruit trees in loess plateau of china and most of them focused on the effects of soil moisture heat and yield in addition the effects of soil water and heat changes on growth and physiology and their relationships with yield formation of fruit trees need further study compared with individual we assumed that the combination of mulching and deficit irrigation can not only increase soil water input but also effectively conserve soil water and improve growth and production of fruit trees therefore the primary objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the combined effects of mulching and deficit irrigation on the soil water and heat growth and physiology of apple trees 2 investigate the relationships between soil water and heat changes growth and physiology response and yield formation and 3 recommend an optimal combination of mulching and deficit irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment location a two year field study was carried out during 2018 season i and 2019 season ii the experiment was conducted at a commercial apple orchard located in qingshuigou village zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province northwest china 37 27 n 110 2 e altitude 1020 m the experimental site is in a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau and has a continental temperate climate with an annual average sunshine duration of over 2543 3 h with 170 frost free days the annual effective rainfall amounts during the whole growth stage were 486 8 mm in 2018 and 452 2 mm in 2019 the daily mean temperatures in the 2018 and 2019 growth season were 10 4 and 11 2 c respectively the soil of the experimental location is classified as sandy loam with favourable hydraulic properties gao et al 2018 it has a ph of 8 5 a bulk density of 1 41 g cm 3 and a mean field capacity θf of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 in 1 m soil layer 2 2 experimental design eight year old honeycrisp apple trees malus pumila mill with similar trunk diameters and bark depths were selected as the experimental trees the apple trees were planted in east west orientation with a row spacing of 3 5 m and a plant spacing of 2 m 1429 plants ha 1 the whole growth season was divided into the bud development and flowering stage early april to mid may the leaf expansion stage late may to mid june the fruit expansion stage late june to late august and the fruit maturing stage early september to fruit harvest the experiment included two factors mulching and deficit irrigation in a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement there were three mulching treatments horticultural fabric mulching fm corn straw mulching sm and clear tillage treatment with no mulching tl for fm a 10 cm deep and 1 2 m wide ditch was dug along both sides of the tree row first and slopes with a depth to width ratio of 1 12 were built fig 1 the slopes on both sides of the trench were respectively covered with 1 m wide and 0 3 mm thick horticultural fabric and 20 cm at the bottom of the trench was not covered to facilitate rainwater collection for sm both sides of the tree row were respectively covered with 1 2 m wide corn straw and the straw mulching layer was divided into two layers the lower layer was the straw section 1 3 cm length which was crushed by a straw crusher and the covering was 7 cm thick the upper layer was complete straw the covering was 3 cm thick the total thickness of the straw covering layer was 10 cm the straw came from a corn field near the orchard and was exposed to the sun for three days before being used as the covering to kill pests and pathogens a nylon net covered the straw mulching layer to stabilize the straw mulching layer straw was supplemented in october every year a total of three irrigation treatments was designed in 2018 and 2019 including full irrigation w1 and sustainable moderate w2 and sustainable severe w3 deficit treatments with three irrigation levels the three irrigation levels applied were defined based on the soil water content swc of tlw1 θtlw1 w1 θtlw1 85 θf w2 75 w1 and w3 50 w1 under the same water deficit different mulching treatments received the same irrigation amount the local rainfed apple trees were taken as the control ck so there were ten treatments in total with each treatment having 3 5 trees and being repeated three times in early october after harvesting 700 kg ha 1 p2o5 570 kg ha 1 k2o and 430 kg ha 1 urea were applied as a base fertilizer in mid june the trees were fertilized with 430 kg ha 1 k2o and 300 kg ha 1 urea as a topdressing other agronomic measures were consistent such as pruning weeding insecticide spraying and flower thinning and fruit thinning 2 3 soil moisture monitoring and irrigation according to the local water consumption rate the soil moisture of each treatment was monitored for about 10 days by trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de at 20 cm intervals over the 80 cm depth soil layer at horizontal distances of 40 and 80 cm from the tree row fig 1 when θtlw1 was lower than the irrigation low limit 70 θf irrigation was carried out the experimental plots were equipped with a drip irrigation system each tree row had two drip lines 16 mm on the left and right sides located 60 cm from the tree row fig 1 and equipped with integrated emitters uniformly spaced 30 cm apart on the drip line to deliver 3 l per hour drip lines were placed under the mulching layer in fm and sm the irrigation amount of w1 was calculated using the following formula 1 1 w 1000 ph θ max θ tlw1 here w is the irrigation amount per tree mm p is the planned wetting ratio 0 3 h is the planned wetting layer m 0 8 m θmax is the irrigation upper limit 85 θf and θtlw1 is the swc of tlw1 irrigation water of suitable quality for apple growth was obtained from a well near the experimental site each subplot had a water meter connected to the pipeline to monitor the water inflow 2 4 soil temperature in order to study the changes in soil temperature under different treatments at each growth stage and reduce labor the soil temperature was measured for about seven days during the two consecutive growth seasons at fixed time points 8 00 10 00 12 00 14 00 16 00 18 00 20 00 using an angle stem earth thermometer the angle stem earth thermometer was placed at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm in the tlw1 tlw3 fmw1 fmw3 smw1 smw3 and ck treatment plots 2 5 plant measurements 2 5 1 flowering intensity the number and type of flowers red bud stage balloon stage open flower petal fall and fruit set fig 2 were counted on april 22 before flower thinning and april 30 may 9 and may 18 after flower thinning in 2019 in each experimental tree twelve branches they come from the upper middle and lower layers of the east west north and south respectively were selected to count the number and type of flowers to represent the flowering intensity of the whole tree the proportions of each flowering stage were expressed in percent count with respect to the total number of developmental flowering stages observed on each evaluation date kusakabe et al 2016 2 5 2 leaf photosynthesis leaf physiological parameters were measured on three consecutive sunny days from july 17 three days after one irrigation event during fruit expansion with a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor nebraska usa in 2019 in each experimental tree four sunlit healthy leaves were randomly selected from different directions and tagged to measure the leaf physiological parameters at two hour intervals from 8 00 to 18 00 each leaf was measured three times in each measurement and then the leaf water use efficiency wuel was calculated as the net photosynthetic rate pn divided by the transpiration rate tr 2 5 3 fruit yield the number of fruits and yield per tree were calculated and the fruits were weighed after harvesting on 17 september 2018 and 21 september 2019 respectively the single fruit weight per tree was calculated by dividing the yield by the number of fruits 2 6 meteorological factors and et0 the rainfall air temperature atmospheric pressure relative air humidity solar radiation wind velocity and wind direction were obtained at a height of 2 0 m using an automatic weather station installed in the orchard a rainfall amount during a single rainfall of greater than 5 mm was considered to be an effective rainfall reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 7 statistical analysis the data were analysed by an analysis of variance anova with spss 25 0 statistics spss inc chicago il usa to determine the effects of mulching on the flowering stage distribution a chi squared χ2 analysis was performed using spss 25 0 statistics on the proportions of flowering developmental stages were calculated per treatment the statistical significance of treatment differences calculated based on the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 rainfall irrigation et0 and air temperature fig 3 shows the daily average temperatures during two consecutive apple growing seasons compared with 2019 the temperature variation in 2018 was extremely unstable on april 6 and 7 2018 a severe frost occurred which caused many apple flowers to be damaged in 2018 and 2019 effective rainfall rainfall greater than 5 mm events during the growth season totalled 30 and 22 and the total effective rainfall was 486 8 mm and 452 2 mm respectively table 1 most of the effective rainfall occurred during the fruit expansion stage accounting for 59 8 291 2 mm and 48 3 218 4 mm of the total effective rainfall in 2018 and 2019 respectively the water was irrigated eight times in 2018 and 2019 most of the irrigation events were distributed during the first three growth stages table 1 the reference evapotranspiration et0 amounts during the whole growth seasons were 670 5 mm in 2018 and 656 0 mm in 2019 3 2 soil water content despite some fluctuations the swc showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during the two years fig 4 fig 5 at the beginning of the growth stage the temperature and solar radiation were low the apple tree grew slowly and the evapotranspiration was at a low level with the development of the growth period the temperature gradually rose the apple trees began to grow vigorously and there was less rainfall so the swc at this stage the leaf expansion stage and early fruit expansion stage was at the lowest level throughout the growth season after july the rainfall increased rapidly which effectively supplemented the soil moisture content while due to the higher evapotranspiration the swc during this period was characterized by the alternation of increases and losses as well as drastic changes the tlw3 had the lowest swc in 2018 19 62 and 2019 19 81 the smw1 had the highest swc in 2018 21 22 and fmwi had the highest swc in 2019 21 10 mulching significantly increased the swc fig 4b fig 5b in 2018 the mean swc of fm was 20 which was an increase of 4 6 and 5 8 compared to those of tl 19 98 and ck 19 75 and that of sm 20 85 increased by 4 4 and 5 6 compared to those of tl and ck respectively in 2019 the mean swc of fm was 20 85 an increase of 4 3 and 3 1 compared with those of tl 20 00 and ck 19 85 respectively and that of sm 20 62 increased by 3 1 and 3 9 compared with those of tl and ck respectively in 2018 the swc of the fm and sm treatments was higher than those of the tl and ck treatments except on a limited number of days fm always had a higher swc in the early growth stage while sm had a higher swc in the later growth stage in the early growth period the swc of tl was significantly higher than that of ck while no significant difference was found between them in the later growth period which may have been related to increased rainfall and reduced irrigation in the later growth period in the early growth period of 2019 the swc presented a trend of fm sm tl ck and in the middle growth period the swc of sm was at a low level even lower than those of tl and ck and gradually recovered to a higher level in the later growth period different deficit irrigation strategies had an impact on the swc in the two consecutive growth seasons fig 4c fig 5c the swc in both years increased with the increase of the irrigation amount in 2018 the mean swc of w1 w2 and w3 in the growth season were 20 92 20 59 and 20 21 which were 6 0 4 3 and 2 3 higher than those of ck 19 75 respectively irrigation had a smaller effect on the swc in 2019 as the mean swc of w1 w2 and w3 in the growth season were 20 71 20 42 and 20 23 which were 4 3 2 9 and 1 9 higher than those of ck 19 85 respectively it is worth noting that the swc of ck was the lowest in the early growth period but in the middle and late growth period its swc rose to an abnormally high level in 2019 3 3 soil temperature during the two year apple growth season the changes in the surface soil temperature and air temperature were basically the same and they all showed a trend of first rising and then decreasing fig 6 the soil temperature during the bud development and flowering stage in 2019 was lower than that in 2018 but the soil temperature during the leaf expansion stage was higher than that in 2018 and the last two growth stages did not produce a difference this was because a colder dormant period date not shown was experienced before the growth season in 2019 and the air temperature during leaf expansion in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 the maximum soil temperature during the two years was reached in the fruit expansion stage the effects of different mulching treatments on the soil temperature are different although the soil temperature under fm had some differences from those under tl and ck the differences did not reach a significant level however sm significantly decreased the soil temperature during these two years and with the development of the growth period the differences decreased gradually different water deficits did not have a significant effect on the surface soil temperature the daily variation of the soil temperature was also greatly affected by the air temperature fig 7 in the daily variation of the soil temperature during the four growth periods the soil temperatures of tl fm and ck were consistent with the air temperature changes while differences appeared in sm the soil temperature of sm was significantly lower than those of the other three treatments and the difference gradually decreased with the development of the growth period the minimum value of the soil temperature in all treatments appeared at 8 00 while the maximum value appeared at different times the maximum value of the soil temperature of tl fm and ck always appeared at the same time as the maximum air temperature however the maximum value of the soil temperature of sm appeared two hours later compared to that of the air temperature in the last three growth periods sm significantly delayed the rising and declining of the soil temperature during the whole growth season 3 4 flowering intensity the intensity of flowering which was expressed as the number of flowers nf on twelve selected branches per tree at different phenological stages including red bud balloon open flower petal fall and fruit set counted on the trees showed a downward trend fig 8 due to natural flower dropping and flower thinning manual thinning by local farmers on april 29 nf was significantly affected by the mulching practices the nf of fm was significantly higher than those of other treatments on april 22 however artificial flower thinning eliminated this effect fig 8a b the sm treatment had the most flowers in the last three observations with numbers significantly higher than those of other treatments on may 18 fig 8b c d while no significant differences were found between other treatments the flowering phenology which is the distribution of flowering stages on a tree was significantly affected by the mulching higher proportions of flowers were at the red bud stage in sm trees 90 relative to tl 69 fm 75 and ck 76 trees on april 22 χ2 13 64 p 0 034 fig 8a by contrast the balloon and open flower stages of flowers were present in lower proportions in sm 7 3 than in other treatments while no significant differences were found in the distribution of flowers between the other treatments χ2 1 793 p 0 774 nf decreased significantly after flower thinning but the same trend was still found in the later two observation periods as sm delayed the onset of flowering in apple trees compared to other treatments and no significant differences were found in the distribution of flowers between the other treatments fig 8b c the proportion of open flowers in sm 61 was significantly lower than those in other three treatments tl 71 fm 77 ck 78 with the highest proportion of backward growth stages red bud and balloon on april 30 χ2 21 36 p 0 011 fig 7b on may 9 sm had the highest proportion of open flowers 55 and the lowest proportion of fruit setting 38 while more than 50 of the flowers were in fruit setting stage in the other treatments χ2 20 88 p 0 013 fig 8c near the end of flowering may 18 no differences were observed in the distribution of flowering stages among the different mulching practices χ2 8 26 p 0 213 fig 8d 3 5 leaf photosynthesis fig 9 shows the daily variation of the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance gs under different mulching types and different water deficits degrees during the fruit expansion period in 2019 sm effectively inhibited the midday depression of leaf photosynthesis and the daily variation of pn showed a unimodal type with the maximum value appearing at 10 00 the daily variations of pn in the other treatments were bimodal with a midday depression at 12 00 the two peaks appeared at 10 00 and 14 00 although the second peak was lower than the first peak mulching significantly increased the pn of apple leaves the daily average pn of fm and sm were 11 19 μmol m 2 s 1 and 11 60 μmol m 2 s 1 which were 14 4 and 18 6 higher than those of tl 9 78 μmol m 2 s 1 and 32 7 and 37 6 higher than those of ck 8 43 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively table 2 however there was no significant difference between sm and fm the daily variation of tr was unimodal except that the maximum value of ck appeared at 12 00 while the maximum value of other treatments appeared at 14 00 the daily average tr presented a trend sm 4 74 mmol m 2s 1 fm 4 61 mmol m 2s 1 tl 4 40 mmol m 2s 1 ck 4 08 mmol m 2s 1 the daily average tr showed no significant difference between sm fm and tl but they were all significantly higher than that of ck the daily variation of gs was also unimodal with the maximum values of all treatments appearing at 10 00 the daily averages of fm 0 34 mol m 2 s 1 and sm 0 35 mol m 2 s 1 were significantly higher than those of tl 0 31 mol m 2 s 1 and ck 0 30 mol m 2 s 1 different water deficits had significant effects on pn tr and gs fig 9b under different water deficits the daily variation of pn was bimodal and pn increased with the increase of the irrigation amount the daily average pn of w1 w2 w3 and ck were 11 61 μmol m 2 s 1 10 95 μmol m 2 s 1 10 01 μmol m 2 s 1 and 8 43 μmol m 2 s 1 and significant differences existed between any two treatments the daily variation of tr was unimodal and the maximum values of w1 w2 and w3 appeared at 14 00 the daily averages tr of w1 w2 and w3 were 4 82 mmol m 2s 1 4 50 mmol m 2s 1 and 4 43 mmol m 2s 1 which were significantly higher than that of ck and the value for w1 was significantly higher than those for w2 and w3 under different water deficits gs increased with the increase of the irrigation amount and the maximum value appeared at 10 00 the daily mean gs of w1 w2 w3 and ck were 0 35 mol m 2 s 1 0 32 mol m 2 s 1 0 32 mol m 2 s 1 and 0 30 mol m 2 s 1 respectively and the value for w1 was significantly higher than that for ck table 2 shows the photosynthetic parameters of apple leaves under different treatments during the fruit expansion stage in 2019 under the same mulching strategy pn tr gs and rh relative humidity gradually decreased with the decrease of the irrigation amount the maximum values of these four photosynthetic parameters usually appeared in the fmw1 and smw1 and the minimum values usually appeared in tlw3 and ck under tl and sm ci the intercellular co2 concentration gradually increased with the decrease of the irrigation amount while that of fm showed the opposite trend and ck had the largest ci under the same water deficit pn tr and gs followed the trend of sm fm tl ck and the largest rh appeared in the fm treatment under the same water deficit mulching significantly improved the wuel and w2 had the highest wuel under the same mulching strategy in all treatments smw2 had the highest wuel and the lowest wuel appeared in tlw3 and ck table 3 shows the pearson correlation analysis of the photosynthetic parameters ci was negatively correlated with all other photosynthetic parameters and was significantly negatively correlated with pn tr and wuel except that the correlations between tr and wuel there was a significant positive correlation between other photosynthetic parameters 3 6 yield frost that occurred in spring greatly damaged production in 2018 and the number of fruits single fruit weight and yield in 2018 were only 67 1 74 6 and 49 9 of that in 2019 table 4 mulching significantly increased the number of fruits at harvest and the sm treatment produced a higher value than that of fm in 2018 while no significant difference was found between them in 2019 the application of mulching had no significant effects p 0 05 on the single fruit weight during the two consecutive apple growing seasons even though sm had relatively lower single fruit weight in 2018 while ck showed the same in 2019 in 2018 fm and sm produced similar yields of 20 8 t ha 1 and 21 5 t ha 1 respectively which were significantly higher than those of tl 16 9 t ha 1 and ck 14 2 t ha 1 the same trend emerged in 2019 even though the production had been greatly improved compared with 2018 the two year average yields indicate that the yield was improved by 24 8 and 49 4 in the fm treatment compared to the tl and ck treatments simultaneously compared with those of tl and ck the yield of sm also increased by 25 9 and 50 8 under the same mulching strategy irrigation had no significant effects on the yield however there was a significant difference between tlw1 and tlw3 in 2019 smwi and fmwi had the highest yields in 2018 and 2019 respectively and ck had the lowest yields in both years 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching and irrigation on the soil water content in our study the changes of the swc in all treatments were similar showing a trend of decreasing first and then increasing while in a similar study huang et al 2009 observed that the changes of the swc were w type and this might have been due to the different climate and rainfall distribution in the early stage of the growth period the swc was at a relatively high level due to the low evapotranspiration however with the increase of the temperature and radiation and the vigorous growth of the trees the swc began to decline and reached the lowest level in may and june after july the swc began to increase due to the rapid increase of rainfall as shown in fig 4 fig 5 and table 1 irrigation mainly occurred in the early stage of the growth season while rainfall was mainly concentrated in the late stage of the growth season therefore there was a complementary relationship between irrigation and rainfall to maintain and improve the swc the soil water is considered to be one of the most important factors affecting plant growth and development yi et al 2010 silvente et al 2012 even a small change in soil water storage could affect crop productivity liu et al 2010a b in the two consecutive years mulching had significant effects on improving the swc and the same results were found in previous studies liao et al 2019 liu et al 2014 suo et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 zribi et al 2015 fm always had the higher swc in the early growth period while sm had the higher swc in the late growth period evaporation inhibition and increasing rainfall infiltration are two keys to soil moisture conservation fm and sm had the same effects on controlling evaporation because they covered the surface soil and isolated the soil from the atmosphere however some differences existed in the absorption and infiltration of rainfall between them horticultural fabric is a kind of woven material with permeability straw itself forms a rainfall collection and absorption layer and additional barriers on the soil surface therefore sm can not only absorb part of the rainfall but can also effectively delay and prevent the formation of surface seepage and runoff liu et al 2012 2014 prosdocimi et al 2016 in the early growth period rainfall is always characterized by low frequency low magnitude and the fm treatment could absorb more rainfall compared to the sm treatment because part of the rainfall was absorbed by straw and then lost due to evaporation from the ground conversely rainfall in the late growth period is characterized by high frequency high magnitude and part of the rainfall will form surface seepage and runoff in the fm treatment while the absorption capability of straw provides additional pathways for water infiltration li et al 2011 this trapped water in the straw is gradually released over several days resulting in increasing infiltration liu et al 2014 it is worth noting that in 2019 the swc of sm in the middle growth period was at a relatively low level it was speculated that there was high transpiration from compensatory growth in this period because the low temperature fig 6 caused by sm treatment delayed the growth and development of crops in the early growth period rashid et al 2019 in our study the swc increased with the increase of the irrigation amount it was noted that the difference in the swc caused by different deficit irrigation amounts was mainly reflected in the early and middle stages which was related to the fact that the irrigation events were mainly concentrated in the early and middle growth periods and more rainfall occurred in the later growth period the control treatment without irrigation was at a high level in the middle and late growth period of 2019 this might be because the ck treatment inhibited the normal growth of apple trees due to long term water stress resulting in lower transpiration under the same water deficit mulching increased the swc compared with tl which was an effect partially attributed to the high water holding capacity of the mulch on the other hand mulching reduced the evaporation of irrigation water because the wetted soil surface after irrigation was covered zhang et al 2014 4 2 effects of mulching and irrigation on the soil temperature the soil temperature controls the rate of crop development particularly when the meristem is within the soil olasantan 1999 in the consecutive two years sm treatment significantly reduced the soil temperature during daytime in the whole growth season which was consistent with the results of previous studies rashid et al 2019 suo et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 this might be because of the interactive effect between high solar reflectance and low thermal conductivity due to the thick mulching layer of organics awe et al 2015 straw forms an isolation layer for the temperature on the soil surface and it plays a role in buffering and regulating the changes of the surface soil temperature therefore sm can reduce soil temperature fluctuations throughout the growth season which is beneficial to the top growth and root development of plants kader et al 2017 in our study with the development of the growth period the effect of sm on decreasing the soil temperature gradually decreased which could be attributed to three factors the first was that sm delayed the increase of the soil temperature in the early growth period and the decrease of the soil temperature in the late growth period in addition at the end of the growth season almost all the straw section were decomposed into residue and organic matter which could reduce the mulching effect and the thickness of the straw covering layer was reduced to about 3 cm the last one was the increase of the plant canopy which reduced the area of bare soil hou et al 2010 in terms of daily changes the daily variation of the soil temperature was more moderate under the sm treatment than under the other treatments in the similar study liu et al 2014 reported that in spring and autumn when the diurnal temperature range was large the soil temperature under sm was lower during the daytime but higher at night while the soil temperature was always lower in summer and higher in winter compared to other treatments however there was no conflict with our results due to the different measurement times and methods inorganic mulches such as plastic films geotextiles etc are always reported to can increase the temperature nurzadeh namaghi et al 2018 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2018 in our study fm had no significant effect on the soil temperature which was probably because of the differences of the materials colour thickness permeability to water and air etc and the local climate conditions the movement of water and heat in soil is interactive the soil moisture affects the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of soil thus affecting the soil temperature at the same time the changes of the soil temperature can also affect the movement of soil moisture zhang et al 2006 in our study irrigation did not cause a significant difference in the soil temperature in the similar study yang et al 2018 reported that irrigation did not have a significant effect on the soil temperature but under mulching conditions higher irrigation can reduce the accumulated soil temperature near the ground surface because the heat preservation of the film mulching and the larger canopy reduced the solar radiation reaching the ground 4 3 effects of mulching on the flowering intensity mulching and irrigation greatly affect the soil temperature and soil moisture which are of great importance to plant growth and development however in previous studies there were some controversies about the changes of soil temperature under mulching some scholars reported that the low temperature caused by organic mulching in the spring often lead to poor development of crops and the increase of the soil temperature under plastic film mulching in the spring was beneficial to crop growth yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 while in summer an excessive increase of the soil temperature under film mulching would hinder root growth and crop development and ultimately affect the yield and organic mulching can reduce the fluctuations of soil temperature and the harmful effects of extreme temperatures on crop growth nurzadeh namaghi et al 2018 pinamonti 1998 in addition the increase of the temperature would lead to the advancement of crop phenology and on the contrary the decrease of the temperature would lead to the delay of phenology paltineanu and chitu 2020 yang et al 2018 in our study the fm treatment increased the flowering potential of the apple trees and produced the most flowers on april 22 although the effect was eliminated by artificial flower thinning this was in agreement with the results of muneer et al 2019 compared with other treatments the sm treatment delayed the onset of flowering in apple trees due to the lower soil temperature szalay et al 2019 reported that the frost tolerance of flowers was determined mostly by environmental factors rather than genotypic effects and the frost tolerance was the largest at the red bud stage and continuously decreased as blooming proceeded therefore late blooming apple trees are less affected by frost this means that the sm treatment can effectively reduce the risk of freezing injury during apple flowering especially in the loess plateau which has frequent frost damage in spring moreover the sm treatment can effectively control the flower bud abscission and produced the most flowers near the end of flowering this is consistent with the findings of nurzadeh namaghi et al 2018 who reported that organic mulches can significantly controlled flower bud and fruit abscission and are effective in controlling the alternate bearing of fruit trees flowering is generally considered to be advanced by water deficits in many woody perennial species sharp et al 2009 in the measurement of flowering intensity only two irrigation was carried out near the end of flowering hence we did not study the differences of flowering intensity among different water deficits 4 4 effects of mulching and irrigation on leaf photosynthesis photosynthesis provides organic compounds and energy for plants and is a key factor affecting the growth and productivity of fruit trees mulching effectively improved the photosynthetic efficiency which may have been due to the improvement of the soil conditions higher soil moisture and stable soil temperature and crop canopy temperature and humidity which was consistent with the results obtained for grapevines and blueberries muneer et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 on clear sunny days a midday depression of photosynthesis in outdoor grown plants is often observed and the maximum rates of co2 assimilation occur only during the early morning and late afternoon guo et al 2009 in some studies the midday depression of photosynthesis is related to high air temperatures a low relative humidity at midday and water deficits xu 1990 zhang et al 2018 in our study midday depression was also observed and sm effectively inhibited the midday depression of leaf photosynthesis fm had the same trend of inhibiting the midday depression but it was not significant which may have been because sm could not only improve the soil moisture content and relative humidity but also stabilize the soil temperature and reduce the soil high temperature at midday decaying corn straw can also release co2 and increase photosynthesis raw materials leaf photosynthesis was sensitive to swc cui et al 2009 in our study water deficit decreased pn and pn was reduced with the increase of the water deficit this conclusion supports the findings of previous studies ben ahmed et al 2007 cui et al 2009 ma et al 2007 it is generally believed that the reasons for the decrease of the photosynthetic capacity include stomatal limitation and non stomatal limitation and there is a complementary relationship between them jiang et al 2001 xu 1997 zhang et al 2018 stomatal limitation refers the decrease of gs which can prevent co2 from entering into leaf cells which results in the decrease of ci and pn and non stomatal limitation refers to lower photosynthetic activity due to low chloroplast activity rubisco activity and rubp carboxylase regeneration ability our study also found that gs decreased with the increase of the water deficit and the recovery of pn at 14 00 under the continuous decline of gs from 10 00 infers the participation of non stomatal limitation stomata are the passageways of gas exchange between plant leaves and the external environment and they are also important channels of water loss gs indicates the difficulty of gas passing through the stomata which is related to pn tr and ci to a certain extent in our study gs had a significant positive correlation with pn and tr however no significant correlation was found with ci and this might have been because a higher gs was always accompanied by a higher pn which indicates more co2 consumption mulching significantly improves wuel because mulching significantly improves pn but the increase of tr was not significant the same effect also appeared in the promotion of wuel by irrigation 4 5 effects of mulching and irrigation on the yield regardless of the normal year 2019 and the year affected by frost 2018 mulching significantly increased the apple yield which was consistent with the results of chen et al 2014 liu et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 however no significant difference was found in the single fruit weight therefore the improvement of the yield was largely due to the increase and maintenance of the number of fruits by mulching in our study significant quadratic polynomial relationships between the yield and swc fig 10 and between the yield and pn fig 11 were shown as reported by zhou et al 2017 therefore the increase of the number of fruits and yield under mulching may be due to a higher swc and greater co2 assimilation due to a higher photosynthetic rate in addition fm can increase the flowering potential of the apple trees and sm can effectively control the flower bud abscission in 2018 the number of fruits in the sm treatment was significantly higher than that in the fm treatment this might have been because sm delayed flowering and effectively stabilized the soil temperature thus reducing the impact of frost damage on flowering du et al 2017 reported that the number of fruits and yield significantly increased with the increase of the irrigation amount in our study only the tl treatment in 2019 presented the same trend this might have been because the high swc under the mulching reduced the irrigation water required hou et al 2010 moreover the severe frost in 2018 counteracted part of the irrigation effect looking at the impact of irrigation alone the mean yield of the tl treatments was increased by 14 2 and 20 compared with ck in 2018 and 2019 in the normal year under the tl pattern the yield under full irrigation was significantly higher than that under severe deficit irrigation while no significant difference was found between full irrigation and moderate deficit irrigation zhou et al 2017 reported similar results indicating that moderate deficit irrigation will not affect yields due to the certain adaptability of crops to water deficits in this study we found that mulching significantly increased the apple yield however under mulching no significant differences in the yield was found between different water deficits does this mean that separate application of mulching is enough to meet the water demands of apple trees in this region further research is needed in addition mulching mainly adjusts the growth and development of crops by adjusting soil water and heat conditions and roots are the most vulnerable therefore more research are required on roots growth and distribution which are important to explain crop response 5 conclusion both fm and sm greatly changed the soil environment however fm had a greater effect on increasing the swc than did sm while no significant effect on the soil temperature was found in fm sm also significantly increased the swc and it concurrently decreased and stabilized the soil temperature throughout the whole growth season which delayed the onset of flowering mulching and irrigation improved pn and fm and sm had higher pn values than those of tl and ck compared with tl mulching significantly improved the yield in addition mulching reduced the irrigation water required and the frost that occurred in 2018 counteracted the effect of irrigation on the yield under tl the yield decreased with the increase of the deficit degree while moderate deficit irrigation did not significantly decrease the yield however there are still some doubts that need further study first under mulching different water deficits did not create differences in the yield so we could not judge the best irrigation amount suitable for matching with the mulching furthermore we could not recommend an optimal combination of mulching and deficit irrigation in addition further studies are required to understand the effect of mulching on the roots growth and distribution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10408,mulching and deficit irrigation are often used to alleviate the contradiction between the water supply and consumption in the apple industry in the loess plateau of china however the effects of the combination of mulching and deficit irrigation on the soil environment and the growth and productivity of apple trees are not clear field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 which included three mulching methods horticultural fabric mulching fm corn straw mulching sm and clear tillage treatment with no mulching tl and three irrigation strategies full irrigation w1 moderate deficit irrigation w2 and severe deficit irrigation w3 the results showed that both sm and fm significantly increased the soil water content swc especially in the early stage of the growth period sm significantly reduced and stabilized the soil temperature during the whole growth season and effectively delayed the onset of flowering while fm had no significant effect on the soil temperature both mulching and irrigation significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate pn of leaves and sm inhibited the occurrence of midday depression a significant improvement of the yield was found in the sm and fm treatments and there was little difference between them differences of the yield under different irrigation amounts were only reflected in the tl treatment in 2019 as a high soil moisture content under mulch counteracts part of the irrigation effect taken together the results indicate that sm and fm have the potential to increase apple yields in the loess plateau by improving the soil environment and regulating the growth and physiology of apple trees keywords loess plateau of china mulching deficit irrigation soil water heat apple growth yield 1 introduction the semiarid region of the loess plateau of china is the largest apple producing area in the world due to its high altitude abundant sunshine deep soils and large day night temperature differences huang and gallichand 2006 however drought and soil erosion in the loess plateau have led to a severe water shortage in this region where the average annual rainfall is only 200 600 mm zhong et al 2019 apple trees have a high demand for transpiration which aggravates the contradiction between the water supply and consumption in apple orchards therefore water shortage is severely restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry which is mainly located in rainfed areas song et al 2018 maintaining sufficient soil storage for apple growth can be achieved by two measures increasing the water input and reducing the water consumption on one hand introducing irrigation and ensuring adequate infiltration of rainfall can increase the water input on the other hand it is possible to conserve water through the reduction of non productive water evaporation chen et al 2015 ram et al 2013 and the reduction of luxury crop transpiration collins et al 2010 du et al 2006 lópez lópez et al 2018 as a farmland management practice and effective water conservation technique soil surface mulching is widely used in arid and semi arid areas chakraborty et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 zribi et al 2015 in general a large amount of water is lost through soil evaporation and crop transpiration deng et al 2006 qin et al 2013 mulching forms an isolation layer between the soil surface and the atmosphere which can effectively reduce the exchange of water vapor between the soil surface and the atmosphere zribi et al 2015 in this area the traditional planting model is clear tillage with bare farmland so mulching can effectively reduce the soil evaporation by reducing the surface exposure and soil disturbance consequently the evaporation of water from the mulched soil decreases relative to that from bare soil and more water is available for beneficial crop transpiration hou et al 2010 sarkar et al 2007 the soil temperature is a key environmental factor that has an impact on crop growth by regulating the water absorption and nutrient uptake in root zones in previous studies it has been shown that mulching can also effectively affect the soil temperature awe et al 2015 olasantan 1999 sarkar et al 2007 xie et al 2006 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2009 however different mulching methods have different effects on the soil temperature depending on the materials used film mulching was reported to increase the soil temperature due to absorbing more solar radiation and reducing the soil heat loss anikwe et al 2007 gu et al 2019 hou et al 2010 li et al 2013a b while organic mulch such as straw woodchips and crop residues was reported to effectively decrease the soil temperature by retaining incoming solar radiation cook et al 2006 rashid et al 2019 in addition in previous studies soil surface mulching was also reported to improve the soil physical properties chen et al 2014 smets et al 2008 and soil fertility jordán et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2013 alter the soil microbiology carney and matson 2005 steinmetz et al 2016 adjust the infiltration of rainfall li et al 2018 prosdocimi et al 2016 song et al 2018 and affect the crop growth physiology and ultimately yield and wue abd el wahed and ali 2013 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 however mulching also has some negative effects such as plastic wastes and more greenhouse gas emissions in the film mulching cuello et al 2015 pests and soil acidification in some organic mulchings kader et al 2017 high labor demand in gravel mulching suo et al 2019 therefore the appropriate mulching method should be determined according to the mulching materials soil crops and economic cost in arid and semi arid areas deficit irrigation is widely used to alleviate the contradiction between water scarcity and yield improvement some studies have demonstrated that crops have a certain adaptability to water deficits and a moderate water deficit may not significantly reduce the crop yield garcía tejero et al 2010 zhong et al 2019 to evaluate the response of fruit tree growth to deficit irrigation scholars have done much research including on apples zhong et al 2019 almonds lópez lópez et al 2018 oranges zapata sierra and manzano agugliaro 2017 grapes faci et al 2014 and pear jujubes cui et al 2008 el jaouhari et al 2018 found that moderate deficit irrigation 75 etc can improve wue and quality parameters firmness and brix without significant loss of yield while the severe deficit 50 etc was insufficient to maintain an acceptable fruit size similar results were observed in alikhani koupaei et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 reported that 75 etc treatment reduced transpiration and vegetative growth which may be due to the accumulation of abscisic acid aba zhong et al 2019 found that moderate water stress inhibits overgrowth by balancing vegetative with reproductive growth and has little effect on the normal growth and development of fruits as water conservation and water saving measures mulching and deficit irrigation have been studied in numerous field experiments respectively however few studies were available on the combination of deficit irrigation and mulching for fruit trees in loess plateau of china and most of them focused on the effects of soil moisture heat and yield in addition the effects of soil water and heat changes on growth and physiology and their relationships with yield formation of fruit trees need further study compared with individual we assumed that the combination of mulching and deficit irrigation can not only increase soil water input but also effectively conserve soil water and improve growth and production of fruit trees therefore the primary objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the combined effects of mulching and deficit irrigation on the soil water and heat growth and physiology of apple trees 2 investigate the relationships between soil water and heat changes growth and physiology response and yield formation and 3 recommend an optimal combination of mulching and deficit irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment location a two year field study was carried out during 2018 season i and 2019 season ii the experiment was conducted at a commercial apple orchard located in qingshuigou village zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province northwest china 37 27 n 110 2 e altitude 1020 m the experimental site is in a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau and has a continental temperate climate with an annual average sunshine duration of over 2543 3 h with 170 frost free days the annual effective rainfall amounts during the whole growth stage were 486 8 mm in 2018 and 452 2 mm in 2019 the daily mean temperatures in the 2018 and 2019 growth season were 10 4 and 11 2 c respectively the soil of the experimental location is classified as sandy loam with favourable hydraulic properties gao et al 2018 it has a ph of 8 5 a bulk density of 1 41 g cm 3 and a mean field capacity θf of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 in 1 m soil layer 2 2 experimental design eight year old honeycrisp apple trees malus pumila mill with similar trunk diameters and bark depths were selected as the experimental trees the apple trees were planted in east west orientation with a row spacing of 3 5 m and a plant spacing of 2 m 1429 plants ha 1 the whole growth season was divided into the bud development and flowering stage early april to mid may the leaf expansion stage late may to mid june the fruit expansion stage late june to late august and the fruit maturing stage early september to fruit harvest the experiment included two factors mulching and deficit irrigation in a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement there were three mulching treatments horticultural fabric mulching fm corn straw mulching sm and clear tillage treatment with no mulching tl for fm a 10 cm deep and 1 2 m wide ditch was dug along both sides of the tree row first and slopes with a depth to width ratio of 1 12 were built fig 1 the slopes on both sides of the trench were respectively covered with 1 m wide and 0 3 mm thick horticultural fabric and 20 cm at the bottom of the trench was not covered to facilitate rainwater collection for sm both sides of the tree row were respectively covered with 1 2 m wide corn straw and the straw mulching layer was divided into two layers the lower layer was the straw section 1 3 cm length which was crushed by a straw crusher and the covering was 7 cm thick the upper layer was complete straw the covering was 3 cm thick the total thickness of the straw covering layer was 10 cm the straw came from a corn field near the orchard and was exposed to the sun for three days before being used as the covering to kill pests and pathogens a nylon net covered the straw mulching layer to stabilize the straw mulching layer straw was supplemented in october every year a total of three irrigation treatments was designed in 2018 and 2019 including full irrigation w1 and sustainable moderate w2 and sustainable severe w3 deficit treatments with three irrigation levels the three irrigation levels applied were defined based on the soil water content swc of tlw1 θtlw1 w1 θtlw1 85 θf w2 75 w1 and w3 50 w1 under the same water deficit different mulching treatments received the same irrigation amount the local rainfed apple trees were taken as the control ck so there were ten treatments in total with each treatment having 3 5 trees and being repeated three times in early october after harvesting 700 kg ha 1 p2o5 570 kg ha 1 k2o and 430 kg ha 1 urea were applied as a base fertilizer in mid june the trees were fertilized with 430 kg ha 1 k2o and 300 kg ha 1 urea as a topdressing other agronomic measures were consistent such as pruning weeding insecticide spraying and flower thinning and fruit thinning 2 3 soil moisture monitoring and irrigation according to the local water consumption rate the soil moisture of each treatment was monitored for about 10 days by trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de at 20 cm intervals over the 80 cm depth soil layer at horizontal distances of 40 and 80 cm from the tree row fig 1 when θtlw1 was lower than the irrigation low limit 70 θf irrigation was carried out the experimental plots were equipped with a drip irrigation system each tree row had two drip lines 16 mm on the left and right sides located 60 cm from the tree row fig 1 and equipped with integrated emitters uniformly spaced 30 cm apart on the drip line to deliver 3 l per hour drip lines were placed under the mulching layer in fm and sm the irrigation amount of w1 was calculated using the following formula 1 1 w 1000 ph θ max θ tlw1 here w is the irrigation amount per tree mm p is the planned wetting ratio 0 3 h is the planned wetting layer m 0 8 m θmax is the irrigation upper limit 85 θf and θtlw1 is the swc of tlw1 irrigation water of suitable quality for apple growth was obtained from a well near the experimental site each subplot had a water meter connected to the pipeline to monitor the water inflow 2 4 soil temperature in order to study the changes in soil temperature under different treatments at each growth stage and reduce labor the soil temperature was measured for about seven days during the two consecutive growth seasons at fixed time points 8 00 10 00 12 00 14 00 16 00 18 00 20 00 using an angle stem earth thermometer the angle stem earth thermometer was placed at soil depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm in the tlw1 tlw3 fmw1 fmw3 smw1 smw3 and ck treatment plots 2 5 plant measurements 2 5 1 flowering intensity the number and type of flowers red bud stage balloon stage open flower petal fall and fruit set fig 2 were counted on april 22 before flower thinning and april 30 may 9 and may 18 after flower thinning in 2019 in each experimental tree twelve branches they come from the upper middle and lower layers of the east west north and south respectively were selected to count the number and type of flowers to represent the flowering intensity of the whole tree the proportions of each flowering stage were expressed in percent count with respect to the total number of developmental flowering stages observed on each evaluation date kusakabe et al 2016 2 5 2 leaf photosynthesis leaf physiological parameters were measured on three consecutive sunny days from july 17 three days after one irrigation event during fruit expansion with a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor nebraska usa in 2019 in each experimental tree four sunlit healthy leaves were randomly selected from different directions and tagged to measure the leaf physiological parameters at two hour intervals from 8 00 to 18 00 each leaf was measured three times in each measurement and then the leaf water use efficiency wuel was calculated as the net photosynthetic rate pn divided by the transpiration rate tr 2 5 3 fruit yield the number of fruits and yield per tree were calculated and the fruits were weighed after harvesting on 17 september 2018 and 21 september 2019 respectively the single fruit weight per tree was calculated by dividing the yield by the number of fruits 2 6 meteorological factors and et0 the rainfall air temperature atmospheric pressure relative air humidity solar radiation wind velocity and wind direction were obtained at a height of 2 0 m using an automatic weather station installed in the orchard a rainfall amount during a single rainfall of greater than 5 mm was considered to be an effective rainfall reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 2 7 statistical analysis the data were analysed by an analysis of variance anova with spss 25 0 statistics spss inc chicago il usa to determine the effects of mulching on the flowering stage distribution a chi squared χ2 analysis was performed using spss 25 0 statistics on the proportions of flowering developmental stages were calculated per treatment the statistical significance of treatment differences calculated based on the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 rainfall irrigation et0 and air temperature fig 3 shows the daily average temperatures during two consecutive apple growing seasons compared with 2019 the temperature variation in 2018 was extremely unstable on april 6 and 7 2018 a severe frost occurred which caused many apple flowers to be damaged in 2018 and 2019 effective rainfall rainfall greater than 5 mm events during the growth season totalled 30 and 22 and the total effective rainfall was 486 8 mm and 452 2 mm respectively table 1 most of the effective rainfall occurred during the fruit expansion stage accounting for 59 8 291 2 mm and 48 3 218 4 mm of the total effective rainfall in 2018 and 2019 respectively the water was irrigated eight times in 2018 and 2019 most of the irrigation events were distributed during the first three growth stages table 1 the reference evapotranspiration et0 amounts during the whole growth seasons were 670 5 mm in 2018 and 656 0 mm in 2019 3 2 soil water content despite some fluctuations the swc showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during the two years fig 4 fig 5 at the beginning of the growth stage the temperature and solar radiation were low the apple tree grew slowly and the evapotranspiration was at a low level with the development of the growth period the temperature gradually rose the apple trees began to grow vigorously and there was less rainfall so the swc at this stage the leaf expansion stage and early fruit expansion stage was at the lowest level throughout the growth season after july the rainfall increased rapidly which effectively supplemented the soil moisture content while due to the higher evapotranspiration the swc during this period was characterized by the alternation of increases and losses as well as drastic changes the tlw3 had the lowest swc in 2018 19 62 and 2019 19 81 the smw1 had the highest swc in 2018 21 22 and fmwi had the highest swc in 2019 21 10 mulching significantly increased the swc fig 4b fig 5b in 2018 the mean swc of fm was 20 which was an increase of 4 6 and 5 8 compared to those of tl 19 98 and ck 19 75 and that of sm 20 85 increased by 4 4 and 5 6 compared to those of tl and ck respectively in 2019 the mean swc of fm was 20 85 an increase of 4 3 and 3 1 compared with those of tl 20 00 and ck 19 85 respectively and that of sm 20 62 increased by 3 1 and 3 9 compared with those of tl and ck respectively in 2018 the swc of the fm and sm treatments was higher than those of the tl and ck treatments except on a limited number of days fm always had a higher swc in the early growth stage while sm had a higher swc in the later growth stage in the early growth period the swc of tl was significantly higher than that of ck while no significant difference was found between them in the later growth period which may have been related to increased rainfall and reduced irrigation in the later growth period in the early growth period of 2019 the swc presented a trend of fm sm tl ck and in the middle growth period the swc of sm was at a low level even lower than those of tl and ck and gradually recovered to a higher level in the later growth period different deficit irrigation strategies had an impact on the swc in the two consecutive growth seasons fig 4c fig 5c the swc in both years increased with the increase of the irrigation amount in 2018 the mean swc of w1 w2 and w3 in the growth season were 20 92 20 59 and 20 21 which were 6 0 4 3 and 2 3 higher than those of ck 19 75 respectively irrigation had a smaller effect on the swc in 2019 as the mean swc of w1 w2 and w3 in the growth season were 20 71 20 42 and 20 23 which were 4 3 2 9 and 1 9 higher than those of ck 19 85 respectively it is worth noting that the swc of ck was the lowest in the early growth period but in the middle and late growth period its swc rose to an abnormally high level in 2019 3 3 soil temperature during the two year apple growth season the changes in the surface soil temperature and air temperature were basically the same and they all showed a trend of first rising and then decreasing fig 6 the soil temperature during the bud development and flowering stage in 2019 was lower than that in 2018 but the soil temperature during the leaf expansion stage was higher than that in 2018 and the last two growth stages did not produce a difference this was because a colder dormant period date not shown was experienced before the growth season in 2019 and the air temperature during leaf expansion in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 the maximum soil temperature during the two years was reached in the fruit expansion stage the effects of different mulching treatments on the soil temperature are different although the soil temperature under fm had some differences from those under tl and ck the differences did not reach a significant level however sm significantly decreased the soil temperature during these two years and with the development of the growth period the differences decreased gradually different water deficits did not have a significant effect on the surface soil temperature the daily variation of the soil temperature was also greatly affected by the air temperature fig 7 in the daily variation of the soil temperature during the four growth periods the soil temperatures of tl fm and ck were consistent with the air temperature changes while differences appeared in sm the soil temperature of sm was significantly lower than those of the other three treatments and the difference gradually decreased with the development of the growth period the minimum value of the soil temperature in all treatments appeared at 8 00 while the maximum value appeared at different times the maximum value of the soil temperature of tl fm and ck always appeared at the same time as the maximum air temperature however the maximum value of the soil temperature of sm appeared two hours later compared to that of the air temperature in the last three growth periods sm significantly delayed the rising and declining of the soil temperature during the whole growth season 3 4 flowering intensity the intensity of flowering which was expressed as the number of flowers nf on twelve selected branches per tree at different phenological stages including red bud balloon open flower petal fall and fruit set counted on the trees showed a downward trend fig 8 due to natural flower dropping and flower thinning manual thinning by local farmers on april 29 nf was significantly affected by the mulching practices the nf of fm was significantly higher than those of other treatments on april 22 however artificial flower thinning eliminated this effect fig 8a b the sm treatment had the most flowers in the last three observations with numbers significantly higher than those of other treatments on may 18 fig 8b c d while no significant differences were found between other treatments the flowering phenology which is the distribution of flowering stages on a tree was significantly affected by the mulching higher proportions of flowers were at the red bud stage in sm trees 90 relative to tl 69 fm 75 and ck 76 trees on april 22 χ2 13 64 p 0 034 fig 8a by contrast the balloon and open flower stages of flowers were present in lower proportions in sm 7 3 than in other treatments while no significant differences were found in the distribution of flowers between the other treatments χ2 1 793 p 0 774 nf decreased significantly after flower thinning but the same trend was still found in the later two observation periods as sm delayed the onset of flowering in apple trees compared to other treatments and no significant differences were found in the distribution of flowers between the other treatments fig 8b c the proportion of open flowers in sm 61 was significantly lower than those in other three treatments tl 71 fm 77 ck 78 with the highest proportion of backward growth stages red bud and balloon on april 30 χ2 21 36 p 0 011 fig 7b on may 9 sm had the highest proportion of open flowers 55 and the lowest proportion of fruit setting 38 while more than 50 of the flowers were in fruit setting stage in the other treatments χ2 20 88 p 0 013 fig 8c near the end of flowering may 18 no differences were observed in the distribution of flowering stages among the different mulching practices χ2 8 26 p 0 213 fig 8d 3 5 leaf photosynthesis fig 9 shows the daily variation of the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance gs under different mulching types and different water deficits degrees during the fruit expansion period in 2019 sm effectively inhibited the midday depression of leaf photosynthesis and the daily variation of pn showed a unimodal type with the maximum value appearing at 10 00 the daily variations of pn in the other treatments were bimodal with a midday depression at 12 00 the two peaks appeared at 10 00 and 14 00 although the second peak was lower than the first peak mulching significantly increased the pn of apple leaves the daily average pn of fm and sm were 11 19 μmol m 2 s 1 and 11 60 μmol m 2 s 1 which were 14 4 and 18 6 higher than those of tl 9 78 μmol m 2 s 1 and 32 7 and 37 6 higher than those of ck 8 43 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively table 2 however there was no significant difference between sm and fm the daily variation of tr was unimodal except that the maximum value of ck appeared at 12 00 while the maximum value of other treatments appeared at 14 00 the daily average tr presented a trend sm 4 74 mmol m 2s 1 fm 4 61 mmol m 2s 1 tl 4 40 mmol m 2s 1 ck 4 08 mmol m 2s 1 the daily average tr showed no significant difference between sm fm and tl but they were all significantly higher than that of ck the daily variation of gs was also unimodal with the maximum values of all treatments appearing at 10 00 the daily averages of fm 0 34 mol m 2 s 1 and sm 0 35 mol m 2 s 1 were significantly higher than those of tl 0 31 mol m 2 s 1 and ck 0 30 mol m 2 s 1 different water deficits had significant effects on pn tr and gs fig 9b under different water deficits the daily variation of pn was bimodal and pn increased with the increase of the irrigation amount the daily average pn of w1 w2 w3 and ck were 11 61 μmol m 2 s 1 10 95 μmol m 2 s 1 10 01 μmol m 2 s 1 and 8 43 μmol m 2 s 1 and significant differences existed between any two treatments the daily variation of tr was unimodal and the maximum values of w1 w2 and w3 appeared at 14 00 the daily averages tr of w1 w2 and w3 were 4 82 mmol m 2s 1 4 50 mmol m 2s 1 and 4 43 mmol m 2s 1 which were significantly higher than that of ck and the value for w1 was significantly higher than those for w2 and w3 under different water deficits gs increased with the increase of the irrigation amount and the maximum value appeared at 10 00 the daily mean gs of w1 w2 w3 and ck were 0 35 mol m 2 s 1 0 32 mol m 2 s 1 0 32 mol m 2 s 1 and 0 30 mol m 2 s 1 respectively and the value for w1 was significantly higher than that for ck table 2 shows the photosynthetic parameters of apple leaves under different treatments during the fruit expansion stage in 2019 under the same mulching strategy pn tr gs and rh relative humidity gradually decreased with the decrease of the irrigation amount the maximum values of these four photosynthetic parameters usually appeared in the fmw1 and smw1 and the minimum values usually appeared in tlw3 and ck under tl and sm ci the intercellular co2 concentration gradually increased with the decrease of the irrigation amount while that of fm showed the opposite trend and ck had the largest ci under the same water deficit pn tr and gs followed the trend of sm fm tl ck and the largest rh appeared in the fm treatment under the same water deficit mulching significantly improved the wuel and w2 had the highest wuel under the same mulching strategy in all treatments smw2 had the highest wuel and the lowest wuel appeared in tlw3 and ck table 3 shows the pearson correlation analysis of the photosynthetic parameters ci was negatively correlated with all other photosynthetic parameters and was significantly negatively correlated with pn tr and wuel except that the correlations between tr and wuel there was a significant positive correlation between other photosynthetic parameters 3 6 yield frost that occurred in spring greatly damaged production in 2018 and the number of fruits single fruit weight and yield in 2018 were only 67 1 74 6 and 49 9 of that in 2019 table 4 mulching significantly increased the number of fruits at harvest and the sm treatment produced a higher value than that of fm in 2018 while no significant difference was found between them in 2019 the application of mulching had no significant effects p 0 05 on the single fruit weight during the two consecutive apple growing seasons even though sm had relatively lower single fruit weight in 2018 while ck showed the same in 2019 in 2018 fm and sm produced similar yields of 20 8 t ha 1 and 21 5 t ha 1 respectively which were significantly higher than those of tl 16 9 t ha 1 and ck 14 2 t ha 1 the same trend emerged in 2019 even though the production had been greatly improved compared with 2018 the two year average yields indicate that the yield was improved by 24 8 and 49 4 in the fm treatment compared to the tl and ck treatments simultaneously compared with those of tl and ck the yield of sm also increased by 25 9 and 50 8 under the same mulching strategy irrigation had no significant effects on the yield however there was a significant difference between tlw1 and tlw3 in 2019 smwi and fmwi had the highest yields in 2018 and 2019 respectively and ck had the lowest yields in both years 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching and irrigation on the soil water content in our study the changes of the swc in all treatments were similar showing a trend of decreasing first and then increasing while in a similar study huang et al 2009 observed that the changes of the swc were w type and this might have been due to the different climate and rainfall distribution in the early stage of the growth period the swc was at a relatively high level due to the low evapotranspiration however with the increase of the temperature and radiation and the vigorous growth of the trees the swc began to decline and reached the lowest level in may and june after july the swc began to increase due to the rapid increase of rainfall as shown in fig 4 fig 5 and table 1 irrigation mainly occurred in the early stage of the growth season while rainfall was mainly concentrated in the late stage of the growth season therefore there was a complementary relationship between irrigation and rainfall to maintain and improve the swc the soil water is considered to be one of the most important factors affecting plant growth and development yi et al 2010 silvente et al 2012 even a small change in soil water storage could affect crop productivity liu et al 2010a b in the two consecutive years mulching had significant effects on improving the swc and the same results were found in previous studies liao et al 2019 liu et al 2014 suo et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 zribi et al 2015 fm always had the higher swc in the early growth period while sm had the higher swc in the late growth period evaporation inhibition and increasing rainfall infiltration are two keys to soil moisture conservation fm and sm had the same effects on controlling evaporation because they covered the surface soil and isolated the soil from the atmosphere however some differences existed in the absorption and infiltration of rainfall between them horticultural fabric is a kind of woven material with permeability straw itself forms a rainfall collection and absorption layer and additional barriers on the soil surface therefore sm can not only absorb part of the rainfall but can also effectively delay and prevent the formation of surface seepage and runoff liu et al 2012 2014 prosdocimi et al 2016 in the early growth period rainfall is always characterized by low frequency low magnitude and the fm treatment could absorb more rainfall compared to the sm treatment because part of the rainfall was absorbed by straw and then lost due to evaporation from the ground conversely rainfall in the late growth period is characterized by high frequency high magnitude and part of the rainfall will form surface seepage and runoff in the fm treatment while the absorption capability of straw provides additional pathways for water infiltration li et al 2011 this trapped water in the straw is gradually released over several days resulting in increasing infiltration liu et al 2014 it is worth noting that in 2019 the swc of sm in the middle growth period was at a relatively low level it was speculated that there was high transpiration from compensatory growth in this period because the low temperature fig 6 caused by sm treatment delayed the growth and development of crops in the early growth period rashid et al 2019 in our study the swc increased with the increase of the irrigation amount it was noted that the difference in the swc caused by different deficit irrigation amounts was mainly reflected in the early and middle stages which was related to the fact that the irrigation events were mainly concentrated in the early and middle growth periods and more rainfall occurred in the later growth period the control treatment without irrigation was at a high level in the middle and late growth period of 2019 this might be because the ck treatment inhibited the normal growth of apple trees due to long term water stress resulting in lower transpiration under the same water deficit mulching increased the swc compared with tl which was an effect partially attributed to the high water holding capacity of the mulch on the other hand mulching reduced the evaporation of irrigation water because the wetted soil surface after irrigation was covered zhang et al 2014 4 2 effects of mulching and irrigation on the soil temperature the soil temperature controls the rate of crop development particularly when the meristem is within the soil olasantan 1999 in the consecutive two years sm treatment significantly reduced the soil temperature during daytime in the whole growth season which was consistent with the results of previous studies rashid et al 2019 suo et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 this might be because of the interactive effect between high solar reflectance and low thermal conductivity due to the thick mulching layer of organics awe et al 2015 straw forms an isolation layer for the temperature on the soil surface and it plays a role in buffering and regulating the changes of the surface soil temperature therefore sm can reduce soil temperature fluctuations throughout the growth season which is beneficial to the top growth and root development of plants kader et al 2017 in our study with the development of the growth period the effect of sm on decreasing the soil temperature gradually decreased which could be attributed to three factors the first was that sm delayed the increase of the soil temperature in the early growth period and the decrease of the soil temperature in the late growth period in addition at the end of the growth season almost all the straw section were decomposed into residue and organic matter which could reduce the mulching effect and the thickness of the straw covering layer was reduced to about 3 cm the last one was the increase of the plant canopy which reduced the area of bare soil hou et al 2010 in terms of daily changes the daily variation of the soil temperature was more moderate under the sm treatment than under the other treatments in the similar study liu et al 2014 reported that in spring and autumn when the diurnal temperature range was large the soil temperature under sm was lower during the daytime but higher at night while the soil temperature was always lower in summer and higher in winter compared to other treatments however there was no conflict with our results due to the different measurement times and methods inorganic mulches such as plastic films geotextiles etc are always reported to can increase the temperature nurzadeh namaghi et al 2018 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2018 in our study fm had no significant effect on the soil temperature which was probably because of the differences of the materials colour thickness permeability to water and air etc and the local climate conditions the movement of water and heat in soil is interactive the soil moisture affects the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of soil thus affecting the soil temperature at the same time the changes of the soil temperature can also affect the movement of soil moisture zhang et al 2006 in our study irrigation did not cause a significant difference in the soil temperature in the similar study yang et al 2018 reported that irrigation did not have a significant effect on the soil temperature but under mulching conditions higher irrigation can reduce the accumulated soil temperature near the ground surface because the heat preservation of the film mulching and the larger canopy reduced the solar radiation reaching the ground 4 3 effects of mulching on the flowering intensity mulching and irrigation greatly affect the soil temperature and soil moisture which are of great importance to plant growth and development however in previous studies there were some controversies about the changes of soil temperature under mulching some scholars reported that the low temperature caused by organic mulching in the spring often lead to poor development of crops and the increase of the soil temperature under plastic film mulching in the spring was beneficial to crop growth yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 while in summer an excessive increase of the soil temperature under film mulching would hinder root growth and crop development and ultimately affect the yield and organic mulching can reduce the fluctuations of soil temperature and the harmful effects of extreme temperatures on crop growth nurzadeh namaghi et al 2018 pinamonti 1998 in addition the increase of the temperature would lead to the advancement of crop phenology and on the contrary the decrease of the temperature would lead to the delay of phenology paltineanu and chitu 2020 yang et al 2018 in our study the fm treatment increased the flowering potential of the apple trees and produced the most flowers on april 22 although the effect was eliminated by artificial flower thinning this was in agreement with the results of muneer et al 2019 compared with other treatments the sm treatment delayed the onset of flowering in apple trees due to the lower soil temperature szalay et al 2019 reported that the frost tolerance of flowers was determined mostly by environmental factors rather than genotypic effects and the frost tolerance was the largest at the red bud stage and continuously decreased as blooming proceeded therefore late blooming apple trees are less affected by frost this means that the sm treatment can effectively reduce the risk of freezing injury during apple flowering especially in the loess plateau which has frequent frost damage in spring moreover the sm treatment can effectively control the flower bud abscission and produced the most flowers near the end of flowering this is consistent with the findings of nurzadeh namaghi et al 2018 who reported that organic mulches can significantly controlled flower bud and fruit abscission and are effective in controlling the alternate bearing of fruit trees flowering is generally considered to be advanced by water deficits in many woody perennial species sharp et al 2009 in the measurement of flowering intensity only two irrigation was carried out near the end of flowering hence we did not study the differences of flowering intensity among different water deficits 4 4 effects of mulching and irrigation on leaf photosynthesis photosynthesis provides organic compounds and energy for plants and is a key factor affecting the growth and productivity of fruit trees mulching effectively improved the photosynthetic efficiency which may have been due to the improvement of the soil conditions higher soil moisture and stable soil temperature and crop canopy temperature and humidity which was consistent with the results obtained for grapevines and blueberries muneer et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 on clear sunny days a midday depression of photosynthesis in outdoor grown plants is often observed and the maximum rates of co2 assimilation occur only during the early morning and late afternoon guo et al 2009 in some studies the midday depression of photosynthesis is related to high air temperatures a low relative humidity at midday and water deficits xu 1990 zhang et al 2018 in our study midday depression was also observed and sm effectively inhibited the midday depression of leaf photosynthesis fm had the same trend of inhibiting the midday depression but it was not significant which may have been because sm could not only improve the soil moisture content and relative humidity but also stabilize the soil temperature and reduce the soil high temperature at midday decaying corn straw can also release co2 and increase photosynthesis raw materials leaf photosynthesis was sensitive to swc cui et al 2009 in our study water deficit decreased pn and pn was reduced with the increase of the water deficit this conclusion supports the findings of previous studies ben ahmed et al 2007 cui et al 2009 ma et al 2007 it is generally believed that the reasons for the decrease of the photosynthetic capacity include stomatal limitation and non stomatal limitation and there is a complementary relationship between them jiang et al 2001 xu 1997 zhang et al 2018 stomatal limitation refers the decrease of gs which can prevent co2 from entering into leaf cells which results in the decrease of ci and pn and non stomatal limitation refers to lower photosynthetic activity due to low chloroplast activity rubisco activity and rubp carboxylase regeneration ability our study also found that gs decreased with the increase of the water deficit and the recovery of pn at 14 00 under the continuous decline of gs from 10 00 infers the participation of non stomatal limitation stomata are the passageways of gas exchange between plant leaves and the external environment and they are also important channels of water loss gs indicates the difficulty of gas passing through the stomata which is related to pn tr and ci to a certain extent in our study gs had a significant positive correlation with pn and tr however no significant correlation was found with ci and this might have been because a higher gs was always accompanied by a higher pn which indicates more co2 consumption mulching significantly improves wuel because mulching significantly improves pn but the increase of tr was not significant the same effect also appeared in the promotion of wuel by irrigation 4 5 effects of mulching and irrigation on the yield regardless of the normal year 2019 and the year affected by frost 2018 mulching significantly increased the apple yield which was consistent with the results of chen et al 2014 liu et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 however no significant difference was found in the single fruit weight therefore the improvement of the yield was largely due to the increase and maintenance of the number of fruits by mulching in our study significant quadratic polynomial relationships between the yield and swc fig 10 and between the yield and pn fig 11 were shown as reported by zhou et al 2017 therefore the increase of the number of fruits and yield under mulching may be due to a higher swc and greater co2 assimilation due to a higher photosynthetic rate in addition fm can increase the flowering potential of the apple trees and sm can effectively control the flower bud abscission in 2018 the number of fruits in the sm treatment was significantly higher than that in the fm treatment this might have been because sm delayed flowering and effectively stabilized the soil temperature thus reducing the impact of frost damage on flowering du et al 2017 reported that the number of fruits and yield significantly increased with the increase of the irrigation amount in our study only the tl treatment in 2019 presented the same trend this might have been because the high swc under the mulching reduced the irrigation water required hou et al 2010 moreover the severe frost in 2018 counteracted part of the irrigation effect looking at the impact of irrigation alone the mean yield of the tl treatments was increased by 14 2 and 20 compared with ck in 2018 and 2019 in the normal year under the tl pattern the yield under full irrigation was significantly higher than that under severe deficit irrigation while no significant difference was found between full irrigation and moderate deficit irrigation zhou et al 2017 reported similar results indicating that moderate deficit irrigation will not affect yields due to the certain adaptability of crops to water deficits in this study we found that mulching significantly increased the apple yield however under mulching no significant differences in the yield was found between different water deficits does this mean that separate application of mulching is enough to meet the water demands of apple trees in this region further research is needed in addition mulching mainly adjusts the growth and development of crops by adjusting soil water and heat conditions and roots are the most vulnerable therefore more research are required on roots growth and distribution which are important to explain crop response 5 conclusion both fm and sm greatly changed the soil environment however fm had a greater effect on increasing the swc than did sm while no significant effect on the soil temperature was found in fm sm also significantly increased the swc and it concurrently decreased and stabilized the soil temperature throughout the whole growth season which delayed the onset of flowering mulching and irrigation improved pn and fm and sm had higher pn values than those of tl and ck compared with tl mulching significantly improved the yield in addition mulching reduced the irrigation water required and the frost that occurred in 2018 counteracted the effect of irrigation on the yield under tl the yield decreased with the increase of the deficit degree while moderate deficit irrigation did not significantly decrease the yield however there are still some doubts that need further study first under mulching different water deficits did not create differences in the yield so we could not judge the best irrigation amount suitable for matching with the mulching furthermore we could not recommend an optimal combination of mulching and deficit irrigation in addition further studies are required to understand the effect of mulching on the roots growth and distribution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10409,uncertainty in the availability of water supply pose challenges to traditional irrigation approaches regulating the amount and time of irrigation at different crop growth stages could provide a solution to optimize the irrigation water amid drought periods this study evaluated the effect of different deficit irrigation levels on maize zea mays l at several growth phases over two growing seasons 2012 and 2013 in yangling shaanxi province of china total nine irrigation treatments incorporated three irrigation amount ratios i e control irrigation ck 100 of crop evapotranspiration and 80 and 60 of control irrigation named as t2 t9 among the irrigation treatments grain yield ranged from 6392 to 9362 kg ha 1 and seasonal water use efficiency wue varied from 20 3 to 34 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 whereas the irrigation water use efficiency iwue ranged between 32 0 and 58 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 t2 that received 80 irrigation between v8 and r6 growth stage had overall higher yield than ck and this was closely followed by t4 that received 80 irrigation at growth phase v3 v8 and v11 tasseling full irrigation at v8 v11 and 60 irrigation between tasseling and maturity due to near optimum growing season temperature in 2013 larger wue was noted in comparison to 2012 that resulted 16 larger yield with 10 lesser etc on an average whereas 2012 growing season had better iwue because of 37 5 smaller irrigation consumption maize grain yield in response to water stress ky the yield response factor was 0 66 suggesting that the environmental conditions of the study area favor the application of deficit irrigation the maize yield response to reduced irrigation supply in this experiment indicated that regulated deficit irrigation might help growers to cope with decline in water availability during growing season keywords irrigation scheduling evapotranspiration maize yield water use efficiency water deficit drought 1 introduction maize is a part of staple diet in many developing countries and it is considered among the most important food sources fao 2014 also maize has the highest contribution in feed grain sector world wide cgiar 2016 with the ever increasing world population maize production needs to increase by 66 by 2050 to meet the global demand alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 china is the second largest maize producing country and shaanxi province is the main production region in china meng et al 2006 like other parts of the world maize production in china is also being affected by changes in climatic conditions wang et al 2012 an overall drying trend has been noted during summers in shaanxi province wang et al 2020 that point towards higher crop water demand of maize due to the climate change induced uncertainty both in spatial and temporal trends of precipitation timely availability of the irrigation water to fulfill crop water requirements saddique et al 2020 wang et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 would be a considerable challenge for maize production in the region irrigation is essential for supporting crop yield especially during drought periods and limited water availability could reduce water quotas for irrigated agriculture to support other stakeholders in water resources ajaz et al 2019 increasing tendency of precipitation extremes extreme drought to extreme precipitation in guanzhong plain coupled with high temperature liu et al 2018 makes the precise information on crop water requirements inevitable for better planning also it is important to determine how much and when the irrigation is needed for optimum water productivity and crop yield under scarce water supply thorp et al 2010 ali et al 2016 chai et al 2016 based on the historical records annual stream flow in wei river basin which mainly provides irrigation water to guanzhong plain has decreased whereas potential evapotranspiration has increased in the region zhao et al 2012 wei river basin is highly susceptible to occurrence of frequent droughts and floods as described by huang et al 2015 due to a considerable variation of annual precipitation in dry and wet years 370 800 mm respectively this arises the need for the irrigation districts and growers to adapt accordingly one possible adaptation strategy is deficit irrigation that allows the farmers to decrease the irrigation amount based on the irrigation quota and water availability ouda and noreldin 2020 ajaz et al 2020 though crop yield response to full irrigation is usually stable in semi arid regions response to deficit irrigation can fluctuate substantially depending on the timing and quantity of irrigation provision along with the occurrence of precipitation and initial soil water content at sowing kang et al 2000 many previous studies have evaluated the effect of controlled water stress on the maize yield by conducting field experiments for example aguilar et al 2007 found 29 larger productivity of applied water for limited irrigation treatments in comparison to full irrigation in a semi arid environment 10 32 reduction in water use by the maize crop was reported by li et al 2010 under partial root zone irrigation when compared with conventional irrigation as well as they found 10 42 increase in canopy water use efficiency crop modeling has also been used by previous researchers to examine the interaction of maize yield and water stress for example dominguez et al 2012 investigated the optimized approach for deficit irrigation of maize using mopeco model and found that the stage specific reduced irrigation may increase the grain yield up to 20 as to constant deficit irrigation during whole growing cycle dssat ceres maize model was employed by chen et al 2020 to improve irrigation use efficiency iue including a site in guanzhong region they estimated iue as high as 3 5 times by reducing water application to crop in comparison to locally applied irrigation at the cost of about 12 reduction in yield crop growth stage plays a pivotal role in decision related to allowing deficit irrigation and despite its importance to the best of our knowledge the effects of different levels of reduced irrigation application on maize yield at different development stages has not been investigated before in the guanzhong plain china also such amalgamation of varying irrigation levels with respect to crop growth phases received less attention in other parts of the world therefore the impact of variation in irrigation amounts with respect to different growth stages of maize grown in the guanzhong region is needed to be thoroughly examined furthermore the implications of any potential fluctuation in water supply to farms during the maize growing period should be thoroughly studied this study aimed to 1 identify the effect of different irrigation amounts at different growth stages on maize yield and 2 determine whether deficit irrigation can help maintaining the maize yield under water stressed conditions in guanzhong plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental conditions of the study area the experiment was carried out during two cropping years 2012 and 2013 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering northwest a f university fig 1 34 18 n 108 24 e 506 m above sea level yangling guanzhong plain china the study area is situated in a semi arid weather zone with a mean annual temperature of 12 8 c annual precipitation in the region is 548 mm precipitation mm d 1 and maximum and minimum daily air temperatures c in 2012 and 2013 were obtained from a weather station near the field site fig 2 the soil at the field site was sampled from different locations in the experimental plots from 0 to 250 cm soil depth the soil class is a brown loess loam containing 51 silt 26 sand and 23 clay the soil had 0 028 g kg 1 phosphorus p 0 0021 g kg 1 nitrogen n 0 99 g kg 1 potassium k and the bulk density was 1 36 g cm 3 the average volumetric water content at permanent wilting point and field capacity was 12 7 and 26 2 respectively 2 2 crop management and irrigation the maize variety wuke 2 was selected for this study as it is commonly grown in the region summer maize june october and winter wheat october may are grown as common practice in the area crop was sown between 19 june 2012 and 23 june 2013 six plants m 2 were sown in rows 50 cm apart with 180 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 applied at sowing four successive phenological phases in the summer maize growing period v3 3 leaf v8 8 leaf v8 8 leaf v11 11 leaf v11 11 leaf vt tasseling and vt tasseling r6 physiological maturity or black layer were selected to study the influence of different irrigation amounts the aforementioned periods were named as stage 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for irrigation applications moveable rain out shelter was used in the study to avoid the impact of uncertainty due to precipitation partial orthogonal l9 design scheme was used for the nine deficit irrigation treatments with three replications of each treatment in both years details of the design scheme and irrigation amounts are provided in tables 1a and 1b nine irrigation treatments incorporated three irrigation amounts control or full irrigation ck 100 of crop evapotranspiration et and two levels as a fraction of the control being 80 and 60 of ck applied at different growth stages during the growing season crop et of the ck irrigation treatment was measured with a large weighing lysimeter 3 m 2 2 m 3 m with continuous data loggers precision of 0 021 mm installed in experimental plots fig 3 soil and crop management conditions in the lysimeter were the same as other experimental plots the crop et from the lysimeter was recorded on an hourly basis and then summed up to get the daily or monthly value when the soil moisture in the control treatment ck declined to a predetermined lower limit i e 65 fc irrigation was applied soil water content was measured using a pre calibrated thetaprobe ml2x delta t devicesltd cambridge uk sensor installed at depths of 20 40 80 100 200 and 250 cm for the treatments t2 t9 irrigation was synchronous to the control irrigation treatment ck the flood irrigation method was employed in the experimental plots and irrigation application was performed with a pump coupled with a flow meter to control the amount of irrigation applied to each experimental plot 2 3 irrigation and seasonal water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated dividing the grain yield by total irrigation applied during the growing season seasonal water use efficiency wue was calculated as follows 1 w u e y e t c where y is grain yield kg ha 1 and etc is growing season crop et for each irrigation treatment estimated using the following water balance equation allen et al 1998 2 e t c i p r d δ s where i is applied irrigation mm p is seasonal precipitation mm r is surface runoff mm d is downward flux below the crop root zone mm and δs is variation in soil water content in terms of depth mm p r and d were considered 0 due to the presence of the rain out shelter covered boundary around the plot and downward flux below the crop root zone that was neglected because the lower side of every plot in the rain out shelter was impermeable therefore eq 2 was simplified to 3 e t c i δ s 2 4 maize yield response factor the yield response factor ky for maize was calculated in this study that is the relative reduction in yield linked to the corresponding relative reduction in et and reflects the slope of the relationship of these two variables smith and steduto 2012 doorenbos and kassam 1979 calculation of ky has been described as follows 4 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m the maximum yield y m and maximum et e t m values were determined from the non stressed irrigated treatment ck actual yield y a and actual et e t a values were determined from the combined deficit irrigation levels 60 ck 80 ck and 100 ck furthermore data for the two growing seasons were pooled to determine seasonal values of ky in general larger ky translates greater sensitivity for yield to water stress during crop growing period and smaller ky implies higher tolerance of the crop to water deficit 2 5 growth parameters leaf area index lai was measured using a sunscan ss1 canopy analyzer leaf area observations were recorded on eight occasions during crop development crop phenology in each irrigation treatment was observed by inspecting the field experiment grain yield and aboveground biomass were collected at maturity 2 6 statistical analysis the collected maize data and parameters grain yield biomass lai wue and iwue were examined by analysis of variance test anova and the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between yield and seasonal et and total applied irrigation water 3 results 3 1 leaf area index and biomass in both growing seasons 2012 and 2013 the maximum lai was recorded near the anthesis stage the non stressed irrigation treatment ck had maximum lai values of 4 78 and 5 22 at 58 2012 and 55 das 2013 respectively which differed significantly p 0 05 from the other irrigation treatments t3 t9 table 2 t3 had a maximum lai of 3 81 in 2012 which did not significantly differ from t4 t6 or t9 the maximum lai of the t3 t4 t6 and t9 treatments did however significantly differ p 0 05 from those in ck t2 t5 t7 and t8 the maximum lai of t3 during 2013 growing season was significantly different from all other treatments whereas the maximum lai did not differ significantly between ck and t2 and similar trend was noted from t4 to t9 water stress significantly influenced dry biomass production in both growing seasons table 2 with significantly higher growth in 2013 than 2012 p 0 05 due to the more favorable weather conditions near optimum growing seaoson temperature greaves 1996 the control treatment ck produced the largest dry biomass 15 809 kg ha 1 and 18 911 kg ha 1 in 2012 at 110 das and 2013 at 101 das respectively the t3 irrigation treatment produced the smallest dry biomass 13 260 kg ha 1 and 16 075 kg ha 1 in 2012 and 2013 respectively which differed significantly from the other irrigation treatments except for t6 in 2013 dry biomass did not significantly differ in the t4 t9 irrigation treatments in 2012 or t7 t9 irrigation treatments in 2013 p 0 05 3 2 grain yield mean grain yield in 2013 was significantly larger compared to 2012 p 0 05 table 3 shows the grain yields for the 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons the control and t4 treatments produced the largest grain yields in 2012 7994 kg ha 1 and 2013 9362 kg ha 1 respectively t3 treatment has the smallest yield 6571 kg ha 1 in 2012 and 7461 kg ha 1 in 2013 which was 20 and 12 smaller than the control in 2012 grain yield in the t2 t5 and t6 treatments did not significantly differ from the control and during 2013 grain yield in t2 t4 t5 t7 and t9 treatments did not show significant difference from the control p 0 05 3 3 relationship between grain yield biomass lai irrigation depth and et maize yield improved by increasing the irrigation depth and a linear relationship existed between them with r2 of 0 86 fig 4 the predictability of yield biomass lai and irrigation amount was found to be good under multiple regression and r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 90 table 4 a linear relationship between et deficit and relative grain yield reduction was observed in both years with grain yield response factor values ky of 0 61 and 0 82 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the average slope ky across both years was 0 66 with r2 of 0 77 3 4 water use efficiency across all treatments wue and iwue ranged from 20 3 to 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 32 0 to 58 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively table 3 overall higher wue was noted in 2013 whereas larger iwue was estimated for 2012 the t5 and t2 treatments had the highest wue in 2012 and 2013 and t8 and ck treatments had the lowest wue in 2012 and 2013 respectively the t5 treatment had the highest iwue 58 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2012 and 46 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 and ck had the lowest iwue 41 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2012 and 32 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 fig 5 4 discussion this study examined the impact of variable irrigation supply on maize yield applied at different growth stages in a semi arid area it was found that in comparison to full irrigation treatment ck t2 provided overall better yield in two growing seasons and t4 yield was also close to ck on an average for 2012 and 2013 this highlighted the potential of water saving in the region by following a combination of deficit irrigation application at different development stages it is important to note that full irrigation treatment ck did not always have the largest yield for example t4 during 2013 had the largest yield 10 8 greater than ck whereas the biomass was 4 3 smaller than ck t2 on the other hand had 0 6 larger biomass than ck whereas the yield was 10 7 greater than ck this shows the impact of different levels of water stress at different crop growth stages which had a positive impact on yield for t2 and t5 in comparison to ck though the processes involved in increasing the plant productivity under stress are not well explored as discussed by chai et al 2016 one probable reason in case of t4 could be the reallocation of pre anthesis carbon reserves towards grains due to presence of water stress between vegetative reproductive and grain filling stages raes et al 2018 yang and zhang 2006 in addition higher biomass and grain yield of t2 might be due to better nitrogen use efficiency of maize plant under partial water stress conditions as highlighted by li et al 2007 lower yields were noted in t3 where the irrigation supply was reduced by 40 of full irrigation between second and fourth stage these results were in accordance with the findings of jin et al 2020 who found higher yield response of maize due to water stress in vegetative stages in comparison to reproductive stages zhang et al 2019a also reported similar findings and maize yield was higher when irrigation was applied at trumpeting stage v6 v12 in comparison to silking stage this is most likely due to the effects of water deficit between v9 and tasseling stage that impacts the kernel setting and weight li et al 2018 our results also showed that the negative impacts of water stress on maize yield during the early to mid vegetative stages i e t6 and t9 can be compensated by supplying 80 or 100 irrigation during the later stages i e silking flowering and grain filling this could be most probably due to the fact that by saving the maize from water deficit during the reproductive and maturity stage the accelerated senescence would be curbed that otherwise may reduce the photosynthesis zhang et al 2019b the association between irrigation depth and grain yield is important for understanding the grain yield response to different irrigation regimes chai et al 2016 in our study the irrigation depth grain yield relationship was linear and corresponds with the findings of farré and faci 2006 other factors such as soil characteristics irrigation management practices and climate also affect the relationship between the amount of irrigation applied and grain yield tolk and howell 2003 however these factors were not included in the scope of this study the range of ky value for the two years 0 61 0 82 was lower than that of estimated by jin et al 2020 in the same region they reported ky ranging between 0 97 and 1 2 for different development stages of maize by skipping irrigation in different periods smith and steduto 2012 also calculated ky for maize and it ranged from 0 2 to 2 3 in different growth stages moreover ky ranging between 0 83 and 1 65 was estimated by irmak et al 2016 for maize crop grown under variable irrigation rates as low as 25 of full irrigation and dryland conditions there could be several possible factors causing smaller ky values in this study for example drought tolerance of crop variety used in the experiment crop management practices growing season weather conditions etc dominguez et al 2012 irmak et al 2016 another probable reason of smaller ky is that the crop never experienced severe water stress in our study as lowest irrigation treatment for any particular stage was 40 of total irrigation and a small overall coefficient of variation 0 1 was calculated for grain yields from two years and all treatments wue values estimated in our study ranged from 20 3 to 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 which were broadly in accordance with the results of jin et al 2020 and their wue range was 14 3 24 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 the iwue values of our study 32 0 58 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 were also largely in agreement with the findings of greaves and wang 2017 and their estimated iwue ranged as 16 4 45 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 for different treatments of deficit irrigation for maize the aforementioned study nevertheless did not incorporate different growth stages to optimize reduced irrigation as included in our study larger wue in 2013 was mainly due to better growing conditions that resulted about 16 larger yield with 10 lesser etc on an average in comparison to 2012 yield also the irrigation requirement was greater in 2013 mainly due to warmer growing season in comparison to 2012 conversely 2012 growing season had better iwue due to 37 5 smaller irrigation consumption in general as to 2013 higher wue for t2 and t3 during 2013 shows that with sufficient water supply during stage 1 v3 v8 of maize development greater yields can be achieved despite reducing the irrigation in later stages on the other hand when the water supply is short reproductive stages can be prioritized for full irrigation t5 and t9 to maximize the iwue while regulating the deficit irrigation for earlier growth phases the water saving potential of maize under water deficit conditions could be linked to the chemical signaling mechanism of roots due to lack of plant available water that triggers the stomatal closure hence reducing the transpiration from leaves kang et al 2000 davies and zhang 1991 implementation of deficit irrigation at a certain growth stage might allow the growers to harness from this physiological process and by reducing the crop water supply partial stomatal inhibition could be achieved that would reduce the plant water use with minimal reduction in photosynthesis chai et al 2016 5 conclusion this study was conducted to assess the water saving potential of maize farming in guanzhong plain china during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013 deficit irrigation was regulated at different growth stages to analyze the impact of water stress on maize yield the results showed that irrigation treatment t2 that received 20 less irrigation compared with 100 of plant et full irrigation treatment ck from v8 to maturity had the overall highest yield t4 received 80 irrigation between v3 v8 and v11 tasseling 100 irrigation between v8 v11 and 60 irrigation between tasseling and maturity and it had average yield closer to ck lower yields were noted when the irrigation supply was reduced by 40 of full irrigation between v8 v11 and tasseling maturity the results also showed that the negative impacts of water stress on maize yield during the early to mid vegetative stages i e t6 and t9 can be compensated by supplying 80 or 100 irrigation during the later stages i e silking flowering and grain filling the overall highest iwue 52 15 kg mm 1 ha 1 for

10409,uncertainty in the availability of water supply pose challenges to traditional irrigation approaches regulating the amount and time of irrigation at different crop growth stages could provide a solution to optimize the irrigation water amid drought periods this study evaluated the effect of different deficit irrigation levels on maize zea mays l at several growth phases over two growing seasons 2012 and 2013 in yangling shaanxi province of china total nine irrigation treatments incorporated three irrigation amount ratios i e control irrigation ck 100 of crop evapotranspiration and 80 and 60 of control irrigation named as t2 t9 among the irrigation treatments grain yield ranged from 6392 to 9362 kg ha 1 and seasonal water use efficiency wue varied from 20 3 to 34 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 whereas the irrigation water use efficiency iwue ranged between 32 0 and 58 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 t2 that received 80 irrigation between v8 and r6 growth stage had overall higher yield than ck and this was closely followed by t4 that received 80 irrigation at growth phase v3 v8 and v11 tasseling full irrigation at v8 v11 and 60 irrigation between tasseling and maturity due to near optimum growing season temperature in 2013 larger wue was noted in comparison to 2012 that resulted 16 larger yield with 10 lesser etc on an average whereas 2012 growing season had better iwue because of 37 5 smaller irrigation consumption maize grain yield in response to water stress ky the yield response factor was 0 66 suggesting that the environmental conditions of the study area favor the application of deficit irrigation the maize yield response to reduced irrigation supply in this experiment indicated that regulated deficit irrigation might help growers to cope with decline in water availability during growing season keywords irrigation scheduling evapotranspiration maize yield water use efficiency water deficit drought 1 introduction maize is a part of staple diet in many developing countries and it is considered among the most important food sources fao 2014 also maize has the highest contribution in feed grain sector world wide cgiar 2016 with the ever increasing world population maize production needs to increase by 66 by 2050 to meet the global demand alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 china is the second largest maize producing country and shaanxi province is the main production region in china meng et al 2006 like other parts of the world maize production in china is also being affected by changes in climatic conditions wang et al 2012 an overall drying trend has been noted during summers in shaanxi province wang et al 2020 that point towards higher crop water demand of maize due to the climate change induced uncertainty both in spatial and temporal trends of precipitation timely availability of the irrigation water to fulfill crop water requirements saddique et al 2020 wang et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 would be a considerable challenge for maize production in the region irrigation is essential for supporting crop yield especially during drought periods and limited water availability could reduce water quotas for irrigated agriculture to support other stakeholders in water resources ajaz et al 2019 increasing tendency of precipitation extremes extreme drought to extreme precipitation in guanzhong plain coupled with high temperature liu et al 2018 makes the precise information on crop water requirements inevitable for better planning also it is important to determine how much and when the irrigation is needed for optimum water productivity and crop yield under scarce water supply thorp et al 2010 ali et al 2016 chai et al 2016 based on the historical records annual stream flow in wei river basin which mainly provides irrigation water to guanzhong plain has decreased whereas potential evapotranspiration has increased in the region zhao et al 2012 wei river basin is highly susceptible to occurrence of frequent droughts and floods as described by huang et al 2015 due to a considerable variation of annual precipitation in dry and wet years 370 800 mm respectively this arises the need for the irrigation districts and growers to adapt accordingly one possible adaptation strategy is deficit irrigation that allows the farmers to decrease the irrigation amount based on the irrigation quota and water availability ouda and noreldin 2020 ajaz et al 2020 though crop yield response to full irrigation is usually stable in semi arid regions response to deficit irrigation can fluctuate substantially depending on the timing and quantity of irrigation provision along with the occurrence of precipitation and initial soil water content at sowing kang et al 2000 many previous studies have evaluated the effect of controlled water stress on the maize yield by conducting field experiments for example aguilar et al 2007 found 29 larger productivity of applied water for limited irrigation treatments in comparison to full irrigation in a semi arid environment 10 32 reduction in water use by the maize crop was reported by li et al 2010 under partial root zone irrigation when compared with conventional irrigation as well as they found 10 42 increase in canopy water use efficiency crop modeling has also been used by previous researchers to examine the interaction of maize yield and water stress for example dominguez et al 2012 investigated the optimized approach for deficit irrigation of maize using mopeco model and found that the stage specific reduced irrigation may increase the grain yield up to 20 as to constant deficit irrigation during whole growing cycle dssat ceres maize model was employed by chen et al 2020 to improve irrigation use efficiency iue including a site in guanzhong region they estimated iue as high as 3 5 times by reducing water application to crop in comparison to locally applied irrigation at the cost of about 12 reduction in yield crop growth stage plays a pivotal role in decision related to allowing deficit irrigation and despite its importance to the best of our knowledge the effects of different levels of reduced irrigation application on maize yield at different development stages has not been investigated before in the guanzhong plain china also such amalgamation of varying irrigation levels with respect to crop growth phases received less attention in other parts of the world therefore the impact of variation in irrigation amounts with respect to different growth stages of maize grown in the guanzhong region is needed to be thoroughly examined furthermore the implications of any potential fluctuation in water supply to farms during the maize growing period should be thoroughly studied this study aimed to 1 identify the effect of different irrigation amounts at different growth stages on maize yield and 2 determine whether deficit irrigation can help maintaining the maize yield under water stressed conditions in guanzhong plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental conditions of the study area the experiment was carried out during two cropping years 2012 and 2013 at the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering northwest a f university fig 1 34 18 n 108 24 e 506 m above sea level yangling guanzhong plain china the study area is situated in a semi arid weather zone with a mean annual temperature of 12 8 c annual precipitation in the region is 548 mm precipitation mm d 1 and maximum and minimum daily air temperatures c in 2012 and 2013 were obtained from a weather station near the field site fig 2 the soil at the field site was sampled from different locations in the experimental plots from 0 to 250 cm soil depth the soil class is a brown loess loam containing 51 silt 26 sand and 23 clay the soil had 0 028 g kg 1 phosphorus p 0 0021 g kg 1 nitrogen n 0 99 g kg 1 potassium k and the bulk density was 1 36 g cm 3 the average volumetric water content at permanent wilting point and field capacity was 12 7 and 26 2 respectively 2 2 crop management and irrigation the maize variety wuke 2 was selected for this study as it is commonly grown in the region summer maize june october and winter wheat october may are grown as common practice in the area crop was sown between 19 june 2012 and 23 june 2013 six plants m 2 were sown in rows 50 cm apart with 180 kg n ha 1 and 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 applied at sowing four successive phenological phases in the summer maize growing period v3 3 leaf v8 8 leaf v8 8 leaf v11 11 leaf v11 11 leaf vt tasseling and vt tasseling r6 physiological maturity or black layer were selected to study the influence of different irrigation amounts the aforementioned periods were named as stage 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for irrigation applications moveable rain out shelter was used in the study to avoid the impact of uncertainty due to precipitation partial orthogonal l9 design scheme was used for the nine deficit irrigation treatments with three replications of each treatment in both years details of the design scheme and irrigation amounts are provided in tables 1a and 1b nine irrigation treatments incorporated three irrigation amounts control or full irrigation ck 100 of crop evapotranspiration et and two levels as a fraction of the control being 80 and 60 of ck applied at different growth stages during the growing season crop et of the ck irrigation treatment was measured with a large weighing lysimeter 3 m 2 2 m 3 m with continuous data loggers precision of 0 021 mm installed in experimental plots fig 3 soil and crop management conditions in the lysimeter were the same as other experimental plots the crop et from the lysimeter was recorded on an hourly basis and then summed up to get the daily or monthly value when the soil moisture in the control treatment ck declined to a predetermined lower limit i e 65 fc irrigation was applied soil water content was measured using a pre calibrated thetaprobe ml2x delta t devicesltd cambridge uk sensor installed at depths of 20 40 80 100 200 and 250 cm for the treatments t2 t9 irrigation was synchronous to the control irrigation treatment ck the flood irrigation method was employed in the experimental plots and irrigation application was performed with a pump coupled with a flow meter to control the amount of irrigation applied to each experimental plot 2 3 irrigation and seasonal water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated dividing the grain yield by total irrigation applied during the growing season seasonal water use efficiency wue was calculated as follows 1 w u e y e t c where y is grain yield kg ha 1 and etc is growing season crop et for each irrigation treatment estimated using the following water balance equation allen et al 1998 2 e t c i p r d δ s where i is applied irrigation mm p is seasonal precipitation mm r is surface runoff mm d is downward flux below the crop root zone mm and δs is variation in soil water content in terms of depth mm p r and d were considered 0 due to the presence of the rain out shelter covered boundary around the plot and downward flux below the crop root zone that was neglected because the lower side of every plot in the rain out shelter was impermeable therefore eq 2 was simplified to 3 e t c i δ s 2 4 maize yield response factor the yield response factor ky for maize was calculated in this study that is the relative reduction in yield linked to the corresponding relative reduction in et and reflects the slope of the relationship of these two variables smith and steduto 2012 doorenbos and kassam 1979 calculation of ky has been described as follows 4 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m the maximum yield y m and maximum et e t m values were determined from the non stressed irrigated treatment ck actual yield y a and actual et e t a values were determined from the combined deficit irrigation levels 60 ck 80 ck and 100 ck furthermore data for the two growing seasons were pooled to determine seasonal values of ky in general larger ky translates greater sensitivity for yield to water stress during crop growing period and smaller ky implies higher tolerance of the crop to water deficit 2 5 growth parameters leaf area index lai was measured using a sunscan ss1 canopy analyzer leaf area observations were recorded on eight occasions during crop development crop phenology in each irrigation treatment was observed by inspecting the field experiment grain yield and aboveground biomass were collected at maturity 2 6 statistical analysis the collected maize data and parameters grain yield biomass lai wue and iwue were examined by analysis of variance test anova and the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between yield and seasonal et and total applied irrigation water 3 results 3 1 leaf area index and biomass in both growing seasons 2012 and 2013 the maximum lai was recorded near the anthesis stage the non stressed irrigation treatment ck had maximum lai values of 4 78 and 5 22 at 58 2012 and 55 das 2013 respectively which differed significantly p 0 05 from the other irrigation treatments t3 t9 table 2 t3 had a maximum lai of 3 81 in 2012 which did not significantly differ from t4 t6 or t9 the maximum lai of the t3 t4 t6 and t9 treatments did however significantly differ p 0 05 from those in ck t2 t5 t7 and t8 the maximum lai of t3 during 2013 growing season was significantly different from all other treatments whereas the maximum lai did not differ significantly between ck and t2 and similar trend was noted from t4 to t9 water stress significantly influenced dry biomass production in both growing seasons table 2 with significantly higher growth in 2013 than 2012 p 0 05 due to the more favorable weather conditions near optimum growing seaoson temperature greaves 1996 the control treatment ck produced the largest dry biomass 15 809 kg ha 1 and 18 911 kg ha 1 in 2012 at 110 das and 2013 at 101 das respectively the t3 irrigation treatment produced the smallest dry biomass 13 260 kg ha 1 and 16 075 kg ha 1 in 2012 and 2013 respectively which differed significantly from the other irrigation treatments except for t6 in 2013 dry biomass did not significantly differ in the t4 t9 irrigation treatments in 2012 or t7 t9 irrigation treatments in 2013 p 0 05 3 2 grain yield mean grain yield in 2013 was significantly larger compared to 2012 p 0 05 table 3 shows the grain yields for the 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons the control and t4 treatments produced the largest grain yields in 2012 7994 kg ha 1 and 2013 9362 kg ha 1 respectively t3 treatment has the smallest yield 6571 kg ha 1 in 2012 and 7461 kg ha 1 in 2013 which was 20 and 12 smaller than the control in 2012 grain yield in the t2 t5 and t6 treatments did not significantly differ from the control and during 2013 grain yield in t2 t4 t5 t7 and t9 treatments did not show significant difference from the control p 0 05 3 3 relationship between grain yield biomass lai irrigation depth and et maize yield improved by increasing the irrigation depth and a linear relationship existed between them with r2 of 0 86 fig 4 the predictability of yield biomass lai and irrigation amount was found to be good under multiple regression and r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 90 table 4 a linear relationship between et deficit and relative grain yield reduction was observed in both years with grain yield response factor values ky of 0 61 and 0 82 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the average slope ky across both years was 0 66 with r2 of 0 77 3 4 water use efficiency across all treatments wue and iwue ranged from 20 3 to 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 32 0 to 58 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively table 3 overall higher wue was noted in 2013 whereas larger iwue was estimated for 2012 the t5 and t2 treatments had the highest wue in 2012 and 2013 and t8 and ck treatments had the lowest wue in 2012 and 2013 respectively the t5 treatment had the highest iwue 58 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2012 and 46 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 and ck had the lowest iwue 41 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2012 and 32 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2013 fig 5 4 discussion this study examined the impact of variable irrigation supply on maize yield applied at different growth stages in a semi arid area it was found that in comparison to full irrigation treatment ck t2 provided overall better yield in two growing seasons and t4 yield was also close to ck on an average for 2012 and 2013 this highlighted the potential of water saving in the region by following a combination of deficit irrigation application at different development stages it is important to note that full irrigation treatment ck did not always have the largest yield for example t4 during 2013 had the largest yield 10 8 greater than ck whereas the biomass was 4 3 smaller than ck t2 on the other hand had 0 6 larger biomass than ck whereas the yield was 10 7 greater than ck this shows the impact of different levels of water stress at different crop growth stages which had a positive impact on yield for t2 and t5 in comparison to ck though the processes involved in increasing the plant productivity under stress are not well explored as discussed by chai et al 2016 one probable reason in case of t4 could be the reallocation of pre anthesis carbon reserves towards grains due to presence of water stress between vegetative reproductive and grain filling stages raes et al 2018 yang and zhang 2006 in addition higher biomass and grain yield of t2 might be due to better nitrogen use efficiency of maize plant under partial water stress conditions as highlighted by li et al 2007 lower yields were noted in t3 where the irrigation supply was reduced by 40 of full irrigation between second and fourth stage these results were in accordance with the findings of jin et al 2020 who found higher yield response of maize due to water stress in vegetative stages in comparison to reproductive stages zhang et al 2019a also reported similar findings and maize yield was higher when irrigation was applied at trumpeting stage v6 v12 in comparison to silking stage this is most likely due to the effects of water deficit between v9 and tasseling stage that impacts the kernel setting and weight li et al 2018 our results also showed that the negative impacts of water stress on maize yield during the early to mid vegetative stages i e t6 and t9 can be compensated by supplying 80 or 100 irrigation during the later stages i e silking flowering and grain filling this could be most probably due to the fact that by saving the maize from water deficit during the reproductive and maturity stage the accelerated senescence would be curbed that otherwise may reduce the photosynthesis zhang et al 2019b the association between irrigation depth and grain yield is important for understanding the grain yield response to different irrigation regimes chai et al 2016 in our study the irrigation depth grain yield relationship was linear and corresponds with the findings of farré and faci 2006 other factors such as soil characteristics irrigation management practices and climate also affect the relationship between the amount of irrigation applied and grain yield tolk and howell 2003 however these factors were not included in the scope of this study the range of ky value for the two years 0 61 0 82 was lower than that of estimated by jin et al 2020 in the same region they reported ky ranging between 0 97 and 1 2 for different development stages of maize by skipping irrigation in different periods smith and steduto 2012 also calculated ky for maize and it ranged from 0 2 to 2 3 in different growth stages moreover ky ranging between 0 83 and 1 65 was estimated by irmak et al 2016 for maize crop grown under variable irrigation rates as low as 25 of full irrigation and dryland conditions there could be several possible factors causing smaller ky values in this study for example drought tolerance of crop variety used in the experiment crop management practices growing season weather conditions etc dominguez et al 2012 irmak et al 2016 another probable reason of smaller ky is that the crop never experienced severe water stress in our study as lowest irrigation treatment for any particular stage was 40 of total irrigation and a small overall coefficient of variation 0 1 was calculated for grain yields from two years and all treatments wue values estimated in our study ranged from 20 3 to 34 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 which were broadly in accordance with the results of jin et al 2020 and their wue range was 14 3 24 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 the iwue values of our study 32 0 58 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 were also largely in agreement with the findings of greaves and wang 2017 and their estimated iwue ranged as 16 4 45 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 for different treatments of deficit irrigation for maize the aforementioned study nevertheless did not incorporate different growth stages to optimize reduced irrigation as included in our study larger wue in 2013 was mainly due to better growing conditions that resulted about 16 larger yield with 10 lesser etc on an average in comparison to 2012 yield also the irrigation requirement was greater in 2013 mainly due to warmer growing season in comparison to 2012 conversely 2012 growing season had better iwue due to 37 5 smaller irrigation consumption in general as to 2013 higher wue for t2 and t3 during 2013 shows that with sufficient water supply during stage 1 v3 v8 of maize development greater yields can be achieved despite reducing the irrigation in later stages on the other hand when the water supply is short reproductive stages can be prioritized for full irrigation t5 and t9 to maximize the iwue while regulating the deficit irrigation for earlier growth phases the water saving potential of maize under water deficit conditions could be linked to the chemical signaling mechanism of roots due to lack of plant available water that triggers the stomatal closure hence reducing the transpiration from leaves kang et al 2000 davies and zhang 1991

could be achieved that would reduce the plant water use with minimal reduction in photosynthesis chai et al 2016 5 conclusion this study was conducted to assess the water saving potential of maize
