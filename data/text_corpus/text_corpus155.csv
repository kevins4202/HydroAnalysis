775,vegetation in channels strongly affects flow structure and turbulence with consequences on the hydrological storage of nutrients and chemical tracers the shelter of stream biota as well as the trapping or transport of sediments at the same time all these phenomena are inevitably subjected to alteration of hydrological conditions in fluvial systems due to climate change the present study intends to provide a thorough investigation into the processes of transport and dispersion induced by flow turbulence within the vegetation structure specifically velocity measurements in vegetated channels were intensively conducted and analyzed in the case of both flexible submerged and rigid emergent canopies the experiments aimed to i highlight the differences in the hydrodynamic structures induced by different plant types and configurations ii study the spatially varying dispersive properties and turbulent behavior of the current attributable to different plant density submergence and stiffness further the spatial variability of velocity and turbulence distributions was taken into due consideration the experimental results showed how longitudinal and transversal hydrodynamics and transport differ depending on vegetation configuration and stem properties keywords rigid vegetation flexible vegetation turbulent length dispersion advective transport 1 introduction river vegetation has historically been acknowledged from a hydraulic perspective as a source of flow resistance by increasing bottom roughness decreasing near bed turbulent stress and reducing conveyance capacity gurnell 2014 nepf 2012a 2012b nevertheless the reduced velocity and transport within the vegetation shelters biota promotes the trapping of sediments as well as the storage and retention of nutrients chemical tracers and microbes inside the canopy also allowing flood control costanza et al 1997 kemp et al 2000 marois et al 2015 only recently vegetation has been considered as an integral part of a river system its pivotal role in regulating ecological services and protecting from flood drought risks has received remarkable attention nepf 2012a pollen and simon 2005 considering that the alteration of hydrological conditions is strictly sensitive to climate change mean and turbulent flows advection and dispersion are perturbed by the canopy ben meftah et al 2014 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 ikeda and kanazawa 1996 raupach and thom 1981 at the same time varying water loads and flow characteristics affect the hydraulic behavior and resisting force of plants in a community depending on their shape stiffness submergence permeability porosity phenologic stage growth maturity decay periods the residence time transport and fate of contaminants nutrients dissolved oxygen and other scalars along with the deposition of sediment grains can be accurately envisaged depending on our ability to understand the mechanism of exchange between the free stream and the vegetated region such a transfer mechanism is critical to the overall dispersion and seems primarily controlled by the canopy density and geometry ghisalberti and nepf 2005 nepf 2012b nepf et al 2007 oldham and sturman 2001 poggi et al 2009 schultz et al 1995 to optimize the ecosystem functions and define adequate sediment management a better knowledge of the impact of the changing conditions on suspended sediment mechanisms should be attempted namely a mutual feedback exerts between water flows vegetation and sediments so that the first fundamental step to recognize and manage the impact of climate change on riverine systems is to deduce the interaction between vegetation and river hydrodynamics the interplay between flow and vegetation creates feedbacks to sediment deposition liu and nepf 2016 based on flow velocity and stem generated turbulence the deposition of fine sediment and organic material could benefit from the flow velocity reduction between the plants whilst local soil erosion could diminish due to the reduction of the bed shear stress crosato and saleh 2011 righetti 2008 righetti and armanini 2002 in any case when the main flow is diverted towards unobstructed areas enhanced velocities laterally adjacent to the patch are produced so that a transversal sharp transition region at the interface between the obstructed and unobstructed domains is formed a transverse shear occurs generating large scale horizontal vortices centered around the edge of the vegetated area ben meftah and mossa 2016 ben meftah et al 2014 lima and izumi 2014 white and nepf 2007a 2007b which might cause localized erosion liu and nepf 2016 the effects of vegetation on the dispersion process have been experimentally investigated for both the submerged and emergent cases but usually the cross section spatial averaging of non uniform advection and diffusion results have been applied nepf and vivoni 2000 nepf et al 1997 perucca et al 2009 in this way the variation of the transversal diffusion and advection cannot be examined experiments by nepf et al 1997 within an array of emergent cylindrical rods using a continuous injection technique showed that when plants are present the vertical diffusivity and the diminished vertical shear reduced the shear flow dispersion the production of turbulence within a stand of emergent vegetation is dominated by the stem wakes rather than by the bottom boundary shear as in open channel flows nepf et al 1997 a relation between water depth and turbulence structure was highlighted by nepf and vivoni 2000 who pointed out that the generation of wake turbulence is strongly associated with the relative water depth analyses of velocity spectra and turbulent kinetic energy profiles showed that in natural river vegetation naden et al 2006 and in model canopies ricardo et al 2014 zong and nepf 2012 stem scale turbulence is absent at low stem reynolds number red and arises at red 200 nepf and vivoni 2000 tanino and nepf 2008 with red equal to the product of flow mean velocity and stem diameter rated by kinematic viscosity in the case of rigid vegetation tanino and nepf 2008 proposed a model for the mean turbulence intensity and the lateral dispersion coefficient due to the spatially heterogeneous velocity field as a function of cylinder distribution and density their study proved that only turbulent eddies with mixing length scale greater than stem diameter contribute significantly to net lateral dispersion shucksmith et al 2010 showed that in emergent conditions the mixing process dominant factor is the degree of reduction in spatial variation of velocity over the channel cross section the effects of submerged vegetation on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient were investigated by ghisalberti and nepf 2006 who proposed a two zone model to identify three contributing processes large scale shear dispersion above the canopy inefficient exchange between the canopy and the overflow and stem scale dispersion within the canopy later shucksmith et al 2011 utilized an empirical data set of longitudinal mixing measurements to evaluate the performance of both existing and newly proposed models for mixing in submerged vegetated open channel flow they highlighted that the rate of mixing in such systems is dependent on the relative size of the flow layers the difference in average velocity and the rate of the vertical mass transfer furthermore the physical structure of individual plants and the canopy morphology alter the velocity field across several scales ben meftah et al 2014 ben meftah et al 2015 nepf 2012a 2012b tanino and nepf 2008 ranging from individual branches and blades on a single plant to a community of plants in a meadow or patch flow structure at different scales is relevant to different processes as an example the retenepfntion and release of organic matter mineral sediments seeds and pollen from a meadow or patch depend on the flow structure at the meadow or patch scale mossa and de serio 2016 mossa et al 2017 literature shows that with emergent vegetation the turbulent length scales are set by the stem diameter and spacing see among others ben meftah and mossa 2013 2012b nepf 2012a tanino and nepf 2008 termini 2016a shucksmith et al 2010 proved that in the presence of a relatively uniform distribution of plant blockage over the width and depth mixing is dominated by stem scale processes in the case of dense submerged vegetation the drag discontinuity at the top of vegetation generates a shear layer with canopy scale vortices controlling the exchanges of mass and momentum between the canopy and the overflow nepf 2012a termini 2015 furthermore the turbulent transport occurs inside the upper part of the vegetated layer despite turbulent unobstructed flows i e river and sea currents jets have been extensively studied see among others ben meftah et al 2017 cuthbertson et al 2006 de serio and mossa 2014 2015 mossa 2004 flows through regions with vegetation still deserve an in depth examination in fact from the brief notes above described it is evident that the knowledge of the engineering role played by vegetation in regulating eco services and river management is crucial even if challenging according to gregory et al 1991 lotsari et al 2015 sandercock and hooke 2011 modelling should play an important role in reducing uncertainty associated with channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions strategies for quantifying solute transport in vegetated rivers consist of lumped models ghisalberti and nepf 2005 upscaled models marion et al 2008 and numerical solutions of the advection dispersion equation rubol et al 2016 however the most relevant issue to both simulations and predictions is modelling calibration and validation for this reason since it is hard to monitor in situ sediment water interactions due to required timescales laboratory experiments are needed to investigate transport patterns and dynamics for different vegetation scenarios laboratory experiments in flumes provide the opportunity i to evaluate the impact of different hydrodynamic regimes on different plant types and configurations in controlled conditions ii to assess and estimate the action played by streamwise patterns of vegetation on the processes of transport and dispersion of turbulence and tracers in the three directions the purpose of the present study is to analyze these two aspects specifically considering the 3d spatial variability of the flow canopy interaction a simple analogy can be obtained relating the solute transport of the vegetated river with its sediment transport in any case the above mentioned analogy involves the knowledge of key parameters governing the process such as grain size or settling velocity thus it goes beyond the analysis of the present research experiments were carried out in two different laboratory facilities and two different types of surrogate vegetation were used the structure of the vegetation was simplified and attention was focused on the effect of its main parameters i e vegetation stiffness density and size on the processes of turbulence transport and dispersion to this aim plant elements having the same characteristic dimension but a different stiffness were considered and the experimental runs were conducted for different plant submergences and plane distributions firstly a sparse rigid and emergent canopy was studied in two different hydrodynamic configurations after this a dense flexible and submerged canopy was investigated the present paper is structured in the following way in the next section a theoretical background is provided to point out the principal variables involved in the process of turbulence and solute transport in section 3 the experimental work is illustrated while results from the two canopies are analyzed in section 4 and finally discussed in section 5 2 theoretical approach 2 1 main variables involved a canopy consists of a distribution of plant elements in the present paper both rigid cylinders of uniform diameter d and submerged canopy of blade width d were considered thus according to ghisalberti and nepf 2009 it is reasonable to define d as the characteristic element scale within the canopy other key parameters characterizing the canopy are the solid volume fraction ϕ i e the volume within the canopy occupied by solid elements which is the complement of the canopy porosity η 1 ϕ and the frontal area per unit length of the canopy a nd where n is the number of elements per unit planar area in the case of a periodic square array of cylinders the value of a is equal to 1 s2 being s the axis to axis distance of the cylinders within the array the flow is spatially heterogeneous at the scale of the individual elements and often unsteady in time generally in the case of obstructed flows the double averaging method is used to remove the temporal and element scale spatial heterogeneity of the current finnigan 1985 raupach and shaw 1982 in other words the instantaneous equations of the vegetated current are first averaged over a time longer than the time scale of turbulence or instabilities in the flow and then averaged over an infinitesimally thin area that spans many cylinders including only the area occupied by the fluid in the present study only the time averaging procedure indicated by the overbar sign is used to not miss information on the typical spatial variations in the longitudinal and transversal sections for the sake of simplicity the ambient current is considered uniform 2 2 solute transport and contribution from turbulence hereafter we consider a rectangular canopy located in a fluid of depth h the canopy length is parallel to the mean flow directions with u v and w the streamwise transverse and vertical velocity components respectively the x axis is parallel to the mean flow and sits along the centerline of the channel and array the y axis is at the leading edge of the canopy and is perpendicular to the mean flow direction the profile of the current velocity upstream of the canopy is assumed uniform over the water depth the transport of a tracer c species concentration is described by the following expression 1 c t v c d 0 c where t is time c x t is the solute concentration v x t u v w v1 v2 v3 is the fluid velocity d 0 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and x x y z x1 x2 x3 neglecting the molecular diffusion that is small in a turbulent flow and time averaging eq 1 over a time interval much longer than the time scales of turbulent fluctuations we have the time averaged concentration equation 2 c t u j c x j u j c x j where the overbar denotes the temporal average and the prime symbol denotes the temporal fluctuations so that 3 c x t c x c x t u x t u x u x t v x t v x v x t w x t w x w x t eq 2 shows that the concentration mass flux is due to the convection by the time averaged flow also named mean flow u c v c and w c and transport by turbulent velocity fluctuations u c v c and w c eq 2 can be rewritten as follows 4 c t u j c x j k j j 2 c x j 2 in fact following ting and kirby 1995 1996 in direct analogy to turbulent momentum transport also turbulent mass concentration transport is assumed to be related to the gradient of the transported quantity in this way kjj are the coefficients for net dispersion which parameterize u j c i e the turbulent diffusion furthermore the terms u j c like the molecular diffusion are expected to be fickian if the spatial scale of the contributing mechanisms is smaller than the scale over which the mean concentration gradient varies the mechanisms associated with the terms u j c have characteristic scales of the stem diameter d and axis to axis distance s differently from tanino and nepf 2008 who averaged eq 1 both in time and in space in our present case the flow is three dimensional and therefore the equations are only time averaged this means that the present study focuses on the turbulent diffusion whereas the mechanical dispersion is the consequence of the time averaged spatial fluctuations tanino and nepf 2008 in the analysis of the flow dispersion interaction the turbulent kinetic energy tke is important in determining the turbulent dispersion coefficient and thus the mass transport the turbulent dispersion coefficient may be written as the product of a length scale and a velocity scale a physical meaningful velocity scale is k where k is the turbulent kinetic energy i e 5 k k 1 2 u i u i k 1 2 u i u i therefore the determination of the time and spatial variations of turbulent kinetic energy is of great importance in the evaluation of the dispersion process for high reynolds numbers the equation of the turbulent kinetic energy is 6 k t local derivative u j k x j advection x j 1 ρ u j p pressure diffusion u j k turbulent transport 1 2 u i u j u i x j u j x i production 1 2 ν u i x j u j x i 2 dissipation as shown by nepf 1999 it reasonable to assume that the production term is of order of the dissipation term our experimental data and previous literature findings nepf 1999 nepf and vivoni 2000 enabled us to confirm this assumption namely considering the production of tke as the sum of wake and bed shear production terms nepf 1999 noted that in the emergent case the bed shear production is negligible over almost all the flow depth apart from the zone very close to the bed consequently tke dissipation and wake production balance over almost all the flow depth apart from the zone close to the bottom in the submerged case the shear at the top of vegetation could provide an important source of turbulence nevertheless for shallow depth ratios and especially inside the vegetation nepf and vivoni 2000 proved that the wake production is of order of the turbulence dissipation furthermore to obtain the diffusive transport terms in turbulence modeling turbulent diffusion is often assumed proportional to the gradient of k rodi 1984 i e 7 1 ρ u j p u j k d k k x j with the turbulent diffusion coefficient dk 8 d k ν t σ k where νt is the eddy viscosity and σk is an empirical diffusion constant therefore being energy dissipation and production of the same order of magnitude the transport equation for k becomes 9 k t u j k x j d k 2 k x j 2 where following the eddy diffusivity concept nepf 1999 ting and kirby 1995 the turbulent diffusion coefficient is assumed as 10 d k l k with l the integral length scale associated with turbulent eddies eq 9 is formally analogous to eq 4 and therefore assuming that the prandtl number is o 1 the analysis of the terms of eq 9 can be used for eq 4 consequently it seems interesting to investigate the relations between u v w and k in fact the analogy between eqs 4 and 9 suggests that the cross correlation between the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy and the u v and w velocity components is related to the time averaged solute concentration c transport by the mean flow u c v c and w c this approach was also used by ting and kirby 1994 who stated that the suspended sediment concentration shows that the mass flux along the flow direction is due to convection by mean flow and transport by turbulent velocity fluctuations while the tendency of sediment to settle out is counteracted by the action of turbulent fluctuations in their study they proved that if it is assumed that turbulent velocity fluctuations are responsible for keeping sediment in suspension and the mean flow transports the sediment then suspended sediment transport resembles turbulence transport in the present study sediments were not directly investigated and consequently some key parameters like grain size or settling velocity were not available to examine thoroughly the analogy between the transport of tke and the sediment transport in any case the analogy between the transport of tke and the transport of a scalar concentration by means of the mean flow is reliable and is taken into consideration referring to both eqs 4 and 9 the integral length scale l present in eq 10 can be evaluated by the power spectrum or by multiplying the integral time scale tu by the local time averaged velocity u i x where tu is estimated by the autocorrelation function of the turbulent velocity fluctuations i e 11 l i u i x t u u i x 0 τ 0 u i x t u i x t τ u i 2 x d τ with τ the time lag with respect to t and τ0 the value of τ at the first zero crossing the integral length scale of turbulence l depends strongly on the presence of cylinders in unobstructed flow l increases with the scale of the diffusion patch until the largest length scale is reached that is the length scale defined by the flow domain okubo 1971 emergent canopies impose structure on both the mean and turbulent flow over the entire water column in flows with emergent vegetation the canopy dissipates eddies with scales greater than the stem scale of s and d while contributing additional turbulent energy at these stem scales thus the dominant turbulent length scale within a canopy is shifted downward from analogous condition without vegetation particularly in a channel with a regular array of cylinders the integral length scale of the turbulence is set by the smaller of the stem diameter d or the distance between the stems s regardless of the water depth taylor 1935 tanino and nepf 2008 in other words for d s turbulence is generated within stem wakes if the red is larger than 120 so that l d on the contrary for d s turbulence is generated within the pore channels so that l s these two depicted regimes in presence of cylinders are not exhaustive since for low solid volume fractions ad less than 0 01 the integral length scale of the turbulence should have an intermediate value between those previously mentioned i e l o min d s h for further details see for example nepf et al 1997 and lopez and garcia 1998 analogously to eq 10 tanino and nepf 2008 assumed that the net dispersion coefficients could be assumed equal to 12 k j j α k l j where the scale factor α could generally differ for horizontal and vertical diffusion following nepf 1999 it is reasonable to assume the horizontal dispersion coefficient value in the range 0 1 3 methods and materials literature nepf 2012a shows that aquatic plants exhibit a wide range of geometry and distribution marsh grasses are relatively sparse with stem diameters d 0 1 1 cm ϕ 0 1 1 and a 1 7 m 1 mangroves are among the densest canopies with ϕ as high as 45 mean trunk diameters of 4 9 cm and a up to 20 m 1 seagrasses have a 1 100 m 1 and ϕ 1 10 emergent plants tend to have rounded stems for higher stiffness and submerged grasses tend to have a blade geometry in which the width 0 3 1 cm is larger than the thickness 0 1 cm in which case d is the blade width based on the above information two flow velocity datasets have been used in this work the first one herein indicated as ba r data set was collected with the bed covered by rigid emerged vegetated stems the second one herein indicated as pa f data set was collected with flexible and submerged vegetation on the bed the manifest diversity of the two vegetated systems is justified by the aim to identify the key parameters which drive their different behaviors and find possible analogies in the hydrodynamic and dispersion processes the vegetation elements were characterized by the same characteristic dimension d 3 1 setup and instrumentation for the rigid vegetated flume ba r data set experimental runs were carried out in a smooth horizontal rectangular channel in the department of civil environmental land building engineering and chemistry of the polytechnic university of bari italy the channel was 25 0 m long 0 40 m wide and 0 50 m deep with lateral walls and bottom surface in plexiglas as shown in fig 1 a stable recirculating flow was guaranteed in the channel for details please refer to ben meftah and mossa 2013 and ben meftah et al 2015 the vegetation array was constructed of vertical rigid circular steel cylinders with threaded lateral surfaces and thus considered as rough cylinders the cylinder diameter was d 0 003 m the cylinder extremities were inserted into a plywood plaque 3 0 m long 0 02 m thick and a width equal to those of the channels which in turn was fixed along the channel bottoms forming the experimental area the plywood plaque was extended 3 m both upstream and downstream of the array of cylinders experimental area and was tapered to the channel bottom to minimize flow disturbance fig 1 cylinders were arranged regularly and spaced longitudinally and transversally with the same axis to axis distance s 0 05 m so that the cylinder density n was 4 cylinders dm2 while the vegetation density per meter was a 1 2 m 1 and the solid volume fraction was ϕ 0 28 therefore following nepf 2012a this vegetation can be considered sparse a cartesian coordinate system x y z was adopted in the centre of the array with x y and z coordinates denoting the longitudinal transversal and vertical directions respectively because water was forced to move around the cylinders the flow within the canopy was turbulent and highly heterogeneous at the scale of the individual stem therefore the instantaneous three dimensional flow velocity components through different longitudinal cross and horizontal planes were accurately measured 1cmx1cm grid resolution using a down looking three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino system by nortek the adv was used with a velocity range equal to 0 30 m s a velocity accuracy of 1 a sampling rate of 100 hz and a sampling volume of vertical extend of 9 mm the acquired data were filtered based on tukey s method ben meftah et al 2015 and bad samples signal to noise ratio snr 15 db and correlation coefficient 70 were removed measurements were carried out placing the adv between two consecutive rigid stems two different runs were analysed with different flow depths and mean channel velocities named ba r1 and ba r2 the initial experimental conditions and parameters of the runs are shown in table 1 herein b is the channel width and fa ua gh 0 5 is the inlet flow froude number with ua q bh the mean channel velocity g the gravity acceleration and q the flow rate the element reynolds number red was calculated based on d and on the time averaged velocity also averaged in the transversal plane 3 2 setup and instrumentation for the flexible vegetated flume pa f data set the data used for such a comparison were collected in a straight laboratory channel constructed at the hydraulic laboratory of dicam department of university of palermo italy details of the experimental apparatus can be found in previous works termini 2013 2016a termini and sammartano 2012 thus only information important for the following analysis is reported in this section the rectangular flume was 11 2 m long and 0 4 m wide see fig 2 the longitudinal bed slope was equal to 0 4 and the channel reach 1 60 m long downstream of the initial section x0 see fig 2 was covered by real herbaceous flexible vegetation festuca arundinacea the vegetation stems had a blade geometry with width d 0 003 m the blade width was obtained as average value of 15 measures in 10 samples of unit area dm2 the experimental run was conducted with water discharge q 35l s the vegetation height hv that is the height before producing submergence of vegetation was about equal to 7 8 cm and the bent vegetation height kv was about equal to 2 6 cm the stems concentration was equal to 190 stems dm2 at which corresponds a value of the fractional plant area equal to ϕ 13 5 and a 57m 1 so that this canopy can be considered dense nepf 2012a 2012b the element reynolds number was red 2466 during this run the instantaneous longitudinal u t transversal v t and vertical w t velocity components were measured by using the dop 2000 profiler by signal processing s a three probes of emitting frequency of 8 mhz were used the dop2000 allowed the measurement of the instantaneous flow velocity profile along the direction of each probe details of the measurement conditions can be found in termini 2013 2016a 2016b 4 results the two experiments are described separately examining the distributions of the time averaged horizontal velocity turbulent kinetic energy integral length scales and diffusivity coefficients further the advective transport of the turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean flow is also investigated for the sake of simplicity from now on the time averaged longitudinal transversal and vertical velocity components u v and w will be also referred to as u v and w respectively 4 1 results of ba r data set for this data set in run ba r1values assessed along the longitudinal planes y 2 5 cm i e y d 8 3 and y 0 i e y d 0 are available in run ba r2 values assessed along the longitudinal planes y 2 5 cm i e y d 8 3 are available as an example fig 3 a shows in the case of run ba r1 the typical cylinder effects on the flow velocity distribution in the horizontal plane computed as u t u 2 v 2 at the intermediate depth z h 0 45 for further details please refer to ben meftah and mossa 2013 ben meftah et al 2014 2015 because of the adv technical limitations measurements were not assessed in the uppermost layer with a thickness of 7 cm a typical trend is observed in the mapped flow with the expected behavior of the velocity showing maxima values in the intermediate position between two consecutive cylinders where the flow converges also the flow diverges from each cylinder inducing the typical wake fig 3 b displays for the ba r1 run the vertical profiles of the time averaged longitudinal u velocity normalized by ua and plotted for different x d positions along the longitudinal section at y d 8 3 the x positions are all located 0 03 m downstream of a cylinder therefore in the region of higher velocity as previously mentioned the 3d flow is sensitive to the investigated position relative to the stems in fact observing fig 3 b we note that the vertical trends of u normalized by ua are different depending on the relative measuring position x d with respect to the stems in any case to allow a straightforward data comparison the longitudinal average of the vertical profiles was also considered and plotted on the same graph red line this longitudinally averaged profile of u ua was obtained by averaging the data of the different x d positions at the same z h as expected reduced values of the u ua profile are noted in comparison with those of the bare channel i e unobstructed flow superimposed in fig 3 b green line analogous profiles are shown for the ba r2 run and y d 8 3 in fig 3 c where a flattened longitudinally averaged profile of u ua is also displayed for the vegetated case in comparison with the unobstructed channel case fig 4 a and 4 b plots the vertical profiles of the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy normalized by ua 2 for y d 8 3 of cases ba r1 and ba r2 respectively also in these graphs the green and red lines are shown still referring to the unobstructed flow and to the longitudinally averaged profile of the vegetated flow in presence of vegetation increased turbulent kinetic energy values k at all depths and at all x d positions are evident if compared to the non vegetated flow thus proving the increased turbulent effect induced by the rigid stems on the flow moreover in the unobstructed flow greater values of k are noted near the bed as expected especially for the ba r1 run fig 4 a with a decreasing trend towards the surface for the vegetated flow near the surface few higher values of normalized k of run ba r1 are noted attributable to unavoidable local instabilities for the successive key parameters the analysis is structured in the subsequent way firstly the ba r1 run is described referring to all values measured at each x d position along the longitudinal section y d 8 3 in this way the local variability of the parameters is evident successively to have a global view the longitudinally averaged vertical profiles mean trends of the vegetated case y d 0 of the ba r1 run and y d 8 3 of ba r2 run were also added in the graphs the vertical trends of both ba r1 and ba r2 unobstructed cases were also overlaid in this way the grouped trends allow a thorough understanding of the dispersion process the analysis of fig 5 shows the integral turbulent lengths normalized by d along the three directions i e lx ly and lz calculated by means of eq 11 referring to all points investigated in ba r1 run in the longitudinal plane y d 8 3 as previously written in the case of the unobstructed channel the integral length scale of turbulence l is of order of the channel flow depth h instead the presence of the array its density and arrangement of the plants modify the structure of the turbulent flow righetti 2008 in fact it is worth noting that for the bare channel flow the values of lx are of the same order of magnitude of the channel height i e o 10 1 consistently with okubo 1971 nepf 1999 the presence of the vegetation induces a reduction of lx which is characterized by a lower order of magnitude in comparison with the unobstructed case i e o 10 2 and comparable with the canopy pore s on the contrary in the transversal direction the length ly increases when vegetation is present in comparison with the non vegetated case even if the order of magnitude of ly is o 10 4 for both unobstructed and obstructed cases the turbulent length lz in the vertical direction is reduced in the obstructed flow in comparison with the unobstructed case keeping the same order of magnitude o 10 4 the behavior observed in fig 5 highlights that the turbulent eddies are affected by the symmetrical and equally spaced rigid stems thus becoming flattened in the longitudinal and vertical directions while they stretch in the transversal one for lx ly and lz fig 6 collects the vertical profiles of the unobstructed flow of ba r1 and ba r2 as well as the longitudinally averaged vertical profiles mean trends of ba r1 for y d 0 and y d 8 3 and of ba r2 for y d 8 3 three different logarithmic abscissa axes are inserted to identify if the turbulent length scale is scaled by d s or h considering that h is different for ba r1 and ba r2 runs the reference value h 0 3 m was used namely the analysis of lx fig 6 is interesting and marks the novelty of the present research in fact as previously written in the present case of sparse vegetation with ad o 0 01 it was expected that the integral length scale of turbulence was of o d consistently with nepf et al 1997 and lopez and garcia 1998 fig 6 confirms that when vegetation is absent bare channel ba r1 and bare channel ba r2 lx has the order of magnitude of h in addition it reveals that when y d 8 3 lx has the order of magnitude of s while when y d 0 lx has the order of magnitude of d therefore for this sparse rigid vegetation a heterogeneous and locally variable behavior of lx is verified it depends not only on the density of the canopy but also on the position relative to the stems for both runs ba r1 and ba r2 in the longitudinal plane y d 8 3 where in line stems are absent fig 1 turbulent eddies tend to occupy all the available stem to stem distance and lx is scaled by s which on the contrary should occur when d s according to previous research in contrast for the longitudinal plane y d 0 ba r1 run where in line stems are present fig 1 turbulent eddies are in the stem wake and blocked by the same stems so that the canopy behaves as expected with lx scaled by d fig 6 displays the mean trends of ly assembled for all the investigated cases and illustrates that ly is increased by approximately one order of magnitude by the presence of the stems the mean trends of lz are also shown in the same figure where the presence of the stems induces a reduction of about one order of magnitude specifically in the ba r1 case for y d 0 for the ba r1 run and y d 8 3 the vertical profiles of the dispersion coefficients kxx kyy and kzz computed with eq 12 and using α 0 9 are plotted in fig 7 normalized by uad the coefficients kxx and kyy display trends resembling those of the corresponding turbulent lengths in fact in the longitudinal direction the dispersion coefficients are reduced by the presence of vegetation while they increase in the transversal direction referring to kzz the two vertical profiles of the unobstructed flow and of the vegetated flow longitudinally averaged show analogous trends the global view of the dimensionless dispersion coefficients is shown in fig 8 where all the mean trends are assembled for a meaningful assessment the above described trends are confirmed specifically the values of kxx for the ba r1 run and y d 0 are around two order of magnitudes lower than in the case of the bare channel and one order of magnitude lower than in the cases y d 8 3 of runs ba r1 and ba r2 the transversal dispersion coefficients kyy increase of one order of magnitude when vegetation is present for both cases ba r1 and ba r2 the vertical dispersion coefficients are much smaller than the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients furthermore they are smaller in the obstructed cases especially in the layers closer to the bottom and the surface fig 9 displays for the ba r1 run and y d 8 3 the advective transport of k by the time averaged flow in the longitudinal transversal and vertical direction normalized by ua 3 the advection towards the transversal and vertical directions is quite nil for both cases of obstructed and unobstructed flows as shown by the average trends on the contrary the longitudinal advection in the vegetated flows is greater than that of the same flows without vegetation thus proving that in the vegetated runs the increase of the k values prevails on the reduction of the time averaged velocity in the product uk the global trend of fig 10 confirms this observation furtherly the same figure highlights that the increase of the longitudinal advection is mainly evident in the ba r2 run where red is greater than in the run ba r1 4 2 results of pa f data set fig 11 a shows the horizontal distribution of the resultant horizontal velocity u t u 2 v 2 at z h 0 42 along a stretch of the vegetated bed run pa f in this figure the formation of alternating zones of high low values of flow velocity can be seen fig 11 b shows the vertical profiles of the averaged longitudinal u velocity normalized by ua for different x d positions x d 133 3 i e at a distance of 40 cm from the initial section x 0 x d 266 6 i e at a distance of 80 cm from the initial section x 0 x d 400 0 i e at a distance of 120 cm from the initial section x 0 the corresponding averaged profile red line is compared with the vertical profile green line obtained at position x d 666 6 i e at section distant 200 cm from the initial section without vegetation on the bed unlike in the case where there is an absence of vegetation in the presence of vegetation the velocity profile shows the typical s shape in fact the presence of dense vegetation generates a region of shear and a profile with an inflection point near the top of the canopy see also nepf 2012a 2012b carollo et al 2005 termini 2015 2016a fig 12 shows the vertical profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy normalized by the square of the mean flow velocity u a 2 estimated at different locations along the channel axis in this figure the profiles of the spatial average of turbulent kinetic energy and of the turbulent kinetic energy estimated at the position x d 700 0 i e at section distant 210 cm from the initial section without vegetation on the bed both normalized by the square of the mean flow velocity u a 2 are also reported this figure shows that in presence of vegetation the value of the turbulent kinetic energy increases inside the vegetated layer it reaches a peak value at a relative water depth approximately equal to z h kv h 0 24 and it decreases towards the free surface thus according to nepf and vivoni 2000 k u a 2 increases in the shear region at the position x d 700 0 without vegetation on the bed the turbulent kinetic energy shows a decreasing trend from the bed towards the free surface as observed in the case of unobstructed flow for the ba r data set in the absence of vegetation k u a 2 assumes values greater than those obtained in the upstream positions with vegetation on the bed this could be due to the fact that the presence of dense vegetation offers additional resistance determining flow velocity always less than that over conditions without vegetation bare bed see also nepf 1999 2012a fig 13 shows the integral turbulent lengths normalized by d along the directions x y z estimated for the pa f run in this case the order of magnitude of the integral scale lx remains almost invariant i e o d even if a reduction is observed in the obstructed case similar behavior is also noted in the vertical and transversal directions for the integral scales ly and lz this is consistent with results obtained by tanino and nepf 2008 in random cylinder arrays with ϕ 0 01 0 35 it is noteworthy that in the case of the dense canopy the behavior for the turbulent length scales is nearly isotropic the vertical profiles of the dispersion coefficients kxx kyy and kzz normalized by uad are plotted in fig 14 in this case all the dispersion coefficients kxx kyy kyy assume in presence of vegetation values lower than those obtained in absence of vegetation this is particularly evident in the longitudinal direction the advective transport of k by the time averaged flow normalized by ua 3 is displayed in fig 15 when vegetation is present the spatially averaged transport in the transversal and vertical directions is around zero while it assumes positive values in the unobstructed flow in the longitudinal direction the spatially averaged advective transport in presence of vegetation is reduced with respect to the unobstructed case in both cases the spatially averaged advective transport shows an increasing trend from the bed towards the free surface increasing in the shear region and reaching a maximum value at z h 0 4 then it decreases again 5 discussion a reasonable analysis of the two examined data sets which are characterized by very different canopies rigid emergent and flexible submerged respectively can be carried out only if we take in due count that i the value of red characterizing the pa f data set is about 5 times greater than the corresponding one of the ba r data set ii the vegetation density a characterizing the pa f data set is about 50 times greater than the corresponding one of the ba r data set therefore in this research the role played by both stem reynolds number and canopy density in the mechanism of dispersion and transport was examined in depth being not entirely understood in fact white and nepf 2003 suggested that longitudinal dispersion due to vortex trapping may change with density at the same time vortex trapping is also heavily influenced by terms dependent on red which remains the same between densities sonnenwald et al 2017 deduced that transverse dispersion data does not suggest a dependency on solid volume fraction whereas there is some indication of an inverse trend between longitudinal dispersion and solid volume fraction guo et al 2014 in their numerical model for periodic arrays of cylinders showed that longitudinal and transverse dispersion increased with decreasing solid volume fraction in a diamond array of vegetation to examine how our experimental results are affected by red and vegetation density we firstly analyzed the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy k in the unobstructed case for both pa f and ba r data sets a decreasing trend is noted from the bottom where turbulence is high because of the bed roughness towards the surface the vertical gradient of k is greater for the pa f than for the ba r observations on the contrary when vegetation is present the behavior in the two data sets is different in fact the low density of the rigid vegetation ba r allows the flow to move inside the patch and the obstructive mechanism increases the turbulent kinetic energy compared to the non vegetated flow fig 4 as also noted in the experiments by maji et al 2016 on the contrary in the pa f data set fig 12 the presence of the vegetation reduces the turbulent kinetic energy with respect to the non vegetated flow because the densely distributed flexible stems act as a blockage inducing an increased drag and a reduction of the mean flow u this is consistent with results obtained by nepf 1999 2012a 2012b by comparing flow velocity and kinetic energy profiles for different densities of canopy including the bare bed condition it is also worth noting that in the ba r experiments the observations are sensitive to the relative position of the measuring point with respect to the stems the analysis of the integral length scales leads to the following deductions as previously mentioned the unobstructed flow of the ba r case shows values of lx of order of o h while in the obstructed flow lx assumes order o d or o s depending on the measuring position relatively to the stems fig 6 this result is novel as compared with previous studies nepf 1997 1999 shivpure et al 2016 namely in the wake region it is o d while between stems it is o s it is worth noting that vortex trapping and stem scale secondary wake dispersion are primarily responsible of longitudinal dispersion in emergent vegetation white and nepf 2003 in vortex trapping particles are entrained temporarily in the eddies formed behind stems while in secondary wake dispersion particles travel between areas of lower velocity behind stems and higher velocity between stems our result on lx proves the presence of this differential longitudinal advection for the vegetated case even the reduction of lz is noted while lx and lz values reduce values of the transversal ly increase thus expecting turbulent eddies flattened in the longitudinal and vertical direction but transversally stretched with respect to the unobstructed flow this behavior reveals the anisotropy of turbulence spreading in the case of sparse vegetation this conclusion is noteworthy since the spatial average technique generally used in literature prevents any 3d analysis in the pa f experiment the lx ly and lz are always reduced in the obstructed flow with order of magnitudes comparable to d fig 13 therefore in the dense canopy turbulence is characterized by isotropy this result further demonstrates that dense vegetation intercepts and blocks the turbulent eddies independently on the direction especially due to the overlapping of stem wakes on the contrary rigid and sparse vegetation allows a transversal spreading of turbulent patterns thus making the transversal direction a favorite path for turbulent eddies the dispersion coefficients of the ba r data set show vertical trends like those of the integral length scales figs 7 and 8 the reduction of the dispersion coefficients in the longitudinal direction due to vegetation is confirmed namely this reduction is one order of magnitude greater for the position y d 0 with respect to the position y d 8 3 thus proving the influence of the relative position of the stems on the measurement points further considering eq 12 used for the computation of kjj coefficients it should be noted that in the vegetated case the reduction of lx prevails on the increase of k thus providing reduced kxx values on the contrary the transversal dispersion coefficients kyy increase of one order of magnitude in the vegetated flow this increase is more evident for run ba r2 than for run ba r1 thus showing that red is a key parameter in this transversal turbulent process the vertical dispersion is negligible if compared to the longitudinal and transversal ones the examined dispersion mechanism is consistent with the sparse location and the pattern of the rigid canopy frontally impeding the development of the turbulent eddies but allowing their development transversally on both sides the transversal dispersion is even greater when the red number is greater the anisotropy of turbulence is proved again as well as the presence of secondary currents which advect turbulence spanwisely confirming also results by nezu and onitsuka 2001 the longitudinal advective transport of k in the ba r experiment was expected to be lower in the vegetated flow than in the unobstructed one on the contrary it results greater for the vegetated case figs 9 and 10 this could be explained considering that in the vegetated flow two competing effects are present i e reduced velocity and increased turbulence nepf 2012a 2012b these opposing tendencies are responsible for an initial increasing of turbulence due to the presence of sparse stems as in the ba r case fig 4 but eventually turbulence decreases when the vegetation density increases further as in the pa f case fig 12 in fact the behavior within the flexible stems of the pa data set shows turbulent eddies smaller in size fig 13 with a consequent reduction of the dispersion coefficients along all three directions fig 14 the flexible and dense system behaves as a filter which determines a reduction of the turbulent flow features and prevents high rates of the advective transport of k fig 15 this is reliable with previous results in literature see as an example nepf 2012a 2012b demonstrating that at stem scale the length scale of the developing vortices is set by the stem diameter and this length scale partially controls the characteristic eddy size which develops within and between the vegetated elements termini 2016b 2017 therefore consistently with eqs 4 and 9 applying the analogy between the transport of tke and the transport of a solute tracer it can be highlighted that the transport of a scalar in a canopy is heterogeneous and spatially variable and is strictly governed by the density of the canopy in fact for high values of vegetation density the transport and dispersion of a tracer is strongly inhibited along all the three directions in the case of sparse vegetation a transversal path is permitted to turbulent eddies depending on both canopy density and stem reynolds number while the advective longitudinal transport depends on the relative prevalence of channel velocity or turbulence it could be argued that even suspended sediments could experience an analogous mechanism of spreading 6 concluding remarks experiments with vegetated channels were executed in the case of both flexible submerged and rigid emergent canopies specifically the process of transport and dispersion of tracers was investigated once noted that it resembles the transport and dispersion of turbulent kinetic energy k the principal findings are summarized below in presence of vegetation for both canopy configurations a reduction of the mean longitudinal velocity is experienced on the contrary vegetation differently affects the two configurations referring to k the sparse and rigid vegetation of the ba r runs induces an increasing of turbulent kinetic energy while in the pa f data set the dense and flexible stems reduce k acting as a filter with reference to the integral length scales in the sparse canopy ba r the longitudinal turbulent scale lx of the unobstructed channel is of o h while it is reduced by the presence of the stems and scaled by d or s according to the measuring position relatively to the stems namely in the wake region it is o d while between stems it is o s this heterogenous behavior locally variable and dependent on the position consistent with vortex trapping and wake dispersion is a novel outcome with reference to previous researches the vertical length scale lz is reduced while the transversal length scale ly is increased by the presence of the stems thus expecting turbulent eddies flattened in the longitudinal and vertical direction but transversally stretched compared to the unobstructed flow this behavior reveals the anisotropy of turbulence spreading in the case of sparse vegetation in the dense canopy pa f the lx ly and lz turbulent scales are always reduced in presence of vegetation with order of magnitudes even smaller than d as an interesting result in the dense canopy turbulence is characterized by isotropy the trends for the dispersion coefficients follow those of the turbulent scales in fact in presence of vegetation they are reduced along the three directions in the pa f data set while in the ba r data set a reduction is noted only for the longitudinal and vertical ones the transversal dispersion coefficients increase with the stem reynolds number the analysis of the experimental results highlights that the density of the canopy is the key parameter in the advective processes in fact the transport of k and therefore of a possible solute is strictly dependent on the density of the canopy only for high values of vegetation density the transport and dispersion of a tracer is obstructed along all directions in the case of sparse vegetation turbulent eddies and tracer transport have a favorite transversal path regulated by both canopy density and stem reynolds number in the longitudinal direction the advective transport depends on the relative prevalence of channel velocity or turbulence 
775,vegetation in channels strongly affects flow structure and turbulence with consequences on the hydrological storage of nutrients and chemical tracers the shelter of stream biota as well as the trapping or transport of sediments at the same time all these phenomena are inevitably subjected to alteration of hydrological conditions in fluvial systems due to climate change the present study intends to provide a thorough investigation into the processes of transport and dispersion induced by flow turbulence within the vegetation structure specifically velocity measurements in vegetated channels were intensively conducted and analyzed in the case of both flexible submerged and rigid emergent canopies the experiments aimed to i highlight the differences in the hydrodynamic structures induced by different plant types and configurations ii study the spatially varying dispersive properties and turbulent behavior of the current attributable to different plant density submergence and stiffness further the spatial variability of velocity and turbulence distributions was taken into due consideration the experimental results showed how longitudinal and transversal hydrodynamics and transport differ depending on vegetation configuration and stem properties keywords rigid vegetation flexible vegetation turbulent length dispersion advective transport 1 introduction river vegetation has historically been acknowledged from a hydraulic perspective as a source of flow resistance by increasing bottom roughness decreasing near bed turbulent stress and reducing conveyance capacity gurnell 2014 nepf 2012a 2012b nevertheless the reduced velocity and transport within the vegetation shelters biota promotes the trapping of sediments as well as the storage and retention of nutrients chemical tracers and microbes inside the canopy also allowing flood control costanza et al 1997 kemp et al 2000 marois et al 2015 only recently vegetation has been considered as an integral part of a river system its pivotal role in regulating ecological services and protecting from flood drought risks has received remarkable attention nepf 2012a pollen and simon 2005 considering that the alteration of hydrological conditions is strictly sensitive to climate change mean and turbulent flows advection and dispersion are perturbed by the canopy ben meftah et al 2014 ghisalberti and nepf 2004 ikeda and kanazawa 1996 raupach and thom 1981 at the same time varying water loads and flow characteristics affect the hydraulic behavior and resisting force of plants in a community depending on their shape stiffness submergence permeability porosity phenologic stage growth maturity decay periods the residence time transport and fate of contaminants nutrients dissolved oxygen and other scalars along with the deposition of sediment grains can be accurately envisaged depending on our ability to understand the mechanism of exchange between the free stream and the vegetated region such a transfer mechanism is critical to the overall dispersion and seems primarily controlled by the canopy density and geometry ghisalberti and nepf 2005 nepf 2012b nepf et al 2007 oldham and sturman 2001 poggi et al 2009 schultz et al 1995 to optimize the ecosystem functions and define adequate sediment management a better knowledge of the impact of the changing conditions on suspended sediment mechanisms should be attempted namely a mutual feedback exerts between water flows vegetation and sediments so that the first fundamental step to recognize and manage the impact of climate change on riverine systems is to deduce the interaction between vegetation and river hydrodynamics the interplay between flow and vegetation creates feedbacks to sediment deposition liu and nepf 2016 based on flow velocity and stem generated turbulence the deposition of fine sediment and organic material could benefit from the flow velocity reduction between the plants whilst local soil erosion could diminish due to the reduction of the bed shear stress crosato and saleh 2011 righetti 2008 righetti and armanini 2002 in any case when the main flow is diverted towards unobstructed areas enhanced velocities laterally adjacent to the patch are produced so that a transversal sharp transition region at the interface between the obstructed and unobstructed domains is formed a transverse shear occurs generating large scale horizontal vortices centered around the edge of the vegetated area ben meftah and mossa 2016 ben meftah et al 2014 lima and izumi 2014 white and nepf 2007a 2007b which might cause localized erosion liu and nepf 2016 the effects of vegetation on the dispersion process have been experimentally investigated for both the submerged and emergent cases but usually the cross section spatial averaging of non uniform advection and diffusion results have been applied nepf and vivoni 2000 nepf et al 1997 perucca et al 2009 in this way the variation of the transversal diffusion and advection cannot be examined experiments by nepf et al 1997 within an array of emergent cylindrical rods using a continuous injection technique showed that when plants are present the vertical diffusivity and the diminished vertical shear reduced the shear flow dispersion the production of turbulence within a stand of emergent vegetation is dominated by the stem wakes rather than by the bottom boundary shear as in open channel flows nepf et al 1997 a relation between water depth and turbulence structure was highlighted by nepf and vivoni 2000 who pointed out that the generation of wake turbulence is strongly associated with the relative water depth analyses of velocity spectra and turbulent kinetic energy profiles showed that in natural river vegetation naden et al 2006 and in model canopies ricardo et al 2014 zong and nepf 2012 stem scale turbulence is absent at low stem reynolds number red and arises at red 200 nepf and vivoni 2000 tanino and nepf 2008 with red equal to the product of flow mean velocity and stem diameter rated by kinematic viscosity in the case of rigid vegetation tanino and nepf 2008 proposed a model for the mean turbulence intensity and the lateral dispersion coefficient due to the spatially heterogeneous velocity field as a function of cylinder distribution and density their study proved that only turbulent eddies with mixing length scale greater than stem diameter contribute significantly to net lateral dispersion shucksmith et al 2010 showed that in emergent conditions the mixing process dominant factor is the degree of reduction in spatial variation of velocity over the channel cross section the effects of submerged vegetation on the longitudinal dispersion coefficient were investigated by ghisalberti and nepf 2006 who proposed a two zone model to identify three contributing processes large scale shear dispersion above the canopy inefficient exchange between the canopy and the overflow and stem scale dispersion within the canopy later shucksmith et al 2011 utilized an empirical data set of longitudinal mixing measurements to evaluate the performance of both existing and newly proposed models for mixing in submerged vegetated open channel flow they highlighted that the rate of mixing in such systems is dependent on the relative size of the flow layers the difference in average velocity and the rate of the vertical mass transfer furthermore the physical structure of individual plants and the canopy morphology alter the velocity field across several scales ben meftah et al 2014 ben meftah et al 2015 nepf 2012a 2012b tanino and nepf 2008 ranging from individual branches and blades on a single plant to a community of plants in a meadow or patch flow structure at different scales is relevant to different processes as an example the retenepfntion and release of organic matter mineral sediments seeds and pollen from a meadow or patch depend on the flow structure at the meadow or patch scale mossa and de serio 2016 mossa et al 2017 literature shows that with emergent vegetation the turbulent length scales are set by the stem diameter and spacing see among others ben meftah and mossa 2013 2012b nepf 2012a tanino and nepf 2008 termini 2016a shucksmith et al 2010 proved that in the presence of a relatively uniform distribution of plant blockage over the width and depth mixing is dominated by stem scale processes in the case of dense submerged vegetation the drag discontinuity at the top of vegetation generates a shear layer with canopy scale vortices controlling the exchanges of mass and momentum between the canopy and the overflow nepf 2012a termini 2015 furthermore the turbulent transport occurs inside the upper part of the vegetated layer despite turbulent unobstructed flows i e river and sea currents jets have been extensively studied see among others ben meftah et al 2017 cuthbertson et al 2006 de serio and mossa 2014 2015 mossa 2004 flows through regions with vegetation still deserve an in depth examination in fact from the brief notes above described it is evident that the knowledge of the engineering role played by vegetation in regulating eco services and river management is crucial even if challenging according to gregory et al 1991 lotsari et al 2015 sandercock and hooke 2011 modelling should play an important role in reducing uncertainty associated with channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions strategies for quantifying solute transport in vegetated rivers consist of lumped models ghisalberti and nepf 2005 upscaled models marion et al 2008 and numerical solutions of the advection dispersion equation rubol et al 2016 however the most relevant issue to both simulations and predictions is modelling calibration and validation for this reason since it is hard to monitor in situ sediment water interactions due to required timescales laboratory experiments are needed to investigate transport patterns and dynamics for different vegetation scenarios laboratory experiments in flumes provide the opportunity i to evaluate the impact of different hydrodynamic regimes on different plant types and configurations in controlled conditions ii to assess and estimate the action played by streamwise patterns of vegetation on the processes of transport and dispersion of turbulence and tracers in the three directions the purpose of the present study is to analyze these two aspects specifically considering the 3d spatial variability of the flow canopy interaction a simple analogy can be obtained relating the solute transport of the vegetated river with its sediment transport in any case the above mentioned analogy involves the knowledge of key parameters governing the process such as grain size or settling velocity thus it goes beyond the analysis of the present research experiments were carried out in two different laboratory facilities and two different types of surrogate vegetation were used the structure of the vegetation was simplified and attention was focused on the effect of its main parameters i e vegetation stiffness density and size on the processes of turbulence transport and dispersion to this aim plant elements having the same characteristic dimension but a different stiffness were considered and the experimental runs were conducted for different plant submergences and plane distributions firstly a sparse rigid and emergent canopy was studied in two different hydrodynamic configurations after this a dense flexible and submerged canopy was investigated the present paper is structured in the following way in the next section a theoretical background is provided to point out the principal variables involved in the process of turbulence and solute transport in section 3 the experimental work is illustrated while results from the two canopies are analyzed in section 4 and finally discussed in section 5 2 theoretical approach 2 1 main variables involved a canopy consists of a distribution of plant elements in the present paper both rigid cylinders of uniform diameter d and submerged canopy of blade width d were considered thus according to ghisalberti and nepf 2009 it is reasonable to define d as the characteristic element scale within the canopy other key parameters characterizing the canopy are the solid volume fraction ϕ i e the volume within the canopy occupied by solid elements which is the complement of the canopy porosity η 1 ϕ and the frontal area per unit length of the canopy a nd where n is the number of elements per unit planar area in the case of a periodic square array of cylinders the value of a is equal to 1 s2 being s the axis to axis distance of the cylinders within the array the flow is spatially heterogeneous at the scale of the individual elements and often unsteady in time generally in the case of obstructed flows the double averaging method is used to remove the temporal and element scale spatial heterogeneity of the current finnigan 1985 raupach and shaw 1982 in other words the instantaneous equations of the vegetated current are first averaged over a time longer than the time scale of turbulence or instabilities in the flow and then averaged over an infinitesimally thin area that spans many cylinders including only the area occupied by the fluid in the present study only the time averaging procedure indicated by the overbar sign is used to not miss information on the typical spatial variations in the longitudinal and transversal sections for the sake of simplicity the ambient current is considered uniform 2 2 solute transport and contribution from turbulence hereafter we consider a rectangular canopy located in a fluid of depth h the canopy length is parallel to the mean flow directions with u v and w the streamwise transverse and vertical velocity components respectively the x axis is parallel to the mean flow and sits along the centerline of the channel and array the y axis is at the leading edge of the canopy and is perpendicular to the mean flow direction the profile of the current velocity upstream of the canopy is assumed uniform over the water depth the transport of a tracer c species concentration is described by the following expression 1 c t v c d 0 c where t is time c x t is the solute concentration v x t u v w v1 v2 v3 is the fluid velocity d 0 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and x x y z x1 x2 x3 neglecting the molecular diffusion that is small in a turbulent flow and time averaging eq 1 over a time interval much longer than the time scales of turbulent fluctuations we have the time averaged concentration equation 2 c t u j c x j u j c x j where the overbar denotes the temporal average and the prime symbol denotes the temporal fluctuations so that 3 c x t c x c x t u x t u x u x t v x t v x v x t w x t w x w x t eq 2 shows that the concentration mass flux is due to the convection by the time averaged flow also named mean flow u c v c and w c and transport by turbulent velocity fluctuations u c v c and w c eq 2 can be rewritten as follows 4 c t u j c x j k j j 2 c x j 2 in fact following ting and kirby 1995 1996 in direct analogy to turbulent momentum transport also turbulent mass concentration transport is assumed to be related to the gradient of the transported quantity in this way kjj are the coefficients for net dispersion which parameterize u j c i e the turbulent diffusion furthermore the terms u j c like the molecular diffusion are expected to be fickian if the spatial scale of the contributing mechanisms is smaller than the scale over which the mean concentration gradient varies the mechanisms associated with the terms u j c have characteristic scales of the stem diameter d and axis to axis distance s differently from tanino and nepf 2008 who averaged eq 1 both in time and in space in our present case the flow is three dimensional and therefore the equations are only time averaged this means that the present study focuses on the turbulent diffusion whereas the mechanical dispersion is the consequence of the time averaged spatial fluctuations tanino and nepf 2008 in the analysis of the flow dispersion interaction the turbulent kinetic energy tke is important in determining the turbulent dispersion coefficient and thus the mass transport the turbulent dispersion coefficient may be written as the product of a length scale and a velocity scale a physical meaningful velocity scale is k where k is the turbulent kinetic energy i e 5 k k 1 2 u i u i k 1 2 u i u i therefore the determination of the time and spatial variations of turbulent kinetic energy is of great importance in the evaluation of the dispersion process for high reynolds numbers the equation of the turbulent kinetic energy is 6 k t local derivative u j k x j advection x j 1 ρ u j p pressure diffusion u j k turbulent transport 1 2 u i u j u i x j u j x i production 1 2 ν u i x j u j x i 2 dissipation as shown by nepf 1999 it reasonable to assume that the production term is of order of the dissipation term our experimental data and previous literature findings nepf 1999 nepf and vivoni 2000 enabled us to confirm this assumption namely considering the production of tke as the sum of wake and bed shear production terms nepf 1999 noted that in the emergent case the bed shear production is negligible over almost all the flow depth apart from the zone very close to the bed consequently tke dissipation and wake production balance over almost all the flow depth apart from the zone close to the bottom in the submerged case the shear at the top of vegetation could provide an important source of turbulence nevertheless for shallow depth ratios and especially inside the vegetation nepf and vivoni 2000 proved that the wake production is of order of the turbulence dissipation furthermore to obtain the diffusive transport terms in turbulence modeling turbulent diffusion is often assumed proportional to the gradient of k rodi 1984 i e 7 1 ρ u j p u j k d k k x j with the turbulent diffusion coefficient dk 8 d k ν t σ k where νt is the eddy viscosity and σk is an empirical diffusion constant therefore being energy dissipation and production of the same order of magnitude the transport equation for k becomes 9 k t u j k x j d k 2 k x j 2 where following the eddy diffusivity concept nepf 1999 ting and kirby 1995 the turbulent diffusion coefficient is assumed as 10 d k l k with l the integral length scale associated with turbulent eddies eq 9 is formally analogous to eq 4 and therefore assuming that the prandtl number is o 1 the analysis of the terms of eq 9 can be used for eq 4 consequently it seems interesting to investigate the relations between u v w and k in fact the analogy between eqs 4 and 9 suggests that the cross correlation between the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy and the u v and w velocity components is related to the time averaged solute concentration c transport by the mean flow u c v c and w c this approach was also used by ting and kirby 1994 who stated that the suspended sediment concentration shows that the mass flux along the flow direction is due to convection by mean flow and transport by turbulent velocity fluctuations while the tendency of sediment to settle out is counteracted by the action of turbulent fluctuations in their study they proved that if it is assumed that turbulent velocity fluctuations are responsible for keeping sediment in suspension and the mean flow transports the sediment then suspended sediment transport resembles turbulence transport in the present study sediments were not directly investigated and consequently some key parameters like grain size or settling velocity were not available to examine thoroughly the analogy between the transport of tke and the sediment transport in any case the analogy between the transport of tke and the transport of a scalar concentration by means of the mean flow is reliable and is taken into consideration referring to both eqs 4 and 9 the integral length scale l present in eq 10 can be evaluated by the power spectrum or by multiplying the integral time scale tu by the local time averaged velocity u i x where tu is estimated by the autocorrelation function of the turbulent velocity fluctuations i e 11 l i u i x t u u i x 0 τ 0 u i x t u i x t τ u i 2 x d τ with τ the time lag with respect to t and τ0 the value of τ at the first zero crossing the integral length scale of turbulence l depends strongly on the presence of cylinders in unobstructed flow l increases with the scale of the diffusion patch until the largest length scale is reached that is the length scale defined by the flow domain okubo 1971 emergent canopies impose structure on both the mean and turbulent flow over the entire water column in flows with emergent vegetation the canopy dissipates eddies with scales greater than the stem scale of s and d while contributing additional turbulent energy at these stem scales thus the dominant turbulent length scale within a canopy is shifted downward from analogous condition without vegetation particularly in a channel with a regular array of cylinders the integral length scale of the turbulence is set by the smaller of the stem diameter d or the distance between the stems s regardless of the water depth taylor 1935 tanino and nepf 2008 in other words for d s turbulence is generated within stem wakes if the red is larger than 120 so that l d on the contrary for d s turbulence is generated within the pore channels so that l s these two depicted regimes in presence of cylinders are not exhaustive since for low solid volume fractions ad less than 0 01 the integral length scale of the turbulence should have an intermediate value between those previously mentioned i e l o min d s h for further details see for example nepf et al 1997 and lopez and garcia 1998 analogously to eq 10 tanino and nepf 2008 assumed that the net dispersion coefficients could be assumed equal to 12 k j j α k l j where the scale factor α could generally differ for horizontal and vertical diffusion following nepf 1999 it is reasonable to assume the horizontal dispersion coefficient value in the range 0 1 3 methods and materials literature nepf 2012a shows that aquatic plants exhibit a wide range of geometry and distribution marsh grasses are relatively sparse with stem diameters d 0 1 1 cm ϕ 0 1 1 and a 1 7 m 1 mangroves are among the densest canopies with ϕ as high as 45 mean trunk diameters of 4 9 cm and a up to 20 m 1 seagrasses have a 1 100 m 1 and ϕ 1 10 emergent plants tend to have rounded stems for higher stiffness and submerged grasses tend to have a blade geometry in which the width 0 3 1 cm is larger than the thickness 0 1 cm in which case d is the blade width based on the above information two flow velocity datasets have been used in this work the first one herein indicated as ba r data set was collected with the bed covered by rigid emerged vegetated stems the second one herein indicated as pa f data set was collected with flexible and submerged vegetation on the bed the manifest diversity of the two vegetated systems is justified by the aim to identify the key parameters which drive their different behaviors and find possible analogies in the hydrodynamic and dispersion processes the vegetation elements were characterized by the same characteristic dimension d 3 1 setup and instrumentation for the rigid vegetated flume ba r data set experimental runs were carried out in a smooth horizontal rectangular channel in the department of civil environmental land building engineering and chemistry of the polytechnic university of bari italy the channel was 25 0 m long 0 40 m wide and 0 50 m deep with lateral walls and bottom surface in plexiglas as shown in fig 1 a stable recirculating flow was guaranteed in the channel for details please refer to ben meftah and mossa 2013 and ben meftah et al 2015 the vegetation array was constructed of vertical rigid circular steel cylinders with threaded lateral surfaces and thus considered as rough cylinders the cylinder diameter was d 0 003 m the cylinder extremities were inserted into a plywood plaque 3 0 m long 0 02 m thick and a width equal to those of the channels which in turn was fixed along the channel bottoms forming the experimental area the plywood plaque was extended 3 m both upstream and downstream of the array of cylinders experimental area and was tapered to the channel bottom to minimize flow disturbance fig 1 cylinders were arranged regularly and spaced longitudinally and transversally with the same axis to axis distance s 0 05 m so that the cylinder density n was 4 cylinders dm2 while the vegetation density per meter was a 1 2 m 1 and the solid volume fraction was ϕ 0 28 therefore following nepf 2012a this vegetation can be considered sparse a cartesian coordinate system x y z was adopted in the centre of the array with x y and z coordinates denoting the longitudinal transversal and vertical directions respectively because water was forced to move around the cylinders the flow within the canopy was turbulent and highly heterogeneous at the scale of the individual stem therefore the instantaneous three dimensional flow velocity components through different longitudinal cross and horizontal planes were accurately measured 1cmx1cm grid resolution using a down looking three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vectrino system by nortek the adv was used with a velocity range equal to 0 30 m s a velocity accuracy of 1 a sampling rate of 100 hz and a sampling volume of vertical extend of 9 mm the acquired data were filtered based on tukey s method ben meftah et al 2015 and bad samples signal to noise ratio snr 15 db and correlation coefficient 70 were removed measurements were carried out placing the adv between two consecutive rigid stems two different runs were analysed with different flow depths and mean channel velocities named ba r1 and ba r2 the initial experimental conditions and parameters of the runs are shown in table 1 herein b is the channel width and fa ua gh 0 5 is the inlet flow froude number with ua q bh the mean channel velocity g the gravity acceleration and q the flow rate the element reynolds number red was calculated based on d and on the time averaged velocity also averaged in the transversal plane 3 2 setup and instrumentation for the flexible vegetated flume pa f data set the data used for such a comparison were collected in a straight laboratory channel constructed at the hydraulic laboratory of dicam department of university of palermo italy details of the experimental apparatus can be found in previous works termini 2013 2016a termini and sammartano 2012 thus only information important for the following analysis is reported in this section the rectangular flume was 11 2 m long and 0 4 m wide see fig 2 the longitudinal bed slope was equal to 0 4 and the channel reach 1 60 m long downstream of the initial section x0 see fig 2 was covered by real herbaceous flexible vegetation festuca arundinacea the vegetation stems had a blade geometry with width d 0 003 m the blade width was obtained as average value of 15 measures in 10 samples of unit area dm2 the experimental run was conducted with water discharge q 35l s the vegetation height hv that is the height before producing submergence of vegetation was about equal to 7 8 cm and the bent vegetation height kv was about equal to 2 6 cm the stems concentration was equal to 190 stems dm2 at which corresponds a value of the fractional plant area equal to ϕ 13 5 and a 57m 1 so that this canopy can be considered dense nepf 2012a 2012b the element reynolds number was red 2466 during this run the instantaneous longitudinal u t transversal v t and vertical w t velocity components were measured by using the dop 2000 profiler by signal processing s a three probes of emitting frequency of 8 mhz were used the dop2000 allowed the measurement of the instantaneous flow velocity profile along the direction of each probe details of the measurement conditions can be found in termini 2013 2016a 2016b 4 results the two experiments are described separately examining the distributions of the time averaged horizontal velocity turbulent kinetic energy integral length scales and diffusivity coefficients further the advective transport of the turbulent kinetic energy due to the mean flow is also investigated for the sake of simplicity from now on the time averaged longitudinal transversal and vertical velocity components u v and w will be also referred to as u v and w respectively 4 1 results of ba r data set for this data set in run ba r1values assessed along the longitudinal planes y 2 5 cm i e y d 8 3 and y 0 i e y d 0 are available in run ba r2 values assessed along the longitudinal planes y 2 5 cm i e y d 8 3 are available as an example fig 3 a shows in the case of run ba r1 the typical cylinder effects on the flow velocity distribution in the horizontal plane computed as u t u 2 v 2 at the intermediate depth z h 0 45 for further details please refer to ben meftah and mossa 2013 ben meftah et al 2014 2015 because of the adv technical limitations measurements were not assessed in the uppermost layer with a thickness of 7 cm a typical trend is observed in the mapped flow with the expected behavior of the velocity showing maxima values in the intermediate position between two consecutive cylinders where the flow converges also the flow diverges from each cylinder inducing the typical wake fig 3 b displays for the ba r1 run the vertical profiles of the time averaged longitudinal u velocity normalized by ua and plotted for different x d positions along the longitudinal section at y d 8 3 the x positions are all located 0 03 m downstream of a cylinder therefore in the region of higher velocity as previously mentioned the 3d flow is sensitive to the investigated position relative to the stems in fact observing fig 3 b we note that the vertical trends of u normalized by ua are different depending on the relative measuring position x d with respect to the stems in any case to allow a straightforward data comparison the longitudinal average of the vertical profiles was also considered and plotted on the same graph red line this longitudinally averaged profile of u ua was obtained by averaging the data of the different x d positions at the same z h as expected reduced values of the u ua profile are noted in comparison with those of the bare channel i e unobstructed flow superimposed in fig 3 b green line analogous profiles are shown for the ba r2 run and y d 8 3 in fig 3 c where a flattened longitudinally averaged profile of u ua is also displayed for the vegetated case in comparison with the unobstructed channel case fig 4 a and 4 b plots the vertical profiles of the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy normalized by ua 2 for y d 8 3 of cases ba r1 and ba r2 respectively also in these graphs the green and red lines are shown still referring to the unobstructed flow and to the longitudinally averaged profile of the vegetated flow in presence of vegetation increased turbulent kinetic energy values k at all depths and at all x d positions are evident if compared to the non vegetated flow thus proving the increased turbulent effect induced by the rigid stems on the flow moreover in the unobstructed flow greater values of k are noted near the bed as expected especially for the ba r1 run fig 4 a with a decreasing trend towards the surface for the vegetated flow near the surface few higher values of normalized k of run ba r1 are noted attributable to unavoidable local instabilities for the successive key parameters the analysis is structured in the subsequent way firstly the ba r1 run is described referring to all values measured at each x d position along the longitudinal section y d 8 3 in this way the local variability of the parameters is evident successively to have a global view the longitudinally averaged vertical profiles mean trends of the vegetated case y d 0 of the ba r1 run and y d 8 3 of ba r2 run were also added in the graphs the vertical trends of both ba r1 and ba r2 unobstructed cases were also overlaid in this way the grouped trends allow a thorough understanding of the dispersion process the analysis of fig 5 shows the integral turbulent lengths normalized by d along the three directions i e lx ly and lz calculated by means of eq 11 referring to all points investigated in ba r1 run in the longitudinal plane y d 8 3 as previously written in the case of the unobstructed channel the integral length scale of turbulence l is of order of the channel flow depth h instead the presence of the array its density and arrangement of the plants modify the structure of the turbulent flow righetti 2008 in fact it is worth noting that for the bare channel flow the values of lx are of the same order of magnitude of the channel height i e o 10 1 consistently with okubo 1971 nepf 1999 the presence of the vegetation induces a reduction of lx which is characterized by a lower order of magnitude in comparison with the unobstructed case i e o 10 2 and comparable with the canopy pore s on the contrary in the transversal direction the length ly increases when vegetation is present in comparison with the non vegetated case even if the order of magnitude of ly is o 10 4 for both unobstructed and obstructed cases the turbulent length lz in the vertical direction is reduced in the obstructed flow in comparison with the unobstructed case keeping the same order of magnitude o 10 4 the behavior observed in fig 5 highlights that the turbulent eddies are affected by the symmetrical and equally spaced rigid stems thus becoming flattened in the longitudinal and vertical directions while they stretch in the transversal one for lx ly and lz fig 6 collects the vertical profiles of the unobstructed flow of ba r1 and ba r2 as well as the longitudinally averaged vertical profiles mean trends of ba r1 for y d 0 and y d 8 3 and of ba r2 for y d 8 3 three different logarithmic abscissa axes are inserted to identify if the turbulent length scale is scaled by d s or h considering that h is different for ba r1 and ba r2 runs the reference value h 0 3 m was used namely the analysis of lx fig 6 is interesting and marks the novelty of the present research in fact as previously written in the present case of sparse vegetation with ad o 0 01 it was expected that the integral length scale of turbulence was of o d consistently with nepf et al 1997 and lopez and garcia 1998 fig 6 confirms that when vegetation is absent bare channel ba r1 and bare channel ba r2 lx has the order of magnitude of h in addition it reveals that when y d 8 3 lx has the order of magnitude of s while when y d 0 lx has the order of magnitude of d therefore for this sparse rigid vegetation a heterogeneous and locally variable behavior of lx is verified it depends not only on the density of the canopy but also on the position relative to the stems for both runs ba r1 and ba r2 in the longitudinal plane y d 8 3 where in line stems are absent fig 1 turbulent eddies tend to occupy all the available stem to stem distance and lx is scaled by s which on the contrary should occur when d s according to previous research in contrast for the longitudinal plane y d 0 ba r1 run where in line stems are present fig 1 turbulent eddies are in the stem wake and blocked by the same stems so that the canopy behaves as expected with lx scaled by d fig 6 displays the mean trends of ly assembled for all the investigated cases and illustrates that ly is increased by approximately one order of magnitude by the presence of the stems the mean trends of lz are also shown in the same figure where the presence of the stems induces a reduction of about one order of magnitude specifically in the ba r1 case for y d 0 for the ba r1 run and y d 8 3 the vertical profiles of the dispersion coefficients kxx kyy and kzz computed with eq 12 and using α 0 9 are plotted in fig 7 normalized by uad the coefficients kxx and kyy display trends resembling those of the corresponding turbulent lengths in fact in the longitudinal direction the dispersion coefficients are reduced by the presence of vegetation while they increase in the transversal direction referring to kzz the two vertical profiles of the unobstructed flow and of the vegetated flow longitudinally averaged show analogous trends the global view of the dimensionless dispersion coefficients is shown in fig 8 where all the mean trends are assembled for a meaningful assessment the above described trends are confirmed specifically the values of kxx for the ba r1 run and y d 0 are around two order of magnitudes lower than in the case of the bare channel and one order of magnitude lower than in the cases y d 8 3 of runs ba r1 and ba r2 the transversal dispersion coefficients kyy increase of one order of magnitude when vegetation is present for both cases ba r1 and ba r2 the vertical dispersion coefficients are much smaller than the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients furthermore they are smaller in the obstructed cases especially in the layers closer to the bottom and the surface fig 9 displays for the ba r1 run and y d 8 3 the advective transport of k by the time averaged flow in the longitudinal transversal and vertical direction normalized by ua 3 the advection towards the transversal and vertical directions is quite nil for both cases of obstructed and unobstructed flows as shown by the average trends on the contrary the longitudinal advection in the vegetated flows is greater than that of the same flows without vegetation thus proving that in the vegetated runs the increase of the k values prevails on the reduction of the time averaged velocity in the product uk the global trend of fig 10 confirms this observation furtherly the same figure highlights that the increase of the longitudinal advection is mainly evident in the ba r2 run where red is greater than in the run ba r1 4 2 results of pa f data set fig 11 a shows the horizontal distribution of the resultant horizontal velocity u t u 2 v 2 at z h 0 42 along a stretch of the vegetated bed run pa f in this figure the formation of alternating zones of high low values of flow velocity can be seen fig 11 b shows the vertical profiles of the averaged longitudinal u velocity normalized by ua for different x d positions x d 133 3 i e at a distance of 40 cm from the initial section x 0 x d 266 6 i e at a distance of 80 cm from the initial section x 0 x d 400 0 i e at a distance of 120 cm from the initial section x 0 the corresponding averaged profile red line is compared with the vertical profile green line obtained at position x d 666 6 i e at section distant 200 cm from the initial section without vegetation on the bed unlike in the case where there is an absence of vegetation in the presence of vegetation the velocity profile shows the typical s shape in fact the presence of dense vegetation generates a region of shear and a profile with an inflection point near the top of the canopy see also nepf 2012a 2012b carollo et al 2005 termini 2015 2016a fig 12 shows the vertical profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy normalized by the square of the mean flow velocity u a 2 estimated at different locations along the channel axis in this figure the profiles of the spatial average of turbulent kinetic energy and of the turbulent kinetic energy estimated at the position x d 700 0 i e at section distant 210 cm from the initial section without vegetation on the bed both normalized by the square of the mean flow velocity u a 2 are also reported this figure shows that in presence of vegetation the value of the turbulent kinetic energy increases inside the vegetated layer it reaches a peak value at a relative water depth approximately equal to z h kv h 0 24 and it decreases towards the free surface thus according to nepf and vivoni 2000 k u a 2 increases in the shear region at the position x d 700 0 without vegetation on the bed the turbulent kinetic energy shows a decreasing trend from the bed towards the free surface as observed in the case of unobstructed flow for the ba r data set in the absence of vegetation k u a 2 assumes values greater than those obtained in the upstream positions with vegetation on the bed this could be due to the fact that the presence of dense vegetation offers additional resistance determining flow velocity always less than that over conditions without vegetation bare bed see also nepf 1999 2012a fig 13 shows the integral turbulent lengths normalized by d along the directions x y z estimated for the pa f run in this case the order of magnitude of the integral scale lx remains almost invariant i e o d even if a reduction is observed in the obstructed case similar behavior is also noted in the vertical and transversal directions for the integral scales ly and lz this is consistent with results obtained by tanino and nepf 2008 in random cylinder arrays with ϕ 0 01 0 35 it is noteworthy that in the case of the dense canopy the behavior for the turbulent length scales is nearly isotropic the vertical profiles of the dispersion coefficients kxx kyy and kzz normalized by uad are plotted in fig 14 in this case all the dispersion coefficients kxx kyy kyy assume in presence of vegetation values lower than those obtained in absence of vegetation this is particularly evident in the longitudinal direction the advective transport of k by the time averaged flow normalized by ua 3 is displayed in fig 15 when vegetation is present the spatially averaged transport in the transversal and vertical directions is around zero while it assumes positive values in the unobstructed flow in the longitudinal direction the spatially averaged advective transport in presence of vegetation is reduced with respect to the unobstructed case in both cases the spatially averaged advective transport shows an increasing trend from the bed towards the free surface increasing in the shear region and reaching a maximum value at z h 0 4 then it decreases again 5 discussion a reasonable analysis of the two examined data sets which are characterized by very different canopies rigid emergent and flexible submerged respectively can be carried out only if we take in due count that i the value of red characterizing the pa f data set is about 5 times greater than the corresponding one of the ba r data set ii the vegetation density a characterizing the pa f data set is about 50 times greater than the corresponding one of the ba r data set therefore in this research the role played by both stem reynolds number and canopy density in the mechanism of dispersion and transport was examined in depth being not entirely understood in fact white and nepf 2003 suggested that longitudinal dispersion due to vortex trapping may change with density at the same time vortex trapping is also heavily influenced by terms dependent on red which remains the same between densities sonnenwald et al 2017 deduced that transverse dispersion data does not suggest a dependency on solid volume fraction whereas there is some indication of an inverse trend between longitudinal dispersion and solid volume fraction guo et al 2014 in their numerical model for periodic arrays of cylinders showed that longitudinal and transverse dispersion increased with decreasing solid volume fraction in a diamond array of vegetation to examine how our experimental results are affected by red and vegetation density we firstly analyzed the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy k in the unobstructed case for both pa f and ba r data sets a decreasing trend is noted from the bottom where turbulence is high because of the bed roughness towards the surface the vertical gradient of k is greater for the pa f than for the ba r observations on the contrary when vegetation is present the behavior in the two data sets is different in fact the low density of the rigid vegetation ba r allows the flow to move inside the patch and the obstructive mechanism increases the turbulent kinetic energy compared to the non vegetated flow fig 4 as also noted in the experiments by maji et al 2016 on the contrary in the pa f data set fig 12 the presence of the vegetation reduces the turbulent kinetic energy with respect to the non vegetated flow because the densely distributed flexible stems act as a blockage inducing an increased drag and a reduction of the mean flow u this is consistent with results obtained by nepf 1999 2012a 2012b by comparing flow velocity and kinetic energy profiles for different densities of canopy including the bare bed condition it is also worth noting that in the ba r experiments the observations are sensitive to the relative position of the measuring point with respect to the stems the analysis of the integral length scales leads to the following deductions as previously mentioned the unobstructed flow of the ba r case shows values of lx of order of o h while in the obstructed flow lx assumes order o d or o s depending on the measuring position relatively to the stems fig 6 this result is novel as compared with previous studies nepf 1997 1999 shivpure et al 2016 namely in the wake region it is o d while between stems it is o s it is worth noting that vortex trapping and stem scale secondary wake dispersion are primarily responsible of longitudinal dispersion in emergent vegetation white and nepf 2003 in vortex trapping particles are entrained temporarily in the eddies formed behind stems while in secondary wake dispersion particles travel between areas of lower velocity behind stems and higher velocity between stems our result on lx proves the presence of this differential longitudinal advection for the vegetated case even the reduction of lz is noted while lx and lz values reduce values of the transversal ly increase thus expecting turbulent eddies flattened in the longitudinal and vertical direction but transversally stretched with respect to the unobstructed flow this behavior reveals the anisotropy of turbulence spreading in the case of sparse vegetation this conclusion is noteworthy since the spatial average technique generally used in literature prevents any 3d analysis in the pa f experiment the lx ly and lz are always reduced in the obstructed flow with order of magnitudes comparable to d fig 13 therefore in the dense canopy turbulence is characterized by isotropy this result further demonstrates that dense vegetation intercepts and blocks the turbulent eddies independently on the direction especially due to the overlapping of stem wakes on the contrary rigid and sparse vegetation allows a transversal spreading of turbulent patterns thus making the transversal direction a favorite path for turbulent eddies the dispersion coefficients of the ba r data set show vertical trends like those of the integral length scales figs 7 and 8 the reduction of the dispersion coefficients in the longitudinal direction due to vegetation is confirmed namely this reduction is one order of magnitude greater for the position y d 0 with respect to the position y d 8 3 thus proving the influence of the relative position of the stems on the measurement points further considering eq 12 used for the computation of kjj coefficients it should be noted that in the vegetated case the reduction of lx prevails on the increase of k thus providing reduced kxx values on the contrary the transversal dispersion coefficients kyy increase of one order of magnitude in the vegetated flow this increase is more evident for run ba r2 than for run ba r1 thus showing that red is a key parameter in this transversal turbulent process the vertical dispersion is negligible if compared to the longitudinal and transversal ones the examined dispersion mechanism is consistent with the sparse location and the pattern of the rigid canopy frontally impeding the development of the turbulent eddies but allowing their development transversally on both sides the transversal dispersion is even greater when the red number is greater the anisotropy of turbulence is proved again as well as the presence of secondary currents which advect turbulence spanwisely confirming also results by nezu and onitsuka 2001 the longitudinal advective transport of k in the ba r experiment was expected to be lower in the vegetated flow than in the unobstructed one on the contrary it results greater for the vegetated case figs 9 and 10 this could be explained considering that in the vegetated flow two competing effects are present i e reduced velocity and increased turbulence nepf 2012a 2012b these opposing tendencies are responsible for an initial increasing of turbulence due to the presence of sparse stems as in the ba r case fig 4 but eventually turbulence decreases when the vegetation density increases further as in the pa f case fig 12 in fact the behavior within the flexible stems of the pa data set shows turbulent eddies smaller in size fig 13 with a consequent reduction of the dispersion coefficients along all three directions fig 14 the flexible and dense system behaves as a filter which determines a reduction of the turbulent flow features and prevents high rates of the advective transport of k fig 15 this is reliable with previous results in literature see as an example nepf 2012a 2012b demonstrating that at stem scale the length scale of the developing vortices is set by the stem diameter and this length scale partially controls the characteristic eddy size which develops within and between the vegetated elements termini 2016b 2017 therefore consistently with eqs 4 and 9 applying the analogy between the transport of tke and the transport of a solute tracer it can be highlighted that the transport of a scalar in a canopy is heterogeneous and spatially variable and is strictly governed by the density of the canopy in fact for high values of vegetation density the transport and dispersion of a tracer is strongly inhibited along all the three directions in the case of sparse vegetation a transversal path is permitted to turbulent eddies depending on both canopy density and stem reynolds number while the advective longitudinal transport depends on the relative prevalence of channel velocity or turbulence it could be argued that even suspended sediments could experience an analogous mechanism of spreading 6 concluding remarks experiments with vegetated channels were executed in the case of both flexible submerged and rigid emergent canopies specifically the process of transport and dispersion of tracers was investigated once noted that it resembles the transport and dispersion of turbulent kinetic energy k the principal findings are summarized below in presence of vegetation for both canopy configurations a reduction of the mean longitudinal velocity is experienced on the contrary vegetation differently affects the two configurations referring to k the sparse and rigid vegetation of the ba r runs induces an increasing of turbulent kinetic energy while in the pa f data set the dense and flexible stems reduce k acting as a filter with reference to the integral length scales in the sparse canopy ba r the longitudinal turbulent scale lx of the unobstructed channel is of o h while it is reduced by the presence of the stems and scaled by d or s according to the measuring position relatively to the stems namely in the wake region it is o d while between stems it is o s this heterogenous behavior locally variable and dependent on the position consistent with vortex trapping and wake dispersion is a novel outcome with reference to previous researches the vertical length scale lz is reduced while the transversal length scale ly is increased by the presence of the stems thus expecting turbulent eddies flattened in the longitudinal and vertical direction but transversally stretched compared to the unobstructed flow this behavior reveals the anisotropy of turbulence spreading in the case of sparse vegetation in the dense canopy pa f the lx ly and lz turbulent scales are always reduced in presence of vegetation with order of magnitudes even smaller than d as an interesting result in the dense canopy turbulence is characterized by isotropy the trends for the dispersion coefficients follow those of the turbulent scales in fact in presence of vegetation they are reduced along the three directions in the pa f data set while in the ba r data set a reduction is noted only for the longitudinal and vertical ones the transversal dispersion coefficients increase with the stem reynolds number the analysis of the experimental results highlights that the density of the canopy is the key parameter in the advective processes in fact the transport of k and therefore of a possible solute is strictly dependent on the density of the canopy only for high values of vegetation density the transport and dispersion of a tracer is obstructed along all directions in the case of sparse vegetation turbulent eddies and tracer transport have a favorite transversal path regulated by both canopy density and stem reynolds number in the longitudinal direction the advective transport depends on the relative prevalence of channel velocity or turbulence 
776,aquatic plants in rivers interact with flow and exert an important role in maintaining suitable habitat and ecological equilibrium understanding turbulence structure in the presence of vegetation is important with respect to environmental processes such as sediment transport and mixing of transported quantities literature indicates that mass and momentum exchanges in the presence of vegetation are strongly influenced by the sequence of coherent structures which form between vegetated and non vegetated zones in the present paper we investigate turbulence structure and coherent motion in high curvature channels with submerged vegetation the analysis is performed with the aid of detailed experimental data collected in a meandering flume of large amplitude results essentially highlight that the contribution of turbulence to lateral diffusion and to streamwise and vertical transport may be significantly influenced by the relative submergence h kv the dominant mechanism of exchange obtained for h kv 2 is different from that obtained for h kv 2 quadrant analysis has been also applied to investigate the occurrence of turbulent events and the associated exchange mechanism in particular at the apex section it has been found that ejection events dominate in the outer bank region and as literature indicates this could cause the suspension of sediment in the flow that is transported downstream in the central region the motion is especially characterized by high speed fluid directed towards the bed influencing the transport process significantly keywords rivers meanders vegetation transport processes experiments 1 introduction the presence of vegetation in rivers exerts an important ecological function and is very important to maintain suitable habitat plants respond to the effects associated with climate change in very different ways so that rapid climate change leads to remarkable changes in the distribution and behavior of plants contributing to modify the ecosystem equilibrium and habitats thus although vegetation can exert a protection function for shorelines and riverbanks among others green and short 2003 schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 it can also alter concentration of oxygen carbon and transport of nutrients as an example submerged vegetation can have a positive influence on water quality by removing nutrients and producing oxygen in stagnant regions nepf and ghisalberti 2008 thus the analysis of mass transport processes is important in the prediction of environmental quality barry et al 2013 understanding transport processes in the presence of aquatic vegetation is still a research problem katul et al 2011 the studies conducted so far in this field consider straight flumes with different types of vegetation on the bed nepf 1999 developed a physically based model to predict turbulence intensity and diffusion within rigid and emergent vegetation poggi et al 2004 investigated flow turbulence structure in the presence of dense rigid and submerged vegetation considering that in the submerged regime the discontinuity in drag at the top of vegetation determines an inflection point they suggested a phenomenological formulation of the mixing length which takes into account the role of canopy scale vortices tanino and nepf 2008 analyzed the lateral dispersion processes in the presence of a random array of a rigid and emergent vegetation for different values of vegetation density and verified that the turbulent length scale on which the lateral dispersion coefficient depends can be simply determined from the distribution and the geometry of vegetated elements nezu and sanjou 2008 investigated the turbulence characteristics and the evolution of coherent structures in a flume with rigid and submerged vegetation they highlighted that the development of sweep and or ejection events near the top of vegetation affects the exchange processes between vegetation and the overflow carollo et al 2007 2008 examined the profile of turbulence intensity in the presence of flexible submerged vegetation and investigated the mixing layer characteristics for different hydrodynamic conditions other studies conducted in the presence of flexible submerged vegetation among others ghisalberti and nepft 2006 okamoto and nezu 2009 investigated the organized coherent flow turbulent structure focusing the attention on the induced waving motion of the flexible vegetation blades termed as monami by ackerman and okubo 1993 all the aforementioned studies agree that aquatic vegetation controls the mean and turbulent flow structure and thus impacts the transport of sediment and contaminants see also nepf and vivoni 2000 nepf 2012 termini 2015a but how material is exchanged between vegetation and the overflow strongly depends on the relative depth of submergence defined as the ratio of flow depth h to the vegetation height kv in particular it has been verified that nepf and vivoni 2000 nepf 2012 in deeply submerged or unconfined vegetated flow i e for h kv 10 in analogy with terrestrial canopies raupach et al 1996 finnigan 2000 the flow within the vegetation is driven by the vertical turbulent transport of momentum with negligible contribution from the potential gradient on the contrary in emergent vegetated flow i e for h kv 1 the longitudinal transport is the principal mechanism of exchange between vegetation and the overflow with negligible contribution from the vertical turbulent transport of momentum the transition from the submerged to the emergent regimes was investigated by nepf and vivoni 2000 for values of the relative depth of submergence h kv variable in the range 1 0 2 75 they verified that in the transition regime both the vertical turbulent exchange and the longitudinal transport are important and thus two exchange zones respectively indicated as longitudinal zone inside the vegetation and vertical zone over the vegetation should be identified along the flow profile see also in folkard 2011 from the aforementioned it is clear that the presence of vegetation strongly affect diffusion and advection transport processes for this reason there is great interest in describing the evolution of turbulent structures and the associated transport processes in the presence of vegetation this information could be used to improve models for turbulent transport of mass and momentum at the canopy interface among others nepf et al 2013 costantinescu et al 2013 on the other hand it should be considered that straight channels are relatively rare in nature and most rivers exhibit regions of strong curvature which are characterized by more complex flow structure and erosion patterns than channels of low curvature see among others blanckaert 2010 termini 2015b along the curved reaches hydrodynamics are influenced not only by the bed deformation which determines asymmetrical cross sections but also by the curvature induced cross sectional flow which strongly contributes to redistribute the streamwise velocity dietrich and smith 1983 yalin 1992 whiting and dietrich 1991 blanckaert and graf 2001 termini 2015b in steep outside bends an additional complication is due to the presence of a counter rotating cell which forms at the upper corner of the outer bank keeping the core of maximum velocity at a certain distance from the bank rozovski 1957 bathurst et al 1979 blanckaert and de vriend 2004 termini 2015b although some authors as an example thorne and hey 1979 indicated that the outer bank cell can endanger the bank and bed stability recent researches blanckaert 2010 termini and piraino 2011 demonstrated that it protects the outer bank and bed from the action of the central region circulation cell as the ratio r b r local radius of curvature b channel width decreases the degree of nonlinearity of interactions between the cross stream flow and the streamwise momentum increases and modifies the sediment transport pattern costantinescu et al 2013 although in the last decades a considerable amount of research has been conducted in order to analyze how vegetation can influence migration dynamics of meandering bends see as an example among others perucca et al 2007 guneralp and rhoads 2011 these studies have not systematically explored flow vegetation interaction mechanisms thus there is much work needed to understand their relative importance and their role in the transport and exchange processes understanding the evolution of turbulent coherent motion would allow us to better analyze the flow dynamics in high curvature bends especially close to the outer bank that is particularly vulnerable to erosion and sediment movement sekely et al 2002 wilson et al 2008 based on the aforementioned the present work focuses on curved channel reaches which are characterized by a complex turbulent flow structure with intensive mass and momentum exchanges the goal of the present paper is to gain some insight into the turbulent structure and its implication in transport processes in high curvature vegetated channels attention is restricted to the case of flexible submerged vegetation this is motivated by the fact that most aquatic submerged plants in natural rivers and wetlands have great flexibility and move in response to the turbulent flow affecting diffusion and advection of substances see as an example in carpenter and lodge 1986 schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 nikora et al 2008 okamoto and nezu 2009 the analysis is conducted with the aid of experimental data collected in a large amplitude meandering channel this paper complements previous works conducted by termini s group in the same meandering flume and with the same flow discharge as that considered in the present work without vegetation and with vegetation on the bed the analyses conducted in the absence of vegetation essentially demonstrated that i as effect of the continuously changing curvature termini 2009 and of the bed deformation termini 2009 termini and piraino 2011 the core of high velocities shifts along the meandering bend from the inner bank to the outer bank and the curvature induced cross sectional flow exerts the major role in main flow and bed shear stress redistribution termini 2015b ii the curvature induced cross circulation motion is concentrated in the deepest part of the cross section and the turbulent activity at the channel s boundaries is strongly correlated with the evolution of both the main central region circulation cell and the counter rotating circulation cell forming near the free surface in the outer bank region termini and piraino 2011 iii the counter rotating cell initiates near the free surface at the bend entrance and it assumes its complete rotation sense at the apex section downstream termini and piraino 2011 iv the turbulent kinetic energy has a peak value at about the eye of the circulation cells v at the apex section the separation between the central region and the outer bank circulation cells occurs at a distance y y 0 15 0 20b with b channel width from the bank and the highest value of the downstream velocity is found at y y in the presence of vegetation termini 2016 2017 in contrast to what was observed in the absence of vegetation it was found that i the core of high velocities did not reach the outer bank along the bend termini 2017 ii the curvature induced central region cell was divided into small and thin circulation cells developing at the top of the vegetated layer see the sketch of fig 1 a and the outer bank counter rotating cell was weaker and wider than that obtained in the absence of vegetation iii especially in the central part of the cross section and near the bed of the outer bank region alternating regions of positive negative values of the downstream vorticity occur between the vegetated elements thus the presence of the vegetated elements alters the directionality of turbulent structures so that they develop within and between the vegetated elements termini 2016 in the analysis presented herein attention is devoted to turbulent structure coherent motion and associated exchange processes in the presence of vegetation specifically section 2 describes experimental data section 3 explains the theoretical bases of the examined processes and section 4 investigates turbulence structure the related exchange mechanisms and the formation of coherent structures at the apex section finally discussion and conclusion are reported in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental data the experimental data used in the present work were collected in a sine generated laboratory flume of large amplitude deflection angle at the inflection section θo 110 minimum radius of curvature at centreline rmin 0 97 m and constant width b 0 50 m constructed at dicam university of palermo italy see fig 1b according to the prevailing literature s experimental approach among others whiting and dietrich 1993 da silva et al 2006 termini 2009 termini and piraino 2011 following leopold and laigbein 1966 the sine generated function well approximates the shape of river meanders the flow width is assumed constant and a wide stream is defined as a stream having width to depth ratio greater than 10 among others nezu and rodi 1985 da silva et al 2006 the value of the control parameter r b accounting for high curvature effects blanckaert and de vriend 2004 blanckaert 2011 varies along the bend assuming the lowest value rmin b 1 94 at the apex section this value falls into the range of natural rivers with sharp curvature hickin 1977 thus the channel s configuration can be considered representative of natural sharp bends for details of the experimental setup and measurement procedures please refer to previous works see as an example in termini and piraino 2011 termini 2013 2016 this paper reports on experiments conducted with a deformed and fixed bed obtained at the end of a previous mobile bed run carried out as explained in termini 2016 covered with real herbaceous flexible vegetation festuca arundinacea and with flow discharge q 0 012 m3 s overall averaged water depth equal to ha 0 11 m and b ha 4 5 this value of flow discharge was the same as that used during previous experimental runs carried out without vegetation on the bed termini 2016 2017 literature also indicates similar measured values of flow discharge in laboratory flumes and in natural rivers see as an example in nikora et al 2008 blanckaert 2011 for the presented experiments the seeds of vegetation were sprayed on sample containers by hand uniformly the vegetation was left to grow undisturbed inside the sample containers and then the samples were inserted into the flume during the experimental runs the bent vegetation height kv was measured by using a decimal ruler fixed on the side walls at each measurement section see also in carollo et al 2005 after having verified that almost equal values of the bent vegetation height were obtained at the side walls an unique averaged value of kv was considered for the analysis finally the averaged bent vegetation height kv was equal to 2 6 cm the morphology of the vegetation stems was straplike with average blade width d equal to 3 10 3 m this morphology is typical of submerged seagrasses see as an example chandler et al 1996 nepf 2012 and can be also found along the sicilian rivers in agreement with previous works nepf and koch 1999 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nezu and sonjau 2008 in the present work the blade width d is assumed as the characteristic dimension of the vegetated element the fractional plant area ϕ was 14 this value of the fractional plant area can be found for seagrasses see luhar et al 2010 riegl and foster 2011 and is in agreement with values used both in laboratory channels carollo et al 2008 termini 2016 and in the field as an example dense submerged vegetation was found by taguas et al 2016 by nikora et al 2008 in mall stream in new zeland by miler et al 2014 in lowland rivers in this work the analysis is restricted to sections a c of fig 1b and we consider the streamwise coordinates x y and z respectively as the longitudinal transversal and vertical directions of a local reference system having origin at left bank and z positive upwards the instantaneous longitudinal transversal and vertical flow velocities respectively u t v t w t were simultaneously measured by using an acoustic doppler velocity profiler dop 2000 by signal processing s a accuracy of 0 09 cm s which consists of a probe that is simultaneously emitter and receiver of acoustic pulses the number of emitted profiles varied along the channel pulse repetition frequency variable in the range 5000 15 000 hz and the maximum number of emitted profiles was 800 during the acquisition the power spectrum was computed from the high passed filtered data so that the amplitude of the power spectrum at the origin was always zero the acquired data were filtered by using a moving average filter the acquisition parameters were chosen also on the basis of preliminary tests conducted in selected sections by comparing the acquired velocity profiles with those measured by using a 2d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the uncertainty in the experimental data was estimated during a preliminary study by comparing independent measurements and taking into account the different sources of errors such a study indicated as conservative estimates of uncertainty in the time averaged velocity components less than 5 for longitudinal velocity and less than 8 for transversal and vertical velocities the uncertainty in the turbulent fluctuation components was estimated as less than 8 for longitudinal component and less than 12 for transversal and vertical components to collect the data used in the present work three probes the first pointing in the vertical direction the second and third sloping at angle α 60 and pointing in the transversal direction and in the longitudinal direction respectively with emission frequency of 4 mhz which moved by the help of the three dimensional automatic position system see fig 1b were used along each profile the distance between the centre of adjacent sampling volumes was 0 75 mm the spacing of measured profiles in the transverse and vertical directions was 3 0 mm while the spacing of profiles measured by the probe in the longitudinal direction was 4 0 mm more details on measurement conditions and estimates of the velocity components can be found in termini 2013 2016 for simplicity of exposure only some peculiar measurement verticals which are indicative for the analysis have been reported in some of the following figures 3 theoretical considerations 3 1 momentum and transport equations in the presence of vegetation flow is forced to move around the vegetation elements so that the velocity field is spatially heterogeneous at the stem scale an appropriate approach to remove the spatial heterogeneity derives from the double averaging method of the navier stokes equations nikora et al 2001 poggi et al 2004 finnigan and shaw 2008 thus the instantaneous flow variables are decomposed into the time average and the deviation from the time average the time averaged quantity is determined by the sum of a spatial average and the deviation of this spatial average after having applied the double averaging method the momentum equations can be written in the following form among others poggi et al 2004 nezu and sonjau 2008 1a d v j d t g j p ρ x i τ j i x j f f v 1b τ j i v j v i v j v i ν v j x j 1c f f v p x i ν 2 v j x j x i where the overbar indicates the time average the symbol indicates the spatial average time average the single prime indicates the deviation from the time average and the double prime indicates the deviation of the spatial average t is time xj with x1 x x2 y x 3 z are the streamwise transversal and vertical directions vj with v1 u t v2 v t v3 w t are the instantaneous velocity components p is the pressure ρ is the water density ν is the kinematic viscosity g is the gravity force eq 1b defines the space averaged shear stress per unit mass which includes the spatial average of the classical reynolds stress first term on the right hand side of eq 1b the so called dispersive flux term representing the momentum flux associated with spatial correlations in the time averaged velocity field second term on the right hand side of eq 1b and the viscous stress third term on the right hand side of eq 1b which can be considered negligible compared to the turbulent stress eq 1c indicates the drag force per unit mass including the form drag term first term on the right hand side of eq 1c which is generally related to the flow velocity the drag coefficient cd and the local canopy density see as an example poggi et al 2004 finnigan and shaw 2008 nepf 2012 and the viscous drag second term on the right hand side of eq 1c which can be considered negligible compared with the vegetative drag nepf and vivoni 2000 as should be clear from the introduction the major part of studies conducted in this field consider straight and uniform flow so that the left hand side of eq 1a is reduced to zero and attention is especially focused on terms on the right hand side of the streamwise momentum equation by assuming the viscous term negligible from eq 1b the streamwise shear stress per unit mass is determined as 2 τ x z u t w t u t w t in the present paper restricting the attention to this expression we explore the relative importance of the terms on the right hand side at the apex section c the transport equation of a tracer c concentration of substances after having applied the temporal and spacing average method can be written as see as an example tanino and nepf 2008 nepf 2012 3 c t v j c x j x j v j c v j c j d m c x j the first term on the right hand side indicates the mass flux associated with the turbulent fluctuations and thus represents the turbulent diffusion the second term on the right hand side represents the dispersive flux associated with the time averaged spatial fluctuations the third term on the right hand side indicates the flux due to the molecular diffusion dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient which is negligible compared with the turbulent diffusion and the dispersive flux tanino and nepf 2008 nepf 2012 for time scales greater than the turbulent time scale rutherford 1994 and dimension of the averaging volume greater than the characteristic dimension of the vegetated element and of the stems spacing the first two terms on the right hand side of eq 3 are expected to be fickian thus the eq 3 can be rewritten in the following form tanino and nepf 2008 nepf 2012 4 c t v j c x j k j j 2 c x j 2 kjj is the coefficient for net dispersion along the jth direction which is proportional to the product of the velocity scale and the average turbulent length associated with mixing due to turbulent eddies in this paper attention is restricted to the lateral dispersion and thus to the coefficient kyy 4 results 4 1 istantaneous flow in order to investigate the turbulent behavior of flow the instantaneous streamwise u t vertical w t and transversal v t velocity fluctuations have been estimated and analyzed for each measurement point as an example fig 2 a visualizes the distributions of u t w t and v t at t 150 s for the examined sections according to termini and piraino 2011 see also in termini 2015b three regions i e the outer bank region for 0 y b 0 25 the central region for 0 25 y b 0 75 and the inner bank region for 0 75 y b 1 have been identified in fig 2a from this figure an alternating pattern of high speed and low speed fluid areas can be clearly seen which indicate the formation of the turbulence structures at the inflection section section a this is especially evident at the inner bank at the bend entrance section b such a behavior is also evident in the central part of the cross section and then at the apex section section c alternating high low speed fluid areas are especially evident in the central and in the outer bank regions in order to highlight the interference region between neighboring elements along the transversal direction y in fig 2b the contours of the streamwise turbulent component u t obtained only by considering the values measured close to the top of the vegetated layer i e at relative depth z h kv h in the outer half of section c have been also reported this figure shows a contour pattern almost symmetrical with respect to the transversal direction y this is consistent with results obtained by ben meftah et al 2006 around flexible vegetated elements characterized by a geometry similar to that of the elements used in the present work ben meftah et al 2006 related such a behavior to the movements of the branches which influence a relatively large horizontal area around the vegetated element furthermore it can be seen that high turbulent fluctuations are found on either side of the vegetation where the flow separates from it and the width of the interference region along y is comparable with the characteristic dimension of the vegetated element this pattern is consistent with recent studies conducted in straight vegetated bed channels see as an example nepf 1999 nepf et al 2013 and with previous results obtained by termini 2016 2017 which highlight that the vegetated elements generate vortices whose size is partially controlled by the width of the vegetated element 4 2 kinetic energy and contribution from turbulence to lateral dispersion in order to investigate turbulence structure within and above the vegetated layer it is important to analyze the turbulent kinetic energy budget fig 3 reports the contour maps of the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass k u t 2 v t 2 w t 2 2 normalized by u 2 2 with u q bha in the inflection and in the apex sections this figure shows alternating regions of high low values of turbulent kinetic energy with localized peak values at the top of vegetation in the inflection section a high values of kinetic energy occur especially in the inner bank region in the apex section section c high values of k occur especially in the central and in the outer bank regions as one approaches the separation between the main circulation cell and the outer bank counter rotating circulation cell i e at y y the turbulent kinetic energy decreases in value see also in termini 2016 thus fig 3 shows that the vertical trend of the turbulent kinetic energy varies along the cross section in the central part of the cross section the presence of vegetation determines alternating regions of high low values of turbulent kinetic energy with peaks at the top of vegetation this pattern of k is in agreement with that obtained by other researchers in straight vegetated bed channels among others nepf 1999 righetti 2008 but it differs from that observed by termini 2016 in the same meandering channel without vegetation on the bed as indicated by termini 2016 see also in termini and piraino 2011 in the absence of vegetation the turbulent kinetic energy assumes a peak value in the central region near the separation between the central and the outer bank circulation cells and close to the free surface in the outer bank region similar patterns of the turbulent kinetic energy were also observed by other researchers see as an example muto 1997 tamai and ikeda 1985 blanckaert and graf 2001 in the outside region of a bend and in the absence of vegetation as discussed in termini 2016 the different pattern of k observed in the presence and in the absence of vegetation could be related to the fact that while in the absence of vegetation a large curvature induced circulation cell is formed in the central region especially in the deepest part of the cross section in the presence of vegetation this large circulation cell is suppressed because the presence of vegetation determines regions of shear which produce vortices of size partially controlled by the width of the vegetated elements this is consistent with what was observed in straight vegetated bed channels see as an example petroff et al 2009 as consequence while in the absence of vegetation the large circulation cell redistributes the transverse momentum determining an increase of turbulent kinetic energy as the channel s curvature increases blanckaert 2010 in the presence of vegetation this effect is interrupted by the presence of the vegetated elements termini 2017 close to the outer bank as observed by termini 2016 2017 both in the absence and in the presence of vegetation a reverse circulation cell is discernable but in the presence of vegetation this circulation cell is weaker and includes a more extended fluid area than that observed in the absence of vegetation thus in the presence of vegetation close to the outer bank k assumes both a slight peak near the free surface as observed in the absence of vegetation and alternating peak values at the top of vegetation according to tanino and nepf 2008 the turbulent kinetic energy can be used to evaluate the contribution from turbulence to lateral dispersion and mass transport as it should be clear from section 3 the lateral dispersion coefficient kyy is expected to be proportional to the product of the velocity scale and the average turbulent length along y direction lty associated with mixing due to turbulent eddies literature on vegetated flows among others nepf 1999 nepf and vivoni 2000 tanino and nepf 2008 shows that a meaningful velocity scale is k and thus kyy can be estimated as 5 k y y k l t y where lty is set by the stem geometry in sparse arrays nepf 1999 and by the minimum between the stem geometry and the stem spacing in dense arrays raupach and shaw 1982 raupach et al 1991 tanino and nepf 2008 as an example in a cylinder array nepf 1999 suggested to assume lty equal to the cylinder diameter i e the characteristic element dimension when cylinder spacing is smaller than the water depth as indicated in the section 2 the vegetation used in the present work is straplike and in agreement with previous studies nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nepf 2012 the average element s blade width d is assumed as the characteristic element dimension this assumption has been also verified for the examined case by estimating lty through the power spectrum of the turbulent fluctuation component based on this and taking into account the pattern of fig 2b in the present work lty is set by the blade width d and it is assumed k y y k d thus the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient has been estimated as tanino and nepf 2008 6 k y y u d k u fig 4 shows the values of the ratio k u and of the transversal spatial average k u the spatial average was operated over four measurement locations in section c against the relative depth z kv with 0 z h h local water depth this section has been selected because based on previous results obtained by termini and piraino 2011 see also in termini 2015b in the absence of vegetation it is characterized by significant cross sectional flow motion furthermore for brevity only some characteristic profiles have been reported in fig 4 from this figure it can be seen that k u varies along the cross section in region 1 i e y 9 6 y see as an example profile p1 in fig 4 the term k u assumes slight peak values just below the free surface approximately at the eye of the counter rotating circulation cell see in termini and piraino 2011 and close to the top of the vegetated layer as a consequence the vertical profile of the transversal spatial average k u shows an almost uniform trend in depth with a slight peak value approximately at the top of the vegetated layer and just below the free surface in region 1 the relative submergence h kv assumes values greater or almost equal than 5 in region 2 for 9 6 y 32 see as an example profile p2 in fig 4 k u varies in value along the depth generally assuming low values inside the vegetation and higher values for z kv 1 as a consequence the spatial average k u has the lower values inside the vegetation and an increasing trend for increasing values of z kv until a maximum close to the top of the vegetated layer then as one approaches the free surface a high value of k u is maintained with a slightly decrease close to the free surface the observed trend suggests that in this region the lateral diffusion could play an important role in the central part of the water depth just over the top of vegetation it should be also noted that in the examined region the relative submergence h kv assumes values greater than 2 but less than 5 and that the aforementioned trend is more evident as h kv decreases i e especially for 15 9 y 32 see as an example profile p3 in fig 4 in region 3 that is for y 32 see as an example profile p4 in fig 4 the vertical profiles of k u show a different trend compared with that observed for y 32 so that the spatial average k u assumes the higher peak value inside the vegetation and a marked decreasing trend approaching the free surface in this region the relative submergence h kv assumes values less than 2 thus fig 4 shows that especially in the central part of the cross section k u peaks close to the top of the vegetation where the shear layer forms the vertical extent of the high values of k u increases as h kv increases this is consistent with results obtained by nepf and vivoni 2000 in a straight channel for values of submergence h kv variable inside the range 1 25 2 75 4 3 vertical and streamwise exchange the aforementioned result confirms that in the submerged regime the shear layer forming at the top of vegetation strongly affects the diffusion and advection processes as it should be clear from the introduction and the section 3 nepf and vivoni 2000 see also nepf 2012 investigated for a straight and uniform flow the relative importance of the vertical turbulent exchange and the streamwise transport as a result they established that in the transition regime both the vertical turbulent transport of momentum and the streamwise transport are important although the last one decreases as the relative submergence increases thus in this part of the work the relative importance of the vertical turbulent exchange and the streamwise transport is explored at the apex section c where the variability of the relative submergence is particularly evident to this aim the experimental data have been used to estimate the ratio between the turbulent stress and the pressure gradients above the vegetation from eq 2 it can be seen that τ xz includes both the term u t w t which represents the classical vertical momentum flux and the term u t w t which represents the dispersive stress accounting for the spatial heterogeneity in the time averaged velocity field previous studies conducted in straight channels suggest to assume the dispersive stress negligible compared to the reynolds turbulent stress especially in dense vegetation as an example poggi et al 2004 found that the dispersive term is less than 10 of the reynolds turbulent stress nezu and sonjau 2008 obtained values of the dispersive term within 5 of the square friction velocity in order to explore the entity of the dispersive stress at the apex section of the meandering channel the term u t w t has been determined for each measurement point table 1 reports the values of the normalized dispersive term u t w t u 2 u friction velocity along the characteristic profiles p1 p4 according to nezu and sonjau 2008 the friction velocity has been defined by the value of reynolds stress at the vegetation edge i e u 2 u t w t z k v from table 1 it can be seen that over the top of vegetation the dispersive stress assumes values less than 15 of u 2 inside the vegetation the dispersive stress has a peak and this peak assumes values less than around 25 of u 2 through the cross section with exception of some profiles in the region 3 h kv 2 where the peak assumes values of around 33 of u 2 the observed pattern of the dispersive term indicates that in contrast to what observed in straight channels poggi et al 2004 nezu and sanjou 2008 especially for h kv 2 the effect of the dispersive stress should be considered thus in order to evaluate the contribution of the dispersive stress and to investigate the relative importance of the vertical turbulent transport of momentum and the streamwise transport the ratio τ x z z g h x has been estimated at the apex section c by assuming both τ x z u w and τ x z u w u w see fig 5 the turbulent stress gradient has been estimated at the top of the vegetation layer see also in nepf and vivoni 2000 fig 5 shows that the magnitude of the examined driving forces varies as the relative submergence changes furthermore the contribution of the dispersive stress is especially evident in region 3 i e for h kv 2 in the central region for 2 h kv 5 the vertical turbulent transport of momentum prevails over the streamwise transport as the inner bank is approached for h kv 2 the vertical turbulent transport of momentum tends to decrease until that the streamwise transport becomes more important close to the outer bank where the outer bank cell develops the turbulent stress assumes low values and the aforementioned ratio decreases in value thus fig 5 suggests that in the examined section both forms of exchange between vegetation and the overflow should be considered in the central region the vertical turbulent transport of momentum is the dominant exchange mechanism but in the inner bank region the entity of the vertical turbulent transport of momentum decreases and that of the streamwise transport increases this is consistent with results obtained in a straight channel by nepf and vivoni 2000 4 4 higher order moments and vertical and streamwise turbulent diffusion the higher order moments of velocity fluctuations d u u t 3 and d w u t 2 w t are particularly interesting for the present analysis in fact these terms are related respectively to the streamwise and vertical turbulent diffusion the term d w u t 2 w t is related to the transport of turbulent kinetic energy and indicates the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction d u u t 3 can be thought as the streamwise flux of the turbulent kinetic energy component u t 2 raupach and shaw 1982 fig 6 a reports the vertical profiles of normalized terms d u n u t 3 u t 2 3 2 and d w n u t 2 w t u t w t 3 2 estimated at the apex section c for brevity only some characteristic profiles have been reported in fig 6a it has been observed that d u n and d w n have generally opposite peaks and these peaks are at the same relative depth furthermore the peak values of d u n are always larger than those of d w n indicating a streamwise momentum transport the higher peak values of d u n and of d w n occur especially just below the top of the vegetation this could indicate the existence of coherent vortices close to the vegetation in particular in region 1 for y 9 6 y d u n and d w n assume slight peak values along the depth with d u n positive and d w n negative inside vegetation see as an example the vertical profile at y 7 8 in fig 6a this suggests that vegetation could be a sink of turbulent motion in particular the fact that d u n is positive and d w n is negative indicates a high speed fluid movement towards the bed along the depth in region 2 for 9 6 y 32 d u n and d w n gradually change the sign near the top of vegetation so that especially for y 15 9 see as an example the vertical profile for y 16 8 in fig 6a d u n assumes high negative values and d w n assumes low positive values inside the vegetation above the vegetation d u n and d w n become positive and negative respectively and their values tend to increase until a maximum just below the free surface in accordance with nezu and sonjau 2008 the fact that d u n and d w n assume the higher values just below the vegetation is characteristic in canopy flows and indicates the existence of strong coherent turbulent activity in particular in the central part of the water depth and near the top of vegetation i e in the mixing layer d u n 0 and d w n 0 indicating a high speed fluid movement towards the bed in the lower layer d u n and d w n change the sign i e d u n 0 and d w n 0 indicating low speed fluid movement towards the free surface finally in region 3 for y 32 d u n and d w n assume alternating positive negative peak values along the entire profile see as an example the vertical profile at y 38 6 in fig 6a highlighting an intense turbulent coherent activity along the profile in particular in the central part of the water depth d u n is negative and d w n assumes small positive values close to the top of vegetation thus indicating a streamwise momentum transport and low speed movement towards the free surface after having verified that the transversal and the vertical fluctuation components have the same order of magnitude according to nezu and sanjou 2008 the turbulent diffusion of the turbulent kinetic energy along each profile can be synthetized through the approximation t d u t 2 w t 2 w t 3 thus in fig 6b the vertical profiles of td and of its transversal spatial average td estimated at section c have been also reported also in this case for brevity only some characteristic profiles have been reported in this figure it can be seen that for y 9 6 y see as an example the profile p1 in fig 6b the transversal spatial average td is negative and almost uniform in depth for 9 6 y 32 td increases in values just below the free surface inside the vegetation td assumes high values and gradually changes the sign see as an example the profile p2 in fig 6b so that for y 15 9 the spatial average td becomes positive inside the vegetation and negative over it see as an example the profile p3 in fig 6b this confirms that the turbulent activity is diffused both within the vegetation and over it this behavior is consistent with that obtained by nezu and sanjou 2008 in a straight channel for h kv ranging from 1 to 4 finally for y 32 the aforementioned behavior is less evident until that as one approaches the inner bank td assumes alternating positive negative values along the water depth see as an example the profile p4 in fig 6b in summary fig 6 shows that especially for 2 h kv 5 both high speed fluid motion towards the vegetation and low speed fluid movement from the vegetation towards the free surface occur such a behavior is more evident as h kv decreases this is consistent with the fact that td assumes positive values inside vegetation and becomes negative over the vegetation indicating that the turbulent energy near the vegetation is diffused both within the vegetation and in the upper layer this behavior is in agreement with that observed in straight channels with dense submerged vegetation see as an example nezu and sanjou 2008 4 5 quadrant analysis third order moments and in particular the vertical and streamwise turbulent diffusion terms are strictly related to ejection and sweep motions nezu and nakagawa 1993 thus the aforementioned results confirm the formation of turbulent coherent structures which develop along the considered section and control the exchange mechanisms within and above the vegetation in this section the occurrence of the turbulent events is qualitatively investigated through the quadrant decomposition of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations nezu and nakagawa 1993 thus the instantaneous plane u t w t has been divided into four quadrants i i ii iii iv so that the ith quadrant roughly represents a turbulent event i i u t 0 w t 0 outward interaction i ii u t 0 w t 0 ejection i iii u t 0 w t 0 inward interaction i iv u t 0 w t 0 sweep ejection events are associated to net upward momentum flux and are responsible for the maintaining into suspension of particles lu and willmart 1973 sweep events are associated to downward momentum flux and are relevant mechanisms for the entrainment of substances displays and dancey 2012 dey 2014 the contribution coming from each quadrant has been determined through the discriminating function ik the index k i ii iii iv indicates the quadrant in which the generic event falls which is equal to 1 if the couple u t w t falls in k th quadrant and equal to zero otherwise then the normalized occurrence frequency fk for the event types related to the different quadrants has been estimated as 7 f k t 0 t i k t 0 t i i t 0 t i ii t 0 t i iii t 0 t i iv where t is the measurement time length the analysis of the vertical profiles of the normalized occurrence frequency fk has generally shown that the higher values of frequency of occurrence are for events of ii and iv quadrants furthermore the frequency of occurrence of events of quadrants ii and or iv increases inside the vegetation fig 7 shows for brevity only some characteristic profiles of the normalized occurrence frequency fk determined in section c it can be observed that in region 1 for y 9 6 y see as an example the vertical profile at y 7 8 in fig 7 in the over vegetation layer sweep and ejections occur with comparable frequency close to the top of vegetation the frequency of occurrence of ejections slightly dominate over that of sweeps this means that upwards motion of low speed fluid occurs thus the turbulent momentum transport near the top of vegetation is affected by frequent upward motions with infrequent but stronger downward movements of high speed fluid from the upper layer this is consistent with results obtained by other authors in dense canopy yan et al 2017 in region 2 for 9 6 y 32 sweep events occur more frequently than ejections inside vegetation indicating downwards motion of high speed fluid over the top of the vegetated layer ejection events are more frequent than sweeps for y 15 9 for y 15 9 sweep events dominate over ejections along the major part of the water depth see as an example the vertical profile at y 16 8 in fig 7 in region 3 y 32 both ejection and sweep events occur alternatively along the water depth the frequency of occurrence of events of i and iii quadrants becomes comparable and often even higher than that of events of quadrants ii and iv see as an example the vertical profile at y 38 6 in fig 7 this indicates a strong interaction of the turbulent structures with the main flow 5 discussion results presented in the section 4 have substantially confirmed that in the presence of vegetation turbulent coherent structures generate and control the exchange mechanisms within and above the vegetated layer generally the higher values of frequency of occurrence have been found for ejection and sweep events however the performed analysis has demonstrated that the development of these turbulent structures is strongly influenced by the value of the relative submergence this is consistent with previous findings obtained by nezu and sanjou 2008 in a straight flume with submerged vegetation on the bed they highlighted that in contrast to terrestrial canopies which are characterized by infinitely large relative submergence aquatic canopy is characterized by finite values of the relative submergence and thus the development of coherent eddies may be influenced by h kv in a curved channel reach as that considered in the present work the relative submergence is extremely variable in particular in the examined meandering bend the variability of the relative submergence is particularly evident at the apex section where the transversal asymmetry of the bed is large because of the point bar development as one passes from the outer bank to the inner bank the relative submergence h kv varies from values greater than 5 to values lower than 2 close to the outer bank for y 9 6 y where h kv 5 and the counter rotating cell develops the transversal spatial average of the lateral dispersion coefficient and the turbulent diffusion assume low values almost uniform in depth this behavior could be related to the fact that the increase of roughness due to the presence of vegetation determines the formation of a counter rotating circulation cell weaker and wider than that observed in the absence of vegetation thus inhibiting the outward transversal momentum flux see also in termini 2016 as consequence it is expected that the protective effect of the outer bank cell forming in vegetated bed natural meanders could be significant in this part of the cross section ejection motion prevails over sweep motion especially close to the top of vegetation indicating dominant upwards movement of low speed fluid this also suggests a possible process of suspension of substances in the flow transported downstream in the central part of the cross section where 2 h kv 5 it has been observed that the lateral dispersion could be important just over the top of vegetation in fact the coefficient kyy assumes the lower values inside the vegetation and an increasing trend for z kv 1 until a maximum value close to the top of the vegetated layer this behavior becomes more evident as h kv decreases this could be due to the fact that inside the vegetation the flow is retarded by the drag of the plants and above the vegetated layer flow accelerates thus the region close to the top of the vegetated layer is the region of highest shear mixing layer region and the turbulent kinetic energy suddenly increase this is in agreement with literature findings obtained in straight channels see as an example poggi et al 2004 carollo et al 2008 furthermore in this region of the cross section the spatial average of the turbulent diffusion assumes the higher values inside the vegetation where both the diffusion in the vertical direction d w and the streamwise flux of the turbulent kinetic energy d u assume a peak value as literature shows see as an example nezu and sanjou 2008 ghisalberti and nepf 2008 this behavior is characteristic in vegetated flows furthermore d u and d w have always opposite sign which is different inside and above the vegetation this behavior indicates a strong coherent turbulent activity nezu and nakagawa 1993 from the quadrant analysis it has been seen that sweep events dominate over ejections in the mixing layer such behavior indicates that the motion is essentially characterized by high speed fluid directed towards the bed influencing transport processes significantly finally as one moves towards the inner bank where h kv 2 the vertical distribution of the lateral diffusion coefficient is very different from that obtained for h kv 2 in fact in this part of the cross section the lateral diffusion coefficient assumes a higher peak value near the top of vegetation and a marked decreasing trend approaching the free surface this is consistent with the fact that the lateral transfer is the dominant exchange mechanism inside vegetation neft and vivoni 2000 folkard 2011 on the other hand the relative magnitude of the turbulent vertical exchange and the streamwise transport varies as the relative submergence changes in particular in the examined section the turbulent vertical exchange is more significant than the streamwise transport for 2 h kv 5 as the inner bank is approached for h kv 2 the streamwise transport becomes more significant this is also consistent with results obtained by nepf and vivoni 2000 in a straight channel but in contrast to what was observed in straight channels especially for h kv 2 in the examined case the contribution of the dispersive stress is not always negligible and it should be considered in analyzing the exchange processes the transversal spatial average of the vertical and longitudinal turbulent diffusion td for h kv 2 assumes values lower than those obtained for h kv 2 and an alternating positive negative trend along the water depth the quadrant analysis indicates that in this part of the cross section ejection events generally dominate over sweep in the upper layer near the free surface near the top of vegetation the frequency of occurrence of sweep events is greater than that of ejections furthermore in this part of the cross section it has been seen that the frequency of events of i and iii quadrants becomes comparable and sometime even higher than that of events of ii and iv quadrants this is related to the fact that because of the low values of the relative submergence the turbulent structures tend to interact with the main flow on the basis of aforementioned it can be summarized that a different contribution from turbulence to the exchange mechanisms has been observed for h kv 2 and for h kv 2 this is also consistent with results obtained by termini 2015a see also in carollo et al 2008 in a straight channel analyzing the effect of stems concentration and relative submergence on the vertical velocity profile and mixing layer thickness she verified that the mixing layer thickness and thus the momentum thickness as defined by ghisalberti and nepf 2006 tends to increase as the relative submergence increases especially for values of h kv 2 the momentum thickness tends to increase linearly with the relative submergence the variation of the mixing layer thickness modifies the associated mechanism for the momentum transfer see also nikora 2010 nepft 2012 and the dominant momentum transfer mechanism between the bed and the above canopy layer this is also consistent with wu et al 1999 findings obtained also by moramarco and termini 2015 who highlighted the existence of a boundary zone of the relative submergence approximately for 1 7 h kv 2 in submerged vegetation depending on the vegetation species where the increase in drag effect does not correspond to an increase in the hydraulic radius for values of h kv lower to the inferior limit of such a boundary zone vegetation assumes a not submerged behavior this means that in the examined case the vegetation behavior obtained for values of h kv 2 is different from that observed in the rest of the cross section and the value of the relative submergence is near to the boundary condition wu et al 1999 see also in nepf and vivoni 2000 the obtained results are also consistent with those obtained by nepf and vivoni 2000 in the transition from emergent to submerged canopies 1 h kv 2 75 in particular they verified that in submerged vegetation the exchange dynamics could vary in relation to the thickness of the vertical exchange zone for h kv 2 it is reduced because the length of the shear turbulence is constrained by the water depth thus the obtained results indicate that in the submerged regime at the apex section of the meander bend the importance of the vertical turbulent exchange varies with the relative submergence similarly to what was observed in straight channels this could be related to the fact that the transversal flow pattern determined by the channel s curvature is interrupted by the presence of vegetation termini 2016 2017 6 conclusion the main results obtained in the present work can be synthetized as follows i the mass and momentum transport occurring between the vegetation and the flow over it is controlled by coherent turbulent motion of particular importance is that the contribution of coherent turbulence to exchange mechanisms may be significantly influenced by the relative submergence h kv ii for h kv 2 ejection and sweep events have frequency of occurrence much higher than that of events of quadrants i and iii in particular for 2 h kv 5 in the central part of the water depth sweep motion transporting high momentum fluid inside the vegetation prevails over ejection in the upper layer ejection motion transporting low momentum fluid from the vegetation towards the free surface occurs the turbulent energy near the vegetation layer is diffused both within the vegetation and towards the over vegetation layer the lateral dispersion could be important just over the top of vegetation while near the bed where the flow is retarded by the drag of the plants the lateral dispersion coefficient assumes the lower values this behavior becomes more evident as h kv decreases furthermore in this region the turbulent vertical exchange is more significant than the streamwise transport although the turbulent vertical effect decreases as h kv decreases close to the outer bank where h kv 5 and the counter rotating cell develops the lateral dispersion coefficient and the turbulent diffusion assume low values and are uniform in depth this could be related to the fact that as verified by termini 2017 because of the increase of roughness due to the presence of vegetation the counter rotating circulation cell inhibits the lateral transport this means that in natural meandering bends with vegetated bed the protective effect exerted by the outer bank cell could be more significant than that in the absence of vegetation furthermore while in the over vegetation layer the ejection and sweep events alternatively occur with comparable frequency close to the vegetation ejection events slightly prevail over sweep motion this suggests the possible suspension of substances in the flow transported downstream iii for h kv 2 in the inner bank region the lateral dispersion becomes important inside vegetation the turbulent vertical transport assumes values lower than those obtained for h kv 2 and becomes less important compared to the streamwise transport near the top of vegetation events of i and iii quadrants tend to happen with comparable and even higher close to the free surface frequency than that of events of ii and iv quadrants highlighting the interaction of the turbulent structures with the main flow iv in contrast to what was observed in straight channels poggi et al 2004 nezu and sanjou 2008 the contribution of the dispersive stress is not always negligible especially for h kv 2 thus a deeper understanding of dispersive stress contribution to the momentum equation for different hydrodynamic conditions and vegetation patterns needed in summary from the presented results it can be concluded that along the meandering bend the turbulent activity is influenced by the strong variability of the relative submergence h kv in particular a different contribution from turbulence to the exchange mechanism can be observed for h kv 2 and for h kv 2 this is similar to what was observed in straight channels nepf and vivoni 2000 in fact the high roughness due to in the presence of the vegetation interrupts the transversal flow pattern determined by the channel s curvature this determines an evident reduction of the lateral fluid transport towards the outer bank and a significant vertical turbulent transport between the vegetation and the overflow in the central part of the cross section thus the presence of vegetation alters the bend effects so that the flow assumes in some aspects a behavior similar to that observed in straight channels and improves the stability conditions at the outer bank it is expected that the observed behavior may be more important in natural bends where vegetation is present both on the bed and on the bank based on the obtained results it might be also expected that in the presence of vegetation the convective transport processes could be less important than those observed in the absence of vegetation among others blanckaert and graf 2001 termini and piraino 2011 however the quantitative analysis of the importance of turbulence induced processes compared to other flow processes is in progress and will be presented in a successive work it should be noted that this paper focused on a high amplitude meandering bend with dense vegetation on the bed despite this restriction it allows to gain of insight into the turbulent structure and exchange dynamics in high curvature channels with vegetated bed future research will be also addressed to extend the present analysis investigating turbulence contribution and the induced exchange processes for different vegetation patches along the bend 
776,aquatic plants in rivers interact with flow and exert an important role in maintaining suitable habitat and ecological equilibrium understanding turbulence structure in the presence of vegetation is important with respect to environmental processes such as sediment transport and mixing of transported quantities literature indicates that mass and momentum exchanges in the presence of vegetation are strongly influenced by the sequence of coherent structures which form between vegetated and non vegetated zones in the present paper we investigate turbulence structure and coherent motion in high curvature channels with submerged vegetation the analysis is performed with the aid of detailed experimental data collected in a meandering flume of large amplitude results essentially highlight that the contribution of turbulence to lateral diffusion and to streamwise and vertical transport may be significantly influenced by the relative submergence h kv the dominant mechanism of exchange obtained for h kv 2 is different from that obtained for h kv 2 quadrant analysis has been also applied to investigate the occurrence of turbulent events and the associated exchange mechanism in particular at the apex section it has been found that ejection events dominate in the outer bank region and as literature indicates this could cause the suspension of sediment in the flow that is transported downstream in the central region the motion is especially characterized by high speed fluid directed towards the bed influencing the transport process significantly keywords rivers meanders vegetation transport processes experiments 1 introduction the presence of vegetation in rivers exerts an important ecological function and is very important to maintain suitable habitat plants respond to the effects associated with climate change in very different ways so that rapid climate change leads to remarkable changes in the distribution and behavior of plants contributing to modify the ecosystem equilibrium and habitats thus although vegetation can exert a protection function for shorelines and riverbanks among others green and short 2003 schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 it can also alter concentration of oxygen carbon and transport of nutrients as an example submerged vegetation can have a positive influence on water quality by removing nutrients and producing oxygen in stagnant regions nepf and ghisalberti 2008 thus the analysis of mass transport processes is important in the prediction of environmental quality barry et al 2013 understanding transport processes in the presence of aquatic vegetation is still a research problem katul et al 2011 the studies conducted so far in this field consider straight flumes with different types of vegetation on the bed nepf 1999 developed a physically based model to predict turbulence intensity and diffusion within rigid and emergent vegetation poggi et al 2004 investigated flow turbulence structure in the presence of dense rigid and submerged vegetation considering that in the submerged regime the discontinuity in drag at the top of vegetation determines an inflection point they suggested a phenomenological formulation of the mixing length which takes into account the role of canopy scale vortices tanino and nepf 2008 analyzed the lateral dispersion processes in the presence of a random array of a rigid and emergent vegetation for different values of vegetation density and verified that the turbulent length scale on which the lateral dispersion coefficient depends can be simply determined from the distribution and the geometry of vegetated elements nezu and sanjou 2008 investigated the turbulence characteristics and the evolution of coherent structures in a flume with rigid and submerged vegetation they highlighted that the development of sweep and or ejection events near the top of vegetation affects the exchange processes between vegetation and the overflow carollo et al 2007 2008 examined the profile of turbulence intensity in the presence of flexible submerged vegetation and investigated the mixing layer characteristics for different hydrodynamic conditions other studies conducted in the presence of flexible submerged vegetation among others ghisalberti and nepft 2006 okamoto and nezu 2009 investigated the organized coherent flow turbulent structure focusing the attention on the induced waving motion of the flexible vegetation blades termed as monami by ackerman and okubo 1993 all the aforementioned studies agree that aquatic vegetation controls the mean and turbulent flow structure and thus impacts the transport of sediment and contaminants see also nepf and vivoni 2000 nepf 2012 termini 2015a but how material is exchanged between vegetation and the overflow strongly depends on the relative depth of submergence defined as the ratio of flow depth h to the vegetation height kv in particular it has been verified that nepf and vivoni 2000 nepf 2012 in deeply submerged or unconfined vegetated flow i e for h kv 10 in analogy with terrestrial canopies raupach et al 1996 finnigan 2000 the flow within the vegetation is driven by the vertical turbulent transport of momentum with negligible contribution from the potential gradient on the contrary in emergent vegetated flow i e for h kv 1 the longitudinal transport is the principal mechanism of exchange between vegetation and the overflow with negligible contribution from the vertical turbulent transport of momentum the transition from the submerged to the emergent regimes was investigated by nepf and vivoni 2000 for values of the relative depth of submergence h kv variable in the range 1 0 2 75 they verified that in the transition regime both the vertical turbulent exchange and the longitudinal transport are important and thus two exchange zones respectively indicated as longitudinal zone inside the vegetation and vertical zone over the vegetation should be identified along the flow profile see also in folkard 2011 from the aforementioned it is clear that the presence of vegetation strongly affect diffusion and advection transport processes for this reason there is great interest in describing the evolution of turbulent structures and the associated transport processes in the presence of vegetation this information could be used to improve models for turbulent transport of mass and momentum at the canopy interface among others nepf et al 2013 costantinescu et al 2013 on the other hand it should be considered that straight channels are relatively rare in nature and most rivers exhibit regions of strong curvature which are characterized by more complex flow structure and erosion patterns than channels of low curvature see among others blanckaert 2010 termini 2015b along the curved reaches hydrodynamics are influenced not only by the bed deformation which determines asymmetrical cross sections but also by the curvature induced cross sectional flow which strongly contributes to redistribute the streamwise velocity dietrich and smith 1983 yalin 1992 whiting and dietrich 1991 blanckaert and graf 2001 termini 2015b in steep outside bends an additional complication is due to the presence of a counter rotating cell which forms at the upper corner of the outer bank keeping the core of maximum velocity at a certain distance from the bank rozovski 1957 bathurst et al 1979 blanckaert and de vriend 2004 termini 2015b although some authors as an example thorne and hey 1979 indicated that the outer bank cell can endanger the bank and bed stability recent researches blanckaert 2010 termini and piraino 2011 demonstrated that it protects the outer bank and bed from the action of the central region circulation cell as the ratio r b r local radius of curvature b channel width decreases the degree of nonlinearity of interactions between the cross stream flow and the streamwise momentum increases and modifies the sediment transport pattern costantinescu et al 2013 although in the last decades a considerable amount of research has been conducted in order to analyze how vegetation can influence migration dynamics of meandering bends see as an example among others perucca et al 2007 guneralp and rhoads 2011 these studies have not systematically explored flow vegetation interaction mechanisms thus there is much work needed to understand their relative importance and their role in the transport and exchange processes understanding the evolution of turbulent coherent motion would allow us to better analyze the flow dynamics in high curvature bends especially close to the outer bank that is particularly vulnerable to erosion and sediment movement sekely et al 2002 wilson et al 2008 based on the aforementioned the present work focuses on curved channel reaches which are characterized by a complex turbulent flow structure with intensive mass and momentum exchanges the goal of the present paper is to gain some insight into the turbulent structure and its implication in transport processes in high curvature vegetated channels attention is restricted to the case of flexible submerged vegetation this is motivated by the fact that most aquatic submerged plants in natural rivers and wetlands have great flexibility and move in response to the turbulent flow affecting diffusion and advection of substances see as an example in carpenter and lodge 1986 schnauder and sukhodolov 2012 nikora et al 2008 okamoto and nezu 2009 the analysis is conducted with the aid of experimental data collected in a large amplitude meandering channel this paper complements previous works conducted by termini s group in the same meandering flume and with the same flow discharge as that considered in the present work without vegetation and with vegetation on the bed the analyses conducted in the absence of vegetation essentially demonstrated that i as effect of the continuously changing curvature termini 2009 and of the bed deformation termini 2009 termini and piraino 2011 the core of high velocities shifts along the meandering bend from the inner bank to the outer bank and the curvature induced cross sectional flow exerts the major role in main flow and bed shear stress redistribution termini 2015b ii the curvature induced cross circulation motion is concentrated in the deepest part of the cross section and the turbulent activity at the channel s boundaries is strongly correlated with the evolution of both the main central region circulation cell and the counter rotating circulation cell forming near the free surface in the outer bank region termini and piraino 2011 iii the counter rotating cell initiates near the free surface at the bend entrance and it assumes its complete rotation sense at the apex section downstream termini and piraino 2011 iv the turbulent kinetic energy has a peak value at about the eye of the circulation cells v at the apex section the separation between the central region and the outer bank circulation cells occurs at a distance y y 0 15 0 20b with b channel width from the bank and the highest value of the downstream velocity is found at y y in the presence of vegetation termini 2016 2017 in contrast to what was observed in the absence of vegetation it was found that i the core of high velocities did not reach the outer bank along the bend termini 2017 ii the curvature induced central region cell was divided into small and thin circulation cells developing at the top of the vegetated layer see the sketch of fig 1 a and the outer bank counter rotating cell was weaker and wider than that obtained in the absence of vegetation iii especially in the central part of the cross section and near the bed of the outer bank region alternating regions of positive negative values of the downstream vorticity occur between the vegetated elements thus the presence of the vegetated elements alters the directionality of turbulent structures so that they develop within and between the vegetated elements termini 2016 in the analysis presented herein attention is devoted to turbulent structure coherent motion and associated exchange processes in the presence of vegetation specifically section 2 describes experimental data section 3 explains the theoretical bases of the examined processes and section 4 investigates turbulence structure the related exchange mechanisms and the formation of coherent structures at the apex section finally discussion and conclusion are reported in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental data the experimental data used in the present work were collected in a sine generated laboratory flume of large amplitude deflection angle at the inflection section θo 110 minimum radius of curvature at centreline rmin 0 97 m and constant width b 0 50 m constructed at dicam university of palermo italy see fig 1b according to the prevailing literature s experimental approach among others whiting and dietrich 1993 da silva et al 2006 termini 2009 termini and piraino 2011 following leopold and laigbein 1966 the sine generated function well approximates the shape of river meanders the flow width is assumed constant and a wide stream is defined as a stream having width to depth ratio greater than 10 among others nezu and rodi 1985 da silva et al 2006 the value of the control parameter r b accounting for high curvature effects blanckaert and de vriend 2004 blanckaert 2011 varies along the bend assuming the lowest value rmin b 1 94 at the apex section this value falls into the range of natural rivers with sharp curvature hickin 1977 thus the channel s configuration can be considered representative of natural sharp bends for details of the experimental setup and measurement procedures please refer to previous works see as an example in termini and piraino 2011 termini 2013 2016 this paper reports on experiments conducted with a deformed and fixed bed obtained at the end of a previous mobile bed run carried out as explained in termini 2016 covered with real herbaceous flexible vegetation festuca arundinacea and with flow discharge q 0 012 m3 s overall averaged water depth equal to ha 0 11 m and b ha 4 5 this value of flow discharge was the same as that used during previous experimental runs carried out without vegetation on the bed termini 2016 2017 literature also indicates similar measured values of flow discharge in laboratory flumes and in natural rivers see as an example in nikora et al 2008 blanckaert 2011 for the presented experiments the seeds of vegetation were sprayed on sample containers by hand uniformly the vegetation was left to grow undisturbed inside the sample containers and then the samples were inserted into the flume during the experimental runs the bent vegetation height kv was measured by using a decimal ruler fixed on the side walls at each measurement section see also in carollo et al 2005 after having verified that almost equal values of the bent vegetation height were obtained at the side walls an unique averaged value of kv was considered for the analysis finally the averaged bent vegetation height kv was equal to 2 6 cm the morphology of the vegetation stems was straplike with average blade width d equal to 3 10 3 m this morphology is typical of submerged seagrasses see as an example chandler et al 1996 nepf 2012 and can be also found along the sicilian rivers in agreement with previous works nepf and koch 1999 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nezu and sonjau 2008 in the present work the blade width d is assumed as the characteristic dimension of the vegetated element the fractional plant area ϕ was 14 this value of the fractional plant area can be found for seagrasses see luhar et al 2010 riegl and foster 2011 and is in agreement with values used both in laboratory channels carollo et al 2008 termini 2016 and in the field as an example dense submerged vegetation was found by taguas et al 2016 by nikora et al 2008 in mall stream in new zeland by miler et al 2014 in lowland rivers in this work the analysis is restricted to sections a c of fig 1b and we consider the streamwise coordinates x y and z respectively as the longitudinal transversal and vertical directions of a local reference system having origin at left bank and z positive upwards the instantaneous longitudinal transversal and vertical flow velocities respectively u t v t w t were simultaneously measured by using an acoustic doppler velocity profiler dop 2000 by signal processing s a accuracy of 0 09 cm s which consists of a probe that is simultaneously emitter and receiver of acoustic pulses the number of emitted profiles varied along the channel pulse repetition frequency variable in the range 5000 15 000 hz and the maximum number of emitted profiles was 800 during the acquisition the power spectrum was computed from the high passed filtered data so that the amplitude of the power spectrum at the origin was always zero the acquired data were filtered by using a moving average filter the acquisition parameters were chosen also on the basis of preliminary tests conducted in selected sections by comparing the acquired velocity profiles with those measured by using a 2d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the uncertainty in the experimental data was estimated during a preliminary study by comparing independent measurements and taking into account the different sources of errors such a study indicated as conservative estimates of uncertainty in the time averaged velocity components less than 5 for longitudinal velocity and less than 8 for transversal and vertical velocities the uncertainty in the turbulent fluctuation components was estimated as less than 8 for longitudinal component and less than 12 for transversal and vertical components to collect the data used in the present work three probes the first pointing in the vertical direction the second and third sloping at angle α 60 and pointing in the transversal direction and in the longitudinal direction respectively with emission frequency of 4 mhz which moved by the help of the three dimensional automatic position system see fig 1b were used along each profile the distance between the centre of adjacent sampling volumes was 0 75 mm the spacing of measured profiles in the transverse and vertical directions was 3 0 mm while the spacing of profiles measured by the probe in the longitudinal direction was 4 0 mm more details on measurement conditions and estimates of the velocity components can be found in termini 2013 2016 for simplicity of exposure only some peculiar measurement verticals which are indicative for the analysis have been reported in some of the following figures 3 theoretical considerations 3 1 momentum and transport equations in the presence of vegetation flow is forced to move around the vegetation elements so that the velocity field is spatially heterogeneous at the stem scale an appropriate approach to remove the spatial heterogeneity derives from the double averaging method of the navier stokes equations nikora et al 2001 poggi et al 2004 finnigan and shaw 2008 thus the instantaneous flow variables are decomposed into the time average and the deviation from the time average the time averaged quantity is determined by the sum of a spatial average and the deviation of this spatial average after having applied the double averaging method the momentum equations can be written in the following form among others poggi et al 2004 nezu and sonjau 2008 1a d v j d t g j p ρ x i τ j i x j f f v 1b τ j i v j v i v j v i ν v j x j 1c f f v p x i ν 2 v j x j x i where the overbar indicates the time average the symbol indicates the spatial average time average the single prime indicates the deviation from the time average and the double prime indicates the deviation of the spatial average t is time xj with x1 x x2 y x 3 z are the streamwise transversal and vertical directions vj with v1 u t v2 v t v3 w t are the instantaneous velocity components p is the pressure ρ is the water density ν is the kinematic viscosity g is the gravity force eq 1b defines the space averaged shear stress per unit mass which includes the spatial average of the classical reynolds stress first term on the right hand side of eq 1b the so called dispersive flux term representing the momentum flux associated with spatial correlations in the time averaged velocity field second term on the right hand side of eq 1b and the viscous stress third term on the right hand side of eq 1b which can be considered negligible compared to the turbulent stress eq 1c indicates the drag force per unit mass including the form drag term first term on the right hand side of eq 1c which is generally related to the flow velocity the drag coefficient cd and the local canopy density see as an example poggi et al 2004 finnigan and shaw 2008 nepf 2012 and the viscous drag second term on the right hand side of eq 1c which can be considered negligible compared with the vegetative drag nepf and vivoni 2000 as should be clear from the introduction the major part of studies conducted in this field consider straight and uniform flow so that the left hand side of eq 1a is reduced to zero and attention is especially focused on terms on the right hand side of the streamwise momentum equation by assuming the viscous term negligible from eq 1b the streamwise shear stress per unit mass is determined as 2 τ x z u t w t u t w t in the present paper restricting the attention to this expression we explore the relative importance of the terms on the right hand side at the apex section c the transport equation of a tracer c concentration of substances after having applied the temporal and spacing average method can be written as see as an example tanino and nepf 2008 nepf 2012 3 c t v j c x j x j v j c v j c j d m c x j the first term on the right hand side indicates the mass flux associated with the turbulent fluctuations and thus represents the turbulent diffusion the second term on the right hand side represents the dispersive flux associated with the time averaged spatial fluctuations the third term on the right hand side indicates the flux due to the molecular diffusion dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient which is negligible compared with the turbulent diffusion and the dispersive flux tanino and nepf 2008 nepf 2012 for time scales greater than the turbulent time scale rutherford 1994 and dimension of the averaging volume greater than the characteristic dimension of the vegetated element and of the stems spacing the first two terms on the right hand side of eq 3 are expected to be fickian thus the eq 3 can be rewritten in the following form tanino and nepf 2008 nepf 2012 4 c t v j c x j k j j 2 c x j 2 kjj is the coefficient for net dispersion along the jth direction which is proportional to the product of the velocity scale and the average turbulent length associated with mixing due to turbulent eddies in this paper attention is restricted to the lateral dispersion and thus to the coefficient kyy 4 results 4 1 istantaneous flow in order to investigate the turbulent behavior of flow the instantaneous streamwise u t vertical w t and transversal v t velocity fluctuations have been estimated and analyzed for each measurement point as an example fig 2 a visualizes the distributions of u t w t and v t at t 150 s for the examined sections according to termini and piraino 2011 see also in termini 2015b three regions i e the outer bank region for 0 y b 0 25 the central region for 0 25 y b 0 75 and the inner bank region for 0 75 y b 1 have been identified in fig 2a from this figure an alternating pattern of high speed and low speed fluid areas can be clearly seen which indicate the formation of the turbulence structures at the inflection section section a this is especially evident at the inner bank at the bend entrance section b such a behavior is also evident in the central part of the cross section and then at the apex section section c alternating high low speed fluid areas are especially evident in the central and in the outer bank regions in order to highlight the interference region between neighboring elements along the transversal direction y in fig 2b the contours of the streamwise turbulent component u t obtained only by considering the values measured close to the top of the vegetated layer i e at relative depth z h kv h in the outer half of section c have been also reported this figure shows a contour pattern almost symmetrical with respect to the transversal direction y this is consistent with results obtained by ben meftah et al 2006 around flexible vegetated elements characterized by a geometry similar to that of the elements used in the present work ben meftah et al 2006 related such a behavior to the movements of the branches which influence a relatively large horizontal area around the vegetated element furthermore it can be seen that high turbulent fluctuations are found on either side of the vegetation where the flow separates from it and the width of the interference region along y is comparable with the characteristic dimension of the vegetated element this pattern is consistent with recent studies conducted in straight vegetated bed channels see as an example nepf 1999 nepf et al 2013 and with previous results obtained by termini 2016 2017 which highlight that the vegetated elements generate vortices whose size is partially controlled by the width of the vegetated element 4 2 kinetic energy and contribution from turbulence to lateral dispersion in order to investigate turbulence structure within and above the vegetated layer it is important to analyze the turbulent kinetic energy budget fig 3 reports the contour maps of the turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass k u t 2 v t 2 w t 2 2 normalized by u 2 2 with u q bha in the inflection and in the apex sections this figure shows alternating regions of high low values of turbulent kinetic energy with localized peak values at the top of vegetation in the inflection section a high values of kinetic energy occur especially in the inner bank region in the apex section section c high values of k occur especially in the central and in the outer bank regions as one approaches the separation between the main circulation cell and the outer bank counter rotating circulation cell i e at y y the turbulent kinetic energy decreases in value see also in termini 2016 thus fig 3 shows that the vertical trend of the turbulent kinetic energy varies along the cross section in the central part of the cross section the presence of vegetation determines alternating regions of high low values of turbulent kinetic energy with peaks at the top of vegetation this pattern of k is in agreement with that obtained by other researchers in straight vegetated bed channels among others nepf 1999 righetti 2008 but it differs from that observed by termini 2016 in the same meandering channel without vegetation on the bed as indicated by termini 2016 see also in termini and piraino 2011 in the absence of vegetation the turbulent kinetic energy assumes a peak value in the central region near the separation between the central and the outer bank circulation cells and close to the free surface in the outer bank region similar patterns of the turbulent kinetic energy were also observed by other researchers see as an example muto 1997 tamai and ikeda 1985 blanckaert and graf 2001 in the outside region of a bend and in the absence of vegetation as discussed in termini 2016 the different pattern of k observed in the presence and in the absence of vegetation could be related to the fact that while in the absence of vegetation a large curvature induced circulation cell is formed in the central region especially in the deepest part of the cross section in the presence of vegetation this large circulation cell is suppressed because the presence of vegetation determines regions of shear which produce vortices of size partially controlled by the width of the vegetated elements this is consistent with what was observed in straight vegetated bed channels see as an example petroff et al 2009 as consequence while in the absence of vegetation the large circulation cell redistributes the transverse momentum determining an increase of turbulent kinetic energy as the channel s curvature increases blanckaert 2010 in the presence of vegetation this effect is interrupted by the presence of the vegetated elements termini 2017 close to the outer bank as observed by termini 2016 2017 both in the absence and in the presence of vegetation a reverse circulation cell is discernable but in the presence of vegetation this circulation cell is weaker and includes a more extended fluid area than that observed in the absence of vegetation thus in the presence of vegetation close to the outer bank k assumes both a slight peak near the free surface as observed in the absence of vegetation and alternating peak values at the top of vegetation according to tanino and nepf 2008 the turbulent kinetic energy can be used to evaluate the contribution from turbulence to lateral dispersion and mass transport as it should be clear from section 3 the lateral dispersion coefficient kyy is expected to be proportional to the product of the velocity scale and the average turbulent length along y direction lty associated with mixing due to turbulent eddies literature on vegetated flows among others nepf 1999 nepf and vivoni 2000 tanino and nepf 2008 shows that a meaningful velocity scale is k and thus kyy can be estimated as 5 k y y k l t y where lty is set by the stem geometry in sparse arrays nepf 1999 and by the minimum between the stem geometry and the stem spacing in dense arrays raupach and shaw 1982 raupach et al 1991 tanino and nepf 2008 as an example in a cylinder array nepf 1999 suggested to assume lty equal to the cylinder diameter i e the characteristic element dimension when cylinder spacing is smaller than the water depth as indicated in the section 2 the vegetation used in the present work is straplike and in agreement with previous studies nepf and ghisalberti 2008 nepf 2012 the average element s blade width d is assumed as the characteristic element dimension this assumption has been also verified for the examined case by estimating lty through the power spectrum of the turbulent fluctuation component based on this and taking into account the pattern of fig 2b in the present work lty is set by the blade width d and it is assumed k y y k d thus the normalized lateral dispersion coefficient has been estimated as tanino and nepf 2008 6 k y y u d k u fig 4 shows the values of the ratio k u and of the transversal spatial average k u the spatial average was operated over four measurement locations in section c against the relative depth z kv with 0 z h h local water depth this section has been selected because based on previous results obtained by termini and piraino 2011 see also in termini 2015b in the absence of vegetation it is characterized by significant cross sectional flow motion furthermore for brevity only some characteristic profiles have been reported in fig 4 from this figure it can be seen that k u varies along the cross section in region 1 i e y 9 6 y see as an example profile p1 in fig 4 the term k u assumes slight peak values just below the free surface approximately at the eye of the counter rotating circulation cell see in termini and piraino 2011 and close to the top of the vegetated layer as a consequence the vertical profile of the transversal spatial average k u shows an almost uniform trend in depth with a slight peak value approximately at the top of the vegetated layer and just below the free surface in region 1 the relative submergence h kv assumes values greater or almost equal than 5 in region 2 for 9 6 y 32 see as an example profile p2 in fig 4 k u varies in value along the depth generally assuming low values inside the vegetation and higher values for z kv 1 as a consequence the spatial average k u has the lower values inside the vegetation and an increasing trend for increasing values of z kv until a maximum close to the top of the vegetated layer then as one approaches the free surface a high value of k u is maintained with a slightly decrease close to the free surface the observed trend suggests that in this region the lateral diffusion could play an important role in the central part of the water depth just over the top of vegetation it should be also noted that in the examined region the relative submergence h kv assumes values greater than 2 but less than 5 and that the aforementioned trend is more evident as h kv decreases i e especially for 15 9 y 32 see as an example profile p3 in fig 4 in region 3 that is for y 32 see as an example profile p4 in fig 4 the vertical profiles of k u show a different trend compared with that observed for y 32 so that the spatial average k u assumes the higher peak value inside the vegetation and a marked decreasing trend approaching the free surface in this region the relative submergence h kv assumes values less than 2 thus fig 4 shows that especially in the central part of the cross section k u peaks close to the top of the vegetation where the shear layer forms the vertical extent of the high values of k u increases as h kv increases this is consistent with results obtained by nepf and vivoni 2000 in a straight channel for values of submergence h kv variable inside the range 1 25 2 75 4 3 vertical and streamwise exchange the aforementioned result confirms that in the submerged regime the shear layer forming at the top of vegetation strongly affects the diffusion and advection processes as it should be clear from the introduction and the section 3 nepf and vivoni 2000 see also nepf 2012 investigated for a straight and uniform flow the relative importance of the vertical turbulent exchange and the streamwise transport as a result they established that in the transition regime both the vertical turbulent transport of momentum and the streamwise transport are important although the last one decreases as the relative submergence increases thus in this part of the work the relative importance of the vertical turbulent exchange and the streamwise transport is explored at the apex section c where the variability of the relative submergence is particularly evident to this aim the experimental data have been used to estimate the ratio between the turbulent stress and the pressure gradients above the vegetation from eq 2 it can be seen that τ xz includes both the term u t w t which represents the classical vertical momentum flux and the term u t w t which represents the dispersive stress accounting for the spatial heterogeneity in the time averaged velocity field previous studies conducted in straight channels suggest to assume the dispersive stress negligible compared to the reynolds turbulent stress especially in dense vegetation as an example poggi et al 2004 found that the dispersive term is less than 10 of the reynolds turbulent stress nezu and sonjau 2008 obtained values of the dispersive term within 5 of the square friction velocity in order to explore the entity of the dispersive stress at the apex section of the meandering channel the term u t w t has been determined for each measurement point table 1 reports the values of the normalized dispersive term u t w t u 2 u friction velocity along the characteristic profiles p1 p4 according to nezu and sonjau 2008 the friction velocity has been defined by the value of reynolds stress at the vegetation edge i e u 2 u t w t z k v from table 1 it can be seen that over the top of vegetation the dispersive stress assumes values less than 15 of u 2 inside the vegetation the dispersive stress has a peak and this peak assumes values less than around 25 of u 2 through the cross section with exception of some profiles in the region 3 h kv 2 where the peak assumes values of around 33 of u 2 the observed pattern of the dispersive term indicates that in contrast to what observed in straight channels poggi et al 2004 nezu and sanjou 2008 especially for h kv 2 the effect of the dispersive stress should be considered thus in order to evaluate the contribution of the dispersive stress and to investigate the relative importance of the vertical turbulent transport of momentum and the streamwise transport the ratio τ x z z g h x has been estimated at the apex section c by assuming both τ x z u w and τ x z u w u w see fig 5 the turbulent stress gradient has been estimated at the top of the vegetation layer see also in nepf and vivoni 2000 fig 5 shows that the magnitude of the examined driving forces varies as the relative submergence changes furthermore the contribution of the dispersive stress is especially evident in region 3 i e for h kv 2 in the central region for 2 h kv 5 the vertical turbulent transport of momentum prevails over the streamwise transport as the inner bank is approached for h kv 2 the vertical turbulent transport of momentum tends to decrease until that the streamwise transport becomes more important close to the outer bank where the outer bank cell develops the turbulent stress assumes low values and the aforementioned ratio decreases in value thus fig 5 suggests that in the examined section both forms of exchange between vegetation and the overflow should be considered in the central region the vertical turbulent transport of momentum is the dominant exchange mechanism but in the inner bank region the entity of the vertical turbulent transport of momentum decreases and that of the streamwise transport increases this is consistent with results obtained in a straight channel by nepf and vivoni 2000 4 4 higher order moments and vertical and streamwise turbulent diffusion the higher order moments of velocity fluctuations d u u t 3 and d w u t 2 w t are particularly interesting for the present analysis in fact these terms are related respectively to the streamwise and vertical turbulent diffusion the term d w u t 2 w t is related to the transport of turbulent kinetic energy and indicates the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction d u u t 3 can be thought as the streamwise flux of the turbulent kinetic energy component u t 2 raupach and shaw 1982 fig 6 a reports the vertical profiles of normalized terms d u n u t 3 u t 2 3 2 and d w n u t 2 w t u t w t 3 2 estimated at the apex section c for brevity only some characteristic profiles have been reported in fig 6a it has been observed that d u n and d w n have generally opposite peaks and these peaks are at the same relative depth furthermore the peak values of d u n are always larger than those of d w n indicating a streamwise momentum transport the higher peak values of d u n and of d w n occur especially just below the top of the vegetation this could indicate the existence of coherent vortices close to the vegetation in particular in region 1 for y 9 6 y d u n and d w n assume slight peak values along the depth with d u n positive and d w n negative inside vegetation see as an example the vertical profile at y 7 8 in fig 6a this suggests that vegetation could be a sink of turbulent motion in particular the fact that d u n is positive and d w n is negative indicates a high speed fluid movement towards the bed along the depth in region 2 for 9 6 y 32 d u n and d w n gradually change the sign near the top of vegetation so that especially for y 15 9 see as an example the vertical profile for y 16 8 in fig 6a d u n assumes high negative values and d w n assumes low positive values inside the vegetation above the vegetation d u n and d w n become positive and negative respectively and their values tend to increase until a maximum just below the free surface in accordance with nezu and sonjau 2008 the fact that d u n and d w n assume the higher values just below the vegetation is characteristic in canopy flows and indicates the existence of strong coherent turbulent activity in particular in the central part of the water depth and near the top of vegetation i e in the mixing layer d u n 0 and d w n 0 indicating a high speed fluid movement towards the bed in the lower layer d u n and d w n change the sign i e d u n 0 and d w n 0 indicating low speed fluid movement towards the free surface finally in region 3 for y 32 d u n and d w n assume alternating positive negative peak values along the entire profile see as an example the vertical profile at y 38 6 in fig 6a highlighting an intense turbulent coherent activity along the profile in particular in the central part of the water depth d u n is negative and d w n assumes small positive values close to the top of vegetation thus indicating a streamwise momentum transport and low speed movement towards the free surface after having verified that the transversal and the vertical fluctuation components have the same order of magnitude according to nezu and sanjou 2008 the turbulent diffusion of the turbulent kinetic energy along each profile can be synthetized through the approximation t d u t 2 w t 2 w t 3 thus in fig 6b the vertical profiles of td and of its transversal spatial average td estimated at section c have been also reported also in this case for brevity only some characteristic profiles have been reported in this figure it can be seen that for y 9 6 y see as an example the profile p1 in fig 6b the transversal spatial average td is negative and almost uniform in depth for 9 6 y 32 td increases in values just below the free surface inside the vegetation td assumes high values and gradually changes the sign see as an example the profile p2 in fig 6b so that for y 15 9 the spatial average td becomes positive inside the vegetation and negative over it see as an example the profile p3 in fig 6b this confirms that the turbulent activity is diffused both within the vegetation and over it this behavior is consistent with that obtained by nezu and sanjou 2008 in a straight channel for h kv ranging from 1 to 4 finally for y 32 the aforementioned behavior is less evident until that as one approaches the inner bank td assumes alternating positive negative values along the water depth see as an example the profile p4 in fig 6b in summary fig 6 shows that especially for 2 h kv 5 both high speed fluid motion towards the vegetation and low speed fluid movement from the vegetation towards the free surface occur such a behavior is more evident as h kv decreases this is consistent with the fact that td assumes positive values inside vegetation and becomes negative over the vegetation indicating that the turbulent energy near the vegetation is diffused both within the vegetation and in the upper layer this behavior is in agreement with that observed in straight channels with dense submerged vegetation see as an example nezu and sanjou 2008 4 5 quadrant analysis third order moments and in particular the vertical and streamwise turbulent diffusion terms are strictly related to ejection and sweep motions nezu and nakagawa 1993 thus the aforementioned results confirm the formation of turbulent coherent structures which develop along the considered section and control the exchange mechanisms within and above the vegetation in this section the occurrence of the turbulent events is qualitatively investigated through the quadrant decomposition of the instantaneous velocity fluctuations nezu and nakagawa 1993 thus the instantaneous plane u t w t has been divided into four quadrants i i ii iii iv so that the ith quadrant roughly represents a turbulent event i i u t 0 w t 0 outward interaction i ii u t 0 w t 0 ejection i iii u t 0 w t 0 inward interaction i iv u t 0 w t 0 sweep ejection events are associated to net upward momentum flux and are responsible for the maintaining into suspension of particles lu and willmart 1973 sweep events are associated to downward momentum flux and are relevant mechanisms for the entrainment of substances displays and dancey 2012 dey 2014 the contribution coming from each quadrant has been determined through the discriminating function ik the index k i ii iii iv indicates the quadrant in which the generic event falls which is equal to 1 if the couple u t w t falls in k th quadrant and equal to zero otherwise then the normalized occurrence frequency fk for the event types related to the different quadrants has been estimated as 7 f k t 0 t i k t 0 t i i t 0 t i ii t 0 t i iii t 0 t i iv where t is the measurement time length the analysis of the vertical profiles of the normalized occurrence frequency fk has generally shown that the higher values of frequency of occurrence are for events of ii and iv quadrants furthermore the frequency of occurrence of events of quadrants ii and or iv increases inside the vegetation fig 7 shows for brevity only some characteristic profiles of the normalized occurrence frequency fk determined in section c it can be observed that in region 1 for y 9 6 y see as an example the vertical profile at y 7 8 in fig 7 in the over vegetation layer sweep and ejections occur with comparable frequency close to the top of vegetation the frequency of occurrence of ejections slightly dominate over that of sweeps this means that upwards motion of low speed fluid occurs thus the turbulent momentum transport near the top of vegetation is affected by frequent upward motions with infrequent but stronger downward movements of high speed fluid from the upper layer this is consistent with results obtained by other authors in dense canopy yan et al 2017 in region 2 for 9 6 y 32 sweep events occur more frequently than ejections inside vegetation indicating downwards motion of high speed fluid over the top of the vegetated layer ejection events are more frequent than sweeps for y 15 9 for y 15 9 sweep events dominate over ejections along the major part of the water depth see as an example the vertical profile at y 16 8 in fig 7 in region 3 y 32 both ejection and sweep events occur alternatively along the water depth the frequency of occurrence of events of i and iii quadrants becomes comparable and often even higher than that of events of quadrants ii and iv see as an example the vertical profile at y 38 6 in fig 7 this indicates a strong interaction of the turbulent structures with the main flow 5 discussion results presented in the section 4 have substantially confirmed that in the presence of vegetation turbulent coherent structures generate and control the exchange mechanisms within and above the vegetated layer generally the higher values of frequency of occurrence have been found for ejection and sweep events however the performed analysis has demonstrated that the development of these turbulent structures is strongly influenced by the value of the relative submergence this is consistent with previous findings obtained by nezu and sanjou 2008 in a straight flume with submerged vegetation on the bed they highlighted that in contrast to terrestrial canopies which are characterized by infinitely large relative submergence aquatic canopy is characterized by finite values of the relative submergence and thus the development of coherent eddies may be influenced by h kv in a curved channel reach as that considered in the present work the relative submergence is extremely variable in particular in the examined meandering bend the variability of the relative submergence is particularly evident at the apex section where the transversal asymmetry of the bed is large because of the point bar development as one passes from the outer bank to the inner bank the relative submergence h kv varies from values greater than 5 to values lower than 2 close to the outer bank for y 9 6 y where h kv 5 and the counter rotating cell develops the transversal spatial average of the lateral dispersion coefficient and the turbulent diffusion assume low values almost uniform in depth this behavior could be related to the fact that the increase of roughness due to the presence of vegetation determines the formation of a counter rotating circulation cell weaker and wider than that observed in the absence of vegetation thus inhibiting the outward transversal momentum flux see also in termini 2016 as consequence it is expected that the protective effect of the outer bank cell forming in vegetated bed natural meanders could be significant in this part of the cross section ejection motion prevails over sweep motion especially close to the top of vegetation indicating dominant upwards movement of low speed fluid this also suggests a possible process of suspension of substances in the flow transported downstream in the central part of the cross section where 2 h kv 5 it has been observed that the lateral dispersion could be important just over the top of vegetation in fact the coefficient kyy assumes the lower values inside the vegetation and an increasing trend for z kv 1 until a maximum value close to the top of the vegetated layer this behavior becomes more evident as h kv decreases this could be due to the fact that inside the vegetation the flow is retarded by the drag of the plants and above the vegetated layer flow accelerates thus the region close to the top of the vegetated layer is the region of highest shear mixing layer region and the turbulent kinetic energy suddenly increase this is in agreement with literature findings obtained in straight channels see as an example poggi et al 2004 carollo et al 2008 furthermore in this region of the cross section the spatial average of the turbulent diffusion assumes the higher values inside the vegetation where both the diffusion in the vertical direction d w and the streamwise flux of the turbulent kinetic energy d u assume a peak value as literature shows see as an example nezu and sanjou 2008 ghisalberti and nepf 2008 this behavior is characteristic in vegetated flows furthermore d u and d w have always opposite sign which is different inside and above the vegetation this behavior indicates a strong coherent turbulent activity nezu and nakagawa 1993 from the quadrant analysis it has been seen that sweep events dominate over ejections in the mixing layer such behavior indicates that the motion is essentially characterized by high speed fluid directed towards the bed influencing transport processes significantly finally as one moves towards the inner bank where h kv 2 the vertical distribution of the lateral diffusion coefficient is very different from that obtained for h kv 2 in fact in this part of the cross section the lateral diffusion coefficient assumes a higher peak value near the top of vegetation and a marked decreasing trend approaching the free surface this is consistent with the fact that the lateral transfer is the dominant exchange mechanism inside vegetation neft and vivoni 2000 folkard 2011 on the other hand the relative magnitude of the turbulent vertical exchange and the streamwise transport varies as the relative submergence changes in particular in the examined section the turbulent vertical exchange is more significant than the streamwise transport for 2 h kv 5 as the inner bank is approached for h kv 2 the streamwise transport becomes more significant this is also consistent with results obtained by nepf and vivoni 2000 in a straight channel but in contrast to what was observed in straight channels especially for h kv 2 in the examined case the contribution of the dispersive stress is not always negligible and it should be considered in analyzing the exchange processes the transversal spatial average of the vertical and longitudinal turbulent diffusion td for h kv 2 assumes values lower than those obtained for h kv 2 and an alternating positive negative trend along the water depth the quadrant analysis indicates that in this part of the cross section ejection events generally dominate over sweep in the upper layer near the free surface near the top of vegetation the frequency of occurrence of sweep events is greater than that of ejections furthermore in this part of the cross section it has been seen that the frequency of events of i and iii quadrants becomes comparable and sometime even higher than that of events of ii and iv quadrants this is related to the fact that because of the low values of the relative submergence the turbulent structures tend to interact with the main flow on the basis of aforementioned it can be summarized that a different contribution from turbulence to the exchange mechanisms has been observed for h kv 2 and for h kv 2 this is also consistent with results obtained by termini 2015a see also in carollo et al 2008 in a straight channel analyzing the effect of stems concentration and relative submergence on the vertical velocity profile and mixing layer thickness she verified that the mixing layer thickness and thus the momentum thickness as defined by ghisalberti and nepf 2006 tends to increase as the relative submergence increases especially for values of h kv 2 the momentum thickness tends to increase linearly with the relative submergence the variation of the mixing layer thickness modifies the associated mechanism for the momentum transfer see also nikora 2010 nepft 2012 and the dominant momentum transfer mechanism between the bed and the above canopy layer this is also consistent with wu et al 1999 findings obtained also by moramarco and termini 2015 who highlighted the existence of a boundary zone of the relative submergence approximately for 1 7 h kv 2 in submerged vegetation depending on the vegetation species where the increase in drag effect does not correspond to an increase in the hydraulic radius for values of h kv lower to the inferior limit of such a boundary zone vegetation assumes a not submerged behavior this means that in the examined case the vegetation behavior obtained for values of h kv 2 is different from that observed in the rest of the cross section and the value of the relative submergence is near to the boundary condition wu et al 1999 see also in nepf and vivoni 2000 the obtained results are also consistent with those obtained by nepf and vivoni 2000 in the transition from emergent to submerged canopies 1 h kv 2 75 in particular they verified that in submerged vegetation the exchange dynamics could vary in relation to the thickness of the vertical exchange zone for h kv 2 it is reduced because the length of the shear turbulence is constrained by the water depth thus the obtained results indicate that in the submerged regime at the apex section of the meander bend the importance of the vertical turbulent exchange varies with the relative submergence similarly to what was observed in straight channels this could be related to the fact that the transversal flow pattern determined by the channel s curvature is interrupted by the presence of vegetation termini 2016 2017 6 conclusion the main results obtained in the present work can be synthetized as follows i the mass and momentum transport occurring between the vegetation and the flow over it is controlled by coherent turbulent motion of particular importance is that the contribution of coherent turbulence to exchange mechanisms may be significantly influenced by the relative submergence h kv ii for h kv 2 ejection and sweep events have frequency of occurrence much higher than that of events of quadrants i and iii in particular for 2 h kv 5 in the central part of the water depth sweep motion transporting high momentum fluid inside the vegetation prevails over ejection in the upper layer ejection motion transporting low momentum fluid from the vegetation towards the free surface occurs the turbulent energy near the vegetation layer is diffused both within the vegetation and towards the over vegetation layer the lateral dispersion could be important just over the top of vegetation while near the bed where the flow is retarded by the drag of the plants the lateral dispersion coefficient assumes the lower values this behavior becomes more evident as h kv decreases furthermore in this region the turbulent vertical exchange is more significant than the streamwise transport although the turbulent vertical effect decreases as h kv decreases close to the outer bank where h kv 5 and the counter rotating cell develops the lateral dispersion coefficient and the turbulent diffusion assume low values and are uniform in depth this could be related to the fact that as verified by termini 2017 because of the increase of roughness due to the presence of vegetation the counter rotating circulation cell inhibits the lateral transport this means that in natural meandering bends with vegetated bed the protective effect exerted by the outer bank cell could be more significant than that in the absence of vegetation furthermore while in the over vegetation layer the ejection and sweep events alternatively occur with comparable frequency close to the vegetation ejection events slightly prevail over sweep motion this suggests the possible suspension of substances in the flow transported downstream iii for h kv 2 in the inner bank region the lateral dispersion becomes important inside vegetation the turbulent vertical transport assumes values lower than those obtained for h kv 2 and becomes less important compared to the streamwise transport near the top of vegetation events of i and iii quadrants tend to happen with comparable and even higher close to the free surface frequency than that of events of ii and iv quadrants highlighting the interaction of the turbulent structures with the main flow iv in contrast to what was observed in straight channels poggi et al 2004 nezu and sanjou 2008 the contribution of the dispersive stress is not always negligible especially for h kv 2 thus a deeper understanding of dispersive stress contribution to the momentum equation for different hydrodynamic conditions and vegetation patterns needed in summary from the presented results it can be concluded that along the meandering bend the turbulent activity is influenced by the strong variability of the relative submergence h kv in particular a different contribution from turbulence to the exchange mechanism can be observed for h kv 2 and for h kv 2 this is similar to what was observed in straight channels nepf and vivoni 2000 in fact the high roughness due to in the presence of the vegetation interrupts the transversal flow pattern determined by the channel s curvature this determines an evident reduction of the lateral fluid transport towards the outer bank and a significant vertical turbulent transport between the vegetation and the overflow in the central part of the cross section thus the presence of vegetation alters the bend effects so that the flow assumes in some aspects a behavior similar to that observed in straight channels and improves the stability conditions at the outer bank it is expected that the observed behavior may be more important in natural bends where vegetation is present both on the bed and on the bank based on the obtained results it might be also expected that in the presence of vegetation the convective transport processes could be less important than those observed in the absence of vegetation among others blanckaert and graf 2001 termini and piraino 2011 however the quantitative analysis of the importance of turbulence induced processes compared to other flow processes is in progress and will be presented in a successive work it should be noted that this paper focused on a high amplitude meandering bend with dense vegetation on the bed despite this restriction it allows to gain of insight into the turbulent structure and exchange dynamics in high curvature channels with vegetated bed future research will be also addressed to extend the present analysis investigating turbulence contribution and the induced exchange processes for different vegetation patches along the bend

maximize or minimize the objective function and their short term responses to boundary conditions such as root zone soil moisture and changes in ca despite differences in what these approaches maximize or minimize a similarity in outcome may be hinting that a more general principle is governing plant responses to fluctuating environmental conditions the main focus of the work here our conjecture is that plants may have evolved a coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery that confers some competitive advantages in fluctuating environmental conditions such a coordination should manifest itself in linkages between the properties describing the photosynthetic machinery the hydraulic and carbohydrate transporting systems it will be remiss if analogies to the energetics of evolution principle as a consequence of natural selection proposed in 1922 by lotka lotka 1922 odum and hall 1995 are not pointed out this principle states that natural selection tends to make the energy flux through the system a maximum so far as compatible with the constraints to which the system is subject as indicated by lotka the maximum input of energy flux exceeding the actual energy demand for growth maintenance defense and reproduction at the current states offers a great opportunity in the future to develop an advantageous plant body that can promote larger total energy flux through the system in the plant kingdom the input of energy flux can be expressed as the sucrose flux rendered out of the loading leaf environmental conditions and endogenous transport processes affecting this energy flux represent the limiting constraints to the system it is with this view that coordination among the xylem phloem and leaf is interpreted as an energy capturing device to direct available energy into the system by harvesting limited resources lotka 1922 1 1 hypothesis in light of the energetics of the evolution principle lotka 1922 we hypothesize that stomatal conductance gs can be predicted by assuming coordination in the leaf xylem phloem system thereby recovering the mathematical form of the aforementioned approaches the criterion for predicting gs is that this coordination maintains efficient maximum transport rate of photoassimlates i e energy flux out of the loading zone over short time intervals δt so as to ensure maximum energy circulation at the whole plant level when coupling the transport and physiological processes in the leaf xylem phloem system i e photosynthetic machinery water transport in xylem and export of assimilated sugar from loading phloem how the limiting constraints induced by these processes and their interaction impact the energy flux entering the plant system and subsequently gs are now considered explicitly in this new modeling approach specifically this hypothesis offers a number of advantages 1 the phloem transport efficiency is no longer isolated from the photosynthetic machinery soil xylem hydraulics and stomatal function as is now recognized hölttä et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 mencuccini and hölttä 2010 nikinmaa et al 2013 sevanto et al 2014 2 the hypothetical assumption of pricing water loss in sot or fitness costs of low xylem water potential in profit maximization is by passed it should be noted that the transport rate of photoassimlates out of the loading zone represents the objective function to be maximized which is similar to the non steady state model proposed elsewhere nikinmaa et al 2013 adopting this hypothesis the objective of this work is to analyze gs responses to environmental factors and plant attributes across a wide range of time scales we also focus specifically on two consequences of the model results i the gs responses to long term elevated co2 conditions and ii progressive drought as well as species differentiation across the spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior before presenting the model formulation the constraints on photosynthesis and xylem water movement are briefly reviewed with a lens on their connections 1 2 constraints on photosynthesis and water transport for c3 plants the photosynthetic machinery limits the biochemical demand for co2 f c d mathematically f c d can be expressed as the outcome of co limitation of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco kinetic activity and ribulose 1 5 biphosphate rubp regeneration rate farquhar et al 1980b approximated by vico et al 2013 1 f c d k 1 c i γ k 2 c i r d where ci is the inter cellular co2 concentration k 1 and k 2 are photosynthetic parameters that vary with ppfd and ta γ is the co2 compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration and rd is the daytime mitochondrial respiration rate eq 1 is a hyperbolic function imposing the most limiting factor through electron transport rate at high ci i e f c d j 4 r d when k 1 j 4 where j is the electron transport rate or through rubisco activity at

atmosphere and kc and ko are respectively the michaelis constants for co2 fixation and oxygen inhibition vico et al 2013 when operating under co limitation regime eq 1 also ensures a continuous transition between the two photosynthetic limitations for ci f c d saturates at a maximum f c m a x k 1 r d i e the asymptotic behavior of f c c i curve f c d c i k 1 c i γ k 2 c i r d c i hence when ci availability is not limiting photosynthesis is only constrained by the photosynthetic machinery usually through electron transport rubp limitation l1 in fig 1 although an infinite ci is not realistic for any condition this extreme case may be used to explain the rapid land colonization by plants in the ordovician and their subsequent productivity during the silurian devonian approximately 400 million years ago during this time period ca reached up to 5000 ppm berner 1991 berner and kothavala 2001 and the long term ci ca commonly ranged from 0 6 to 0 9 drake et al 1997 ehleringer and cerling 1995 prentice et al 2014 wong et al 1979 it was this era when photorespiration was potentially suppressed and water use efficiency remained high sperry 2003 for present ca conditions 400 ppm the assimilation rate is further limited by the atmospheric supply of co2 which in turn is governed by ca the transport efficiency to co2 through the stomatal pathway i e stomatal conductance gs and the laminar boundary layer attached to the leaf surface assuming an infinitesimal thickness of the laminar boundary layer i e well coupled condition and a mesophyll conductance to co2 that is much larger than gs the atmospheric supply of co2 across the stomatal aperture can be described by a fickian diffusion and is given as f c s g s c a c i if all co2 molecules diffusing through stomata are eventually assimilated then the supply and demand for co2 are in balance resulting in f c s f c d the f c s f c d results in an actual photosynthetic rate fc that can then be expressed as a function of gs and the photosynthetic parameters huang et al 2015 katul et al 2010 2 f c g s 1 2 k 1 k 2 c a g s r d k 1 k 2 c a g s r d 2 4 g s c a g s k 2 k 2 r d k 1 γ for gs i e stomata do not limit photosynthesis ci ca and a finite maximum f c k 1 c a γ k 2 c a r d is guaranteed see eq 1 again this is another reference condition where fc is now bounded by finite ca l2 in fig 1 when ca f c max is recovered for a finite gs fc is limited by gs see eq 2 as well as environmental conditions through their effects on k 1 k 2 and γ as shown later such limitations are dictated by the coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery eq 2 demonstrates that an additional and independent link between fc and gs is needed to mathematically solve for gs fc and ci from c i c a 1 f c s g s c a in current climate and land surface models this independent expression is provided using one of two semi empirical formulations proposed by ball et al 1987 bwb and leuning 1995 leu thereby allowing fc gs and ci to be predicted baldocchi and meyers 1998 juang et al 2008 lai et al 2000 sellers et al 1996 1995 siqueira and katul 2002 the common feature of bwb and leu models is that g s m e f c c a γ f where me is an empirical parameter linking gs to f c c a γ and the reduction function f r h or 1 d d 0 1 is an atmospheric aridity function where rh is the relative humidity d is the vapor pressure deficit and d 0 is a normalizing constant how gs is impacted by the measures of atmospheric aridity such as rh and d is included in bwb and leu models the linkage between gs and fc ca through f is perhaps not surprising when water loss through the stomatal pathway i e atmospheric evaporative demand f e d agsd pa where a 1 6 is the relative diffusivity of water vapor with respect to co2 and pa is the atmospheric pressure is inevitable during photosynthesis the gs should satisfy both the atmospheric evaporative demand i e f e d and the supply demand balance of co2 i e f c s f c d eq 2 such atmospheric evaporative loss from the leaf as driven by the biochemical demand for co2 and the aridity of the atmosphere only serves as an upper bound for water vapor loss the actual water supply to satisfy the atmospheric evaporative demand also depends on soil water availability and whole system hydraulic conductance k integrated throughout the entire water flow path commencing from the soil and progressing to the distal parts of the plants sperry and love 2015 when xylem water potential decreases originally functional i e water filled xylem conduits can be occupied by air drawn from neighboring air filled conduits through inter conduit pit membranes such that water is no longer conducted by these dysfunctional conduits crombie et al 1985 sperry and tyree 1988 1990 similar to xylem soil water conductivity that varies with decreasing water potential is also reduced by spreading air over pore space between soil particles the bwb and leu models do not explicitly or mechanistically consider how gs is impacted by reductions in k due to progressive soil drying i e soil xylem hydraulic limitation the effects of such soil drying is represented by ad hoc reductions in me tuzet et al 2003 based on the economics of leaf level gas exchange berninger and hari 1993 cowan and farquhar 1977 givnish and vermeij 1976 hari et al 1986 konrad et al 2008 stomatal optimization theories sot provide an alternative approach to predict gs in sot the stomatal aperture variation is assumed to maximize carbon gain subjected to a cost of water loss incurred during transpiration in carbon units cost function this constrained optimization theory is equivalent to maximizing the objective function or hamiltonian defined as 3 h a l g s f c g s gain λ l f e d g s cost h a l g s g s f c g s g s λ l f e d g s g s 0 with f c g s f e d g s λ l 0 where the cost function is determined by the unit cost of water loss λl also known as the marginal water use efficiency or lagrange multiplier under some conditions the analytical form of gs derived from sot is per se similar to bwb and leu models katul et al 2010 2012 medlyn et al 2011 volpe et al 2011 for the optimal solution to hold λl must be a constant independent of short term stomatal aperture fluctuations e g sub hourly katul et al 2009 however λl may vary on longer time scales such as those commensurate with drying soil daily or any structural acclimation or adaptation monthly or yearly buckley et al 2016 manzoni et al 2013b stated differently λl can be inferred from fc gs f e d gs provided a large time scale separation exists between the gs and λl variability katul et al 2010 manzoni et al 2011 similar to bwb and leu models the representation of water loss in sot f e d does not directly account for water supply limitations imposed by the soil xylem hydraulic system wolf et al 2016 to capture such effects in drying soil conditions an ad hoc increase in λl with decreasing soil water status must be a priori specified manzoni et al 2011 soil xylem hydraulics may offer a logical alternative to such ad hoc specification a linkage between gs and soil xylem hydraulics can be obtained by the supply demand balance for water manzoni et al 2014 sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2016b given as 4 f e s k ψ l ψ s ψ l m v a l a g s d p a f e d resulting in g s ψ l k ψ l ψ s ψ l p a a d m v a l where f e s represents the steady state water supply function determined by the overall k ψl and the total water potential difference between the soil ψs and the leaf xylem ψl mv is the molecular weight of water and al is the leaf area when coupling the supply demand balance of co2 eq 2 and water eq 4 fluxes through gs an fc ψl relation can be derived without invoking a cost function and its associated unknown parameter λl as in sot however ψl is now necessary to determine fc prompting interest in possible links between sot and soil xylem hydraulics as a necessary step to link soil xylem hydraulics to sot two remarks are in order 1 gs is entirely described by ψl at a given ψs as given by eq 4 provided that the k ψl is known and 2 fc gs is a monotonically increasing function with increasing gs as dictated by eq 2 these two remarks imply that fc gs is a maximum at the maximum gs allowed by eq 4 and this maximum can be evaluated from g s ψ l 0 the associated leaf pressure satisfying g s ψ l 0 is hereafter referred to as ψ l crit the water and co2 fluxes at ψ l crit must represent the maximum permissible water transport capacity f e crit and the maximum permissible assimilation rate f c crit that can be supported by the soil xylem hydraulic system to the leaf at a given ψs manzoni et al 2013a sperry et al 2002 to solve the equation g s ψ l 0 and determine ψ l crit k ψl must be a priori determined there are multiple approaches to determine k ψl at the plant scale that often necessitate detailed hydraulic models through the soil root xylem system bohrer et al 2005 huang et al 2017 manoli et al 2014 sperry et al 1998 not withstanding this complication k ψl can be determined independently without requiring any knowledge of the photosynthetic properties or atmospheric drivers for gs hence unless otherwise stated it is assumed that k ψl is known and represents the up scaled xylem hydraulic system the supply demand balance of water flux sets another physical limit on gs because of f e crit and thus fc l3 in fig 1 last it is to be noted that maximizing fc ψl is equivalent to maximizing fe ψl this further suggests that the consideration of supply demand balance of co2 eq 2 and water eq 4 fluxes alone is not sufficient to predict the operating gs and fc i e operating fc is smaller than f c crit l4 in fig 1 moreover the operating leaf pressure must be larger than ψ l crit or smaller in magnitude to be shown later the limitations in the coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting system are required to determine the optimal operating leaf pressure for a given soil pressure a number of variants to this approach have also been proposed for example a modified sot that accounts for the soil xylem hydraulics can be expressed as novick et al 2016 5 h a x ψ l profit f c ψ l gain λ x f e ψ l cost h a x ψ l ψ l f c ψ l ψ l λ x f e ψ l ψ l 0 because gs is entirely described by ψl eq 5 can be directly derived from eq 3 by noting that h a x g s h a x ψ l ψ l g s 0 is equivalent to h a x ψ l 0 when ψl gs is always larger than zero see eq 4 the cost function in eq 5 represents the sought after limitation on gs and further includes soil xylem hydraulics as the modified sot explicitly accounts for the soil xylem hydraulics at the whole plant level to accommodate the effects of dry soil process i e varying ψs and ψl on gs eq 5 may be robust as λx is expected to be less variable when compared with its leaf level λl counterpart in the conventional sot a pre specified increasing function of λl with decreasing ψs is still required as discussed before however the specification of λx remains arbitrary another approach that bypasses the need for specifying λx altogether is to revise the objective function a matric of marginal xylem tension efficiency wolf et al 2016 or relative k losses sperry et al 2016a were recently suggested as alternatives to sot and are labeled as profit maximization their mathematical form can be still framed explicitly as gain cost thereby resembling h a x but without the need for a λx next sucrose production by product of photosynthesis and their transport in the phloem may offer new constraints on the leaf xylem hydraulic system or the marginal water use efficiency thereby mathematically closing the original problem linking xylem leaf phloem discussed in section 1 2 theory 2 1 modeling framework the leaf level gas exchange of water vapor and co2 liquid water and carbohydrate assumed to be sucrose mass fluxes in xylem and phloem are presented in fig 2 a the notations and units used throughout are listed in table 1 as noted earlier the relation between k and ψl here see eq 4 is reconstructed using a multi layer plant hydraulic model described elsewhere huang et al 2017 sperry et al 1998 and is not repeated the basic elements of this hydraulic model are as follows hydraulic architecture for both above and below ground compartments are not explicitly resolved but indirectly accounted for in the whole system hydraulic conductance i e k ψl the effects of plant water storage and hysteresis in k ψ l relation induced by the delay in repair of cavitated xylem conduits i e refilling are also not considered here see section 3 4 but can be accommodated in the present framework a number of features are pointed out regarding the numerical solution of the hydraulic model i e k ψ l relation 1 the leaf water potential ψ 12 at which hydraulic conductivity drops by 12 from its maximum value k max can be determined from the derived k ψ l relation and roughly coincides with the air entry pressure domec and gartner 2001 and 2 ψ 50 at which hydraulic conductivity drops by about 50 which is often used in safety efficiency studies is never attained in practice as ψ 50 ψ l crit operating ψl atmospheric conditions and soil water states are assumed to define the prevailing conditions for all leaves and absorbing roots respectively when ppfd 0 photosynthesis commences assimilated sugars that accumulate in the mesophyll are first transported to the companion cell and subsequently to the sieve elements in the loading zone i e leaf loading is achieved by either active i e polymer trapping and apoplastic pumping or passive i e molecular diffusion mechanisms turgeon 2010 passive loading is common in woody seed plants i e angiosperm and gymnosperm while many herbaceous species exhibit active loading jensen et al 2016 turgeon 2010 at the sub hourly time scale defined over a fixed period δt fc ψl fe ψl environmental factors e g atmospheric forcing and soil water status are assumed to be stationary hence over such δt period production rate of sucrose pc in the loading zone can be approximated by 6 p c n c δ t α β f c a l where nc are the moles of sucrose produced in the mesophyll cells and then transported into the loading zone and α 0 1 and β are the species specific loading efficiency and the number of sucrose molecules produced from one assimilated co2 molecule β 1 12 for sucrose only respectively it must be noted that for a stationary photosynthetic rate sucrose production and subsequent transport rate i e pc is assumed to be constant the α is set to be 1 when assuming that all the sucrose molecules assimilated from fc enter the loading zone over a δt period i e no time delay for different sucrose loading mechanisms hölttä et al 2017 nikinmaa et al 2013 the total water potential ψp in the loading zone of the phloem includes turgor pressure pp osmotic potential π and gravitational potential p g ρ g h where ρ is the liquid density that varies weakly with nc g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height above a datum set at the forest floor the kinetic energy head is ignored as expected for low reynolds number flows hence 7 ψ p p p π p g for an ideal solute and diluted sucrose concentration the loading phloem sap π can be computed from the van t hoff formula campbell and norman 1998 nobel 2009 given by 8 π r t p c where r is the gas constant tp is the absolute temperature of the loading phloem and c n c v p is the sucrose concentration accumulated over δt in the loading phloem volume vp the magnitude of pp is dictated by the elastic nature of sieve tubes and the amount of water stored in the loading phloem that is the relative change in vp due to alternating shrinkage and swelling determines pp i e elastic pressure volume curve over the short δt water storage in the loading phloem is also neglected and pp may be ignored relative to π jensen et al 2016 the amount of water drawn from nearby xylem conduits per unit time fw is then balanced by the water outflow from the loading phloem i e no water storage the fw is determined from the water permeability lxp and water potential gradient across the interface separating the xylem and phloem in the loading zone characterized by an area axp and is given by 9 f w a x p l x p ψ l ψ p thus the export of sucrose mass fs and its associated energy flux fe driven by the accumulated sucrose molecules over a δt period i e nc eq 6 from the loading phloem can be determined by 10 f s c f w f e q c f s where qc 5637 86 kj mol 1 is the energy content of sucrose eq 10 considers only advective and neglects diffusive and dispersive effects as well as any sucrose leaks i e no loss in nc over δt in the loading phloem previous studies have reported that phloem sap speed mainly depends on sieve element geometry jensen et al 2011 mullendore et al 2010 instead of plant height i e the whole path of sucrose flow throughout phloem dannoura et al 2011 liesche et al 2015 windt et al 2006 modeling analysis christy and ferrier 1973 thompson and holbrook 2003 also indicated that the water influx from xylem to phloem in the leaf is the main driver responsible for sucrose transport it is for these reasons that the aforementioned assumptions may not be too restrictive in natural settings jensen et al 2016 however it is to be noted that fe does not represent the actual instantaneous export of energy flux given the steady state assumption here δt must also be sufficiently large to allow accumulation of nc from mesophyll cells as needed to initiate phloem transport by osmosis after osmosis is initiated a pulse of energy i e fe occurs that then can be used to determine the optimal gs when fe is maximized residual sucrose molecules from a previous δt period in the loading cell are assumed to be negligible and do not impact fe or fs naturally δt must also be sufficiently long to allow for the transport of sugar molecules from the mesophyll cells into the loading cell and subsequent buildup of nc to initiate an osmo regulated flux that exports sugars out of the loading cell however δt must be sufficiently short so that fc and gs can be treated as stationary variables ideally a non steady state model that can accommodate transport processes of assimilated sugar from mesophyll to the companion cell and to the sieve elements in the leaf and to the sugar sinks i e storage and unloading throughout the plant see section 3 4 is required surrogating the effects of such unsteadiness to a pre fixed but constrained δt allows for the consideration of a quasi steady model to be formulated for the instantaneous export of energy flux when combining eqs 2 4 6 10 see appendix a fe to be maximized can now be expressed as a function of ψl and is given as 11 f e ψ l energy profit p g f c 2 ψ l energy gain e i ψ l p g f c ψ l limiting cost e c where g q c a x p l x p r t p α β a l δ t v p 2 and i v p a l α β δ t r t p 1 are constants i e independent of ψl associated with phloem system properties the fe here has a unit of joule per time and represents the energy profit due to the addition of sucrose molecules arising from f c 2 supplied by the atmosphere over a δt period the first term on the right hand side represents the energy gain e f c 2 ψ l but is constrained by the soil xylem hydraulic system for a given ψs see eqs 2 and 4 this constraint arises because the solutions of f c g s g s ψ l 0 and f e g s g s ψ l 0 are the same as ψl decreases with increasing gs a larger energy gain is achieved until the maximum permissible energy gain e e max is reached at ψ l crit however the decrease in ψl also impedes fw that drives fe see eqs 9 and 10 this mechanism which represents an additional cost of energy ec due to interaction between xylem and phloem in the loading leaf is the physical significance of the second term on the right hand side of eq 11 the ec is always a cost term because the value of ψ l p g is never positive when the drop in ψl reaches a certain threshold ψ l opt expected to occur before ψ l crit the increase in energy gain is no longer larger than the increase in the limiting cost implying diminishing returns of energy profit p in the system the optimal ψ l opt that ensures a maximum p i e fe can now be determined by setting 12 f e ψ l ψ l 0 when 2 f e ψ l ψ l 2 0 as shown in fig 2 b ψ l opt i e operating ψl is numerically solved through eq 12 for a given set of environmental factors physiological properties plant characteristics and constant parameters the corresponding gs ci fc and fe can be computed from eqs 2 and 4 eq 12 sets the optimal criterion that reflects the energetics of the evolution principle lotka 1922 in which the energy flux is maintained efficient maximum at current state when the system is explicitly subjected to the limiting constraints through the transport or physiological processes a favorable plant body that can enhance larger energy flux through the system may be further promoted by the maximum input of energy flux the points of departure from the conventional sot or profit maximization are that 1 the gain in the objective function here is proportional to f c 2 not fc and 2 the cost is directly derived not externally assumed from the limiting constraints imposed on the system and arises from xylem leaf phloem interaction in the present modeling framework however a number of mechanisms e g adjustments in mesophyll conductance and osmotic regulation with different soil water status that may potentially impact the transport system and subsequently the gain and cost are not considered but discussed later in section 3 4 we now show that the proposed approach recovers the form of objective function i e gain cost where gain and cost are linearly proportional to fc and fe or a function of ψl respectively in the conventional sot and profit maximization that predict gs for well watered soil condition 2 2 recovery of prior formulations for well watered soil conditions because prior gs formulations have been shown to describe a large corpus of data especially under well watered conditions it is assumed that their mathematical form offers a compact representation of all such experiments when the soil moisture content is near saturation i e ψs ψl and the operating ψl for plants shorter than c 20 m is much larger than pg at high fe manzoni et al 2013a eq 11 can be further simplified to see appendix a 13 f e w w ψ l g f c 2 ψ l m v i a l f e ψ l k ψ l f c ψ l where the energy profit f e ww is defined for well watered conditions again the optimal ψ l opt can be obtained by setting f e w w ψ l 0 that then yields 14 f c ψ l ψ l m v i a l 2 f e ψ l k ψ l f c ψ l f c ψ l ψ l m ψ l f e ψ l k ψ l n 0 a scaling analysis featured in appendix b compares the two contributions labeled m and n in eq 14 the outcome of this analysis shows smaller contribution of term m when compared with term n this finding may have been anticipated for well watered soil conditions because the reduction in k is usually small at ψs 0 when stomatal closure commonly occurs before the air entry point i e at ψl where 12 of k losses occur bond and kavanagh 1999 sparks and black 1999 based on this scaling analysis eq 14 can be further simplified to 15 ψ l f c ψ l i 2 ψ l 0 or 16 ψ l f c ψ l v p m v 2 α β k m a x δ t r t p λ x f e ψ l 0 interestingly eqs 15 and 16 converge respectively to the profit maximization wolf et al 2016 and to the modified sot eq 5 this convergence suggests a tight connection between the leaf xylem phloem system given the dissimilarity in objective functions the emergence of a linear relation between gs and ψl for a nearly constant k max at ψs 0 see eq 4 also results in the convergence of the conventional and modified sot s h a l g s g s 0 is equivalent to h a x ψ l ψ l 0 and λ l λ x one of the main novelties here is the predicted dependency of λx or λl on xylem and phloem properties arising from the condition f e w w ψ l 0 the analysis may also indicate why the time scale used for sot to predict gs remains uncertain buckley et al 2016 current uncertainty in determining λx arises from the inexact specification of δt again a non steady state model is needed to eliminate the dependency of λx or λl on δt an analytical solution for the proposed approach i e eq 16 can now be derived under some conditions assuming fc rd ci γ the optimal gs and ci ca are given as see appendix c 17 g s w w 1 k 2 γ a d λ x f c c a c i c a k 2 γ a λ x k 2 γ a λ x d the link between the xylem phloem and leaf is provided here by λx see eq 16 when fc operates under rubp limitation eq 17 converges to the form of gs derived from conventional sot proposed elsewhere medlyn et al 2011 if the higher order terms in the taylor series expansion expressing ci ca are neglected as shown in appendix c the optimal gs and ci ca simplify to 18 g s w w k 2 γ a λ x f c c a d 1 2 c i c a 1 a λ x k 2 γ d eq 18 also recovers the linear dependency of gs on fc ca as in bwb and leu models and suggests that me encodes the xylem phloem system properties also the predicted ci ca varies marginally with d as has been known for some time now wong et al 1979 eq 18 also recovers the form of optimal gs and ci ca derived by others katul et al 2010 2012 volpe et al 2011 when a linearized biochemical demand function is assumed as expected for rubisco limitations on fc the convergence of analytical solutions here can be expected when they are all derived from the same objective function i e eq 16 for well watered condition these analytical solutions mainly differ in the choice of rubp or rubisco limitations i e limitation regime is known on fc that can be bypassed when co limitation i e eq 1 is accounted for vico et al 2013 neglecting γ and rd may generate unrealistic gs responses at low ca although this assumption may not be too restrictive especially when ca is expected to increase above current level i e 400 ppm however these analytical solutions are invalid under water stress condition unless variations in λx with ψs can be appropriately described manzoni et al 2011 as suggested elsewhere prentice et al 2014 the optimal gs and ci ca under rubisco limitation can be assumed to operate with minimum maintenance cost that simultaneously maximizes fc and fe and are given as 19 g s w w 1 a 2 a d λ p f c c a c i c a 1 1 a λ p a 2 d where λp is the long term cost of maintaining transpirational stream relative to maintaining photosynthetic protein to support assimilation again the current approach recovers similar forms of gs and ci ca to eq 19 and the dependency of the apparent λp on k max 1 is also reflected by λx analytically derived here this dependency of λx on k max 1 has been inferred by fitting sot to a numerical model with consideration of whole plant sucrose transporting length hölttä et al 2017 the effects of drying soil process on gs is embedded in a b λ p k 1 in prentice et al 2014 that is equivalent to λx in sot while the increase in the carbon cost represented as a function of ψl i e θ ψl with decreasing ψl is assumed in wolf et al 2016 the modeling approaches proposed by prentice et al 2014 and wolf et al 2016 can accommodate how gs is impacted by the reduction in k as drought progresses but may not reflect the isohydric to anisohydric behavior that can be explained by the energy partitioning between p e and ec in eq 11 see section 3 2 in the absence of drought stress the convergence of various optimization goals shown here invites the use of the energetics of the evolution principle as a unifying hypothesis to predict gs 3 results and discussion to address the study objectives we first analyze how different transport and physiological processes impact the short term gs responses to environmental factors through model calculations featured in section 3 1 in particular we first examine the sensitivity of gs to d and ψl that has been well documented in the literature in section 3 2 we then explore how the difference in the coordinated leaf xylem phloem system determines different water use strategies among plants i e isohydric to anisohydric behavior during a soil dry down process the analysis here is accomplished by examining how the difference in the soil xylem hydraulics impact the energy partitioning in eq 11 i e p e and ec and hence the sensitivity of ψl to ψs and d we also explain the general decreasing trends in gs following elevated atmospheric co2 concentration sustained over long time scales in section 3 3 specifically how the adjustments in plant hydraulic and physiological properties in response to a new stationary co2 concentration level modify the value of λx dictating leaf level gas exchange is explored finally we briefly summarize the study limitation in the present modeling framework in section 3 4 for all the following model calculations i e model base case the physiological hydraulic and allometric attributes of soil plant system for coniferous species in general reported elsewhere huang et al 2017 are adopted physical characteristics of leaves and anatomical attributes of phloem for pinus taeda l listed in table 2 are used 3 1 stomatal responses to variations in environmental conditions to illustrate a number of features of the new gs model the focus now is on gs responses to short term sub daily variations in environmental factors it is assumed that at sub daily time scales the hydraulic and physiological properties of plants remain constant the proposed approach to gs captures the main features of stomatal responses to key environmental factors including ppfd ca d ta and ψs fig 3 the overall negative trends in gs with respect to increasing d aphalo and jarvis 1991 ball and farquhar 1984 farquhar et al 1980a grantz 1990 katul et al 2009 lange et al 1971 lendzion and leuschner 2008 massman and kaufmann 1991 mcadam and brodribb 2015 monteith 1995 morison and gifford 1983 oren et al 1999 schulze et al 1974 and decreasing ψs berninger et al 1996 are governed by the supply demand balance of water flux i e eq 4 that presets the maximum permissible stomatal conductance g s crit and subsequently e max in eq 11 at ψ l crit to examine the sensitivity of predicted gs to d the empirical relation between gs and d oren et al 1999 is adopted as it encodes a large corpus of leaf and sapflow data this expression is given as 20 g s g s r e f 1 m ln d where g s ref is the reference conductance at d 1 kpa and m is the ratio of dgs dln d to g s ref using all the model runs in fig 3 c the value of m determined by least square fit to eq 20 is 0 61 and is close to the value i e 0 59 derived from a meta analysis of c 30 species oren et al 1999 when ψs decreases the predicted relation between gs and ψl fig 4 also recovers a weibull type form that has been globally observed klein 2014 this weibull type g s ψ l relation is mainly dictated by the shape of k ψl i e soil xylem hydraulics without relying on a pre specified ψl dependent λx manzoni et al 2011 or any cost function linked with xylem hydraulics wolf et al 2016 formulated in sot or profit maximization the predicted c i c a 0 82 9 8 across all runs for well watered soil condition in fig 3 representing a relatively conservative ci ca when compared with gs fc fe and ψl this predicted near constant ci ca is supported by previous studies c i c a 0 6 0 9 drake et al 1997 ehleringer and cerling 1995 prentice et al 2014 wong et al 1979 based on a constant ci ca the general trends in negative stomatal response to ca mansfield et al 1990 messinger et al 2006 morison 1998 morison and gifford 1983 mott 1988 and positive stomatal response to ppfd and ta schulze et al 1974 wong et al 1979 are mainly reflected by the supply demand balance of co2 flux 3 2 coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery explaining isohydric to anisohydric behavior the analysis is now expanded to examine the coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery in species with different water use strategies across the spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior as drought progresses 3 2 1 general features of isohydric to anisohydric behavior and the model set up the isohydric to anisohydric behavior is mainly defined by the sensitivity of ψl to ψs and d martínez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 the general features differentiating isohydric and anisohydric behavior domec and johnson 2012 meinzer et al 2016 are that 1 isohydric species tend to maintain a relatively constant midday ψl that is less sensitive to decreasing ψs and increasing d 2 anisohydric species allow midday ψl to significantly decrease with decreasing ψs and increasing d such that a relatively larger fe and fc can be maintained when compared to isohydric species studies conducted to contrast isohydric and anisohydric behavior kolb and sperry 1999 mcdowell et al 2008 schultz 2003 sperry et al 1998 2002 reported that species with larger ψ 12 i e air entry point that is commonly defined at ψl where 12 of k losses occur tend to exhibit more isohydric behavior while anisohydric behavior occurs in species with a smaller ψ 12 the proposed model is now shown to be able to reconcile connections between ψ 12 and the defining features of isohydric to anisohydric for this reason two scenarios s1 with larger ψ 12 and s2 with smaller ψ 12 are now constructed to illustrate how the magnitude of ψ 12 modifies the leaf xylem phloem system and impacts isohydric to anisohydric behavior during reduced soil moisture conditions fig 5 all the model parameters used for s1 are the same as the model base case a smaller ψ 12 is selected for s2 but all other model parameters are maintained the same as s1 the plant hydraulic and physiological properties are assumed to be constant i e no acclimation or adaptation during a soil dry down process the environmental factors i e ppfd ta ca rh and ψs used in the model runs are maintained the same for s1 and s2 the model results i e predicted fe e e max ec e max and p e max for the two cases are respectively represented as red and gray solid lines for s1 and s2 in figs 5 and 6 for s1 a larger rh is also used in another model run to examine if a reduced d can modify isohydric to anisohydric behavior as represented by red dashed lines in figs 5 and 6 for s2 we also use a larger photosynthetic capacity i e larger k 1 and k 2 to explore the effects of relative magnitude of photosynthetic capacity in relation to the water transport capacity on the isohydric to anisohrdic behavior as represented by gray dashed lines in figs 5 and 6 specifically it is shown that maximizing the energy profit p across these two different ψ 12 scenarios recovers the key features delineating isohydric from anisohydric behavior for simplicity it is assumed that k max maintains a near constant value as loss of conductivity at ψ 12 is assumed to be minor 12 3 2 2 linkage between the energy partitioning in eq 11 and the sensitivity of fe and ψl to ψs and d as gs increases monotonically with decreasing ψl up to ψ l crit e max occurs at f c crit and can be surrogated to a preset f e crit for a given ψs the e max is constrained by the soil xylem limitation see eq 11 and section 1 2 however the corresponding ψ l crit does not guarantee a maximum p due to finite ec as discussed in section 2 1 in eq 11 maximum p occurs at ψ l opt ψ l crit and the corresponding predicted fe or fc can be used as an indicator for the actual level of e thus the energy partitioning between p e and ec in eq 11 fig 6 can be used to explain the sensitivity of fe and ψl to ψs and d that then determines isohydric to anisohydric behavior 3 2 3 similar behavior of isohydric and anisohydric plants under severe drought condition the common feature of the two scenarios is that the difference between f e crit i e orange lines in fig 5 b and d and predicted fe δfe decreases as drought progresses this decreasing trend in δfe is reflected by the increasing trend in e e max up to nearly unity implying that soil xylem limitation dominates p at a small ψs however e e max ψs 0 does not suggest that e is enhanced by a smaller ψs as ψs drops the decrease in e f c 2 is smaller than the decrease in e max f c c r i t 2 but p can be further suppressed by increasing ec when severe drought conditions persist 3 2 4 isohydric and anisohydric behavior when compared with s1 a smaller ψ 12 in s2 allows a more negative operating ψl i e anisohydric behavior that further enhances the impediment of sucrose transport i e ec the smaller e e max in the case of s2 also suggests that the maximum permissible water transport capacity i e f e crit significantly overshoots the actual fe required to attain the maximum p especially when ψs 0 this over built soil xylem hydraulics in s2 also permits a broader operating range of ψl in response to environmental factors such as d ppfd and ta in the absence of water stress it is advantageous to maintain maximum p and a larger fc f c crit although a larger fe can be achieved by changes in environmental conditions i e increasing d ppfd or ta when compared with s2 δfe in the case of s1 is smaller due to a larger ψ 12 i e isohydric behavior a narrower range of ψl where a nearly constant k max can operate it is suggested that the main limiting component is the soil xylem hydraulics leading to smaller ec and larger e e max in s1 although the maximum p e max f c c r i t 2 and operating e f c 2 in s1 are suppressed by a larger ψ 12 the limitation induced by the interaction between xylem and phloem in the loading leaf i e ec is also reduced due to a larger operating ψl however if d in the case of s1 is reduced the decrease in fe i e increase in ψl results in a larger δfe fig 5 b and smaller e e max fig 6 a where the enhancement in e max is larger than the enhancement in e a reduced d also suppresses ec due to the increase in ψl this finding suggests that the maximum p and operating e can be enhanced even when the range of ψl is small i e a larger ψ 12 for a nearly constant k max similar to s2 ψl in s1 can now respond to a wider range of d at short time scale as a consequence of reduced fe hence s1 and s2 may represent plant hydraulics associated with the more conservative and aggressive water use strategies for plants across the spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior however the range of ψl for a nearly constant k max to operate i e ψ 12 alone cannot be used to differentiate species with different water use strategy to illustrate δfe decreases with increasing photosynthetic capacity i e larger k 1 and k 2 are used in s2 leading to a shift from anisohydric to isohydric behavior i e narrower range of operating ψl along the gray dashed line as shown in fig 5 d a larger photosynthetic capacity also necessitates a larger fe that reduces δfe and increases e e max because soil xylem hydraulics now dominate with a reduced contribution of ec to p gray dashed lines in fig 6 d e and f to sum up it is fair to state that the photosynthetic capacity for isohydric species has the tendency to nearly exploit f e crit throughout a dry down i e e e max 1 isohydric plants are conservative water users i e limited by soil xylem hydraulics but their photosynthetic capacity is aggressively utilizing the soil xylem hydraulic system anisohydric plants by contrast are aggressive water users but they adopt more conservative photosynthetic capacity that requires smaller fe to maintain a maximum p compared to their f e crit state when responding to fluctuation in environmental conditions the compartments of the system appear to operate in a coordinated manner so as to maintain p e max without any apparent bottleneck even when ψs drops while previous experimental studies mainly focused on the variation of ψl during a dry down and the sensitivity of gs to d and ψs to distinguish isohydric to anisohydric behavior domec and johnson 2012 meinzer et al 2016 the finding here forms a new model generated hypothesis that has not been explored and requires testing in future field and laboratory experiments that is the magnitude of atmospheric aridity i e d and the relative magnitude of photosynthetic capacity in relation to the water transport capacity through soil xylem hydraulic system can shift isohydric to anisohydric behavior 3 3 long term effect of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration on leaf level gas exchange when plants acclimate or adapt to a changing environment leaf level gas exchange reflects concomitant adjustments in plant hydraulic and physiological properties under well watered soil conditions the closed form expressions for g s ww fc and water use efficiency wue f c f e can be derived by replacing eq 17 into the supply demand balance of co2 flux and are given as 21 g s w w k 1 1 k 2 γ a d λ x k 2 1 a d λ x k 2 γ c a f c k 1 c a k 2 1 a d λ x k 2 γ c a wue c a a d 1 k 2 γ a d λ x on long time scales xylem and phloem traits i e λx and photosynthetic parameters i e k 1 and k 2 in eq 21 are shaped by the environmental conditions they have experienced however g s ww fc wue and ci ca i e eq 17 represent short term leaf level responses to current states or environmental conditions a large time scale separation exists between variations in endogenous plant attributes encoded in λx k 1 and k 2 and instantaneous leaf level responses i e g s ww fc wue and ci ca for this reason eqs 21 and 17 only focus on how measured modifications in λx following long term elevated atmospheric co2 concentration modify photosynthetic parameters as well as g s ww ci ca ratio fc and wue for simplicity the focus is on formulations that assume absence of water stress after the plants experience different ca s on long time scales e g by comparing leaves grown under ambient and enriched ca conditions such a situation describes the setup for pinus taeda l growing under 200 ppm co2 above current level as reported from the duke free air co2 enrichment face site the duke face was conducted in a south eastern u s pine forest domec et al 2009 2016b tor ngern et al 2015 where leaf and plant hydraulic traits have been measured when other environmental conditions are maintained the same a reduced maximum leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf max was reported with increased ca in this case the maximum leaf specific tree conductance k s m a x k max a l decreased from 0 65 to 0 43 mmol m 2 s 1 mpa 1 domec et al 2016a as a result of the reduction in k leaf max domec et al 2009 this general decrease in k s max has been reported for ring porous diffuse porous coniferous and non woody species in a literature survey conducted on elevated co2 experiments over the last 40 years domec et al 2016a as shown in table 2 the needle size phloem diameter and the number of phloem cells per needle appear to be suppressed by increased atmospheric co2 when accounting for all the loading leaf at the canopy level the enhancement of canopy leaf area 16 mccarthy et al 2007 results in 35 6 decrease in k max but a nearly unaltered vp i e 5 8 decrease hence the expenditure of water loss λx is predicted by eq 16 to increase by 65 1 comparable with the percentage increase of λx i e 62 9 computed by inverting λx based on sot from leaf level gas exchange measurements at the same site katul et al 2010 furthermore the difference in photosynthetic parameters of pinus taeda l between control and elevated co2 plots is not significant ellsworth et al 2012 katul et al 2010 it was assumed here that acclimation of k 1 and k 2 did not occur e g no down regulation if λx is the only plant trait to be modified by elevated co2 the general trends in decreasing g s ww and ci ca ratio and increasing fc and wue with increasing ca ellsworth et al 2012 katul et al 2010 can be attributed to the combined effects of increasing λx and ca i e eq 21 however the suppression of g s ww and ci ca ratio by increasing λx is relatively small ellsworth et al 2012 katul et al 2010 when compared with the sensitivity of fc and wue to long term elevated co2 the increment of ca in the numerator of fc and wue further amplifies the effects of elevated co2 on fc and wue 3 4 study limitation given all the assumptions made to arrive at the proposed modeling approach it is instructive to present future improvements to the current formulation while retaining a quasi steady assumption for analytical tractability as suggested in a recent review of sot buckley et al 2016 aerodynamic modifications resulting from the interaction between wind speed and the leaf represented by boundary layer conductance gb and the co2 transport efficiency in the mesophyll encoded in the mesophyll conductance gm are required when their magnitudes are comparable with gs regarding gb the stomatal behavior can be altered appreciably by gb even when the state variables such as ta co2 and water vapor concentrations above the laminar boundary layer remain the same huang et al 2015 schymanski and or 2016 the effects of gb on gs have been incorporated into prior models using sot or profit maximization huang et al 2015 sperry et al 2016a wolf et al 2016 however gb was mainly characterized by mean wind speed and effective leaf size using empirical formulations that may not reflect wind contact angle leaf orientation and the micro roughness on the leaf surface and turbulent intensity with regard to gm the effects of gm on fc has been considered explicitly in some sot volpe et al 2011 and compared with empirical data to explore the partitioning between gs and gm under salt stressed conditions when soil water availability is not limited evidence that gm is finite and varies with various environmental factors has been reviewed elsewhere flexas et al 2008 with gm being reduced during persistent drought conditions grassi and magnani 2005 jones 1973 as suggested elsewhere gu and sun 2014 however the dependency of gm on ci or irradiance may be artifacts due to measurement methods uncertainties in modeling gs can be further reduced when the spatio temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil xylem hydraulic system are appropriately described plant water storage pws and hydraulic redistribution hr representing above and below ground water reservoirs are the two defining features that impact soil plant hydrodynamics and drought resilience domec et al 2010 goldstein et al 1998 huang et al 2017 maherali and delucia 2001 neumann and cardon 2012 prieto et al 2012 stratton et al 2000 to accommodate the overnight competition for water between pws and hr in modeling gs a multi layered scheme for solving water mass balance in each soil plant compartments is required huang et al 2017 the consideration of how the soil xylem hydraulics i e k ψ l relation is impacted by the delay refilling processes in air filled xylem conduits brodribb and cochard 2009 sperry and tyree 1990 is also required especially when the function of impaired xylem conduits cannot be recovered under water stress condition when coupled with light attenuation and turbulent flow models detailed representation of hydraulic architecture bohrer et al 2005 hentschel et al 2013 janott et al 2011 manoli et al 2014 2017 for individual plant can further assist understanding plant plant competition for water and light despite the plethora of complications to measure or model water relations withing the soil plant system an exhaustive theoretical treatment for the aforementioned mechanisms may also shed light on how the transport of chemical signals e g abscisic acid through xylem contributes to stomatal behavior tardieu 2016 in line with recent studies hölttä et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 lucas et al 2013 nikinmaa et al 2013 sevanto 2014 stroock et al 2014 the significance of the phloem anatomy and physiology associated with long distance sucrose transport on gs cannot be overlooked at the whole plant level sucrose export from the loading phloem here requires further elaboration to account for influences of loading efficiencies with different loading strategies viscosity built up due to sucrose accumulation elastic nature of sieve element thickness of the sieve plate and distribution of sieve pore radii jensen et al 2012 2014 liesche et al 2015 thompson and holbrook 2003 turgeon 2010 how the modifications of osmotic regulation in response to drought stress in each plant compartment impact the transport system dichio et al 2006 morgan 1984 should be also accounted for in future modeling efforts however the primary challenge remains at the long time scales different from quantifying short time scales stomatal responses the difficulty in evaluating how acclimation or adaptation of plant traits respond to the history of environmental conditions can be further accentuated by the fact that the climate system is also sensitive to feedbacks from plants thereby generating the so called feedback cycle 4 conclusion the significance of biotic controls through stomata on global carbon and water cycles food production and security and ecosystem services is rarely disputed we developed a mathematical model of stomata based on the premise of a coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery we hypothesize that this coordination evolved to maximize the sucrose mass flux out of the loading leaf because we consider that maximizing sucrose mass flux can be readily viewed as maximizing energy flux we proposed this as a qualitative link to lodka s maximum energy circulation principle in plants for a wide range of time scales the proposed approach captures the general features of stomatal sensitivity to environmental factors and hydrological states the proposed framework explains how the carbon and water economies are intrinsically linked by the coordination among the main mass transporting networks within plants that dictates the much debated isohydric to anisohydric behavior to permit analytical foresight only the main transporting processes impacting gs are accounted for in the soil xylem leaf phloem system variable sucrose sinks and stores from the loading to the unloading zones were not explicitly treated here recent research trends are beginning to address carbon allocation and sinks throughout the entire plant system fatichi et al 2014 hartmann and trumbore 2016 savage et al 2015 and the framework here must be viewed as one step in this direction it offers immanent constraints as to how gs responds to its environment on multiple time scales pertinent to the xylem leaf phloem transport system field and laboratory testing of the proposed approach here are topics for future studies acknowledgments we acknowledge support from the national science foundation

777,links between the carbon and water economies of plants are coupled by combining the biochemical demand for atmospheric co2 with gas transfer through stomates liquid water transport in the soil xylem hydraulic system and sucrose export in the phloem we formulated a model to predict stomatal conductance gs consistent with the maximum energy circulation concept of lotka and odum by maximizing the sucrose flux out of photosynthesizing leaves the proposed modeling approach recovers all prior results derived from stomatal optimization theories and profit maximization arguments for the xylem hydraulic system aimed at predicting gs the novel features of this approach are its ability to 1 predict the price of losing water in carbon units using xylem and phloem properties i e the marginal water use efficiency and 2 explain why water molecules become more expensive to exchange for co2 molecules when soil moisture becomes limiting or when plants acclimate to new elevated atmospheric co2 concentration on short time scales sub daily predicted gs under many environmental stimuli were consistent with measurements reported in the literature including a general sensitivity of gs to vapor

delivery to leaves and carbohydrate trans location from leaves to reserves root exudation and export to symbionts fatichi et al 2014 pittermann 2010 thompson and katul 2012 it is now accepted that a framework linking stomatal function to such water delivery and trans location of carbohydrates is needed to assess how vegetation structure and its spatial patterns is impacted by future climate conditions and vice versa hölttä et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 mencuccini and hölttä 2010 nikinmaa et al 2013 savage et al 2015 sevanto 2014 sperry and love 2015 the general features of this framework

buckley et al 2016 damour et al 2010 katul et al 2012 2009 medlyn et al 2011 paschalis et al 2017 because stomatal function balances photosynthetic carbon gain and water loss transpiration to the atmosphere a number of arguments have been offered to displace the original sot at the leaf scale cowan and farquhar 1977 at the whole plant level soil xylem hydraulics i e outcome of supply and demand for water and carbohydrate mainly sucrose transport efficiency in the phloem impose appreciable constraints so as to govern leaf level gas exchange hölttä et al 2017 2006 jensen et al 2016 mencuccini and hölttä 2010 nikinmaa et al 2013 savage et al 2015 sevanto 2014 sperry and love 2015 the work here shows that the original sot at the leaf scale cowan and farquhar 1977 the maximization of water flow in the xylem and variants on them the maximization of carbohydrate transport and attainment of a near constant inter cellular to ambient atmospheric co2 hypothesis prentice et al 2014 all lead to similar formulations for stomatal conductance under well watered soil condition what is different across these approaches is the interpretation of parameters e g the cost term used to maximize or minimize the objective function and their short term responses to boundary conditions such as root zone soil moisture and changes in ca despite differences in what these approaches maximize or minimize a similarity in outcome may be hinting that a more general principle is governing plant responses to fluctuating environmental conditions the main focus of the work here our conjecture is that plants may have evolved a coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery that confers some competitive advantages in fluctuating environmental conditions such a coordination should manifest itself in linkages between the properties describing the photosynthetic machinery the hydraulic and carbohydrate transporting systems it will be remiss if analogies to the energetics of evolution principle as a consequence of natural selection proposed in 1922 by lotka lotka 1922 odum and hall 1995 are not pointed out this principle states that natural selection tends to make the energy flux through the system a maximum so far as compatible with the constraints to which the system is subject as indicated by lotka the maximum input of energy flux exceeding the actual energy demand for growth maintenance defense and reproduction at the current states offers a great opportunity in the future to develop an advantageous plant body that can promote larger total energy flux through the system in the plant kingdom the input of energy flux can be expressed as the sucrose flux rendered out of the loading leaf environmental conditions and endogenous transport processes affecting this energy flux represent the limiting constraints to the system it is with this view that coordination among the xylem phloem and leaf is interpreted as an energy capturing device to direct available energy into the system by harvesting limited resources lotka 1922 1 1 hypothesis in light of the energetics of the evolution principle lotka 1922 we hypothesize that stomatal conductance gs can be predicted by assuming coordination in the leaf xylem phloem system thereby recovering the mathematical form of the aforementioned approaches the criterion for predicting gs is that this coordination maintains efficient maximum transport rate of photoassimlates i e energy flux out of the loading zone over short time intervals δt so as to ensure maximum energy circulation at the whole plant level when coupling the transport and physiological processes in the leaf xylem phloem system i e photosynthetic machinery water transport in xylem and export of assimilated sugar from loading phloem how the limiting constraints induced by these processes and their interaction impact the energy flux entering the plant system and subsequently gs are now considered explicitly in this new modeling approach specifically this hypothesis offers a number of advantages 1 the phloem transport efficiency is no longer isolated from the photosynthetic machinery soil xylem hydraulics and stomatal function as is now recognized hölttä et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 mencuccini and hölttä 2010 nikinmaa et al 2013 sevanto et al 2014 2 the hypothetical assumption of pricing water loss in sot or fitness costs of low xylem water potential in profit maximization is by passed it should be noted that the transport rate of photoassimlates out of the loading zone represents the objective function to be maximized which is similar to the non steady state model proposed elsewhere nikinmaa et al 2013 adopting this hypothesis the objective of this work is to analyze gs responses to environmental factors and plant attributes across a wide range of time scales we also focus specifically on two consequences of the model results i the gs responses to long term elevated co2 conditions and ii progressive drought as well as species differentiation across the spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior before presenting the model formulation the constraints on photosynthesis and xylem water movement are briefly reviewed with a lens on their connections 1 2 constraints on photosynthesis and water transport for c3 plants the photosynthetic machinery limits the biochemical demand for co2 f c d mathematically f c d can be expressed as the outcome of co limitation of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco kinetic activity and ribulose 1 5 biphosphate rubp regeneration rate farquhar et al 1980b approximated by vico et al 2013 1 f c d k 1 c i γ k 2 c i r d where ci is the inter cellular co2 concentration k 1 and k 2 are photosynthetic parameters that vary with ppfd and ta γ is the co2 compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration and rd is the daytime mitochondrial respiration rate eq 1 is a hyperbolic function imposing the most limiting factor through electron transport rate at high ci i e f c d j 4 r d when k 1 j 4 where j is the electron transport rate or through rubisco activity at

atmosphere and kc and ko are respectively the michaelis constants for co2 fixation and oxygen inhibition vico et al 2013 when operating under co limitation regime eq 1 also ensures a continuous transition between the two photosynthetic limitations for ci f c d saturates at a maximum f c m a x k 1 r d i e the asymptotic behavior of f c c i curve f c d c i k 1 c i γ k 2 c i r d c i hence when ci availability is not limiting photosynthesis is only constrained by the photosynthetic machinery usually through electron transport rubp limitation l1 in fig 1 although an infinite ci is not realistic for any condition this extreme case may be used to explain the rapid land colonization by plants in the ordovician and their subsequent productivity during the silurian devonian approximately 400 million years ago during this time period ca reached up to 5000 ppm berner 1991 berner and kothavala 2001 and the long term ci ca commonly ranged from 0 6 to 0 9 drake et al 1997 ehleringer and cerling 1995 prentice et al 2014 wong et al 1979 it was this era when photorespiration was potentially suppressed and water use efficiency remained high sperry 2003 for present ca conditions 400 ppm the assimilation rate is further limited by the atmospheric supply of co2 which in turn is governed by ca the transport efficiency to co2 through the stomatal pathway i e stomatal conductance gs and the laminar boundary layer attached to the leaf surface assuming an infinitesimal thickness of the laminar boundary layer i e well coupled condition and a mesophyll conductance to co2 that is much larger than gs the atmospheric supply of co2 across the stomatal aperture can be described by a fickian diffusion and is given as f c s g s c a c i if all co2 molecules diffusing through stomata are eventually assimilated then the supply and demand for co2 are in balance resulting in f c s f c d the f c s f c d results in an actual photosynthetic rate fc that can then be expressed as a function of gs and the photosynthetic parameters huang et al 2015 katul et al 2010 2 f c g s 1 2 k 1 k 2 c a g s r d k 1 k 2 c a g s r d 2 4 g s c a g s k 2 k 2 r d k 1 γ for gs i e stomata do not limit photosynthesis ci ca and a finite maximum f c k 1 c a γ k 2 c a r d is guaranteed see eq 1 again this is another reference condition where fc is now bounded by finite ca l2 in fig 1 when ca f c max is recovered for a finite gs fc is limited by gs see eq 2 as well as environmental conditions through their effects on k 1 k 2 and γ as shown later such limitations are dictated by the coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery eq 2 demonstrates that an additional and independent link between fc and gs is needed to mathematically solve for gs fc and ci from c i c a 1 f c s g s c a in current climate and land surface models this independent expression is provided using one of two semi empirical formulations proposed by ball et al 1987 bwb and leuning 1995 leu thereby allowing fc gs and ci to be predicted baldocchi and meyers 1998 juang et al 2008 lai et al 2000 sellers et al 1996 1995 siqueira and katul 2002 the common feature of bwb and leu models is that g s m e f c c a γ f where me is an empirical parameter linking gs to f c c a γ and the reduction function f r h or 1 d d 0 1 is an atmospheric aridity function where rh is the relative humidity d is the vapor pressure deficit and d 0 is a normalizing constant how gs is impacted by the measures of atmospheric aridity such as rh and d is included in bwb and leu models the linkage between gs and fc ca through f is perhaps not surprising when water loss through the stomatal pathway i e atmospheric evaporative demand f e d agsd pa where a 1 6 is the relative diffusivity of water vapor with respect to co2 and pa is the atmospheric pressure is inevitable during photosynthesis the gs should satisfy both the atmospheric evaporative demand i e f e d and the supply demand balance of co2 i e f c s f c d eq 2 such atmospheric evaporative loss from the leaf as driven by the biochemical demand for co2 and the aridity of the atmosphere only serves as an upper bound for water vapor loss the actual water supply to satisfy the atmospheric evaporative demand also depends on soil water availability and whole system hydraulic conductance k integrated throughout the entire water flow path commencing from the soil and progressing to the distal parts of the plants sperry and love 2015 when xylem water potential decreases originally functional i e water filled xylem conduits can be occupied by air drawn from neighboring air filled conduits through inter conduit pit membranes such that water is no longer conducted by these dysfunctional conduits crombie et al 1985 sperry and tyree 1988 1990 similar to xylem soil water conductivity that varies with decreasing water potential is also reduced by spreading air over pore space between soil particles the bwb and leu models do not explicitly or mechanistically consider how gs is impacted by reductions in k due to progressive soil drying i e soil xylem hydraulic limitation the effects of such soil drying is represented by ad hoc reductions in me tuzet et al 2003 based on the economics of leaf level gas exchange berninger and hari 1993 cowan and farquhar 1977 givnish and vermeij 1976 hari et al 1986 konrad et al 2008 stomatal optimization theories sot provide an alternative approach to predict gs in sot the stomatal aperture variation is assumed to maximize carbon gain subjected to a cost of water loss incurred during transpiration in carbon units cost function this constrained optimization theory is equivalent to maximizing the objective function or hamiltonian defined as 3 h a l g s f c g s gain λ l f e d g s cost h a l g s g s f c g s g s λ l f e d g s g s 0 with f c g s f e d g s λ l 0 where the cost function is determined by the unit cost of water loss λl also known as the marginal water use efficiency or lagrange multiplier under some conditions the analytical form of gs derived from sot is per se similar to bwb and leu models katul et al 2010 2012 medlyn et al 2011 volpe et al 2011 for the optimal solution to hold λl must be a constant independent of short term stomatal aperture fluctuations e g sub hourly katul et al 2009 however λl may vary on longer time scales such as those commensurate with drying soil daily or any structural acclimation or adaptation monthly or yearly buckley et al 2016 manzoni et al 2013b stated differently λl can be inferred from fc gs f e d gs provided a large time scale separation exists between the gs and λl variability katul et al 2010 manzoni et al 2011 similar to bwb and leu models the representation of water loss in sot f e d does not directly account for water supply limitations imposed by the soil xylem hydraulic system wolf et al 2016 to capture such effects in drying soil conditions an ad hoc increase in λl with decreasing soil water status must be a priori specified manzoni et al 2011 soil xylem hydraulics may offer a logical alternative to such ad hoc specification a linkage between gs and soil xylem hydraulics can be obtained by the supply demand balance for water manzoni et al 2014 sperry and love 2015 sperry et al 2016b given as 4 f e s k ψ l ψ s ψ l m v a l a g s d p a f e d resulting in g s ψ l k ψ l ψ s ψ l p a a d m v a l where f e s represents the steady state water supply function determined by the overall k ψl and the total water potential difference between the soil ψs and the leaf xylem ψl mv is the molecular weight of water and al is the leaf area when coupling the supply demand balance of co2 eq 2 and water eq 4 fluxes through gs an fc ψl relation can be derived without invoking a cost function and its associated unknown parameter λl as in sot however ψl is now necessary to determine fc prompting interest in possible links between sot and soil xylem hydraulics as a necessary step to link soil xylem hydraulics to sot two remarks are in order 1 gs is entirely described by ψl at a given ψs as given by eq 4 provided that the k ψl is known and 2 fc gs is a monotonically increasing function with increasing gs as dictated by eq 2 these two remarks imply that fc gs is a maximum at the maximum gs allowed by eq 4 and this maximum can be evaluated from g s ψ l 0 the associated leaf pressure satisfying g s ψ l 0 is hereafter referred to as ψ l crit the water and co2 fluxes at ψ l crit must represent the maximum permissible water transport capacity f e crit and the maximum permissible assimilation rate f c crit that can be supported by the soil xylem hydraulic system to the leaf at a given ψs manzoni et al 2013a sperry et al 2002 to solve the equation g s ψ l 0 and determine ψ l crit k ψl must be a priori determined there are multiple approaches to determine k ψl at the plant scale that often necessitate detailed hydraulic models through the soil root xylem system bohrer et al 2005 huang et al 2017 manoli et al 2014 sperry et al 1998 not withstanding this complication k ψl can be determined independently without requiring any knowledge of the photosynthetic properties or atmospheric drivers for gs hence unless otherwise stated it is assumed that k ψl is known and represents the up scaled xylem hydraulic system the supply demand balance of water flux sets another physical limit on gs because of f e crit and thus fc l3 in fig 1 last it is to be noted that maximizing fc ψl is equivalent to maximizing fe ψl this further suggests that the consideration of supply demand balance of co2 eq 2 and water eq 4 fluxes alone is not sufficient to predict the operating gs and fc i e operating fc is smaller than f c crit l4 in fig 1 moreover the operating leaf pressure must be larger than ψ l crit or smaller in magnitude to be shown later the limitations in the coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting system are required to determine the optimal operating leaf pressure for a given soil pressure a number of variants to this approach have also been proposed for example a modified sot that accounts for the soil xylem hydraulics can be expressed as novick et al 2016 5 h a x ψ l profit f c ψ l gain λ x f e ψ l cost h a x ψ l ψ l f c ψ l ψ l λ x f e ψ l ψ l 0 because gs is entirely described by ψl eq 5 can be directly derived from eq 3 by noting that h a x g s h a x ψ l ψ l g s 0 is equivalent to h a x ψ l 0 when ψl gs is always larger than zero see eq 4 the cost function in eq 5 represents the sought after limitation on gs and further includes soil xylem hydraulics as the modified sot explicitly accounts for the soil xylem hydraulics at the whole plant level to accommodate the effects of dry soil process i e varying ψs and ψl on gs eq 5 may be robust as λx is expected to be less variable when compared with its leaf level λl counterpart in the conventional sot a pre specified increasing function of λl with decreasing ψs is still required as discussed before however the specification of λx remains arbitrary another approach that bypasses the need for specifying λx altogether is to revise the objective function a matric of marginal xylem tension efficiency wolf et al 2016 or relative k losses sperry et al 2016a were recently suggested as alternatives to sot and are labeled as profit maximization their mathematical form can be still framed explicitly as gain cost thereby resembling h a x but without the need for a λx next sucrose production by product of photosynthesis and their transport in the phloem may offer new constraints on the leaf xylem hydraulic system or the marginal water use efficiency thereby mathematically closing the original problem linking xylem leaf phloem discussed in section 1 2 theory 2 1 modeling framework the leaf level gas exchange of water vapor and co2 liquid water and carbohydrate assumed to be sucrose mass fluxes in xylem and phloem are presented in fig 2 a the notations and units used throughout are listed in table 1 as noted earlier the relation between k and ψl here see eq 4 is reconstructed using a multi layer plant hydraulic model described elsewhere huang et al 2017 sperry et al 1998 and is not repeated the basic elements of this hydraulic model are as follows hydraulic architecture for both above and below ground compartments are not explicitly resolved but indirectly accounted for in the whole system hydraulic conductance i e k ψl the effects of plant water storage and hysteresis in k ψ l relation induced by the delay in repair of cavitated xylem conduits i e refilling are also not considered here see section 3 4 but can be accommodated in the present framework a number of features are pointed out regarding the numerical solution of the hydraulic model i e k ψ l relation 1 the leaf water potential ψ 12 at which hydraulic conductivity drops by 12 from its maximum value k max can be determined from the derived k ψ l relation and roughly coincides with the air entry pressure domec and gartner 2001 and 2 ψ 50 at which hydraulic conductivity drops by about 50 which is often used in safety efficiency studies is never attained in practice as ψ 50 ψ l crit operating ψl atmospheric conditions and soil water states are assumed to define the prevailing conditions for all leaves and absorbing roots respectively when ppfd 0 photosynthesis commences assimilated sugars that accumulate in the mesophyll are first transported to the companion cell and subsequently to the sieve elements in the loading zone i e leaf loading is achieved by either active i e polymer trapping and apoplastic pumping or passive i e molecular diffusion mechanisms turgeon 2010 passive loading is common in woody seed plants i e angiosperm and gymnosperm while many herbaceous species exhibit active loading jensen et al 2016 turgeon 2010 at the sub hourly time scale defined over a fixed period δt fc ψl fe ψl environmental factors e g atmospheric forcing and soil water status are assumed to be stationary hence over such δt period production rate of sucrose pc in the loading zone can be approximated by 6 p c n c δ t α β f c a l where nc are the moles of sucrose produced in the mesophyll cells and then transported into the loading zone and α 0 1 and β are the species specific loading efficiency and the number of sucrose molecules produced from one assimilated co2 molecule β 1 12 for sucrose only respectively it must be noted that for a stationary photosynthetic rate sucrose production and subsequent transport rate i e pc is assumed to be constant the α is set to be 1 when assuming that all the sucrose molecules assimilated from fc enter the loading zone over a δt period i e no time delay for different sucrose loading mechanisms hölttä et al 2017 nikinmaa et al 2013 the total water potential ψp in the loading zone of the phloem includes turgor pressure pp osmotic potential π and gravitational potential p g ρ g h where ρ is the liquid density that varies weakly with nc g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height above a datum set at the forest floor the kinetic energy head is ignored as expected for low reynolds number flows hence 7 ψ p p p π p g for an ideal solute and diluted sucrose concentration the loading phloem sap π can be computed from the van t hoff formula campbell and norman 1998 nobel 2009 given by 8 π r t p c where r is the gas constant tp is the absolute temperature of the loading phloem and c n c v p is the sucrose concentration accumulated over δt in the loading phloem volume vp the magnitude of pp is dictated by the elastic nature of sieve tubes and the amount of water stored in the loading phloem that is the relative change in vp due to alternating shrinkage and swelling determines pp i e elastic pressure volume curve over the short δt water storage in the loading phloem is also neglected and pp may be ignored relative to π jensen et al 2016 the amount of water drawn from nearby xylem conduits per unit time fw is then balanced by the water outflow from the loading phloem i e no water storage the fw is determined from the water permeability lxp and water potential gradient across the interface separating the xylem and phloem in the loading zone characterized by an area axp and is given by 9 f w a x p l x p ψ l ψ p thus the export of sucrose mass fs and its associated energy flux fe driven by the accumulated sucrose molecules over a δt period i e nc eq 6 from the loading phloem can be determined by 10 f s c f w f e q c f s where qc 5637 86 kj mol 1 is the energy content of sucrose eq 10 considers only advective and neglects diffusive and dispersive effects as well as any sucrose leaks i e no loss in nc over δt in the loading phloem previous studies have reported that phloem sap speed mainly depends on sieve element geometry jensen et al 2011 mullendore et al 2010 instead of plant height i e the whole path of sucrose flow throughout phloem dannoura et al 2011 liesche et al 2015 windt et al 2006 modeling analysis christy and ferrier 1973 thompson and holbrook 2003 also indicated that the water influx from xylem to phloem in the leaf is the main driver responsible for sucrose transport it is for these reasons that the aforementioned assumptions may not be too restrictive in natural settings jensen et al 2016 however it is to be noted that fe does not represent the actual instantaneous export of energy flux given the steady state assumption here δt must also be sufficiently large to allow accumulation of nc from mesophyll cells as needed to initiate phloem transport by osmosis after osmosis is initiated a pulse of energy i e fe occurs that then can be used to determine the optimal gs when fe is maximized residual sucrose molecules from a previous δt period in the loading cell are assumed to be negligible and do not impact fe or fs naturally δt must also be sufficiently long to allow for the transport of sugar molecules from the mesophyll cells into the loading cell and subsequent buildup of nc to initiate an osmo regulated flux that exports sugars out of the loading cell however δt must be sufficiently short so that fc and gs can be treated as stationary variables ideally a non steady state model that can accommodate transport processes of assimilated sugar from mesophyll to the companion cell and to the sieve elements in the leaf and to the sugar sinks i e storage and unloading throughout the plant see section 3 4 is required surrogating the effects of such unsteadiness to a pre fixed but constrained δt allows for the consideration of a quasi steady model to be formulated for the instantaneous export of energy flux when combining eqs 2 4 6 10 see appendix a fe to be maximized can now be expressed as a function of ψl and is given as 11 f e ψ l energy profit p g f c 2 ψ l energy gain e i ψ l p g f c ψ l limiting cost e c where g q c a x p l x p r t p α β a l δ t v p 2 and i v p a l α β δ t r t p 1 are constants i e independent of ψl associated with phloem system properties the fe here has a unit of joule per time and represents the energy profit due to the addition of sucrose molecules arising from f c 2 supplied by the atmosphere over a δt period the first term on the right hand side represents the energy gain e f c 2 ψ l but is constrained by the soil xylem hydraulic system for a given ψs see eqs 2 and 4 this constraint arises because the solutions of f c g s g s ψ l 0 and f e g s g s ψ l 0 are the same as ψl decreases with increasing gs a larger energy gain is achieved until the maximum permissible energy gain e e max is reached at ψ l crit however the decrease in ψl also impedes fw that drives fe see eqs 9 and 10 this mechanism which represents an additional cost of energy ec due to interaction between xylem and phloem in the loading leaf is the physical significance of the second term on the right hand side of eq 11 the ec is always a cost term because the value of ψ l p g is never positive when the drop in ψl reaches a certain threshold ψ l opt expected to occur before ψ l crit the increase in energy gain is no longer larger than the increase in the limiting cost implying diminishing returns of energy profit p in the system the optimal ψ l opt that ensures a maximum p i e fe can now be determined by setting 12 f e ψ l ψ l 0 when 2 f e ψ l ψ l 2 0 as shown in fig 2 b ψ l opt i e operating ψl is numerically solved through eq 12 for a given set of environmental factors physiological properties plant characteristics and constant parameters the corresponding gs ci fc and fe can be computed from eqs 2 and 4 eq 12 sets the optimal criterion that reflects the energetics of the evolution principle lotka 1922 in which the energy flux is maintained efficient maximum at current state when the system is explicitly subjected to the limiting constraints through the transport or physiological processes a favorable plant body that can enhance larger energy flux through the system may be further promoted by the maximum input of energy flux the points of departure from the conventional sot or profit maximization are that 1 the gain in the objective function here is proportional to f c 2 not fc and 2 the cost is directly derived not externally assumed from the limiting constraints imposed on the system and arises from xylem leaf phloem interaction in the present modeling framework however a number of mechanisms e g adjustments in mesophyll conductance and osmotic regulation with different soil water status that may potentially impact the transport system and subsequently the gain and cost are not considered but discussed later in section 3 4 we now show that the proposed approach recovers the form of objective function i e gain cost where gain and cost are linearly proportional to fc and fe or a function of ψl respectively in the conventional sot and profit maximization that predict gs for well watered soil condition 2 2 recovery of prior formulations for well watered soil conditions because prior gs formulations have been shown to describe a large corpus of data especially under well watered conditions it is assumed that their mathematical form offers a compact representation of all such experiments when the soil moisture content is near saturation i e ψs ψl and the operating ψl for plants shorter than c 20 m is much larger than pg at high fe manzoni et al 2013a eq 11 can be further simplified to see appendix a 13 f e w w ψ l g f c 2 ψ l m v i a l f e ψ l k ψ l f c ψ l where the energy profit f e ww is defined for well watered conditions again the optimal ψ l opt can be obtained by setting f e w w ψ l 0 that then yields 14 f c ψ l ψ l m v i a l 2 f e ψ l k ψ l f c ψ l f c ψ l ψ l m ψ l f e ψ l k ψ l n 0 a scaling analysis featured in appendix b compares the two contributions labeled m and n in eq 14 the outcome of this analysis shows smaller contribution of term m when compared with term n this finding may have been anticipated for well watered soil conditions because the reduction in k is usually small at ψs 0 when stomatal closure commonly occurs before the air entry point i e at ψl where 12 of k losses occur bond and kavanagh 1999 sparks and black 1999 based on this scaling analysis eq 14 can be further simplified to 15 ψ l f c ψ l i 2 ψ l 0 or 16 ψ l f c ψ l v p m v 2 α β k m a x δ t r t p λ x f e ψ l 0 interestingly eqs 15 and 16 converge respectively to the profit maximization wolf et al 2016 and to the modified sot eq 5 this convergence suggests a tight connection between the leaf xylem phloem system given the dissimilarity in objective functions the emergence of a linear relation between gs and ψl for a nearly constant k max at ψs 0 see eq 4 also results in the convergence of the conventional and modified sot s h a l g s g s 0 is equivalent to h a x ψ l ψ l 0 and λ l λ x one of the main novelties here is the predicted dependency of λx or λl on xylem and phloem properties arising from the condition f e w w ψ l 0 the analysis may also indicate why the time scale used for sot to predict gs remains uncertain buckley et al 2016 current uncertainty in determining λx arises from the inexact specification of δt again a non steady state model is needed to eliminate the dependency of λx or λl on δt an analytical solution for the proposed approach i e eq 16 can now be derived under some conditions assuming fc rd ci γ the optimal gs and ci ca are given as see appendix c 17 g s w w 1 k 2 γ a d λ x f c c a c i c a k 2 γ a λ x k 2 γ a λ x d the link between the xylem phloem and leaf is provided here by λx see eq 16 when fc operates under rubp limitation eq 17 converges to the form of gs derived from conventional sot proposed elsewhere medlyn et al 2011 if the higher order terms in the taylor series expansion expressing ci ca are neglected as shown in appendix c the optimal gs and ci ca simplify to 18 g s w w k 2 γ a λ x f c c a d 1 2 c i c a 1 a λ x k 2 γ d eq 18 also recovers the linear dependency of gs on fc ca as in bwb and leu models and suggests that me encodes the xylem phloem system properties also the predicted ci ca varies marginally with d as has been known for some time now wong et al 1979 eq 18 also recovers the form of optimal gs and ci ca derived by others katul et al 2010 2012 volpe et al 2011 when a linearized biochemical demand function is assumed as expected for rubisco limitations on fc the convergence of analytical solutions here can be expected when they are all derived from the same objective function i e eq 16 for well watered condition these analytical solutions mainly differ in the choice of rubp or rubisco limitations i e limitation regime is known on fc that can be bypassed when co limitation i e eq 1 is accounted for vico et al 2013 neglecting γ and rd may generate unrealistic gs responses at low ca although this assumption may not be too restrictive especially when ca is expected to increase above current level i e 400 ppm however these analytical solutions are invalid under water stress condition unless variations in λx with ψs can be appropriately described manzoni et al 2011 as suggested elsewhere prentice et al 2014 the optimal gs and ci ca under rubisco limitation can be assumed to operate with minimum maintenance cost that simultaneously maximizes fc and fe and are given as 19 g s w w 1 a 2 a d λ p f c c a c i c a 1 1 a λ p a 2 d where λp is the long term cost of maintaining transpirational stream relative to maintaining photosynthetic protein to support assimilation again the current approach recovers similar forms of gs and ci ca to eq 19 and the dependency of the apparent λp on k max 1 is also reflected by λx analytically derived here this dependency of λx on k max 1 has been inferred by fitting sot to a numerical model with consideration of whole plant sucrose transporting length hölttä et al 2017 the effects of drying soil process on gs is embedded in a b λ p k 1 in prentice et al 2014 that is equivalent to λx in sot while the increase in the carbon cost represented as a function of ψl i e θ ψl with decreasing ψl is assumed in wolf et al 2016 the modeling approaches proposed by prentice et al 2014 and wolf et al 2016 can accommodate how gs is impacted by the reduction in k as drought progresses but may not reflect the isohydric to anisohydric behavior that can be explained by the energy partitioning between p e and ec in eq 11 see section 3 2 in the absence of drought stress the convergence of various optimization goals shown here invites the use of the energetics of the evolution principle as a unifying hypothesis to predict gs 3 results and discussion to address the study objectives we first analyze how different transport and physiological processes impact the short term gs responses to environmental factors through model calculations featured in section 3 1 in particular we first examine the sensitivity of gs to d and ψl that has been well documented in the literature in section 3 2 we then explore how the difference in the coordinated leaf xylem phloem system determines different water use strategies among plants i e isohydric to anisohydric behavior during a soil dry down process the analysis here is accomplished by examining how the difference in the soil xylem hydraulics impact the energy partitioning in eq 11 i e p e and ec and hence the sensitivity of ψl to ψs and d we also explain the general decreasing trends in gs following elevated atmospheric co2 concentration sustained over long time scales in section 3 3 specifically how the adjustments in plant hydraulic and physiological properties in response to a new stationary co2 concentration level modify the value of λx dictating leaf level gas exchange is explored finally we briefly summarize the study limitation in the present modeling framework in section 3 4 for all the following model calculations i e model base case the physiological hydraulic and allometric attributes of soil plant system for coniferous species in general reported elsewhere huang et al 2017 are adopted physical characteristics of leaves and anatomical attributes of phloem for pinus taeda l listed in table 2 are used 3 1 stomatal responses to variations in environmental conditions to illustrate a number of features of the new gs model the focus now is on gs responses to short term sub daily variations in environmental factors it is assumed that at sub daily time scales the hydraulic and physiological properties of plants remain constant the proposed approach to gs captures the main features of stomatal responses to key environmental factors including ppfd ca d ta and ψs fig 3 the overall negative trends in gs with respect to increasing d aphalo and jarvis 1991 ball and farquhar 1984 farquhar et al 1980a grantz 1990 katul et al 2009 lange et al 1971 lendzion and

supply demand balance of water flux i e eq 4 that presets the maximum permissible stomatal conductance g s crit and subsequently e max in eq 11 at ψ l crit to examine the sensitivity of predicted gs to d the empirical relation between gs and d oren et al 1999 is adopted as it encodes a large corpus of leaf and sapflow data this expression is given as 20 g s g s r e f 1 m ln d where g s ref is the reference conductance at d 1 kpa and m is the ratio of dgs dln d to g s ref using all the model runs in fig 3 c the value of m determined by least square fit to eq 20 is 0 61 and is close to the value i e 0 59 derived from a meta analysis of c 30 species oren et al 1999 when ψs decreases the predicted relation between gs and ψl fig 4 also recovers a weibull type form that has been globally observed klein 2014 this weibull type g s ψ l relation is mainly dictated by the shape of k ψl i e soil xylem hydraulics without relying on a pre specified ψl dependent λx manzoni et al 2011 or any cost

mott 1988 and positive stomatal response to ppfd and ta schulze et al 1974 wong et al 1979 are mainly reflected by the supply demand balance of co2 flux 3 2 coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery explaining isohydric to anisohydric behavior the analysis is now expanded to examine the coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery in species with different water use strategies across the spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior as drought progresses 3 2 1 general features of isohydric to anisohydric behavior and the model set up the isohydric to anisohydric behavior is mainly defined by the sensitivity of ψl to ψs and d martínez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 the general features differentiating isohydric and anisohydric behavior domec and johnson 2012 meinzer et al 2016 are that 1 isohydric species tend to maintain a relatively constant midday ψl that is less sensitive to decreasing ψs and increasing d 2 anisohydric species allow midday ψl to significantly decrease with decreasing ψs and increasing d such that a relatively larger fe and fc can be maintained when compared to isohydric species studies conducted to contrast isohydric and anisohydric behavior kolb and sperry 1999 mcdowell et al 2008 schultz 2003 sperry et al 1998 2002 reported that species with larger ψ 12 i e air entry point that is commonly defined at ψl where 12 of k losses occur tend to exhibit more isohydric behavior while anisohydric behavior occurs in species with a smaller ψ 12 the proposed model is now shown to be able to reconcile connections between ψ 12 and the defining features of isohydric to anisohydric for this reason two scenarios s1 with larger ψ 12 and s2 with smaller ψ 12 are now constructed to illustrate how the magnitude of ψ 12 modifies the leaf xylem phloem system and impacts isohydric to anisohydric behavior during reduced soil moisture conditions fig 5 all the model parameters used for s1 are the same as the model base case a smaller ψ 12 is selected for s2 but all other model parameters are maintained the same as s1 the plant hydraulic and physiological properties are assumed to be constant i e no acclimation or adaptation during a soil dry down process the environmental factors i e ppfd ta ca rh and ψs used in the model runs are maintained the same for s1 and s2 the model results i e predicted fe e e max ec e max and p e max for the two cases are respectively represented as red and gray solid lines for s1 and s2 in figs 5 and 6 for s1 a larger rh is also used in another model run to examine if a reduced d can modify isohydric to anisohydric behavior as represented by red dashed lines in figs 5 and 6 for s2 we also use a larger photosynthetic capacity i e larger k 1 and k 2 to explore the effects of relative magnitude of photosynthetic capacity in relation to the water transport capacity on the isohydric to anisohrdic behavior as represented by gray dashed lines in figs 5 and 6 specifically it is shown that maximizing the energy profit p across these two different ψ 12 scenarios recovers the key features delineating isohydric from anisohydric behavior for simplicity it is assumed that k max maintains a near constant value as loss of conductivity at ψ 12 is assumed to be minor 12 3 2 2 linkage between the energy partitioning in eq 11 and the sensitivity of fe and ψl to ψs and d as gs increases monotonically with decreasing ψl up to ψ l crit e max occurs at f c crit and can be surrogated to a preset f e crit for a given ψs the e max is constrained by the soil xylem limitation see eq 11 and section 1 2 however the corresponding ψ l crit does not guarantee a maximum p due to finite ec as discussed in section 2 1 in eq 11 maximum p occurs at ψ l opt ψ l crit and the corresponding predicted fe or fc can be used as an indicator for the actual level of e thus the energy partitioning between p e and ec in eq 11 fig 6 can be used to explain the sensitivity of fe and ψl to ψs and d that then determines isohydric to anisohydric behavior 3 2 3 similar behavior of isohydric and anisohydric plants under severe drought condition the common feature of the two scenarios is that the difference between f e crit i e orange lines in fig 5 b and d and predicted fe δfe decreases as drought progresses this decreasing trend in δfe is reflected by the increasing trend in e e max up to nearly unity implying that soil xylem limitation dominates p at a small ψs however e e max ψs 0 does not suggest that e is enhanced by a smaller ψs as ψs drops the decrease in e f c 2 is smaller than the decrease in e max f c c r i t 2 but p can be further suppressed by increasing ec when severe drought conditions persist 3 2 4 isohydric and anisohydric behavior when compared with s1 a smaller ψ 12 in s2 allows a more negative operating ψl i e anisohydric behavior that further enhances the impediment of sucrose transport i e ec the smaller e e max in the case of s2 also suggests that the maximum permissible water transport capacity i e f e crit significantly overshoots the actual fe required to attain the maximum p especially when ψs 0 this over built soil xylem hydraulics in s2 also permits a broader operating range of ψl in response to environmental factors such as d ppfd and ta in the absence of water stress it is advantageous to maintain maximum p and a larger fc f c crit although a larger fe can be achieved by changes in environmental conditions i e increasing d ppfd or ta when compared with s2 δfe in the case of s1 is smaller due to a larger ψ 12 i e isohydric behavior a narrower range of ψl where a nearly constant k max can operate it is suggested that the main limiting component is the soil xylem hydraulics leading to smaller ec and larger e e max in s1 although the maximum p e max f c c r i t 2 and operating e f c 2 in s1 are suppressed by a larger ψ 12 the limitation induced by the interaction between xylem and phloem in the loading leaf i e ec is also reduced due to a larger operating ψl however if d in the case of s1 is reduced the decrease in fe i e increase in ψl results in a larger δfe fig 5 b and smaller e e max fig 6 a where the enhancement in e max is larger than the enhancement in e a reduced d also suppresses ec due to the increase in ψl this finding suggests that the maximum p and operating e can be enhanced even when the range of ψl is small i e a larger ψ 12 for a nearly constant k max similar to s2 ψl in s1 can now respond to a wider range of d at short time scale as a consequence of reduced fe hence s1 and s2 may represent plant hydraulics associated with the more conservative and aggressive water use strategies for plants across the spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior however the range of ψl for a nearly constant k max to operate i e ψ 12 alone cannot be used to differentiate species with different water use strategy to illustrate δfe decreases with increasing photosynthetic capacity i e larger k 1 and k 2 are used in s2 leading to a shift from anisohydric to isohydric behavior i e narrower range of operating ψl along the gray dashed line as shown in fig 5 d a larger photosynthetic capacity also necessitates a larger fe that reduces δfe and increases e e max because soil xylem hydraulics now dominate with a reduced contribution of ec to p gray dashed lines in fig 6 d e and f to sum up it is fair to state that the photosynthetic capacity for isohydric species has the tendency to nearly exploit f e crit throughout a dry down i e e e max 1 isohydric plants are conservative water users i e limited by soil xylem hydraulics but their photosynthetic capacity is aggressively utilizing the soil xylem hydraulic system anisohydric plants by contrast are aggressive water users but they adopt more conservative photosynthetic capacity that requires smaller fe to maintain a maximum p compared to their f e crit state when responding to fluctuation in environmental conditions the compartments of the system appear to operate in a coordinated manner so as to maintain p e max without any apparent bottleneck even when ψs drops while previous experimental studies mainly focused on the variation of ψl during a dry down and the sensitivity of gs to d and ψs to distinguish isohydric to anisohydric behavior domec and johnson 2012 meinzer et al 2016 the finding here forms a new model generated hypothesis that has not been explored and requires testing in future field and laboratory experiments that is the magnitude of atmospheric aridity i e d and the relative magnitude of photosynthetic capacity in relation to the water transport capacity through soil xylem hydraulic system can shift isohydric to anisohydric behavior 3 3 long term effect of elevated atmospheric co2 concentration on leaf level gas exchange when plants acclimate or adapt to a changing environment leaf level gas exchange reflects concomitant adjustments in plant hydraulic and physiological properties under well watered soil conditions the closed form expressions for g s ww fc and water use efficiency wue f c f e can be derived by replacing eq 17 into the supply demand balance of co2 flux and are given as 21 g s w w k 1 1 k 2 γ a d λ x k 2 1 a d λ x k 2 γ c a f c k 1 c a k 2 1 a d λ x k 2 γ c a wue c a a d 1 k 2 γ a d λ x on long time scales xylem and phloem traits i e λx and photosynthetic parameters i e k 1 and k 2 in eq 21 are shaped by the environmental conditions they have experienced however g s ww fc wue and ci ca i e eq 17 represent short term leaf level responses to current states or environmental conditions a large time scale separation exists between variations in endogenous plant attributes encoded in λx k 1 and k 2 and instantaneous leaf level responses i e g s ww fc wue and ci ca for this reason eqs 21 and 17 only focus on how measured modifications in λx following long term elevated atmospheric co2 concentration modify photosynthetic parameters as well as g s ww ci ca ratio fc and wue for simplicity the focus is on formulations that assume absence of water stress after the plants experience different ca s on long time scales e g by comparing leaves grown under ambient and enriched ca conditions such a situation describes the setup for pinus taeda l growing under 200 ppm co2 above current level as reported from the duke free air co2 enrichment face site the duke face was conducted in a south eastern u s pine forest domec et al 2009 2016b tor ngern et al 2015 where leaf and plant hydraulic traits have been measured when other environmental conditions are maintained the same a reduced maximum leaf hydraulic conductance k leaf max was reported with increased ca in this case the maximum leaf specific tree conductance k s m a x k max a l decreased from 0 65 to 0 43 mmol m 2 s 1 mpa 1 domec et al 2016a as a result of the reduction in k leaf max domec et al 2009 this general decrease in k s max has been reported for ring porous diffuse porous coniferous and non woody species in a literature survey conducted on elevated co2 experiments over the last 40 years domec et al 2016a as shown in table 2 the needle size phloem diameter and the number of phloem cells per needle appear to be suppressed by increased atmospheric co2 when accounting for all the loading leaf at the canopy level the enhancement of canopy leaf area 16 mccarthy et al 2007 results in 35 6 decrease in k max but a nearly unaltered vp i e 5 8 decrease hence the expenditure of water loss λx is predicted by eq 16 to increase by 65 1 comparable with the percentage increase of λx i e 62 9 computed by inverting λx based on sot from leaf level gas exchange measurements at the same site katul et al 2010 furthermore the difference in photosynthetic parameters of pinus taeda l between control and elevated co2 plots is not significant ellsworth et al 2012 katul et al 2010 it was assumed here that acclimation of k 1 and k 2 did not occur e g no down regulation if λx is the only plant trait to be modified by elevated co2 the general trends in decreasing g s ww and ci ca ratio and increasing fc and wue with increasing ca ellsworth et al 2012 katul et al 2010 can be attributed to the combined effects of increasing λx and ca i e eq 21 however the suppression of g s ww and ci ca ratio by increasing λx is relatively small ellsworth et al 2012 katul et al 2010 when compared with the sensitivity of fc and wue to long term elevated co2 the increment of ca in the numerator of fc and wue further amplifies the effects of elevated co2 on fc and wue 3 4 study limitation given all the assumptions made to arrive at the proposed modeling approach it is instructive to present future improvements to the current formulation while retaining a quasi steady assumption for analytical tractability as suggested in a recent review of sot buckley et al 2016 aerodynamic modifications resulting from the interaction between wind speed and the leaf represented by boundary layer conductance gb and the co2 transport efficiency in the mesophyll encoded in the mesophyll conductance gm are required when their magnitudes are comparable with gs regarding gb the stomatal behavior can be altered appreciably by gb even when the state variables such as ta co2 and water vapor concentrations above the laminar boundary layer remain the same huang et al 2015 schymanski and or 2016 the effects of gb on gs have been incorporated into prior models using sot or profit maximization huang et al 2015 sperry et al 2016a wolf et al 2016 however gb was mainly characterized by mean wind speed and effective leaf size using empirical formulations that may not reflect wind contact angle leaf orientation and the micro roughness on the leaf surface and turbulent intensity with regard to gm the effects of gm on fc has been considered explicitly in some sot volpe et al 2011 and compared with empirical data to explore the partitioning between gs and gm under salt stressed conditions when soil water availability is not limited evidence that gm is finite and varies with various environmental factors has been reviewed elsewhere flexas et al 2008 with gm being reduced during persistent drought conditions grassi and magnani 2005 jones 1973 as suggested elsewhere gu and sun 2014 however the dependency of gm on ci or irradiance may be artifacts due to measurement methods uncertainties in modeling gs can be further reduced when the spatio temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil xylem hydraulic system are appropriately described plant water storage pws and hydraulic redistribution hr representing above and below ground water reservoirs are the two defining features that impact soil plant hydrodynamics and drought resilience domec et al 2010 goldstein et al 1998 huang et al 2017 maherali and delucia 2001 neumann and cardon 2012 prieto et al 2012 stratton et al 2000 to accommodate the overnight competition for water between pws and hr in modeling gs a multi layered scheme for solving water mass balance in each soil plant compartments is required huang et al 2017 the consideration of how the soil xylem hydraulics i e k ψ l relation is impacted by the delay refilling processes in air filled xylem conduits brodribb and cochard 2009 sperry and tyree 1990 is also required especially when the function of impaired xylem conduits cannot be recovered under water stress condition when coupled with light attenuation and turbulent flow models detailed representation of hydraulic architecture bohrer et al 2005 hentschel et al 2013 janott et al 2011 manoli et al 2014 2017 for individual plant can further assist understanding plant plant competition for water and light despite the plethora of complications to measure or model water relations withing the soil plant system an exhaustive theoretical treatment for the aforementioned mechanisms may also shed light on how the transport of chemical signals e g abscisic acid through xylem contributes to stomatal behavior tardieu 2016 in line with recent studies hölttä et al 2017 jensen et al 2016 lucas et al 2013 nikinmaa et al 2013 sevanto 2014 stroock et al 2014 the significance of the phloem anatomy and physiology associated with long distance sucrose transport on gs cannot be overlooked at the whole plant level sucrose export from the loading phloem here requires further elaboration to account for influences of loading efficiencies with different loading strategies viscosity built up due to sucrose accumulation elastic nature of sieve element thickness of the sieve plate and distribution of sieve pore radii jensen et al 2012 2014 liesche et al 2015 thompson and holbrook 2003 turgeon 2010 how the modifications of osmotic regulation in response to drought stress in each plant compartment impact the transport system dichio et al 2006 morgan 1984 should be also accounted for in future modeling efforts however the primary challenge remains at the long time scales different from quantifying short time scales stomatal responses the difficulty in evaluating how acclimation or adaptation of plant traits respond to the history of environmental conditions can be further accentuated by the fact that the climate system is also sensitive to feedbacks from plants thereby generating the so called feedback cycle 4 conclusion the significance of biotic controls through stomata on global carbon and water cycles food production and security and ecosystem services is rarely disputed we developed a mathematical model of stomata based on the premise of a coordinated photosynthetic hydraulic sucrose transporting machinery we hypothesize that this coordination evolved to maximize the sucrose mass flux out of the loading leaf because we consider that maximizing sucrose mass flux can be readily viewed as maximizing energy flux we proposed this as a qualitative link to lodka s maximum energy circulation principle in plants for a wide range of time scales the proposed approach captures the general features of stomatal sensitivity to environmental factors and hydrological states the proposed framework explains how the carbon and water economies are intrinsically linked by the coordination among the main mass transporting networks within plants that dictates the much debated isohydric to anisohydric behavior to permit analytical foresight only the main transporting processes impacting gs are accounted for in the soil xylem leaf phloem system variable sucrose sinks and stores from the loading to the unloading zones were not explicitly treated here recent research trends are beginning to address carbon allocation and sinks throughout the entire plant system fatichi et al 2014 hartmann and trumbore 2016 savage et al 2015 and the framework here must be viewed as one step in this direction it offers immanent constraints as to how gs responds to its environment on multiple time scales pertinent to the xylem leaf phloem transport system field and laboratory testing of the proposed approach here are topics for future studies acknowledgments we acknowledge support from the national science foundation

778,indirect inversion has been the predominant method for matching models and data in geochemical systems typically using observations of chemical concentrations as calibration targets this reserves the data with the highest confidence observed concentrations for the final comparison but does little to constrain the initial state of the system on which the indirect inversion is based an alternative approach to inverse modeling is to start with the observations to reconstruct a concentration field but it is unclear if this is feasible for reactive transport in heterogeneous systems the purpose of this article is to consider the applicability of backward in time bit techniques as tools for simulating reactive transport in porous media a multi component reaction system is considered in a variety of systems of increasing complexity and we show that complex non linear systems can be simulated backward in time given a sufficiently robust integration scheme recent advances in reactive random walk particle tracking are employed to investigate simple flow systems with spatially variable reactions as well as 2 d heterogeneous flows and we show that some level of time reversibility exists in both cases under a uniform injection scheme the total masses generated in forward and backward simulations of the 2 d models were all within 3 5 of each other for all the species considered indicating good overall agreement between the models this suggests that bit techniques may have yet unrealized applications to inverse modeling however further research on the sensitivity of the approach to measurement errors and on how to efficiently apply bit methods to transient problems is needed keywords reactive transport inverse modeling backward in time 1 introduction reactive transport problems involve immense complexities existing at multiple temporal and spatial scales atchley et al 2014 dentz et al 2011 a common approach to understanding the behavior of such systems starts by collecting and analyzing geochemical data at monitoring points then using a lumped parameter or distributed model to discover the physical implications or context of the observations for predictive modeling or other applications at its core this workflow is an application of indirect inverse modeling to reactive transport the parameters boundary conditions and initial conditions of a forward model are specified the simulation result is compared to the data and then the model is revised accordingly until satisfactory agreement with observations is reached distributed parameter models e g appelo and rolle 2010 beisman et al 2015 are common tools for simulating reactive transport because of their ability to solve problems with spatially variable parameters as opposed to lumped parameter models however these models also further complicate the problem because of their immense computational expense which can require hours days or weeks for a single simulation e g mills et al 2007 a key point about these models is that each forward simulation implicitly assumes that the specified initial and boundary conditions are correct and that the hydrologic and geochemical properties of the system will be able to approach the observed values but this is far from guaranteed considering the uncertainty of the problem essentially this approach relies on specifying something that we do not or cannot know the initial condition and uses this guess to try and recreate observations this can be an effective strategy but the enormous computational costs can limit its applicability to those with supercomputers at their disposal making it impractical for many real world problems inverse modeling can be sped up by adopting simplified forward models but this comes at the expense of accuracy since excessive simplifications will inevitably lead to inaccurate predictions particularly regarding nonlinear processes clearly a major challenge of any reactive transport model is identifying the starting state of the system regardless of the simplicity or complexity of the forward model with this in mind it may be possible to improve the process of inverse modeling if the system can be solved in a way that begins with known data as opposed to comparing to it in the end this would then provide plausible estimates of the unknown initial conditions that are conditional to the observations which are the component of the inverse problem that is known with the highest confidence the main question is how to incorporate the observations most effectively in the inverse model many ways of conditioning to chemical data exist but one possibility that has seen little attention is simulating the full reactive transport system with time reversed forward in time fit models are widespread across hydrology but the most common example of a backward in time bit or adjoint model is capture zone analysis which is often associated with simulations of travel time from a strictly mathematical perspective there is nothing preventing integration of a system of ordinary differential equations odes in an arbitrary direction the simplest case to consider to illustrate this point is a single analytical function such as f with derivative d f d x 2 x given a known function value anywhere on the curve say f x 2 2 one can determine the value at any other location and the same is true for a system of equations as long as a starting point for each equation is known however eulerian solutions of a system of partial differential equations in arbitrary directions fit or bit introduce complexities in the boundary conditions see neupauer and wilson 1999 2002 and the stability of the problem is not guaranteed appendix b lagrangian approaches to the backward problem de rooij et al 2013 eberts et al 2012 offer a conceptually simpler approach at least mathematically and they are adopted here for this reason the most common lagrangian approach in hydrology is random walk particle tracking rwpt a simple form of the rw equation for a fit model is 1 x i t δ t x i t v x i t t 2 d δ t ξ where x i t l is the position vector of the ith particle at time t moving according to the velocity field v x t l t and diffusing at rate d l 2 t with n dimensional gaussian random noise included via ξ over time step δt in the continuum limit i e for a large ensemble of particles it is well known that this models an advection dispersion process we expect that many readers are at least conceptually familiar with the rw model so a more general form and more detail on the approach are reserved for appendix a the key point is that lagrangian methods discretize the mass whereas eulerian methods discretize space contemporary versions of the rw approach can now assign an arbitrary number of species to each particle bolster et al 2016 allow inter particle interactions benson and meerschaert 2008 rahbaralam et al 2015 and incorporate complex reactions engdahl et al 2017 while avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dispersion the random walk bit approach for advection is conceptually simple and differs from the fit model only in the sign of the time step δ t δ t in 1 which can also be accomplished by reversing the sign of the velocity field more details on advection are given in appendix a but it simply traces streamlines backwards instead of forwards the diffusion operator is self adjoint and this means that its forward and backward forms are identical it remains a spreading operation in both cases proportional in magnitude to δ t backward in time dispersion due to sub grid velocity heterogeneity incorporates some of the elements of the advection and diffusion operators and interested readers are referred to uffink 1990 for details it is important to note that since diffusion is simulated as a random process the forward and backward paths of an individual particle will differ unless the exact same jumps are used in both simulations conceptually a bit model places particles at their terminus and sends them back to their source allowing for advection and random dispersive motion along the way one interpretation of this approach is that it aims to identify the distribution of source locations conditional to the sampling location s whereas a fit model does the opposite the bit approach has seen widespread use in source zone identification and simulations of residence time distributions e g engdahl and maxwell 2015 but it has also been used to reconstruct concentration histories of environmental tracers reactions have been simulated on particles in previous applications of bit models but these have been limited to simple reactions that do not require particles to interact such as first order decay e g mccallum et al 2014 when more complex reactions are considered the validity of bit methods is not as clear because the combined impacts of advection spreading and reactions in the presence of a heterogeneous velocity field may have unanticipated effects this also raises some basic questions for example are the same flow paths sampled when spreading occurs in a reversed velocity field however in order to assess whether or not source zone concentrations can be reconstructed using bit methods we must first address the issue of whether or not reactive transport can be simulated in backward time the purpose of this article is to investigate whether or not bit simulations are possible for nonlinear reactive transport systems in an operational sense the approach taken here applies recent advances in particle based simulations of complex reactions to the backward problem and we provide several examples that evaluate the equivalency of the forward and backward models under different transport conditions a single article cannot address all of the possible reaction systems initial conditions and boundary conditions nor the infinite combinations of other factors that can influence reactive transport consequently we focus on a few generic steady state problems and avoid making generalizations at this stage until more supporting research can be completed however the examples establish the general time reversibility of reaction networks in a batch reactor and the equivalency of fit and bit models in 1 d domains under homogeneous and spatially variable reaction rates and demonstrate some of the challenges presented by 2 d heterogeneous flows the body of the article focuses on numerical analysis but two appendices are included that discuss theoretical considerations of backward in time models appendix a and the numerical stability of the fit and bit models appendix b addressing this collection of basic questions is seen as a necessary prerequisite for future investigations of the potential applications of bit simulations such as in inverse problems and uncertainty reduction 2 reaction system simple first order reactions are trivial to reconstruct and this is the basis of many environmental tracer analyses to determine water ages from tracers like krypton 85 or tritium our first task is to show that this time reversibility can also apply to more complex reaction networks the reaction network we consider here is based on the competitive decay chain example found in engdahl et al 2017 which involves a combination of equilibrium and kinetic reactions 2a p a q b c 2b c e f 2c e where p and q are stoichiometric coefficients and the uppercase letters represent chemical species these aqueous phase reactions only affect solutes and involve no precipitation dissolution or surface complexation reactions these processes can be included but are omitted here for simplicity eqs 2a and 2c are irreversible kinetic reactions with rate constants kf and λ respectively and eq 2b is an equilibrium reversible reaction with equilibrium constant k e q c e f we assume unit stoichiometry for 2b arbitrary chemical species are used for generality but this can represent a wide variety of processes the system has a natural shift in its balance over time because f temporarily sequesters e which causes it to stay in the system longer than if decay alone acted on e in a transport system this allows competition between mixing limitations and the direction of the equilibrium reaction to be simulated while still being of manageable complexity 2 1 component based solution the continuum reactive transport system can be written as 3a a t t a r 1 3b b t t b p q r 1 3c c t t c r 1 r 2 3d e t t e r 2 r 3 3e f t t f r 2 where t is a generic transport operator and the ri denote the arbitrary reaction rates for each step based on the reaction system eq 2 rate r 1 corresponds to the rate of eq 2a r 2 corresponds to eq 2b r 3 corresponds to eq 2c the specific form of each is defined below initially we will consider a well mixed batch reactor so that t 0 but this will be relaxed later solving this system is complicated by the unknown r 2 reaction rate which must be instantaneous since it is associated with an equilibrium reaction one technique is to adopt an operator splitting os approach and this is an option in many geochemical simulation codes e g appelo and rolle 2010 beisman et al 2015 gardner et al 2015 hammond et al 2014 steefel and lasaga 1994 doing so inherently incurs small errors since the system is solved sequentially however given an appropriately small time step these are generally inconsequential another possibility is to approximate the equilibrium reactions as a fast kinetic and a final alternative is to define chemical components that eliminate the equilibrium reaction from the solution the latter is adopted here combining the 3rd 4th and 5th equations of 3 we can define two components c t c f and e t e f which reduce the system to 4a a t t a r 1 4b b t t b p q r 1 4c c t t t c t r 1 4d e t t t e t r 3 this eliminates the unknown rate r 2 that was associated with the equilibrium reaction the assumed rate laws are r 1 k f a p b q and r 3 λ e the r 3 term is determined via e not one of the components but this can be found from the definition of the components and the law of mass action k e q c e f the components can be rewritten as c t c f and e t e f and substituted into the mass action law to produce a quadratic in f the exact values of c and e over time are now uniquely defined through ct et and f at all times this transformation ensures that all of the reaction rates involved in 4 are finite because the instantaneous reactions have been eliminated but this is not always possible and an operator splitting os approach can be used in such cases in our testing the component and os approaches both gave reasonably accurate results as long as the time step of the problem is small relative to the characteristic time of the fastest kinetic reaction but we adopted the component approach for speed and to minimize any potential sources of numerical errors one relevant note is that anytime components are used here ct and et it is possible to generate negative component concentrations since they are derived quantities regardless of whether the model is fit or bit this is no cause for concern in most fit models however since eq 2a in this reaction system is irreversible negative species concentrations can be generated in the bit simulation the rate law for eq 2a describes the breakdown of a and b in the fit model which produces c but r 1 does not depend the concentration of c this means that the bit model has no limitation on the masses of a and b that can be generated and they can grow indefinitely consuming c as they do and eventually driving its concentration negative our goal is to generate a concentration field based on the simulated trajectories of the particles in the bit model to compare to the fit model so we simply enforce a minimum value of c 1 0 10 10 in order for the kinetic reaction to occur in the bit model however any trajectory that generates a negative concentration could be rejected as implausible and this is expected to be useful as a screening criteria in upscaled simulations 2 2 forward and backward simulation of reactions our next task is to determine whether a bit model can reconstruct the fit solution of the nonlinear reaction system assuming the transport operator is null and that the system is contained in a well mixed batch reactor the system defined by 4 is a series of coupled ordinary differential equations odes no straightforward analytical solution exits so we adopt a 4th order runge kutta scheme rk4 for the integration of the reaction system to minimize errors the rk4 scheme is a flexible choice and allows time dependent linear nonlinear reactions or combinations of both to be modeled in a consistent framework it also allows the forward and backward time systems to be solved with an identical set of odes with variable time stepping if needed a standard rk4 implementation see pozrikidis 2008 was used and verified against the analytical solution for a second order irreversible nonlinear kinetic reaction given by benson and bolster 2016 the two were in excellent agreement so the full comparison is omitted the forward problem fit model assumes the following initial conditions a 0 1 0 b 0 1 2 c 0 f 0 0 and e 0 1 1 the stoichiometry of the kinetic reaction is nonlinear with p 1 and q 2 the rate constants are k f 5 0 10 3 and λ 1 0 10 2 with k e q 1 0 10 2 the time period of the forward simulation spans t 0 1 10 4 and we use a constant δ t 1 0 10 2 to generate a high accuracy reference solution the solution of the forward model is shown in fig 1 a as the solid lines the same model using a modified set of rate constants is also shown in fig 1b the modified rate constants are k f 1 0 10 1 and λ 5 0 10 2 with k e q 1 0 10 2 and the same initial values were used in both examples the first bit model we evaluate uses the same rk4 scheme with identical parameters but the sign of the time step is reversed and its magnitude increased so that δ t 0 1 the intent of the change in time step is to treat the fit model as the experimental result and the bit as a model of it the initial values for the bit problem are the final values of the reference model and the simulation is run backward to t 0 the differences between the rk4 model and the reference solution were quantified with the maximum magnitude of error over all times l norm and the average of the absolute value of all errors l 1 norm these errors are given in table 1 rk4 row and are very small for all intents and purposes the rk4 bit simulation exactly reproduces the reference fit model fig 1 circles note there are errors introduced here since both solutions have accuracy proportionate to δt 5 pozrikidis 2008 and different time steps were used however the time step and accompanying accuracy of the rk4 bit model are sufficiently small that the errors are not visible relative to the magnitude of concentrations the rk4 bit scheme is highly accurate but it comes at a high computational cost because it takes incremental steps to evaluate the derivatives eq 4 four times per time step a second order runge kutta scheme rk2 also called the modified euler method requires half as many function evaluations but still has accuracy proportionate to δt 3 pozrikidis 2008 so it may be an acceptable tradeoff in some cases re running the bit model with the rk2 scheme at δ t 1 0 10 1 produces larger errors relative to the reference solution than the rk4 scheme table 1 rk2 row but these are still indistinguishable against the plot of the forward model fig 1 squares lastly we consider the first order euler explicit method and investigate the magnitude of error that accumulates in this reaction system from such a coarse approximation using the same time step the explicit euler model will have accuracy proportionate to δt 1 so appreciable errors should be expected for the nonlinear system the maximum errors table 1 euler row were on the order of 10 4 and 10 3 for fit and bit models respectively and this is reflected in the visible deviations from the reference model fig 1 diamonds the accumulated error is significantly greater than the rk2 scheme these numerical approximations show that complex reaction networks can be simulated backward in time the time reversibility holds with nonlinear combinations of equilibrium and kinetic reactions and also for other combinations of rate constants and equilibrium constants omitted for brevity the robustness of the numerical scheme is essential to the reconstruction euler rk2 and rk4 schemes can all provide reasonable approximations of the system when the time scales of reactions are much greater than the simulation time step but convergence analysis should always be used to evaluate whether the time step is sufficiently small to minimize error accumulation the jump from euler to rk2 provides considerably more accuracy for a very low computational cost since the second evaluation of the derivatives reduces the total number of time steps to achieve comparable accuracy by about a factor of 100 first order approximations are convenient but an important caution is that the use of low order integration schemes in reactive transport codes regardless of whether it is a fit or bit model will lead to errors such errors are significant in these examples and calibrated rate constants in an inverse modeling setting could mask these inaccuracies the errors may even be on the order of numerical dispersion in an eulerian model interested readers are directed to benson et al 2017 for more details including discussion of potential damkohler number issues 3 uniform flow with reactions so far we have established that concentrations in the reaction system of eq 2 can be reconstructed backward in time for a stirred reactor our next task is evaluating the same question using a model of a system that includes transport a mobile system is now considered and the transport operator for eq 4 is denoted as 5 t v d where v is a velocity vector d is an n dimensional diffusion tensor and is a placeholder for the concentrations of solutes or components note that hereafter we assume a spatially and temporally constant porosity which is already embedded in the velocity field and dispersion tensor the transport and reaction algorithm we use is based on benson and bolster 2016 bolster et al 2016 and engdahl et al 2017 this lagrangian approach generally referred to as complex reactions on particles crp uses standard random walk particle tracking rwpt methods for the advection and diffusion parts of the problem but allows each particle to carry multiple chemical species unlike most rwpt algorithms the crp approach also allows particles to interact with each other at every time step the details of the interactions are given in the previous references but the basic idea is to use a linear mass transfer model where the mass transfer rate is given by the difference in mass of a particle pair and their colocation probability earlier models of reactive interacting particles used the colocation density to determine whether or not two particles would react with each other benson and meerschaert 2008 ding et al 2013 but bolster et al 2016 introduced a method by which mass was exchanged after the mass exchange step the crp approach evaluates reactions but these are entirely local to each individual particle the original crp approach e g engdahl et al 2017 called the phreeqcrm reaction engine for this step but here we use the component based rk4 solution of section 2 2 based on our experience with these methods we have also observed that the mass exchange step tends to reduce the random numerical noise and provides more stable solutions with fewer realizations but we note that it does not smooth the concentration field as much as dynamic kernel methods rahbaralam et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2017 some last notes before proceeding are that our analysis is restricted to steady state flow fields and stable distributions of solutes which means that these are not mixing limited problems the reason for this simplification is that accurately modeling a transient mixing limited bit problem requires one to un mix solutes as time goes backward this is not a trivial task see ababou et al 2010 and further research on how to do so in an efficient and physically meaningful way is needed fully bounded domains zero outward flux with continuous sources and even some cases with finite duration sources cannot be considered for similar reasons since they may not have a steady state finally since we are considering the mathematical issue of reversibility we simplify the problem by assuming that the reaction rate constants boundary conditions and flow field are error free naturally any error or uncertainty in these quantities will affect the simulation and the issue of sensitivity can be addressed with perturbation analysis 3 1 spatially constant rate constants this example considers the time reversibility of reactive transport in a 1 d homogeneous domain of length l 10 the velocity is assumed to be constant v 0 0 05 l t and we only consider diffusion for now with d 0 1 10 2 l 2 t these define the necessary coefficients for 1 and both transport processes are simulated simultaneously using a 2nd order stochastic runge kutta scheme honeycutt 1992 we assume the domain starts empty and that the inlet boundary x 5 supplies a constant concentration of the reactants a 0 1 0 b 0 1 2 c 0 f 0 0 and e 0 1 1 the rate constants are k f 5 0 10 3 and λ 1 0 10 2 with k e q 1 0 10 2 and we choose p 1 and q 2 to create a nonlinearity in the kinetic term the boundary conditions on the domain are periodic but when particles re enter the domain at the inlet they are assigned the incoming boundary concentrations of each species the fit model was run for 2000 time units at a time step of δ t 0 1 using the full crp algorithm advection diffusion and mass transfer between particles and the steady state was reached by about t 500 the remaining times were used to generate a spatial profile of the results shown in fig 2 a where the fit flow field is toward the outlet at x 5 since the system is steady state we invoke ergodicity and average the profiles from 15 different times beginning at the steady state time of about t 500 each of the 15 profiles is separated in time by half the travel time τ 1 2 100 t across the domain to eliminate any unforeseen hysteresis effects the ensemble averaged concentration at the outlet was used as the initial condition for the bit model the same transport and reaction algorithm was used with parameters identical to the fit model the only differences are 1 the inlet for the bit problem is the outlet of the fit problem and 2 the sign of the time step in the rk4 algorithm was flipped the same time step and total simulation time were run and the average of the 15 different steady profiles are compared to the fit model in fig 2a the agreement between the two models is good overall any discrepancies tended to increase near the inlet of the fit model which represents the combined role of random fluctuations in travel time and accumulated errors 3 2 spatially variable rate constants microbially controlled reactions in natural systems may require a catalyst i e food which can be spatially and or temporally variable combined with a nonlinear rate law this represents a challenging problem with which to evaluate the fit vs bit models so we add some constraints to the example from section 3 the same problem domain flow rate and initial conditions are used but we restrict the regions where the kinetic reaction eq 2a and the decay reaction eq 2c may occur the kinetic reaction occurs in the region 5 x 2 with k f 1 2 5 10 3 and in the region 2 x 5 with k f 2 7 5 10 3 with no kinetic reaction from 2 x 2 the decay reaction is split such that λ 1 1 2 10 2 for x 0 and λ 2 8 0 10 3 elsewhere and these rates are indicated on fig 2b for clarity the simulation was run forward with δ t 0 1 up to t 2000 and the ensemble averaged fit simulation is shown in fig 2b as the solid lines the bit simulation is shown as the dashed lines in fig 2b and two models exhibit agreement comparable to that seen in fig 2a these 1 d examples show that it is possible to reconstruct concentration profiles along uniform velocity streamlines with good overall accuracy but it should be noted that the measured values used to initialize the bit models were assumed to be error free which is often not a good assumption when dealing with field data a reasonable approach to addressing such concerns would be to simulate the upper and lower bounds of the suspected measurement error as well as the expected value but given the nonlinear nature of the system these perturbations would need to be conducted individually for each species and also jointly for all combinations this would be a large number of simulations but it is not intractable finally the accuracy of these methods is controlled by the time step as with all rk solvers decreasing δt increases accuracy but the balance of error propagation and run time are problem specific decisions 4 2 d heterogeneous flow the 1 d results of section 3 2 are directly applicable to transport along non interacting streamlines with uniform velocities but they cannot be used to infer how multi dimensional heterogeneous problems will behave so we move on to a 2 d spatially variable flow field the permeability field is an operator scaling random field borrowed from benson et al 2017 and we imposed zero flux boundaries on the top and bottom with dirichlet boundaries on the right and left edges that give a gradient of 3 driving flow from left to right in the forward model the total size of the field is 100 l in x by 40 l in y with 500 and 200 cells in each direction respectively for d x d y 0 2 l the steady state flow field was found using a 2nd order implicit cell centered finite difference scheme and the velocity field is shown in fig 3 along with contours of piezometric head the geometric mean velocity in this domain is v 1 26 10 1 l t which gives an expected travel time across a cell of τ 7 94 t and we choose δ t 0 1 to better represent trajectories in the higher velocity regions the rate constants for the kinetic reactions were decreased to k f 1 0 10 3 and λ 5 0 10 4 because of the increased size of this domain relative to that used in section 3 but the equilibrium constant and the values of the initial condition are unchanged the transport model simulates advection and diffusion d 0 2 10 2 l 2 t with the transport operator defined by eq 5 assuming a spatially and temporally constant porosity of 30 the integration of the random walk particle trajectories used a 2nd order stochastic runge kutta scheme honeycutt 1992 and the reaction system was integrated using an rk4 scheme 4 1 forward model the fit model starts with particles at the left edge x 0 flowing to the right placed randomly according to a prescribed distribution along the vertical direction y a periodic boundary is used on the opposite side where an exiting particle is recycled to the inlet and its new position on the vertical is drawn randomly we provide separate results for uniform weighting and flux weighting injection schemes rwpt methods discretize the mass into point particles and these are mapped onto a grid to generate concentration fields for visualization this can require a large number of particles but this workload can be reduced significantly since we are interested in steady state concentrations in this case the question becomes a conditioning statement what is the average concentration mass when particles are present in each cell over the entire simulation period this field only requires knowing which cell each particle is in at each time step adding the current mass of each species it carries to the total mass for the cell and increasing the particle count of the cell by 1 for each particle after enough time has elapsed the field of the total masses in each cell is divided by the particle count for each cell and this produces the field of the expected steady state concentrations this approach combined with the periodic boundary allowed us to use only 5 103 particles and simulate 105 time steps to reach steady state the serial execution of the full model took less than 15 min on a 2014 macbook pro the log transformed steady state concentration field of the fit model reflects the heterogeneities of the velocity field and is shown in the left columns of fig 4 for chemical species b c e and f for the uniformly weighted injection scheme species a is omitted because its distribution is similar to that of b 4 2 backward model the bit model swaps the inlet and outlet boundaries concentration and reverses the direction of the flow field the initial particle positions are again based on a randomized distribution either uniform or flux based weights but the boundary concentrations are specified from the steady state concentration field of the fit model at its outlet the bit models are shown in the right column of fig 4 and there are some clear discrepancies between the two errors tend to increase from right to left but even with these errors it is interesting that many similar patterns exist in both concentration fields some obvious culprits are the stringers of high b and e concentration that originate near x 55 y 20 with the complementary decreases in c and f along with the excess amounts of b in the lower left corner despite these visual differences the total mass globally in each paired fit bit simulation is remarkably close the ratio of the total bit mass for each species to the fit model is shown in table 2 and the uniform weighting scheme is within 1 of the fit for species a b and f the least accurate species is species c in the flux weighted models which is underestimated by about 7 relative to the fit scheme and a and b are overestimated as a consequence however for domain wide total masses the fit and bit results are surprisingly close 4 3 residence time and reversibility a natural candidate for causing the discrepancies between fit and bit models is a difference in residence times which leads to the question of whether or not the residence time distributions rtds of the models are similar this was investigated by using the same particle tracking scheme in a passive mode to simulate the rtds where 20 000 particles were released into the models using more particles did not significantly alter the simulated rtds the fit model placed the particles at the inlet using the forward velocity field which was compared to the same amount of particles placed at the outlet run as a bit model for both the uniform and flux weighted injection schemes the fit and bit rtds exhibited minor differences fig 5 a for the uniform scheme with a slight shift to older residence times larger differences can be seen between the fit and bit models under flux weighting fig 5b in this case the bit model has a bigger component of young water and is slightly depleted in old water but the two rtds remain qualitatively similar the reason for the rtds for the fit and bit models not elucidating the mass discrepancies is that the rtd ignores concentration histories consider the most prominent feature in fig 5b which is the high concentration of reactant b and also a near the center of the domain in the bit model this corresponds to a region of low velocity where particles spend roughly the same amount of time in the fit and bit domains particles enter the region in the fit model from the left edge and they begin with high concentrations of a and b which are almost entirely consumed within the slow region note that the blurring around the edges of the low velocity region in the fit model is the result of spreading into the low velocity region the reactions involving a and b have basically gone to completion when the particles finally exit the region in the fit simulation and do not react further on their way out of the domain so the effluent concentrations which are used to initialize the bit models reflect a pseudo inert state in contrast the bit simulation begins reacting in reverse time to re form a and b when the particles enter the low velocity region from the right edge combined with diffusion the particles linger long enough that they regenerate all the mass and would continue to generate more if the mass of c wasn t forced to be limiting section 2 1 even though the residence times are the same in the ensemble sense the concentration history of each path is not reversible because of the effects of the spatially variable velocity and lateral dispersion if lateral dispersion did not play a role this domain could be conceptualized as a series of streamlines and the reproducibility of section 3 would be expected clearly this is not the case and the role of lateral mixing is not trivial in short the bit model has no knowledge of the time of reactant depletion from the fit model and this appears to be the cause of the mass discrepancies potentially this is a significant limitation of the method in any situation where one or more reactants are entirely consumed between the source and monitoring locations however clues like negative species concentrations could help identify cases where this is likely 5 discussion the main findings of this article are 1 nonlinear reaction networks are reversible in time in a batch reactor given high enough accuracy of the numerical integration scheme 2 reactive transport along uniform velocity flow lines i e streamlines or streamtubes with longitudinal spreading is also reversible under similar accuracy conditions and 3 at least some spatially variable velocity fields can be reversed to estimate the total mass domain wide but the spatial distribution of reactants at steady state may differ in the spatially variable case we found that uniform weighting schemes gave more accurate fit bit comparisons than a flux weighting scheme this finding illustrates one of the complexities of flux weighting in that it may not be appropriate if the distribution of fluxes at the injection or monitoring site s are not representative of the distribution of flow paths within the domain this was evident in the rtds where the fit and bit models had nearly identical rtds under uniform weighting of the injection but noticeable changes were evident in the flux weighted case a reversible rtd does not imply that the history of the particle positions along their path are flipped because the distribution of flow paths is a function of the direction of flow and the fact that spreading in the fit and bit models will be different the fit and bit models are likely never exactly equivalent within a realization but they may become so in an ensemble sense as shown in fig 2 however the exact inverse is recovered if no spreading is allowed advection only the lack of direct reversibility causes the disagreement in the fit and bit fields spatially and this is particularly sensitive in the case where one or more of the reactants are entirely consumed in the fit simulation since time to depletion of a reactant in the fit model cannot be known in the bit model this finding may have broad implications because it suggests that changing the direction of flow fundamentally alters the behavior of the problem a change in direction changes travel time which in turn changes the reaction rates over time rapid fluctuations in river stage constantly cause changes in flow directions within river corridors and these results may help explain some of the observed behaviors some supporting evidence for hysteresis in reaction rates already exists that may be linked to reaction hot spots e g baird et al 2005 stegen et al 2016 but further research is needed to determine if appropriate models or corrections can be developed these changes are difficult to capture in grid based simulations particularly given stability constraints appendix b and represent an area where lagrangian methods may be particularly helpful in connecting experiments simulations and observations the main limitation of these results are that they are 2 d steady state flow fields and the transport problem is also steady state the former is not likely to introduce large errors as engdahl 2017 recently showed that it takes large fluctuations in boundary conditions over time to fundamentally change the behavior of a confined flow field factors like pumping can cause the kinds of large changes that will have a significant impact zinn and konikow 2007a 2007b and transience strongly affects unconfined systems engdahl et al 2016 the lack of transience in the transport problem is an issue because many contaminant transport problems are not steady state but bit methods may be useful in the context of geochemistry in natural or minimally disturbed systems bit transient problems that involve instantaneous or transient boundaries on the chemical side of the problem may be tractable using recent advances like the diffusive strip method le borgne et al 2013 2015 meunier and villermaux 2010 and phase exposure dependent exchange ginn et al 2017 but this has yet to be evaluated quantitatively a final limitation of bit methods for reactive transport lies in the diffusion operator it is known that it is self adjoint and this means that fundamentally it is a spreading processes in fit and bit models labolle et al 1996 neupauer and wilson 1999 dispersion in a bit model will look similar to dispersion in a fit model creating fingering in heterogeneous flow fields when in reality mixing limited problems must be un mixed when simulated backward the fit process of diffusion is an entropy maximizing process that cannot be undone by simply sending mass up a concentration gradient instead of down especially with particles but some recent methods for doing so have been proposed e g ababou et al 2010 regardless the process of un mixing solutes in a true bit model is an unclear and non unique problem that remains unresolved clearly fit and bit simulations in heterogeneous fields are not precisely equivalent but the close agreement of the steady state masses suggests that there may be some value to bit simulations in inverse problems at the very least a capture zone analysis from a passive bit model can be used to determine the source zones for a forward model which would be used to select only the subset of a larger domain necessary to reduce the size of the fit domain presently we see this as the most reliable use of bit methods and it may also be a viable method for solving transient and mixing limited problems because it avoids the issues of un mixing solutes and path dependent diffusion however we also expect that a more adaptive iterative combination of fit and bit methods could help to significantly reduce uncertainty in inverse problems if some of the current implementation obstacles can be overcome our most significant finding is that in some simplified cases it is possible to estimate the source distribution directly from observation data using a bit model but many technical and conceptual challenges remain before this approach can be made into a more general tool acknowledgements the authors thank the anonymous reviewers for timely and constructive feedback that improved the quality of this manuscript appendix a notes on forward and backward in time dynamics our approach in this article has been to use high accuracy numerical models as virtual experiments to investigate the applicability of bit models to reactive transport but some aspects can also be explored directly from the governing equations this analysis may be of interest to some readers but it is not presently our main focus so it is included here as an appendix let us first consider the case of deterministic well mixed chemical reaction dynamics we assume the dynamics to be described by a set of first order ordinary differential equations odes a 1 d c t d t f c t t where c t is a vector whose components are the concentrations of each chemical species at time t and f is a vector whose components describe the potentially concentration and time depent combined rate of change of each species due to all chemical reactions assume that for a given initial state at time t 0 c t 0 c 0 the corresponding initial value problem is well posed we note in passing that a sufficient condition is f lipschitz continuous which is implied by f differentiable with continuous derivatives the necessary and sufficient condition is given by okamura s theorem okamura 1942 by the theorem of existence and uniqueness for first order odes e g meiss 2007 this means that the trajectories are unique and cannot intersect each other or themselves within finite time critical points equilibria c c where f c c 0 may only be reached asymptotically and this is true in general of attractors such as limit cycles thus at some time tf t 0 a trajectory that was started outside of an attractor must be at some point c t f c f that is also not part of an attractor it is easy to see that the initial value problem associated with the backward equation is a 2 d c t d t f c t t which gives the backward evolution of the same system up to some time t 0 tf since it describes the backward movement along a unique trajectory this simple change establishes the equivalence between the fit and bit models for reaction dynamics described by a set of first order odes and shows that the backward evolution can be found by taking a negative time step δt in the numerical integration based on the forward equation however some words of caution are in order 1 even though attractors cannot be reached in finite time trajectories may come arbitrarily close this means that experimentally and even numerically a certain measured state may be indistinguishable from a point in an attractor in this case the backward equation cannot predict the dynamics before the attractor was reached and it will predict that the system was in the attractor at all times 2 the bit formulation turns stable attractors into unstable attractors and vice versa a trajectory in the fit model that is sufficiently close to a stable attractor will stay close and it may be reasonable to approximate it as being in the attractor for all times of interest for the trajectory to stay at or near the attractor in the bit model may require a careful choice of numerical method that deals with the instability 3 if the system exhibits chaotic dynamics the ability of the bit model to predict the past is limited by the same principles that constrain the ability of the fit model to predict the future namely for a finite but arbitrary level of precision of measurement of the final state there is a past time horizon beyond which we cannot predict the trajectory in other words the problem of sensitivity to initial conditions becomes that of sensitivity to final conditions if diffusion is absent and we have transport by advection the previous considerations still hold by augmenting the state space with the spatial coordinate x which obeys the equation d x d t v x without diffusion adjacent streamlines do not mix and the arguments above hold independently on a per streamline basis note however that if a reaction has a large support scale i e particles can react at distances large compared to the scale of variation of v reaction between streamlines may occur and this local ode representation is not adequate let us now consider the effect of stochastic transport dynamics intuitively dispersive transport destroys memory of initial conditions and as time increases we loose information about the precise location at which a solute particle will be given its initial position thus the position x tf of a particle at a given time tf given its position x t 0 at time t 0 tf will have an associated uncertainty even if x t 0 is known deterministically on the other hand if we instead measure a particle s position at some time tf we know this position with ideally no uncertainty but only have probabilistic information about where it originated this is in contrast to the previous argument because trajectories between two points are no longer unique and instead follow some probability distribution the backward equation describes the density of initial mass positions given a certain measured concentration distribution at time tf for example if we are interested in the original position at time t 0 of a certain mass m reaching a small region around point x f at a later time tf we could enforce the initial condition m δ x x f at time tf where δ is the dirac delta the solution to the backward equation at time t 0 would then describe the concentration distribution at time t 0 composed of all possible initial mass positions weighted with their respective density given that they follow trajectories that end deterministically at x f more formally consider conservative dispersive transport described by the stochastic differential equation for particle trajectories a 3 d x t v x t t d x t t b x t t d ξ t with the itō interpretation e g van kampen 2007 for each position x and time t the matrix b x t has real coefficients and is such that b b t x t 2 d x t where the superscript t denotes transposition and d is the dispersion tensor for example in one dimension b 2 d δ t at each point and time where d is the dispersion coefficient the noise ξ is a wiener process brownian motion this leads to the advection dispersion equation as the forward equation for the concentration of each species given the initial concentration at time t 0 a 4 c t v c d c the corresponding backward equation conditioned instead on the final concentration distribution at time tf t 0 is risken 1989 a 5 c t v c x t d c the transport operator acting on the concentration on the right hand side in the backward case is the adjoint of the transport operator in the forward case note that the form of neupauer and wilson 1999 omits the 1 on the time derivative but still assumes that the evolution of the model is backward in time so the two are equivalent taking t t i e flipping the sign of the time derivative because the evolution is backward in time in the backward equation shows that diffusion behaves identically backward and forward in time and always increases spreading uncertainty for the case of incompressible flow the velocity contribution backward in time corresponds to the flow being reversed in order to simulate reactive transport backwards we simply integrate the langevin equation numerically backward in time by starting with the final condition and a negative δt and use available collocation methods as usual with the reactive term given by f c as discussed above here we have assumed v and d to be differentiable with respect to the spatial coordinates extensions to discontinuous coefficients are also available labolle et al 2000 we have also assumed that the transport dynamics are independent of the chemical species although the considerations presented here hold also for species dependent advection and dispersion appendix b stability of the forward and backward problems one topic not addressed in the manuscript is the issue of numerical stability the particle based methods used here represent solutions of np number of particles independent stochastic differential equations of motion which do not suffer from spurious oscillations and are also devoid of numerical dispersion however this raises a related question as to whether or not eulerian formulations of the bit problem are numerically less stable than their fit counterparts we consider here the stability of a simple eulerian discretization of the transport operator eq 5 before proceeding we note that there is a fundamental difference between the adjoint equation and a truly backward in time operator the adjoint equation eq a 5 is not a true inverse because it does not undo a forward model the adjoint equation eq a 5 reverses time via a reversal of the velocity field but the dispersion term remains a spreading operation that increases the uncertainty of the final condition as time moves backward from an initial state as such the adjoint model strictly generates spatial probability distributions of the system at previous states as noted in the previous appendix correctly incorporating the final condition in a bit model requires solving the adjoint transport equation which is done throughout the manuscript but for completeness we first consider the stability of the forward model and the model that results from reversing both the velocity field and the effect of dispersion consider a 1 d finite difference discretization of the constant coefficient transport equation without reactions b 1 f n k 1 f n k α δ t v 2 δ x f n 1 k f n 1 k d δ x 2 f n 1 k 2 f n k f n 1 k 0 where v is a constant velocity d is a constant dispersion coefficient n indexes spatial position s and k indexes time levels e g k 1 t k δ t the α term is used to create a classical forward model and a backward inverse model that reverses both velocity and diffusion by changing only the sign of the time step which arise from α 1 and α 1 respectively the overall accuracy of the numerical scheme will be proportionate to δt and δx 2 which is independent of the scaling coefficient α so both schemes have comparable accuracy note that this explicit centered space discretization is known to introduce numerical dispersion which can be reduced with higher order methods see benson et al 2017 but the purpose of this demonstration is only to compare the stability properties of forward and backward models following pozrikidis 2008 we carry out a von neumann stability analysis by substituting the following test function into b 1 b 2 f n k a k exp i θ j where i 2 1 j 1 0 1 to denote the n 1 n and n 1 terms of b 1 respectively and θ is an angular frequency 0 θ π define γ v δ t 2 δ x and β d δ t δ x 2 and simplify to find the amplification factor b 3 a k 1 a k 1 2 α β cos θ 1 i γ sin θ the requirement for stability is max θ a k 1 a k 1 which gives the stability criteria that αγ 2 2αβ 1 see pozrikidis 2008 thus the explicit model for the fit problem α 1 is conditionally stable the fully reversed backward in time model is created by taking α 1 since the same stability criterium applies the term related to advection γ is unchanged because it is squared but the inequality can never be satisfied since αβ 0 and αγ 2 0 thus the fully reversed backward model is unconditionally unstable it is important to note that the fully reversed backward model is in fact physically unstable and not simply numerically unstable this is because when reversed diffusion increases rather than smooths gradients leading to unbounded growth of concentration the stability analysis clearly shows that simply reversing time does not allow one to reverse a forward model and this motivates the adjoint equation the key difference between the true backward model and the adjoint equation is that only the advection term is reversed in the latter i e eq a 5 more details can be found in neupauer and wilson 1999 and risken 1989 the stability condition becomes αγ 2 2β 1 and the fit and bit models have the same conditional stability properties given the same δx and δt solving the adjoint problem for the bit case ensures that the flow paths will be reversed but the key point here is that spreading will still occur even though time is reversed the adjoint model propagates uncertainty backward through the model given a set of conditioning final observations so it should not be expected to be equivalent to the forward model in anything other than an ensemble averaged domain wide sense a bit model that is a true inverse of the forward model would be capable of undoing spreading if it should exist but we are aware of no general techniques for doing so note that the reverse chemical problem may also become physically unrealistic for example a simple degradation reaction becomes an unbounded production reaction when considered backward in time and this was encountered in our results this is a fundamental feature of the physical process and not an issue of numerical stability 
778,indirect inversion has been the predominant method for matching models and data in geochemical systems typically using observations of chemical concentrations as calibration targets this reserves the data with the highest confidence observed concentrations for the final comparison but does little to constrain the initial state of the system on which the indirect inversion is based an alternative approach to inverse modeling is to start with the observations to reconstruct a concentration field but it is unclear if this is feasible for reactive transport in heterogeneous systems the purpose of this article is to consider the applicability of backward in time bit techniques as tools for simulating reactive transport in porous media a multi component reaction system is considered in a variety of systems of increasing complexity and we show that complex non linear systems can be simulated backward in time given a sufficiently robust integration scheme recent advances in reactive random walk particle tracking are employed to investigate simple flow systems with spatially variable reactions as well as 2 d heterogeneous flows and we show that some level of time reversibility exists in both cases under a uniform injection scheme the total masses generated in forward and backward simulations of the 2 d models were all within 3 5 of each other for all the species considered indicating good overall agreement between the models this suggests that bit techniques may have yet unrealized applications to inverse modeling however further research on the sensitivity of the approach to measurement errors and on how to efficiently apply bit methods to transient problems is needed keywords reactive transport inverse modeling backward in time 1 introduction reactive transport problems involve immense complexities existing at multiple temporal and spatial scales atchley et al 2014 dentz et al 2011 a common approach to understanding the behavior of such systems starts by collecting and analyzing geochemical data at monitoring points then using a lumped parameter or distributed model to discover the physical implications or context of the observations for predictive modeling or other applications at its core this workflow is an application of indirect inverse modeling to reactive transport the parameters boundary conditions and initial conditions of a forward model are specified the simulation result is compared to the data and then the model is revised accordingly until satisfactory agreement with observations is reached distributed parameter models e g appelo and rolle 2010 beisman et al 2015 are common tools for simulating reactive transport because of their ability to solve problems with spatially variable parameters as opposed to lumped parameter models however these models also further complicate the problem because of their immense computational expense which can require hours days or weeks for a single simulation e g mills et al 2007 a key point about these models is that each forward simulation implicitly assumes that the specified initial and boundary conditions are correct and that the hydrologic and geochemical properties of the system will be able to approach the observed values but this is far from guaranteed considering the uncertainty of the problem essentially this approach relies on specifying something that we do not or cannot know the initial condition and uses this guess to try and recreate observations this can be an effective strategy but the enormous computational costs can limit its applicability to those with supercomputers at their disposal making it impractical for many real world problems inverse modeling can be sped up by adopting simplified forward models but this comes at the expense of accuracy since excessive simplifications will inevitably lead to inaccurate predictions particularly regarding nonlinear processes clearly a major challenge of any reactive transport model is identifying the starting state of the system regardless of the simplicity or complexity of the forward model with this in mind it may be possible to improve the process of inverse modeling if the system can be solved in a way that begins with known data as opposed to comparing to it in the end this would then provide plausible estimates of the unknown initial conditions that are conditional to the observations which are the component of the inverse problem that is known with the highest confidence the main question is how to incorporate the observations most effectively in the inverse model many ways of conditioning to chemical data exist but one possibility that has seen little attention is simulating the full reactive transport system with time reversed forward in time fit models are widespread across hydrology but the most common example of a backward in time bit or adjoint model is capture zone analysis which is often associated with simulations of travel time from a strictly mathematical perspective there is nothing preventing integration of a system of ordinary differential equations odes in an arbitrary direction the simplest case to consider to illustrate this point is a single analytical function such as f with derivative d f d x 2 x given a known function value anywhere on the curve say f x 2 2 one can determine the value at any other location and the same is true for a system of equations as long as a starting point for each equation is known however eulerian solutions of a system of partial differential equations in arbitrary directions fit or bit introduce complexities in the boundary conditions see neupauer and wilson 1999 2002 and the stability of the problem is not guaranteed appendix b lagrangian approaches to the backward problem de rooij et al 2013 eberts et al 2012 offer a conceptually simpler approach at least mathematically and they are adopted here for this reason the most common lagrangian approach in hydrology is random walk particle tracking rwpt a simple form of the rw equation for a fit model is 1 x i t δ t x i t v x i t t 2 d δ t ξ where x i t l is the position vector of the ith particle at time t moving according to the velocity field v x t l t and diffusing at rate d l 2 t with n dimensional gaussian random noise included via ξ over time step δt in the continuum limit i e for a large ensemble of particles it is well known that this models an advection dispersion process we expect that many readers are at least conceptually familiar with the rw model so a more general form and more detail on the approach are reserved for appendix a the key point is that lagrangian methods discretize the mass whereas eulerian methods discretize space contemporary versions of the rw approach can now assign an arbitrary number of species to each particle bolster et al 2016 allow inter particle interactions benson and meerschaert 2008 rahbaralam et al 2015 and incorporate complex reactions engdahl et al 2017 while avoiding numerical oscillations and numerical dispersion the random walk bit approach for advection is conceptually simple and differs from the fit model only in the sign of the time step δ t δ t in 1 which can also be accomplished by reversing the sign of the velocity field more details on advection are given in appendix a but it simply traces streamlines backwards instead of forwards the diffusion operator is self adjoint and this means that its forward and backward forms are identical it remains a spreading operation in both cases proportional in magnitude to δ t backward in time dispersion due to sub grid velocity heterogeneity incorporates some of the elements of the advection and diffusion operators and interested readers are referred to uffink 1990 for details it is important to note that since diffusion is simulated as a random process the forward and backward paths of an individual particle will differ unless the exact same jumps are used in both simulations conceptually a bit model places particles at their terminus and sends them back to their source allowing for advection and random dispersive motion along the way one interpretation of this approach is that it aims to identify the distribution of source locations conditional to the sampling location s whereas a fit model does the opposite the bit approach has seen widespread use in source zone identification and simulations of residence time distributions e g engdahl and maxwell 2015 but it has also been used to reconstruct concentration histories of environmental tracers reactions have been simulated on particles in previous applications of bit models but these have been limited to simple reactions that do not require particles to interact such as first order decay e g mccallum et al 2014 when more complex reactions are considered the validity of bit methods is not as clear because the combined impacts of advection spreading and reactions in the presence of a heterogeneous velocity field may have unanticipated effects this also raises some basic questions for example are the same flow paths sampled when spreading occurs in a reversed velocity field however in order to assess whether or not source zone concentrations can be reconstructed using bit methods we must first address the issue of whether or not reactive transport can be simulated in backward time the purpose of this article is to investigate whether or not bit simulations are possible for nonlinear reactive transport systems in an operational sense the approach taken here applies recent advances in particle based simulations of complex reactions to the backward problem and we provide several examples that evaluate the equivalency of the forward and backward models under different transport conditions a single article cannot address all of the possible reaction systems initial conditions and boundary conditions nor the infinite combinations of other factors that can influence reactive transport consequently we focus on a few generic steady state problems and avoid making generalizations at this stage until more supporting research can be completed however the examples establish the general time reversibility of reaction networks in a batch reactor and the equivalency of fit and bit models in 1 d domains under homogeneous and spatially variable reaction rates and demonstrate some of the challenges presented by 2 d heterogeneous flows the body of the article focuses on numerical analysis but two appendices are included that discuss theoretical considerations of backward in time models appendix a and the numerical stability of the fit and bit models appendix b addressing this collection of basic questions is seen as a necessary prerequisite for future investigations of the potential applications of bit simulations such as in inverse problems and uncertainty reduction 2 reaction system simple first order reactions are trivial to reconstruct and this is the basis of many environmental tracer analyses to determine water ages from tracers like krypton 85 or tritium our first task is to show that this time reversibility can also apply to more complex reaction networks the reaction network we consider here is based on the competitive decay chain example found in engdahl et al 2017 which involves a combination of equilibrium and kinetic reactions 2a p a q b c 2b c e f 2c e where p and q are stoichiometric coefficients and the uppercase letters represent chemical species these aqueous phase reactions only affect solutes and involve no precipitation dissolution or surface complexation reactions these processes can be included but are omitted here for simplicity eqs 2a and 2c are irreversible kinetic reactions with rate constants kf and λ respectively and eq 2b is an equilibrium reversible reaction with equilibrium constant k e q c e f we assume unit stoichiometry for 2b arbitrary chemical species are used for generality but this can represent a wide variety of processes the system has a natural shift in its balance over time because f temporarily sequesters e which causes it to stay in the system longer than if decay alone acted on e in a transport system this allows competition between mixing limitations and the direction of the equilibrium reaction to be simulated while still being of manageable complexity 2 1 component based solution the continuum reactive transport system can be written as 3a a t t a r 1 3b b t t b p q r 1 3c c t t c r 1 r 2 3d e t t e r 2 r 3 3e f t t f r 2 where t is a generic transport operator and the ri denote the arbitrary reaction rates for each step based on the reaction system eq 2 rate r 1 corresponds to the rate of eq 2a r 2 corresponds to eq 2b r 3 corresponds to eq 2c the specific form of each is defined below initially we will consider a well mixed batch reactor so that t 0 but this will be relaxed later solving this system is complicated by the unknown r 2 reaction rate which must be instantaneous since it is associated with an equilibrium reaction one technique is to adopt an operator splitting os approach and this is an option in many geochemical simulation codes e g appelo and rolle 2010 beisman et al 2015 gardner et al 2015 hammond et al 2014 steefel and lasaga 1994 doing so inherently incurs small errors since the system is solved sequentially however given an appropriately small time step these are generally inconsequential another possibility is to approximate the equilibrium reactions as a fast kinetic and a final alternative is to define chemical components that eliminate the equilibrium reaction from the solution the latter is adopted here combining the 3rd 4th and 5th equations of 3 we can define two components c t c f and e t e f which reduce the system to 4a a t t a r 1 4b b t t b p q r 1 4c c t t t c t r 1 4d e t t t e t r 3 this eliminates the unknown rate r 2 that was associated with the equilibrium reaction the assumed rate laws are r 1 k f a p b q and r 3 λ e the r 3 term is determined via e not one of the components but this can be found from the definition of the components and the law of mass action k e q c e f the components can be rewritten as c t c f and e t e f and substituted into the mass action law to produce a quadratic in f the exact values of c and e over time are now uniquely defined through ct et and f at all times this transformation ensures that all of the reaction rates involved in 4 are finite because the instantaneous reactions have been eliminated but this is not always possible and an operator splitting os approach can be used in such cases in our testing the component and os approaches both gave reasonably accurate results as long as the time step of the problem is small relative to the characteristic time of the fastest kinetic reaction but we adopted the component approach for speed and to minimize any potential sources of numerical errors one relevant note is that anytime components are used here ct and et it is possible to generate negative component concentrations since they are derived quantities regardless of whether the model is fit or bit this is no cause for concern in most fit models however since eq 2a in this reaction system is irreversible negative species concentrations can be generated in the bit simulation the rate law for eq 2a describes the breakdown of a and b in the fit model which produces c but r 1 does not depend the concentration of c this means that the bit model has no limitation on the masses of a and b that can be generated and they can grow indefinitely consuming c as they do and eventually driving its concentration negative our goal is to generate a concentration field based on the simulated trajectories of the particles in the bit model to compare to the fit model so we simply enforce a minimum value of c 1 0 10 10 in order for the kinetic reaction to occur in the bit model however any trajectory that generates a negative concentration could be rejected as implausible and this is expected to be useful as a screening criteria in upscaled simulations 2 2 forward and backward simulation of reactions our next task is to determine whether a bit model can reconstruct the fit solution of the nonlinear reaction system assuming the transport operator is null and that the system is contained in a well mixed batch reactor the system defined by 4 is a series of coupled ordinary differential equations odes no straightforward analytical solution exits so we adopt a 4th order runge kutta scheme rk4 for the integration of the reaction system to minimize errors the rk4 scheme is a flexible choice and allows time dependent linear nonlinear reactions or combinations of both to be modeled in a consistent framework it also allows the forward and backward time systems to be solved with an identical set of odes with variable time stepping if needed a standard rk4 implementation see pozrikidis 2008 was used and verified against the analytical solution for a second order irreversible nonlinear kinetic reaction given by benson and bolster 2016 the two were in excellent agreement so the full comparison is omitted the forward problem fit model assumes the following initial conditions a 0 1 0 b 0 1 2 c 0 f 0 0 and e 0 1 1 the stoichiometry of the kinetic reaction is nonlinear with p 1 and q 2 the rate constants are k f 5 0 10 3 and λ 1 0 10 2 with k e q 1 0 10 2 the time period of the forward simulation spans t 0 1 10 4 and we use a constant δ t 1 0 10 2 to generate a high accuracy reference solution the solution of the forward model is shown in fig 1 a as the solid lines the same model using a modified set of rate constants is also shown in fig 1b the modified rate constants are k f 1 0 10 1 and λ 5 0 10 2 with k e q 1 0 10 2 and the same initial values were used in both examples the first bit model we evaluate uses the same rk4 scheme with identical parameters but the sign of the time step is reversed and its magnitude increased so that δ t 0 1 the intent of the change in time step is to treat the fit model as the experimental result and the bit as a model of it the initial values for the bit problem are the final values of the reference model and the simulation is run backward to t 0 the differences between the rk4 model and the reference solution were quantified with the maximum magnitude of error over all times l norm and the average of the absolute value of all errors l 1 norm these errors are given in table 1 rk4 row and are very small for all intents and purposes the rk4 bit simulation exactly reproduces the reference fit model fig 1 circles note there are errors introduced here since both solutions have accuracy proportionate to δt 5 pozrikidis 2008 and different time steps were used however the time step and accompanying accuracy of the rk4 bit model are sufficiently small that the errors are not visible relative to the magnitude of concentrations the rk4 bit scheme is highly accurate but it comes at a high computational cost because it takes incremental steps to evaluate the derivatives eq 4 four times per time step a second order runge kutta scheme rk2 also called the modified euler method requires half as many function evaluations but still has accuracy proportionate to δt 3 pozrikidis 2008 so it may be an acceptable tradeoff in some cases re running the bit model with the rk2 scheme at δ t 1 0 10 1 produces larger errors relative to the reference solution than the rk4 scheme table 1 rk2 row but these are still indistinguishable against the plot of the forward model fig 1 squares lastly we consider the first order euler explicit method and investigate the magnitude of error that accumulates in this reaction system from such a coarse approximation using the same time step the explicit euler model will have accuracy proportionate to δt 1 so appreciable errors should be expected for the nonlinear system the maximum errors table 1 euler row were on the order of 10 4 and 10 3 for fit and bit models respectively and this is reflected in the visible deviations from the reference model fig 1 diamonds the accumulated error is significantly greater than the rk2 scheme these numerical approximations show that complex reaction networks can be simulated backward in time the time reversibility holds with nonlinear combinations of equilibrium and kinetic reactions and also for other combinations of rate constants and equilibrium constants omitted for brevity the robustness of the numerical scheme is essential to the reconstruction euler rk2 and rk4 schemes can all provide reasonable approximations of the system when the time scales of reactions are much greater than the simulation time step but convergence analysis should always be used to evaluate whether the time step is sufficiently small to minimize error accumulation the jump from euler to rk2 provides considerably more accuracy for a very low computational cost since the second evaluation of the derivatives reduces the total number of time steps to achieve comparable accuracy by about a factor of 100 first order approximations are convenient but an important caution is that the use of low order integration schemes in reactive transport codes regardless of whether it is a fit or bit model will lead to errors such errors are significant in these examples and calibrated rate constants in an inverse modeling setting could mask these inaccuracies the errors may even be on the order of numerical dispersion in an eulerian model interested readers are directed to benson et al 2017 for more details including discussion of potential damkohler number issues 3 uniform flow with reactions so far we have established that concentrations in the reaction system of eq 2 can be reconstructed backward in time for a stirred reactor our next task is evaluating the same question using a model of a system that includes transport a mobile system is now considered and the transport operator for eq 4 is denoted as 5 t v d where v is a velocity vector d is an n dimensional diffusion tensor and is a placeholder for the concentrations of solutes or components note that hereafter we assume a spatially and temporally constant porosity which is already embedded in the velocity field and dispersion tensor the transport and reaction algorithm we use is based on benson and bolster 2016 bolster et al 2016 and engdahl et al 2017 this lagrangian approach generally referred to as complex reactions on particles crp uses standard random walk particle tracking rwpt methods for the advection and diffusion parts of the problem but allows each particle to carry multiple chemical species unlike most rwpt algorithms the crp approach also allows particles to interact with each other at every time step the details of the interactions are given in the previous references but the basic idea is to use a linear mass transfer model where the mass transfer rate is given by the difference in mass of a particle pair and their colocation probability earlier models of reactive interacting particles used the colocation density to determine whether or not two particles would react with each other benson and meerschaert 2008 ding et al 2013 but bolster et al 2016 introduced a method by which mass was exchanged after the mass exchange step the crp approach evaluates reactions but these are entirely local to each individual particle the original crp approach e g engdahl et al 2017 called the phreeqcrm reaction engine for this step but here we use the component based rk4 solution of section 2 2 based on our experience with these methods we have also observed that the mass exchange step tends to reduce the random numerical noise and provides more stable solutions with fewer realizations but we note that it does not smooth the concentration field as much as dynamic kernel methods rahbaralam et al 2015 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2017 some last notes before proceeding are that our analysis is restricted to steady state flow fields and stable distributions of solutes which means that these are not mixing limited problems the reason for this simplification is that accurately modeling a transient mixing limited bit problem requires one to un mix solutes as time goes backward this is not a trivial task see ababou et al 2010 and further research on how to do so in an efficient and physically meaningful way is needed fully bounded domains zero outward flux with continuous sources and even some cases with finite duration sources cannot be considered for similar reasons since they may not have a steady state finally since we are considering the mathematical issue of reversibility we simplify the problem by assuming that the reaction rate constants boundary conditions and flow field are error free naturally any error or uncertainty in these quantities will affect the simulation and the issue of sensitivity can be addressed with perturbation analysis 3 1 spatially constant rate constants this example considers the time reversibility of reactive transport in a 1 d homogeneous domain of length l 10 the velocity is assumed to be constant v 0 0 05 l t and we only consider diffusion for now with d 0 1 10 2 l 2 t these define the necessary coefficients for 1 and both transport processes are simulated simultaneously using a 2nd order stochastic runge kutta scheme honeycutt 1992 we assume the domain starts empty and that the inlet boundary x 5 supplies a constant concentration of the reactants a 0 1 0 b 0 1 2 c 0 f 0 0 and e 0 1 1 the rate constants are k f 5 0 10 3 and λ 1 0 10 2 with k e q 1 0 10 2 and we choose p 1 and q 2 to create a nonlinearity in the kinetic term the boundary conditions on the domain are periodic but when particles re enter the domain at the inlet they are assigned the incoming boundary concentrations of each species the fit model was run for 2000 time units at a time step of δ t 0 1 using the full crp algorithm advection diffusion and mass transfer between particles and the steady state was reached by about t 500 the remaining times were used to generate a spatial profile of the results shown in fig 2 a where the fit flow field is toward the outlet at x 5 since the system is steady state we invoke ergodicity and average the profiles from 15 different times beginning at the steady state time of about t 500 each of the 15 profiles is separated in time by half the travel time τ 1 2 100 t across the domain to eliminate any unforeseen hysteresis effects the ensemble averaged concentration at the outlet was used as the initial condition for the bit model the same transport and reaction algorithm was used with parameters identical to the fit model the only differences are 1 the inlet for the bit problem is the outlet of the fit problem and 2 the sign of the time step in the rk4 algorithm was flipped the same time step and total simulation time were run and the average of the 15 different steady profiles are compared to the fit model in fig 2a the agreement between the two models is good overall any discrepancies tended to increase near the inlet of the fit model which represents the combined role of random fluctuations in travel time and accumulated errors 3 2 spatially variable rate constants microbially controlled reactions in natural systems may require a catalyst i e food which can be spatially and or temporally variable combined with a nonlinear rate law this represents a challenging problem with which to evaluate the fit vs bit models so we add some constraints to the example from section 3 the same problem domain flow rate and initial conditions are used but we restrict the regions where the kinetic reaction eq 2a and the decay reaction eq 2c may occur the kinetic reaction occurs in the region 5 x 2 with k f 1 2 5 10 3 and in the region 2 x 5 with k f 2 7 5 10 3 with no kinetic reaction from 2 x 2 the decay reaction is split such that λ 1 1 2 10 2 for x 0 and λ 2 8 0 10 3 elsewhere and these rates are indicated on fig 2b for clarity the simulation was run forward with δ t 0 1 up to t 2000 and the ensemble averaged fit simulation is shown in fig 2b as the solid lines the bit simulation is shown as the dashed lines in fig 2b and two models exhibit agreement comparable to that seen in fig 2a these 1 d examples show that it is possible to reconstruct concentration profiles along uniform velocity streamlines with good overall accuracy but it should be noted that the measured values used to initialize the bit models were assumed to be error free which is often not a good assumption when dealing with field data a reasonable approach to addressing such concerns would be to simulate the upper and lower bounds of the suspected measurement error as well as the expected value but given the nonlinear nature of the system these perturbations would need to be conducted individually for each species and also jointly for all combinations this would be a large number of simulations but it is not intractable finally the accuracy of these methods is controlled by the time step as with all rk solvers decreasing δt increases accuracy but the balance of error propagation and run time are problem specific decisions 4 2 d heterogeneous flow the 1 d results of section 3 2 are directly applicable to transport along non interacting streamlines with uniform velocities but they cannot be used to infer how multi dimensional heterogeneous problems will behave so we move on to a 2 d spatially variable flow field the permeability field is an operator scaling random field borrowed from benson et al 2017 and we imposed zero flux boundaries on the top and bottom with dirichlet boundaries on the right and left edges that give a gradient of 3 driving flow from left to right in the forward model the total size of the field is 100 l in x by 40 l in y with 500 and 200 cells in each direction respectively for d x d y 0 2 l the steady state flow field was found using a 2nd order implicit cell centered finite difference scheme and the velocity field is shown in fig 3 along with contours of piezometric head the geometric mean velocity in this domain is v 1 26 10 1 l t which gives an expected travel time across a cell of τ 7 94 t and we choose δ t 0 1 to better represent trajectories in the higher velocity regions the rate constants for the kinetic reactions were decreased to k f 1 0 10 3 and λ 5 0 10 4 because of the increased size of this domain relative to that used in section 3 but the equilibrium constant and the values of the initial condition are unchanged the transport model simulates advection and diffusion d 0 2 10 2 l 2 t with the transport operator defined by eq 5 assuming a spatially and temporally constant porosity of 30 the integration of the random walk particle trajectories used a 2nd order stochastic runge kutta scheme honeycutt 1992 and the reaction system was integrated using an rk4 scheme 4 1 forward model the fit model starts with particles at the left edge x 0 flowing to the right placed randomly according to a prescribed distribution along the vertical direction y a periodic boundary is used on the opposite side where an exiting particle is recycled to the inlet and its new position on the vertical is drawn randomly we provide separate results for uniform weighting and flux weighting injection schemes rwpt methods discretize the mass into point particles and these are mapped onto a grid to generate concentration fields for visualization this can require a large number of particles but this workload can be reduced significantly since we are interested in steady state concentrations in this case the question becomes a conditioning statement what is the average concentration mass when particles are present in each cell over the entire simulation period this field only requires knowing which cell each particle is in at each time step adding the current mass of each species it carries to the total mass for the cell and increasing the particle count of the cell by 1 for each particle after enough time has elapsed the field of the total masses in each cell is divided by the particle count for each cell and this produces the field of the expected steady state concentrations this approach combined with the periodic boundary allowed us to use only 5 103 particles and simulate 105 time steps to reach steady state the serial execution of the full model took less than 15 min on a 2014 macbook pro the log transformed steady state concentration field of the fit model reflects the heterogeneities of the velocity field and is shown in the left columns of fig 4 for chemical species b c e and f for the uniformly weighted injection scheme species a is omitted because its distribution is similar to that of b 4 2 backward model the bit model swaps the inlet and outlet boundaries concentration and reverses the direction of the flow field the initial particle positions are again based on a randomized distribution either uniform or flux based weights but the boundary concentrations are specified from the steady state concentration field of the fit model at its outlet the bit models are shown in the right column of fig 4 and there are some clear discrepancies between the two errors tend to increase from right to left but even with these errors it is interesting that many similar patterns exist in both concentration fields some obvious culprits are the stringers of high b and e concentration that originate near x 55 y 20 with the complementary decreases in c and f along with the excess amounts of b in the lower left corner despite these visual differences the total mass globally in each paired fit bit simulation is remarkably close the ratio of the total bit mass for each species to the fit model is shown in table 2 and the uniform weighting scheme is within 1 of the fit for species a b and f the least accurate species is species c in the flux weighted models which is underestimated by about 7 relative to the fit scheme and a and b are overestimated as a consequence however for domain wide total masses the fit and bit results are surprisingly close 4 3 residence time and reversibility a natural candidate for causing the discrepancies between fit and bit models is a difference in residence times which leads to the question of whether or not the residence time distributions rtds of the models are similar this was investigated by using the same particle tracking scheme in a passive mode to simulate the rtds where 20 000 particles were released into the models using more particles did not significantly alter the simulated rtds the fit model placed the particles at the inlet using the forward velocity field which was compared to the same amount of particles placed at the outlet run as a bit model for both the uniform and flux weighted injection schemes the fit and bit rtds exhibited minor differences fig 5 a for the uniform scheme with a slight shift to older residence times larger differences can be seen between the fit and bit models under flux weighting fig 5b in this case the bit model has a bigger component of young water and is slightly depleted in old water but the two rtds remain qualitatively similar the reason for the rtds for the fit and bit models not elucidating the mass discrepancies is that the rtd ignores concentration histories consider the most prominent feature in fig 5b which is the high concentration of reactant b and also a near the center of the domain in the bit model this corresponds to a region of low velocity where particles spend roughly the same amount of time in the fit and bit domains particles enter the region in the fit model from the left edge and they begin with high concentrations of a and b which are almost entirely consumed within the slow region note that the blurring around the edges of the low velocity region in the fit model is the result of spreading into the low velocity region the reactions involving a and b have basically gone to completion when the particles finally exit the region in the fit simulation and do not react further on their way out of the domain so the effluent concentrations which are used to initialize the bit models reflect a pseudo inert state in contrast the bit simulation begins reacting in reverse time to re form a and b when the particles enter the low velocity region from the right edge combined with diffusion the particles linger long enough that they regenerate all the mass and would continue to generate more if the mass of c wasn t forced to be limiting section 2 1 even though the residence times are the same in the ensemble sense the concentration history of each path is not reversible because of the effects of the spatially variable velocity and lateral dispersion if lateral dispersion did not play a role this domain could be conceptualized as a series of streamlines and the reproducibility of section 3 would be expected clearly this is not the case and the role of lateral mixing is not trivial in short the bit model has no knowledge of the time of reactant depletion from the fit model and this appears to be the cause of the mass discrepancies potentially this is a significant limitation of the method in any situation where one or more reactants are entirely consumed between the source and monitoring locations however clues like negative species concentrations could help identify cases where this is likely 5 discussion the main findings of this article are 1 nonlinear reaction networks are reversible in time in a batch reactor given high enough accuracy of the numerical integration scheme 2 reactive transport along uniform velocity flow lines i e streamlines or streamtubes with longitudinal spreading is also reversible under similar accuracy conditions and 3 at least some spatially variable velocity fields can be reversed to estimate the total mass domain wide but the spatial distribution of reactants at steady state may differ in the spatially variable case we found that uniform weighting schemes gave more accurate fit bit comparisons than a flux weighting scheme this finding illustrates one of the complexities of flux weighting in that it may not be appropriate if the distribution of fluxes at the injection or monitoring site s are not representative of the distribution of flow paths within the domain this was evident in the rtds where the fit and bit models had nearly identical rtds under uniform weighting of the injection but noticeable changes were evident in the flux weighted case a reversible rtd does not imply that the history of the particle positions along their path are flipped because the distribution of flow paths is a function of the direction of flow and the fact that spreading in the fit and bit models will be different the fit and bit models are likely never exactly equivalent within a realization but they may become so in an ensemble sense as shown in fig 2 however the exact inverse is recovered if no spreading is allowed advection only the lack of direct reversibility causes the disagreement in the fit and bit fields spatially and this is particularly sensitive in the case where one or more of the reactants are entirely consumed in the fit simulation since time to depletion of a reactant in the fit model cannot be known in the bit model this finding may have broad implications because it suggests that changing the direction of flow fundamentally alters the behavior of the problem a change in direction changes travel time which in turn changes the reaction rates over time rapid fluctuations in river stage constantly cause changes in flow directions within river corridors and these results may help explain some of the observed behaviors some supporting evidence for hysteresis in reaction rates already exists that may be linked to reaction hot spots e g baird et al 2005 stegen et al 2016 but further research is needed to determine if appropriate models or corrections can be developed these changes are difficult to capture in grid based simulations particularly given stability constraints appendix b and represent an area where lagrangian methods may be particularly helpful in connecting experiments simulations and observations the main limitation of these results are that they are 2 d steady state flow fields and the transport problem is also steady state the former is not likely to introduce large errors as engdahl 2017 recently showed that it takes large fluctuations in boundary conditions over time to fundamentally change the behavior of a confined flow field factors like pumping can cause the kinds of large changes that will have a significant impact zinn and konikow 2007a 2007b and transience strongly affects unconfined systems engdahl et al 2016 the lack of transience in the transport problem is an issue because many contaminant transport problems are not steady state but bit methods may be useful in the context of geochemistry in natural or minimally disturbed systems bit transient problems that involve instantaneous or transient boundaries on the chemical side of the problem may be tractable using recent advances like the diffusive strip method le borgne et al 2013 2015 meunier and villermaux 2010 and phase exposure dependent exchange ginn et al 2017 but this has yet to be evaluated quantitatively a final limitation of bit methods for reactive transport lies in the diffusion operator it is known that it is self adjoint and this means that fundamentally it is a spreading processes in fit and bit models labolle et al 1996 neupauer and wilson 1999 dispersion in a bit model will look similar to dispersion in a fit model creating fingering in heterogeneous flow fields when in reality mixing limited problems must be un mixed when simulated backward the fit process of diffusion is an entropy maximizing process that cannot be undone by simply sending mass up a concentration gradient instead of down especially with particles but some recent methods for doing so have been proposed e g ababou et al 2010 regardless the process of un mixing solutes in a true bit model is an unclear and non unique problem that remains unresolved clearly fit and bit simulations in heterogeneous fields are not precisely equivalent but the close agreement of the steady state masses suggests that there may be some value to bit simulations in inverse problems at the very least a capture zone analysis from a passive bit model can be used to determine the source zones for a forward model which would be used to select only the subset of a larger domain necessary to reduce the size of the fit domain presently we see this as the most reliable use of bit methods and it may also be a viable method for solving transient and mixing limited problems because it avoids the issues of un mixing solutes and path dependent diffusion however we also expect that a more adaptive iterative combination of fit and bit methods could help to significantly reduce uncertainty in inverse problems if some of the current implementation obstacles can be overcome our most significant finding is that in some simplified cases it is possible to estimate the source distribution directly from observation data using a bit model but many technical and conceptual challenges remain before this approach can be made into a more general tool acknowledgements the authors thank the anonymous reviewers for timely and constructive feedback that improved the quality of this manuscript appendix a notes on forward and backward in time dynamics our approach in this article has been to use high accuracy numerical models as virtual experiments to investigate the applicability of bit models to reactive transport but some aspects can also be explored directly from the governing equations this analysis may be of interest to some readers but it is not presently our main focus so it is included here as an appendix let us first consider the case of deterministic well mixed chemical reaction dynamics we assume the dynamics to be described by a set of first order ordinary differential equations odes a 1 d c t d t f c t t where c t is a vector whose components are the concentrations of each chemical species at time t and f is a vector whose components describe the potentially concentration and time depent combined rate of change of each species due to all chemical reactions assume that for a given initial state at time t 0 c t 0 c 0 the corresponding initial value problem is well posed we note in passing that a sufficient condition is f lipschitz continuous which is implied by f differentiable with continuous derivatives the necessary and sufficient condition is given by okamura s theorem okamura 1942 by the theorem of existence and uniqueness for first order odes e g meiss 2007 this means that the trajectories are unique and cannot intersect each other or themselves within finite time critical points equilibria c c where f c c 0 may only be reached asymptotically and this is true in general of attractors such as limit cycles thus at some time tf t 0 a trajectory that was started outside of an attractor must be at some point c t f c f that is also not part of an attractor it is easy to see that the initial value problem associated with the backward equation is a 2 d c t d t f c t t which gives the backward evolution of the same system up to some time t 0 tf since it describes the backward movement along a unique trajectory this simple change establishes the equivalence between the fit and bit models for reaction dynamics described by a set of first order odes and shows that the backward evolution can be found by taking a negative time step δt in the numerical integration based on the forward equation however some words of caution are in order 1 even though attractors cannot be reached in finite time trajectories may come arbitrarily close this means that experimentally and even numerically a certain measured state may be indistinguishable from a point in an attractor in this case the backward equation cannot predict the dynamics before the attractor was reached and it will predict that the system was in the attractor at all times 2 the bit formulation turns stable attractors into unstable attractors and vice versa a trajectory in the fit model that is sufficiently close to a stable attractor will stay close and it may be reasonable to approximate it as being in the attractor for all times of interest for the trajectory to stay at or near the attractor in the bit model may require a careful choice of numerical method that deals with the instability 3 if the system exhibits chaotic dynamics the ability of the bit model to predict the past is limited by the same principles that constrain the ability of the fit model to predict the future namely for a finite but arbitrary level of precision of measurement of the final state there is a past time horizon beyond which we cannot predict the trajectory in other words the problem of sensitivity to initial conditions becomes that of sensitivity to final conditions if diffusion is absent and we have transport by advection the previous considerations still hold by augmenting the state space with the spatial coordinate x which obeys the equation d x d t v x without diffusion adjacent streamlines do not mix and the arguments above hold independently on a per streamline basis note however that if a reaction has a large support scale i e particles can react at distances large compared to the scale of variation of v reaction between streamlines may occur and this local ode representation is not adequate let us now consider the effect of stochastic transport dynamics intuitively dispersive transport destroys memory of initial conditions and as time increases we loose information about the precise location at which a solute particle will be given its initial position thus the position x tf of a particle at a given time tf given its position x t 0 at time t 0 tf will have an associated uncertainty even if x t 0 is known deterministically on the other hand if we instead measure a particle s position at some time tf we know this position with ideally no uncertainty but only have probabilistic information about where it originated this is in contrast to the previous argument because trajectories between two points are no longer unique and instead follow some probability distribution the backward equation describes the density of initial mass positions given a certain measured concentration distribution at time tf for example if we are interested in the original position at time t 0 of a certain mass m reaching a small region around point x f at a later time tf we could enforce the initial condition m δ x x f at time tf where δ is the dirac delta the solution to the backward equation at time t 0 would then describe the concentration distribution at time t 0 composed of all possible initial mass positions weighted with their respective density given that they follow trajectories that end deterministically at x f more formally consider conservative dispersive transport described by the stochastic differential equation for particle trajectories a 3 d x t v x t t d x t t b x t t d ξ t with the itō interpretation e g van kampen 2007 for each position x and time t the matrix b x t has real coefficients and is such that b b t x t 2 d x t where the superscript t denotes transposition and d is the dispersion tensor for example in one dimension b 2 d δ t at each point and time where d is the dispersion coefficient the noise ξ is a wiener process brownian motion this leads to the advection dispersion equation as the forward equation for the concentration of each species given the initial concentration at time t 0 a 4 c t v c d c the corresponding backward equation conditioned instead on the final concentration distribution at time tf t 0 is risken 1989 a 5 c t v c x t d c the transport operator acting on the concentration on the right hand side in the backward case is the adjoint of the transport operator in the forward case note that the form of neupauer and wilson 1999 omits the 1 on the time derivative but still assumes that the evolution of the model is backward in time so the two are equivalent taking t t i e flipping the sign of the time derivative because the evolution is backward in time in the backward equation shows that diffusion behaves identically backward and forward in time and always increases spreading uncertainty for the case of incompressible flow the velocity contribution backward in time corresponds to the flow being reversed in order to simulate reactive transport backwards we simply integrate the langevin equation numerically backward in time by starting with the final condition and a negative δt and use available collocation methods as usual with the reactive term given by f c as discussed above here we have assumed v and d to be differentiable with respect to the spatial coordinates extensions to discontinuous coefficients are also available labolle et al 2000 we have also assumed that the transport dynamics are independent of the chemical species although the considerations presented here hold also for species dependent advection and dispersion appendix b stability of the forward and backward problems one topic not addressed in the manuscript is the issue of numerical stability the particle based methods used here represent solutions of np number of particles independent stochastic differential equations of motion which do not suffer from spurious oscillations and are also devoid of numerical dispersion however this raises a related question as to whether or not eulerian formulations of the bit problem are numerically less stable than their fit counterparts we consider here the stability of a simple eulerian discretization of the transport operator eq 5 before proceeding we note that there is a fundamental difference between the adjoint equation and a truly backward in time operator the adjoint equation eq a 5 is not a true inverse because it does not undo a forward model the adjoint equation eq a 5 reverses time via a reversal of the velocity field but the dispersion term remains a spreading operation that increases the uncertainty of the final condition as time moves backward from an initial state as such the adjoint model strictly generates spatial probability distributions of the system at previous states as noted in the previous appendix correctly incorporating the final condition in a bit model requires solving the adjoint transport equation which is done throughout the manuscript but for completeness we first consider the stability of the forward model and the model that results from reversing both the velocity field and the effect of dispersion consider a 1 d finite difference discretization of the constant coefficient transport equation without reactions b 1 f n k 1 f n k α δ t v 2 δ x f n 1 k f n 1 k d δ x 2 f n 1 k 2 f n k f n 1 k 0 where v is a constant velocity d is a constant dispersion coefficient n indexes spatial position s and k indexes time levels e g k 1 t k δ t the α term is used to create a classical forward model and a backward inverse model that reverses both velocity and diffusion by changing only the sign of the time step which arise from α 1 and α 1 respectively the overall accuracy of the numerical scheme will be proportionate to δt and δx 2 which is independent of the scaling coefficient α so both schemes have comparable accuracy note that this explicit centered space discretization is known to introduce numerical dispersion which can be reduced with higher order methods see benson et al 2017 but the purpose of this demonstration is only to compare the stability properties of forward and backward models following pozrikidis 2008 we carry out a von neumann stability analysis by substituting the following test function into b 1 b 2 f n k a k exp i θ j where i 2 1 j 1 0 1 to denote the n 1 n and n 1 terms of b 1 respectively and θ is an angular frequency 0 θ π define γ v δ t 2 δ x and β d δ t δ x 2 and simplify to find the amplification factor b 3 a k 1 a k 1 2 α β cos θ 1 i γ sin θ the requirement for stability is max θ a k 1 a k 1 which gives the stability criteria that αγ 2 2αβ 1 see pozrikidis 2008 thus the explicit model for the fit problem α 1 is conditionally stable the fully reversed backward in time model is created by taking α 1 since the same stability criterium applies the term related to advection γ is unchanged because it is squared but the inequality can never be satisfied since αβ 0 and αγ 2 0 thus the fully reversed backward model is unconditionally unstable it is important to note that the fully reversed backward model is in fact physically unstable and not simply numerically unstable this is because when reversed diffusion increases rather than smooths gradients leading to unbounded growth of concentration the stability analysis clearly shows that simply reversing time does not allow one to reverse a forward model and this motivates the adjoint equation the key difference between the true backward model and the adjoint equation is that only the advection term is reversed in the latter i e eq a 5 more details can be found in neupauer and wilson 1999 and risken 1989 the stability condition becomes αγ 2 2β 1 and the fit and bit models have the same conditional stability properties given the same δx and δt solving the adjoint problem for the bit case ensures that the flow paths will be reversed but the key point here is that spreading will still occur even though time is reversed the adjoint model propagates uncertainty backward through the model given a set of conditioning final observations so it should not be expected to be equivalent to the forward model in anything other than an ensemble averaged domain wide sense a bit model that is a true inverse of the forward model would be capable of undoing spreading if it should exist but we are aware of no general techniques for doing so note that the reverse chemical problem may also become physically unrealistic for example a simple degradation reaction becomes an unbounded production reaction when considered backward in time and this was encountered in our results this is a fundamental feature of the physical process and not an issue of numerical stability 
779,this study proposed an improved finite element based generalized lattice boltzmann model fe glbm to simulate the fluid flow in extremely heterogeneous porous media in which the generalized lattice boltzmann equations proposed by guo and zhao 2002 are solved using the characteristic galerkin finite element method gfem and the fem is applied to improve the flexibility of glbm and to optimize the flow simulation in complex geometries an image based automatic meshing method is adopted to generate advanced unstructured mesh of the structure the proposed numerical model is validated with analytical results finite difference results and previously published data in three cases including the generalized two dimensional poiseuille flow the lid driven cavity flow and the circular cylinder flow respectively the sensitivity study of the fluid flow in three dimensional fractured porous media with a disordered fracture network and permeable matrix is carried out as a practical application example and the results indicate that the matrix permeability plays an important role in controlling the flow dynamics in fractured porous media keywords finite element lattice boltzmann method fractured porous media permeable matrix heterogeneous 1 introduction fluid flow in the fractured porous medium has been one of the most challenging topics in many branches of science and engineering such as the recovery of hydrocarbon from conventional unconventional gas reservoirs geothermal energy generation underground water hydrology dullien 2012 it is important to get a better understanding of the fluid dynamics in porous media and to accurately predict the effective transport properties e g effective permeability and diffusivity for practical applications fluid flow in fractured porous media has been studied at both pore scale and representative elementary volume rev scale and many numerical models have been proposed to discretize the semi empirical models including darcy equation the brinkman or forchheimer extended darcy equation for the flow simulation al amiri 2000 adler et al 1990 gartling et al 1996 nithiarasu and ravindran 1998 as an effective numerical method the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been widely used to study fluid flow in porous media guo and zhao 2002 pan et al 2004 liu et al 2016 chen and doolen 1998 at the pore scale the standard lbm is applied to directly simulate the fluid in the pores of the medium and to obtain local flow information in detail since the early application of lbm to porous flow in 1989 succi et al 1989 tremendous efforts have been made to extend the application of lbm chen et al 2014 wang et al 2016 nie et al 2002 kang et al 2002 pan et al 2001 koponen et al 1998 due to its inherent kinetic nature and the simple implementation of non slip bounce back boundary condition the lbm is advantageous for porous flow involving microscopic interactions pan et al 2006 li et al 2005 however as has been pointed out by guo and zhao guo and zhao 2002 the method at pore scale is not suitable for practical field applications because of the huge computational resources required therefore it s necessary to improve the standard lb model to simulate porous flow at rev scale recently several rev scale lattice boltzmann models are proposed to simulate fluid flow in porous media dardis and mccloskey proposed a modified lattice boltzmann scheme by relating a real numbered parameter to the density of solid scatters to simulate flow in porous media dardis and mccloskey 1998 spaid and phelan presented a modified lb model sp model for flow in heterogeneous porous media by modifying the particle equilibrium distribution function to recovery the brinkman equation spaid and phelan jr 1997 later several improved versions of the sp model were developed freed 1998 spaid and phelan 1998 martys 2001 kang et al developed a unified lb model for multiscale porous media flow kang et al 2002 guo and zhao proposed a generalized lattice boltzmann glb model for isothermal incompressible flow in porous media a new equilibrium distribution function and the force scheme proposed in 2002 guo et al 2002 were adopted to account for the influence of the porous media guo and zhao 2002 based on the glb model chen et al developed a modified generalized lattice boltzmann model with klinkenberg s effect chen et al 2015 moreover some improved lb models have also been developed in modeling fluid flow in porous media hu et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2016 hu et al 2015 gao et al 2014 although lbm has many distinguished merits in the computational fluid dynamics however as pointed out by wang shu wang et al 2014 lbm still suffers some drawbacks and the one draws the most attention is that the conventional lbm requires regularly structured meshes which is often a big disadvantage for studying flows in complex geometries like porous media recently some approaches nannelli and succi 1992 he and doolen 1997 peng et al 1999 lee and lin 2001 guo and zhao 2003 are proposed to apply lbm on nonuniform grids among them the finite element lattice boltzmann method fe lbm has received increasing attention for its applications on irregular structured meshes in 2001 lee and lin made the first contribution toward this direction and they proposed a characteristic galerkin finite element method for the discrete boltzmann equation lee and lin 2001 based on the similar strategy shi et al proposed a discontinuous galerkin spectral element dgse lb model for solving weakly compressible flows which ensures numerical stability at high reynolds number shi et al 2003 later several other fe lb models have been proposed based on the dgse method min and lee 2011 düster et al 2006 zadehgol et al 2014 besides li et al developed another fe lb model based on the least squares finite element lsfe method and the crank nicolson method li et al 2005 although lbm has been well used to study fluid flow in porous media at rev scale for the last decade the previous researchers mainly focus on simple geometries like homogeneous geomaterials using regularly structured meshes there is still no effort to simulate fluid flow in complex geometries such as the porous medium with disordered fractured network and permeable matrix in the present paper we present a computational model for porous media flow at rev scale based on the generalized lattice boltzmann model proposed by guo and zhao 2002 and the galerkin finite element method an image based automatic meshing method is adopted to generate advanced unstructured meshes it is capable to simulate fluid flow in more complex and realistic geometries at rev scale the rest of the paper is organized as follows the finite element based generalized lattice boltzmann model fe glbm is introduced in section 2 the model is validated by simulating generalized two dimensional poiseuille flow lid driven cavity flow and flows past a circular cylinder in section 3 then a porous media flow is investigated in section 4 and finally end this paper with a conclusion in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 generalized navier stokes n s equations the governing

each lattice node the convergence criteria for towards the steady state is set as 29 max u x t n 100 δ t u x t n u x t n 10 6 we tested the velocity profile for a series of reynolds number re and darcy number da as shown in fig 1 the solid lines represent the finite difference results and the symbols represent the results of the present model the excellent agreement is observed between them which obviously confirms the reliability of the present method to simulate porous media flow at rev scale as mentioned earlier the nonlinear inertial effect must be considered at high reynolds number or darcy number fig 2 shows the peak velocity for different values of darcy number when re 1 and ε 0 1 the symbols in the figure represent the solutions from the present fe glb model while the solid line is the result of guo s model good agreement between the present results and previous lbm results can be observed additionally with the reynolds number fixed an increase of darcy number could enhance the effect of porous drag for lid cavity flow problem the present fe glb model is applied to simulate the square cavity flow and the cavity is filled with porous media with length of h the flow in the cavity is driven by the upper lid moving along x direction at a constant velocity u 0 the left right and lower boundaries use the non slip boundary condition the flow is characterized by the reynolds number r e h u 0 υ the velocity and density fields are initialized to be zero and ρ 1 at each lattice node we test the case where ε 0 1 the reynolds number is fixed as 10 in all tests and da is set to be 10 2 10 3 and 10 4 respectively simulations are performed on a uniformed mesh with 129 129 rectangular elements fig 3 presents the horizontal and vertical velocity components through the cavity centre and the results are compared with previous lbm solutions guo and zhao 2002 good agrees could be observed it is also seen that with the decrease of darcy number the boundary layer close to the upper lid becomes thinner the standard lbm can only be applied to regular meshes one advantage of the present model is to do a simulation on irregular grids to further verify the accuracy of this model to simulate fluid flow on unstructured meshes the laminar steady flow past a circular cylinder is simulated the flow domain is sketched in fig 4 and the unstructured mesh is shown in fig 5 the length and width of the channel are 20d and 10d respectively and the cylinder is located at 5d downstream from the inlet where d is the diameter of the cylinder constant velocity and pressure boundary conditions are applied to the inlet and outlet respectively the non equilibrium extrapolation scheme is applied on the top and bottom boundary and the surface of the cylinder for non slip boundary reynolds number is defined as r e d u υ where u is the free stream velocity two sets of reynolds numbers re 20 and 40 are considered in this section and the simulation results are compared with previous solutions the momentum exchange method ladd 1994 is applied to compute the force exerted by the fluid on the cylinder the momentum of particles moving with ei ei denotes the velocity towards the wall is e i f i x f t after collision step the momentum of the particle leaving the solid surface is e i f i x f t δ t e i f i x s t after interacting with the solid wall where e i e i xf is fluid node and xs is solid node the momentum exchange of the particle is e i f i x s t f i x f t the total force on the cylinder body satisfies 30 f a l l x s e i f i x s t f i x f t the drag and lift coefficients cd and cl are defined by 31 c d 2 f x ρ u 2 d c l 2 f y ρ u 2 d fig 6 shows the streamlines around the cylinder at steady state for re 20 and 40 it is observed that a pair of stationary recirculating eddies appear behind the cylinder and the wake length increases as re increases the wake length l is defined as the distance between the nearest point of the cylinder and the end of the wake usually the non dimensional wake region is defined as 2l d table 1 compares the length of the wake region and the drag coefficient estimated by this study with previous data he and doolen 1997 tritton 1959 dennis and chang 1970 nieuwstadt and keller 1973 and it can be concluded that the wake length and drag coefficient agree well with those in the literatures 4 simulation results and discussions in this section the fluid flow in porous medium with a disordered fracture network is discussed in detail the fractures are embedded and interconnected in the porous matrix fig 7 the mesh generation procedures proposed in xing and liu xing and liu 2011 and liu and xing liu and xing 2013 is applied to create the finite element mesh based on the refined rock image the 2d quadrilateral meshes are generated firstly as shown in fig 8 a then the pseudo 3d hexahedron mesh is generated through swapping and extrusion along the perpendicular direction of the meshed surface since it keeps the essential properties of the fractured porous media and simplify the computational complexity the simulation domain size is 736 556 10 and the total grid point of the unstructured mesh is 272 684 the porosity of the matrix is defined as 0 1 while the porosity of fracture network is unit leading to zero resistance force the relaxation time τ 0 8 considering that the matrix permeability can be affected by multiple phenomena such as gas slippage desorption fine migration wettability and stress compaction etc wu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2017 chen et al 2015 which otherwise induces different matrix permeability and influences the fluid flow in fractured porous media a wide range of matrix permeability from 0 02 to 0 8 is discussed in detail during the simulation the pressure gradient is applied from top to bottom the left and right walls are set as non slip boundaries using the non equilibrium extrapolation scheme if the units of variables are not specified the units are in lattice units the distributions of the velocity magnitude in the generated fractured samples with different matrix permeability are shown in figs 9 11 in these three figures the average velocity magnitude of the total simulation domain increases gradually from figs 9 11 the fluid flow in the fractures is much stronger than the matrix which is expected due to the low porosity and permeation of the matrix in fig 9 at a low matrix permeability of 0 02 the fractures are the main conductive pathways for the fluid to flow from the top to the bottom and the flow out of the fractures is extremely slow at t 1000 the fluid starts to penetrate into the main fractures under the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet the matrix only contributes to a small amount of the fluid flux as the time goes on the fluid flow in the matrix becomes negligible and the fluid flow towards the outlet in the main fractures that facing along the direction of the pressure drop dominates the flow some fracture branches are connected by the fluid and most of these branches are near the inlet at t 22 000 the fluid goes through half of the fractured sample in fig 10 at a moderate matrix permeability of 0 4 compared to the simulation results with a matrix permeability of 0 02 in fig 9 the contribution of the porous matrix to the flow in the fractured sample increases and the penetration depth increases at each time step additionally more fractures are connected by the permeable matrix and more fractures start to contribute to the flow and some small branches from the main fractures are connected under the influence of permeable matrix according to the velocity magnitude shown in fig 10 the flow in the fractures is still dominated at t 1000 although the velocity magnitude of the fluid flow in the fractures is twice of that in the matrix because of the concentrated energy and the viscosity effect the penetration depth is flat and no fluid extrusion is observed from the fractures from t 1000 to t 22 000 the fluid flow in the fractures exceeds that in the matrix and fluid breaks through the outlet from several large fractures as the results of the increased permeability of the porous matrix in fig 11 at a large matrix permeability k 0 8 the velocity distribution in the fractured sample is similar to that shown in fig 10 however at each time step the velocity at each node is higher than the situations with low permeability and the penetration depth is deeper a large matrix permeability decreases the heterogeneity between the fracture space and the matrix therefore the fluid extrusion from the fractures appears later than the cases with smaller matrix permeability interestingly a large matrix permeability does not lead to a significant connection between the matrix and the fractures the fluid still prefers to penetrate the fractures along the pressure drop direction additionally the fluid flow in fracture network is controlled by the space of the interconnections take the fracture at the bottom left as an example fluid cannot quickly flow into the large fracture space if the fracture is restricted by narrow pathways which further indicates that the permeability of the whole sample would not be remarkably increased by large fractures with poor connectivity with a large matrix permeability at the late time t 22 000 the fluid breaks through to the bottom from both the fractures and the permeable matrix and the velocity decreases faster in the fractures than that in the matrix to give more details of the fluid flow properties in the fractured porous media the velocity distribution in and around fracture a and the velocities at the cross sections y 400 and y 456 that shown in fig 7 are analyzed in fig 12 14 the results in fig 12 indicate that both the velocity in fracture a and in matrix increase with the increased matrix permeability at low matrix permeability the fluid flow in the fracture dominates the flow and fluid penetrates into the matrix from the fracture surface fig 12b however as the matrix permeability increases the flow boundary between the fractures and the matrix becomes unclear and the fluid flow in permeable matrix controlled by the pressure drop from the inlet to outlet exceed that controlled by the fracture fluid penetration as a result the fluid flow along the pressure drop in both matrix and fractures in fig 13 a c the fluid velocity at the transect y 456 with different matrix permeability at different time steps are compared respectively the average velocity of the fluid flow in the fracture a as shown in fig 7 at a different time step is listed in fig 13 d in coincidence with the results shown in figs 9 12 the fluid velocities in the fractures with large apertures are larger than that in the fractures with small apertures and the matrix additionally at each node of the cross section with the increase of the matrix permeability the velocity variation with time changes from a positive correlation to a negative correlation in fig 13 a the fluid velocity in the matrix is almost zero because of the low matrix permeability at early time the velocity in the fractures increases rapidly with the penetration of the fluid however at a late time because of the difficulty for the fluid to flow through the low permeable matrix the velocity only increases with a small amount in fig 13 b this increasing trend starts to change because a portion of the fluid starts to flow through the matrix in fig 13 c the velocity of the fluid in the fractured can even be decreased at a large matrix permeability which means a large permeation of the fluid into the matrix releases the energy accumulation and the pressure build up in the fractures the influence of the permeable matrix on the fluid flow in a single fracture can be clearly observed in fig 13 d at low matrix permeability the velocity in the fractures increases with time as the pressure transmit from the inlet to the outlet and the velocity increases with the pressure at k 0 4 the velocity starts to decrease with the time around t 6000 and the velocity of the fluid in fracture a always decreases with time at a large permeability k 0 8 the fluid velocity distributions and their components at the transect y 456 and y 400 are compared in fig 14 the streamwise velocity uy increases with the matrix permeability see a1 and b1 however the spanwise velocity ux is almost stable when the matrix permeability varies see a2 and b2 these lead to the fluid velocity at each node of both transects increases with the matrix permeability additionally at the same transect the variation of the spanwise velocity with location x l is smaller than that of the streamwise velocity except for some large fractures the stable spanwise velocity with location and the time explains why an increase in matrix permeability cannot lead to more fractures that perpendicular to the pressure drop to be connected additionally comparing the results shown in a1 a3 with those shown in b1 b3 it can be concluded that along with the pressure drop direction the velocity and its components of each node near the inlet are always larger than those far from the inlet fig 15 shows the variation of global permeability with the matrix permeability in lattice unit in which the global permeability represents the total permeability of the entire domain that calculated by applying the darcy s law by comparing the global permeability at different matrix permeability it can be concluded that a larger permeability of the matrix leads to a larger permeability of the total permeability of the fractured sample which finally leads to an early breakthrough at the outlet 5 conclusions in this study an improved finite element based generalized lattice boltzmann model is proposed to study the fluid flow in the fractured sample with permeable matrix at rev scale the proposed model improves the flexibility of applying lbm to complex geometries and optimizes the flow simulation in a complex structure with the coupling of fem the validation with previous studies demonstrates the capability of the proposed model to simulate fluid flow in extremely heterogeneous porous media which indicates that the proposed model can be applied to solve many engineering problems including the fluid flow in cleats of coal or microfractures of shale with the aid of advanced image based automatic meshing method this study concentrates on the investigation of fluid flow dynamics in a pseudo 3d heterogeneous fractured porous medium and the effects of matrix properties on fluid flow at rev scale is analyzed in detail simulation results show that the matrix permeability plays a significant role to influence the fluid permeation in the fractured sample and an ignoring of matrix permeability leads to a wrong estimation of the fluid flow properties the proposed model can be easily applied

example and the results indicate that the matrix permeability plays an important role in controlling the flow dynamics in fractured porous media keywords finite element lattice boltzmann method fractured porous media permeable matrix heterogeneous 1 introduction fluid flow in the fractured porous medium has been one of the most challenging topics in many branches of science and engineering such as the recovery of hydrocarbon from conventional unconventional gas reservoirs geothermal energy generation underground water hydrology dullien 2012 it is important to get a better understanding of the fluid dynamics in porous media and to accurately predict the effective transport properties e g effective permeability and diffusivity for practical applications fluid flow in fractured porous media has been studied at both pore scale and representative elementary volume rev scale and many numerical models have been proposed to discretize the semi empirical models including darcy equation the brinkman or forchheimer extended darcy equation for the flow simulation al amiri 2000 adler et al 1990 gartling et al 1996 nithiarasu and ravindran 1998 as an effective numerical method the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been widely used to study fluid flow in porous media guo and zhao 2002 pan et al 2004 liu et al 2016 chen and doolen 1998 at the pore scale the standard lbm is applied to directly simulate the fluid in the pores of the medium and to obtain local flow information in detail since the early application of lbm to porous flow in 1989 succi et al 1989 tremendous efforts have been made to extend the application of lbm chen et al 2014 wang et al 2016 nie et al 2002 kang et al 2002 pan et al 2001 koponen et al 1998 due to its inherent kinetic nature and the simple implementation of non slip bounce back boundary condition the lbm is advantageous for porous flow involving microscopic interactions pan et al 2006 li et al 2005 however as has been pointed out by guo and zhao guo and zhao 2002 the method at pore scale is not suitable for practical field applications because of the huge computational resources required therefore it s necessary to improve the standard lb model to simulate porous flow at rev scale recently several rev scale lattice boltzmann models are proposed to simulate fluid flow in porous media dardis and mccloskey proposed a modified lattice boltzmann scheme by relating a real numbered parameter to the density of solid scatters to simulate flow in porous media dardis and mccloskey 1998 spaid and phelan presented a modified lb model sp model for flow in heterogeneous porous media by modifying the particle equilibrium distribution function to recovery the brinkman equation spaid and phelan jr 1997 later several improved versions of the sp model were developed freed 1998 spaid and phelan 1998 martys 2001 kang et al developed a unified lb model for multiscale porous media flow kang et al 2002 guo and zhao proposed a generalized lattice boltzmann glb model for isothermal incompressible flow in porous media a new equilibrium distribution function and the force scheme proposed in 2002 guo et al 2002 were adopted to account for the influence of the porous media guo and zhao 2002 based on the glb model chen et al developed a modified generalized lattice boltzmann model with klinkenberg s effect chen et al 2015 moreover some improved lb models have also been developed in modeling fluid flow in porous media hu et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2016 hu et al 2015 gao et al 2014 although lbm has many distinguished merits in the computational fluid dynamics however as pointed out by wang shu wang et al 2014 lbm still suffers some drawbacks and the one draws the most attention is that the conventional lbm requires regularly structured meshes which is often a big disadvantage for studying flows in complex geometries like porous media recently some approaches nannelli and succi 1992 he and doolen 1997 peng et al 1999 lee and lin 2001 guo and zhao 2003 are proposed to apply lbm on nonuniform grids among them the finite element lattice boltzmann method fe lbm has received increasing attention for its applications on irregular structured meshes in 2001 lee and lin made the first contribution toward this direction and they proposed a characteristic galerkin finite element method for the discrete boltzmann equation lee and lin 2001 based on the similar strategy shi et al proposed a discontinuous galerkin spectral element dgse lb model for solving weakly compressible flows which ensures numerical stability at high reynolds number shi et al 2003 later several other fe lb models have been proposed based on the dgse method min and lee 2011 düster et al 2006 zadehgol et al 2014 besides li et al developed another fe lb model based on the least squares finite element lsfe method and the crank nicolson method li et al 2005 although lbm has been well used to study fluid flow in porous media at rev scale for the last decade the previous researchers mainly focus on simple geometries like homogeneous geomaterials using regularly structured meshes there is still no effort to simulate fluid flow in complex geometries such as the porous medium with disordered fractured network and permeable matrix in the present paper we present a computational model for porous media flow at rev scale based on the generalized lattice boltzmann model proposed by guo and zhao 2002 and the galerkin finite element method an image based automatic meshing method is adopted to generate advanced unstructured meshes it is capable to simulate fluid flow in more complex and realistic geometries at rev scale the rest of the paper is organized as follows the finite element based generalized lattice boltzmann model fe glbm is introduced in section 2 the model is validated by simulating generalized two dimensional poiseuille flow lid driven cavity flow and flows past a circular cylinder in section 3 then a porous media flow is investigated in section 4 and finally end this paper with a conclusion in section 5 2 mathematical model 2 1 generalized navier stokes n s equations the governing

darcy and nonlinear forchheimer drag force for low speed flow because of the quadratic nature of the nonlinear resistance the nonlinear drag can be ignored and eq 3 reduces to the brinkman extended darcy equation martys et al 1994 ginzburg 2008 however for high speed flows the nonlinear drag force needs to be considered 2 2 lattice boltzmann model the generalized lattice boltzmann model proposed

darcy number da as shown in fig 1 the solid lines represent the finite difference results and the symbols represent the results of the present model the excellent agreement is observed between them which obviously confirms the reliability of the present method to simulate porous media flow at rev scale as mentioned earlier the nonlinear inertial effect must be considered at high reynolds number

the cavity centre and the results are compared with previous lbm solutions guo and zhao 2002 good agrees could be observed it is also seen that with the decrease of darcy number the boundary layer close to the upper lid becomes thinner the standard lbm can only be applied to regular meshes one advantage of the present model is to do a simulation on irregular grids to further verify the accuracy of this model to simulate fluid flow on unstructured meshes the laminar steady flow past a circular cylinder is simulated the flow domain is sketched in fig 4 and the unstructured mesh is shown in fig

specified the units are in lattice units the distributions of the velocity magnitude in the generated fractured samples with different matrix permeability are shown in figs 9 11 in these three figures the average velocity magnitude of the total simulation domain increases gradually from figs 9 11 the fluid flow in the fractures is much stronger than the matrix which is expected due to the low porosity and permeation of the matrix in fig 9 at a low matrix permeability of 0 02 the fractures are the main conductive pathways for the fluid to flow from the top to the bottom and the flow out of the fractures is extremely slow at t 1000 the fluid starts to penetrate into the main fractures under the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet the matrix only contributes to a small amount of the fluid flux as the time goes on the fluid flow in the matrix becomes negligible and the fluid flow towards the outlet in the main fractures that facing along the direction of the pressure drop dominates the flow some fracture branches are connected by the fluid and most of these branches are near the inlet at t 22 000 the fluid goes through half of the fractured sample in fig 10 at a moderate matrix permeability of 0 4 compared to the simulation results with a matrix permeability of 0 02 in fig 9 the contribution of the porous matrix to the flow in the fractured sample increases and the penetration depth increases at each time step additionally more fractures are connected by the permeable matrix and more fractures start to contribute to the flow and some small branches from the main fractures are connected under the influence of permeable matrix according to the velocity magnitude shown in fig 10 the flow in the fractures is still dominated at t 1000 although the velocity magnitude of the fluid flow in the fractures is twice of that in the matrix because of the concentrated energy and the viscosity effect the penetration depth is flat and no fluid extrusion is observed from the fractures from t 1000 to t 22 000 the fluid flow in the fractures exceeds that in the matrix and fluid breaks through the outlet from several large fractures as the results of the increased permeability of the porous matrix in fig 11 at a large matrix permeability k 0 8 the velocity distribution in the fractured sample is similar to that shown in fig 10 however at each time step the velocity at each node is higher than the situations with low permeability and the penetration depth is deeper a large matrix permeability decreases the heterogeneity between the fracture space and the matrix therefore the fluid extrusion from the fractures appears later than the cases with smaller matrix permeability interestingly a large matrix permeability does not lead to a significant connection between the matrix and the fractures the fluid still prefers to penetrate the fractures along the pressure drop direction additionally the fluid flow in fracture network is controlled by the space of the interconnections take the fracture at the bottom left as an example fluid cannot quickly flow into the large fracture space if the fracture is restricted by narrow pathways which further indicates that the permeability of the whole sample would not be remarkably increased by large fractures with poor connectivity with a large matrix permeability at the late time t 22 000 the fluid breaks through to the bottom from both the fractures and the permeable matrix and the velocity decreases faster in the fractures than that in the matrix to give more details of the fluid flow properties in the fractured porous media the velocity distribution in and around fracture a and the velocities at the cross sections y 400 and y 456 that shown in fig 7 are analyzed in fig 12 14 the results in fig 12 indicate that both the velocity in fracture a and in matrix increase with the increased matrix permeability at low matrix permeability the fluid flow in the fracture dominates the flow and fluid penetrates into the matrix from the fracture surface fig 12b however as the matrix permeability increases the flow boundary between the fractures and the matrix becomes unclear and the fluid flow in permeable matrix controlled by the pressure drop from the inlet to outlet exceed that controlled by the fracture fluid penetration as a result the fluid flow along the pressure drop in both matrix and fractures in fig 13 a c the fluid velocity at the transect y 456 with different matrix permeability at different time steps are compared respectively the average velocity of the fluid flow in the fracture a as shown in fig 7 at a different time step is listed in fig 13 d in coincidence with the results shown in figs 9 12 the fluid velocities in the fractures with large apertures are larger than that in the fractures with small apertures and the matrix additionally at each node of the cross section with the increase of the matrix permeability the velocity variation with time changes from a positive correlation to a negative correlation in fig 13 a the fluid velocity in the matrix is almost zero because of the low matrix permeability at early time the velocity in the fractures increases rapidly with the penetration of the fluid however at a late time because of the difficulty for the fluid to flow through the low permeable matrix the velocity only increases with a small amount in fig 13 b this increasing trend starts to change because a portion of the fluid starts to flow through the matrix in fig 13 c the velocity of the fluid in the fractured can even be decreased at a large matrix permeability which means a large permeation of the fluid into the matrix releases the energy accumulation and the pressure build up in the fractures the influence of the permeable matrix on the fluid flow in a single fracture can be clearly observed in fig 13 d at low matrix permeability the velocity in the fractures increases with time as the pressure transmit from the inlet to the outlet and the velocity increases with the pressure at k 0 4 the velocity starts to decrease with the time around t 6000 and the velocity of the fluid in fracture a always decreases with time at a large permeability k 0 8 the fluid velocity distributions and their components at the transect y 456 and y 400 are compared in fig 14 the streamwise velocity uy increases with the matrix permeability see a1 and b1 however the spanwise velocity ux is almost stable when the matrix permeability varies see a2 and b2 these lead to the fluid velocity at each node of both transects increases with the matrix permeability additionally at the same transect the variation of the spanwise velocity with location x l is smaller than that of the streamwise velocity except for some large fractures the stable spanwise velocity with location and the time explains why an increase in matrix permeability cannot lead to more fractures that perpendicular to the pressure drop to be connected additionally comparing the results shown in a1 a3 with those shown in b1 b3 it can be concluded that along with the pressure drop direction the velocity and its components of each node near the inlet are always larger than those far from the inlet fig 15 shows the variation of global permeability with the matrix permeability in lattice unit in which the global permeability represents the total permeability of the entire domain that calculated by applying the darcy s law by comparing the global permeability at different matrix permeability it can be concluded that a larger permeability of the matrix leads to a larger permeability of the total permeability of the fractured sample which finally leads to an early breakthrough at the outlet 5 conclusions in this study an improved finite element based generalized lattice boltzmann model is proposed to study the fluid flow in the fractured sample with permeable matrix at rev scale the proposed model improves the flexibility of applying lbm to complex geometries and optimizes the flow simulation in a complex structure with the coupling of fem the validation with previous studies demonstrates the capability of the proposed model to simulate fluid flow in extremely heterogeneous porous media which indicates that the proposed model can be applied to solve many engineering problems including the fluid flow in cleats of coal or microfractures of shale with the aid of advanced image based automatic meshing method this study concentrates on the investigation of fluid flow dynamics in a pseudo 3d heterogeneous fractured porous medium and the effects of matrix properties on fluid flow at rev scale is analyzed in detail simulation results show that the matrix permeability plays a significant role to influence the fluid permeation in the fractured sample and an ignoring of matrix permeability leads to a wrong estimation of the fluid flow properties the proposed model can be easily applied to solve real three dimensional engineering problems with advanced mesh generation method acknowledgments the author appreciates the funding provided by australian international postgraduate research
