11245,spatial and temporal distribution of reference eto and actual evapotranspiration aet over the central region of saudi arabia during 1950 2013 are estimated using remote sensing and gis techniques firstly the fao penman monteith method was used to model the spatial distribution of eto on a grid by grid basis using data collected from meteorological stations and gis techniques then crop coefficients kc were modeled as a function of 16 day time series modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi next using kc maps and eto as input daily aet was simulated by the soil water balance swb model and aggregated to monthly and annual aet from empirical ndvi kc relationships developed and applicable at pixel level kc derived from the ndvi kc relationships agree well with kc recommended by fao over various crop growth stages in the field the monthly aet maps for 1950 2013 show a gradual increase in aet during the crop growing season in january to may but a subsequent decline as the season progresses from june to december the aet estimated for january to june are arranged in descending order which are may 3 67 44 7 mm day april 5 99 36 8 mm day march 2 96 32 7 mm day february 0 68 20 mm day june 2 42 17 7 mm day and january 1 11 mm day respectively statistical analysis shows that statistically significant change point in daily aet generally occurred in 1990 such that the long term average daily aet of 1950 1990 at 3 6 mm day increased to about 5 3 mm day between 1990 and 2016 with a positive trend of 1 5 mm decade the annual aet estimated for irrigated cropland in northern and central regions of riyadh al qassim province and hail province range from 1200 to 2900 mm year in these regions low aet values are found in shrubland grassland and other natural vegetation the annual aet estimated by the swb model are about 9 11 higher than modeled aet in the study area where the long term average daily aet estimated for 1950 2013 range from 2 mm day to 30 mm day representative aet maps derived from applying the ndvi kc relationships to the swb model will be useful to achieve the planning and management of sustainable water use in arid regions of middle east keywords reference evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration soil water balance modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi crop coefficients kc 1 introduction the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa 24 n 45 e is the largest arab country located in western asia the kingdom has an area of 2 15 million square kilometers but its mean annual rainfall is only about 112 mm year mahmoud 2014 and mahmoud et al 2014 the agricultural sector of ksa equipped with modern irrigation technology has more than 1 1 million hectares of irrigated land department of statistics and information 2008 because of its arid climate almost all agricultural lands are dependent on groundwater as the main source of water supply which however is costly to withdraw mahmoud 2014 major crops grown in saudi arabia include cereals wheat sorghum barley and millet vegetables tomato watermelon eggplant potato cucumber and onions fruits dates citrus and grapes and the forage crop of alfalfa agricultural water demand in ksa is very high ranging between 83 90 of the total water demands during 1990 2009 chowdhury and al zahrani 2015 therefore evapotranspiration et loss from irrigated lands is a key factor to consider for water supply to the agriculture sector for example as part of an early warning system as large amount of irrigated water are lost through et partly dependent on irrigation methods employed mahmoud and alazba 2016 accurate regional estimation of et will be helpful for effective management of irrigation water actual evapotranspiration aet reflects the crop s water need which consists of transpiration and evaporation alberto et al 2014 senay et al 2017 olivera guerra et al 2018 aet can be estimated by i in situ measurements using lysimeters or flux towers ii crop coefficients approach allen et al 1998 and iii remotely sensed data kalma et al 2008 and models which are either based on empirical statistical or energy balance approaches using a spline model and a

et al 1998 from the strength and weaknesses of some potential evapotranspiration pet models developed for land covers commonly found in southwestern united states douglas et al 2009 selected a pet model for florida recent studies that applied remotely sensed rs data to estimate spatio temporally estimated aet and crop water consumption are such as duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 er raki et al 2010 sánchez et al 2010 cruz blanco et al 2014 senay et al 2017 and parka et al 2017 similar seasonal patterns of vegetation indices and evapotranspiration have been found over annual crops bausch 1995 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 agrometeorological monitoring of crop production is often done on a large spatial scale and small temporal resolutions using rs vegetation indices of visible and near infrared wavelengths such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to assess the leaf area index lai biomass or the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation soil adjusted vegetation index ndvi can be used to estimate real time kc given the high correlation between ndvi and kc ray and dadhwal 2001 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 kullberg et al 2017 campos et al 2017 because of this close relationship between ndvi and kc ndvi has been widely used for vegetation monitoring crop yield assessment and drought detection justice and townshend 2002 high ndvi values generally indicate more photosynthetic activity on the other hand higher kc due to higher temperature results in less soil water and therefore a decline in ndvi while denser vegetation indices mean more et losses which lower the land surface temperature boegh et al 1999 integrating remote sensing data into soil water balance models are one of the most commonly used methods for estimating crop water requirements bodner et al 2007 for instance campos et al 2016a estimated the total soil moisture in soil layers of southwestern spain based on aet and time series of multispectral imageries of vegetation cover they developed a simple linear relationship between the ndvi and kc such a relationship has been shown to be effective in mapping aet of crops campos et al 2016a b toureiro et al 2017 senay et al 2017 developed historical et maps for major irrigation districts in california usa using landsat images parka et al 2017 estimated aet in northeast asia using kc eto and surface soil moisture data from satellite images they found that kc estimated from ndvi data correspond well with observed kc consoli and vanella 2014 mapped crop et in southern italy using a soil water balance model driven with vegetation indices and climate data the authors reported that this method has the potential to estimate crop water requirements and water management over large agricultural areas many earlier studies tend to estimate field scale crop coefficient and crop water requirements only for a specific crop such as maize soybean cotton and wheat duchemin et al 2006 irmak et al 2013 campos et al 2017 drerup et al 2017 rozenstein et al 2018 the development of models to estimate aet based on remotely sensed data applicable over large areas in arid regions of middle east can be challenging because irrigation water requirements are essential but available water resources are limited the objectives of the present study are 1 to estimate reference evapotranspiration using data collected from meteorological stations and geographic information system techniques on a grid by grid basis 2 modeling kc as a function of 16 day time series of modis ndvi 3 to estimate aet based on soil water balance kc and eto and 4 to detect change points and trends in long term average daily aet 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is in three provinces of central saudi arabia 1 al riyadh 2 al qassim and 3 hail province fig 1 the al riyadh province has an area of 380 497 8 km² and a population of 6 777 146 2010 making it the second largest province of saudi arabia in terms of both area and population it is located at the center of the arabian peninsula 24 38 n and 46 43 e on a large plateau with an arid climate and an annual rainfall ranging from 41 to 230 mm year the al qassim province is one of the largest agricultural areas of central saudi arabia at 647 m above sea level 26 31 e and 43 77 n the hail province in north central saudi arabia borders provinces of madinah tabouk northern border riyadh and qassim hail is largely agricultural with a significant production of grains date and fruits a large percentage of the kingdom s wheat production comes from ha il provinces hail has a continental desert climate with hot summers and cool winters with an arid to extremely arid climate pattern hail s annual precipitation of about 110 mm comes from two peaks rainfall in march and november 2 2 reference evapotranspiration eto daily climate data between 1950 and 2013 was collected from weather stations located across the study area in this study eto is the evapotranspiration from a hypothetical surface that consists of grass as the reference crop at 0 12 m height actively growing adequately watered and with a surface roughness of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 the eto of this reference surface is estimated according to the following penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 on a grid by grid basis 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto reference evapotranspiration mm day rn net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g soil heat flux density mj m2 day

eto was estimated from the penman montieth approach implemented within the main program of gis to produce twelve maps of mean daily reference evapotranspiration for each month mm day 2 3 actual evapotranspiration estimated by a soil water balance model 2 3 1 model structure the model uses soil water balance equations proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 inputs to the water balance model consist of observed climatic data and gridded soil property characteristics two soil parameters obtained from the igbp dis global gridded surfaces of selected soil characteristics database global soil data task group 2000 this soil database was derived from the soil physical attributes of the 1995 digital 1 5 million scale fao soil map of the world and the global pedon database more details about this dataset are given in tempel et al 1996 global soil data task group 2000 and batjes 2002a b the study area s soil parameters were extracted using a 5 5 arc minutes gridded format with arcgis 10 1 the gridded water holding capacity at 0 25 grid resolution was calculated using hydrologic soil properties linked to soil texture and the wilting point wp field capacity fc and saturatedwater content sat for each grid saxton and rowls 2006 the monthly soil water balance in mm of water is 2 δ sw c m e p m ae t m r m mm month where δswcm is the change in soil water content epm the effective precipitation aetm the actual evapotranspiration and rm is the runoff for month m which includes both surface runoff and subsurface drainage swc is less than or at most equal to swcmax which is the total maximum swc available in the soil for evapotranspiration if the monthly water input exceeds swcmax the excess becomes the runoff rm realistic initial swc values are obtained via a trial and error search approach 2 3 2 effective precipitation effective precipitation ep the portion of total precipitation used for crop production is estimated according to the method of the usda soil conservation service dastane 1974 the method assumes that crops can use almost 60 80 percent of the precipitation up to 250 mm month beyond 250 mm month crops would only be able to use about 10 percent of that amount rainfall interception is that intercepted by plant canopy and litter and becomes evaporation loss interception loss plays an important role in the water budget because it reduces the amount of precipitation available for swc ep is the gross precipitation gp minus the precipitation intercepted by canopy cover and litter and interception loss is a function of the storage space of canopy structure the amount of rainfall intercepted is proportional to the interception coefficients kint for each month the effective precipitation is 3 e p m gross p gross p k

vegetation coefficients dependent on vegetation characteristics ksoil the soil stress coefficients dependent on the volumetric soil water content 0 1 ksoil represents a reduction factor resulted from the limit imposed by the monthly soil water content swcm at monthly time step the model uses a simple algorithm to estimate ksoil as a ratio of swcm to the maximum swc zomer et al 2006 5 k soil sw c m

rooting depth rd 6 sw c max rd sw c fc sw c wp mm to estimate kc a land cover map that represents the extent of irrigated crops in the study area is developed for 2013 fig 2 a phenological information for this map is based on ndvi estimated from remotely sensed spectral pixel values in the red and near infrared spectra kc is estimated from ndvi data averaged between 2000 and 2013 available from the 16 day ndvi mod13a2 to validate ndvi derived from modis images 258 sampling sites representing different climatology and vegetation covers were selected a database of default kc to be used in the arcgis et calculation tool was also developed the database contains 10 crop types palm trees grape lemon wheat alfalfa orange olive potato sorghum vulgare and millet and land covers such as evergreen forest and scrublands for actual crops kc values are obtained from fao s water development and management unit database which also contains growing season dates kc is estimated from ndvi time series data 7 k c k ndvi n 8 r 2 i 1 n k c k c n d v i n d v i i 1 n k c k c 2 n d v i n d v i 2 1 2 2 kc varies significantly across the growth phase of crops even though inter annual variations are relatively small the k and n coefficients in eq 7 were determined from 10 different agriculture land use datasets throughout the season so that the above equation is applicable to a wide range of agriculture land use over the whole growing season the coefficients of determination r2 is a statistic used to assess the goodness of fit ranging from 0 to 1 perfect fit for 12 linear models shown in table 1 along with the mean square errors mse and the root mean square of the errors rmse these models were developed for each crop considered in this study and for the average monthly kc and ndvi for the study area these regression coefficients were calculated at 0 05 significance level since a high r2 itself may be insufficient to establish a strong relationship between kc and ndvi the f test of equality of variances was also applied to test the statistical significance of the relationship between kc and ndvi assuming both are of normal populations 2 4 long term average annual actual evapotranspiration at stations three popular relationships between a e t p e t and p p e t attributed to schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 and pike 1964 respectively were used to estimate long term average annual aet for the study area as 9 a e t p e t p p e t 1 e x p p e t p 10 a e t p e t tanh p p e t 11 a e t p e t p p e t 1 p p e t 2 where aet and p are the actual evapotranspiration and long term average annual precipitation and pet is the long term average annual potential evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation respectively to select the most representative method from these three methods for the study area long term average values estimated from the three methods are compared with values obtained from the water balance method the buishand s nonparametric detection method was applied to detect change points in the daily aet of the study area this is a test for a null hypothesis no change point and an alternative hypothesis where change point is detected next the nonparametric mann kendall test was applied to estimate the long term trend in daily aet between 1950 and 2016 3 discussions of results 3 1 spatial distribution of reference evapotranspiration the mean annual precipitation in the study area over the 63 year period was less than 140 mm year fig 2b which is very low compared with the global mean annual rainfall of about 1000 mm under such an arid climate the lack of available water will be very severe during drought periods therefore the variability of annual precipitation plays a very important role in the water resources management development and conservation plans of the study area the southeastern and southwestern parts of the al riyadh province and the northwestern parts of hail province have the lowest mean annual rainfall of 41 110 mm year the al qassim province northern regions of the al riyadh and hail provinces except its northwestern parts received the highest mean annual precipitation of 120 230 mm year the spatial distributions of gridded eto computed at 15 m resolution helps us to better understanding the spatial and temporal variability of the crop water demand for each month the long term average daily eto for the study area is shown in supplementary fig 1 the eto of january is the lowest ranging from 2 5 mm day to 4 4 mm day in the study area while the highest eto are in july ranging from 8 2 to 11 4 mm day between all twelve months summer april september evapotranspiration will be the highest as expected therefore in the summer april september eto is the maximum in al qassim province hail province and in the northern portion of al riyadh province from january to march and november to december the maximum eto will shift towards southeastern parts of al qassim province hail province and al riyadh province probably due to the seasonal variation in the relative humidity and wind speed in the study area from spatial distributions of annual eto shown in fig 3 it is obvious that there are a large spatial and seasonal variations in eto in different regions of the study area the mean annual eto ranges from 2127 to 2460 mm yr with the lowest annual eto located in central and southwestern parts of al riyadh province and the northwestern parts of hail province the maximum eto are found mainly over the al qassim province the results appear to provide comparable or better estimates of eto than currently available pet methodologies using ground based observations topography and climatic factors contribute to variations in annual eto values which are also related to latitudes which seem to play a bigger role than the temporal fluctuations of et the results and eto maps can be used for agroclimatic design the results also show that geostatistics idw is useful to represent the spatial variability of eto over large geographical areas 3 2 monthly ndvi and crop coefficients patterns for irrigated crops monthly kc values for crops were developed according to planting dates of actual crop database which and kc for other types of landcover were used to derive the relationships with 16 day modis ndvi mod13a2 data in the study area twelve simple linear regression models were developed to establish a general relationship between ndvi and the daily kc values measured from 258 sampling sites of varying climatology crops and cropping practices the monthly linear regression models developed out of monthly ndvi kc estimated and modeled have an r2 of 0 72 0 74 0 9 0 78 0 93 0 85 0 82 0 95 0 72 0 87 0 9 and 0 76 respectively table 1 these results are comparable to kc ndvi relationships developed in previous studies mutiibwa and irmak 2013 er raki et al 2013 parka et al 2017 for instance mutiibwa and irmak 2013 derived kc from ndvi data in the u s high plains based on a regression model with r2 of 0 72 and rmse of 0 12 which according to the authors represent a good model performance in another study er raki et al 2013 regarded r2 of 0 63 to be acceptable in deriving kc for grapes of northwestern mexico in our study the results also show a strong correlation between monthly kc and ndvi with low mse and rmse table 1 kc obtained from ndvi data of modis images are also comparable to kc provided in fao 56 allen et al 1998 as expected simple regression models of ndvi and kc developed for the 10 selected crops individually show higher goodness of fit statistics higher r2 to field data collected in 258 sampling sites than similar monthly regression models developed for all irrigated crops of each month table 1 the number of days of an average year doy with a maximum ndvi of 0 8 for palm trees doy 241 ndvimax of 0 64 for grape doy 193 ndvimax of 0 79 for wheat doy 129 ndvimax of 0 65 for lemon doy 289 ndvimax of 0 65for potato doy 113 ndvimax of 0 64 for orange doy 241 ndvimax of 0 77 for olive doy 49 ndvimax of 0 9 for sorghum vulgare doy 161 and ndvimax of 0 82 for millet doy 161 respectively it is clear that the ndvi of irrigated alfalfa during the growing season is greater than that of other crops alfalfa seeds are usually planted on 8 march and it is harvested every 30 40 days throughout the year kc derived from the ndvi of each pixel using the ndvi kc regression model developed generally shows strong agreement with actual kc measured in the field over the growing stage of crops twelve monthly kc maps developed from ndvi data of modis images show spatial variability of kc in the study area and also temporal variations over the growing season fig 4 fig 4 shows that the maximum kc of crops for all irrigated lands range from 0 5 to 1 2 for different months such that high kc values are generally observed in january february march may august and november respectively spatial variations in kc are partly attributed to different crop types and partly to different growth stages of crops because of different planting dates 3 3 spatial distribution of monthly and annual actual evapotranspiration aet monthly aet was estimated using the aforementioned soil water balance model driven with soil stress coefficients monthly kc and monthly eto estimated from eq 4 the aet output represents the average monthly evapotranspiration mm of irrigated cropland for the 1950 2013 period it is observed that kc fluctuates between inter monthly low and high values throughout the year with high water consumption by crops due to high irrigation water supply in february march april and may kc in these months also increase dramatically monthly aet maps derived for the study area from the soil water balance model are shown in fig 5 it should be noted that monthly kc map derived from the twelve regression equations were based on ndvi extrapolated from ndvi data of 312 modis images of 16 day time step the monthly aet maps for 1950 2013 show a gradual increase in aet during the crop growing season from january to may but a subsequent decline from june to december as the season progresses from summer to winter and as plant transpiration decreases drastically in june the month when most crops are harvested the aet estimated for january to june arranged in descending order are may 3 67 44 7 mm day april 5 99 36 8 mm day march 2 96 32 7 mm day february 0 68 20 mm day june 2 42 17 7 mm day and january 1 11 mm day respectively high aet losses in these months are of major concern because crops are irrigated from groundwater sources where the rate of withdrawal far exceeds the rate of replenishment the aet losses estimated are similar to aet of other regions of ksa mahmoud and alazba 2016 madugundu et al 2018 for instance madugundu et al 2018 found that crop water requirements for carrot in the riyadh region of saudi arabia in the summer were about 3243 mm about 36 mm day and 620 mm in winter crop water requirements for silage maize was 1622 mm in the summer and 1359 mm in spring using a surface energy balance algorithm mahmoud and alazba 2016 estimated the average daily aet in the southern and western regions of ksa varies widely from 4 97 to 49 mm day in april and from 3 43 to 48 9 mm day in may in the study area high aet losses found in some small spots in aet maps are mainly due to evaporation from water bodies such as lakes impounded behind rain harvesting dams and water storage facilities such high aet values in an arid region such as saudi arabia are examples of mismanagement of irrigation water which could cause soil salinity to increase to address rising soil salinity problems farmers resort to apply excessive amount of irrigation water higher than the crop water requirement for leaching of soil salinity which is a common issue in irrigated land in saudi arabia due to high evaporation loss of irrigated water fig 5 shows the spatial variations of aet over the study area where maximum aet values are found in al qassim province hail province and in the northern portion of al riyadh province the results also show that irrigated cropland has access to moisture because of irrigation and groundwater so monthly aet of irrigated cropland depend on moisture availability and the atmospheric water demand from june to december there were a gradual decrease in aet values where aet estimate ranged from 2 42 to 17 7 mm day in june 0 85 9 1 mm day in july 0 64 6 57 mm day in august the lowest observed values for aet were in september and october where its value ranged from 0 to 3 7 mm day the average annual aet estimated by the soil water balance model given in fig 6 a shows moderate aet in non irrigated areas in the southern parts of riyadh 351 993 mm year in contrast to very high annual aet ranging from 1200 to 2900 mm year in irrigated cropland in the northern and central region of riyadh al qassim province and hail province the average annual aet losses estimated using the pike and ol dekop methods are unrealistically low even in irrigated crop field and the results are not presented on the other hand aet estimated by the schreiber model ranging from 492 to 2710 mm year agrees well with that estimated by the soil water balance model ranging from 351 to 2900 mm year and so it is shown in fig 6b the annual aet estimated by the soil water balance model are about 9 11 greater than that estimate by the schreiber model 3 4 long term average daily actual evapotranspiration long term average daily aet estimated by the soil water balance model for 1950 2016 fig 7 a generally agree with those obtained from field measurements as shown in fig 7b the long term average daily aet ranges from 2 mm day to 30 mm day in some areas in general uniform daily irrigation is applied to crops from 0 to 2 mm day for alfalfa during the initial crop growth stage and from 1 0 to 5 0 mm day for other crops with the highest values for grapes under the driest conditions from buishand s change detection test applied to average daily aet between 1950 and 2016 statistically significant change points in daily aet were detected in 1990 because the average daily aet of 3 6 mm day over 1950 1990 ha d increased to 5 3 mm day over 1990 2016 furthermore the mann kendall trend test also detected a statistically significant positive trend of 1 5 mm decade in the average daily aet over 1990 2016 likely caused by climate warming in the last three decades the recent rising trend in aet detected is expected to cause stress to crops and to enhance drought conditions mahmoud and gan 2018 to validate the soil water balance model developed in this study both models estimated and field observed daily aet via a water balance analysis for alfalfa crop are compared overall fig 7b shows good agreements between model estimated and observed daily aet for alfalfa even though the model estimated daily aet are about 4 5 higher than the observed aet for january to april the period with the best agreement between both datasets between the end of april and the middle of june estimated aet is about 2 lower than the observed aet and even lower from july to august because of lower atmospheric demand of evaporation loss the successful application of the soil water balance model developed in this study in deriving representative aet maps will be useful to achieve the planning and management of sustainable water use in arid regions of middle east such as the kingdom of saudi arabia 4 conclusion this study was designed to estimate average reference and aet over al riyadh al qassim and hail province in the central region of saudi arabia during 1950 2013 using soil water balance model on daily monthly and annual basis firstly the fao penman monteith method was used to model the spatial distribution of eto on a grid by grid basis using data collected from meteorological stations and gis techniques then crop coefficients kc were modeled as a function of 16 day time series modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi next using kc maps and eto as input daily aet was simulated by the soil water balance swb model and aggregated to monthly and annual aet eto is found to be the highest and of the most concern in al qassim province hail province and in the northern portion of al riyadh province from january to march and from november december there is a shift of maximum eto towards southeastern parts of al qassim province hail province and al riyadh province except in its northern portion the annual eto shows very high values in the entire study area as it ranged from 2127 to 2460 mm year from empirical ndvi kc relationships developed and applicable at pixel level kc derived from the ndvi kc relationships agree well with kc recommended by fao over various crop growth stages in the field the monthly aet maps for 1950 2013 show a gradual increase in aet during the crop growing season in january to may but a subsequent decline as the season progresses from june to december the aet estimated for january to june are arranged in descending order which are may 3 67 44 7 mm day april 5 99 36 8 mm day march 2 96 32 7 mm day february 0 68 20 mm day june 2 42 17 7 mm day and january 1 11 mm day respectively statistical analysis shows that statistically significant change point in daily aet generally occurred in 1990 such that the long term average daily aet of 1950 1990 at 3 6 mm day increased to about 5 3 mm day between 1990 and 2016 with a positive trend of 1 5 mm decade the annual aet estimated for irrigated cropland in northern and central regions of riyadh al qassim province and hail province range from 1200 to 2900 mm year in these regions low aet values are found in shrubland grassland and other natural vegetation the annual aet estimated by the swb model are about 9 11 higher than modeled aet in the study area where the long term average daily aet estimated for 1950 2013 range from 2 mm day to 30 mm day the lowest long term average daily aet is observed from the start of august to the end of september the measured daily aet for alfalfa crop used to test and validate the swb model good agreement between swb based daily aet and the measured daily aet for alfalfa overall there was very good agreements between model estimated and observed daily aet for alfalfa even though the model estimated daily aet are about 4 5 higher than the observed aet for january to april the period with the best agreement between both datasets between the end of april and the middle of june estimated aet is about 2 lower than the observed aet and even lower from july to august because of lower atmospheric demand of evaporation loss representative aet maps derived from applying the ndvi kc relationships to the swb model will be

recommended by fao over various crop growth stages in the field the monthly aet maps for 1950 2013 show a gradual increase in aet during the crop growing season in january to may but a subsequent decline as the season progresses from june to december the aet estimated for january to june are arranged in descending order which are may 3 67 44 7 mm day april 5 99 36 8 mm day march 2 96 32 7 mm day february 0 68 20 mm day june 2 42 17 7 mm day and january 1 11 mm day respectively statistical analysis shows that statistically significant change point in daily aet generally occurred in 1990 such that the long term average daily aet of 1950 1990 at 3 6 mm day increased to about 5 3 mm day between 1990 and 2016 with a positive trend of 1 5 mm decade the annual aet estimated for irrigated cropland in northern and central regions of riyadh al qassim province and hail province range from 1200 to 2900 mm year in these regions low aet values are found in shrubland grassland and other natural vegetation the annual aet estimated by the swb model are about 9 11 higher than modeled aet in the study area where the long term average daily aet estimated for 1950 2013 range from 2 mm day to 30 mm day representative aet maps derived from applying the ndvi kc relationships to the swb model will be useful to achieve the planning and management of sustainable water use in arid regions of

saudi arabia ksa 24 n 45 e is the largest arab country located in western asia the kingdom has an area of 2 15 million square kilometers but its mean annual rainfall is only about 112 mm year mahmoud 2014 and mahmoud et al 2014 the agricultural sector of ksa equipped with modern irrigation technology has more than 1 1 million hectares of irrigated land department of statistics and information 2008 because of its arid climate almost all agricultural lands are dependent on groundwater as the main source of water supply which however is costly to withdraw mahmoud 2014 major crops grown in saudi arabia include cereals wheat sorghum barley and millet vegetables tomato watermelon eggplant potato cucumber and onions fruits dates citrus and grapes and the forage crop of alfalfa agricultural water demand in ksa is very high ranging between 83 90 of the total water demands during 1990 2009 chowdhury and al zahrani 2015 therefore evapotranspiration et loss from irrigated lands is a key factor to consider for water supply to the agriculture sector for example as part of an early warning system as large amount of irrigated water are lost through et partly dependent on irrigation methods employed mahmoud and alazba 2016 accurate regional estimation of et will be helpful for effective management of irrigation water actual evapotranspiration aet reflects the crop s water need which consists of transpiration and evaporation alberto et al 2014 senay et al 2017 olivera guerra et al 2018 aet can be estimated by i in situ measurements using lysimeters or flux towers ii crop

model for florida recent studies that applied remotely sensed rs data to estimate spatio temporally estimated aet and crop water consumption are such as duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 er raki et al 2010 sánchez et al 2010 cruz blanco et al 2014 senay et al 2017 and parka et al 2017 similar seasonal patterns of vegetation indices and evapotranspiration have been

radiation soil adjusted vegetation index ndvi can be used to estimate real time kc given the high correlation between ndvi and kc ray and dadhwal 2001 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo et al 2013 mateos et al 2013 kullberg et al 2017 campos et al 2017 because of this close relationship between ndvi and kc ndvi has been widely used for vegetation monitoring crop yield assessment and drought detection justice and townshend 2002 high ndvi values generally indicate more photosynthetic activity on the other hand higher kc due to higher temperature results in less soil water and therefore a decline in ndvi while denser vegetation indices mean more et losses which lower the land surface temperature boegh et al 1999 integrating remote sensing data into soil water balance models are one of the most commonly used methods for estimating crop water requirements bodner et al 2007 for instance campos et al 2016a estimated the total soil moisture in soil layers of southwestern spain based on aet and time series of multispectral imageries of vegetation cover they developed a simple linear relationship between the ndvi and kc such a relationship has been shown to be effective in mapping aet of crops campos et al 2016a b toureiro et al 2017 senay et al 2017 developed historical et maps for major irrigation districts in california usa using landsat images parka et al 2017 estimated aet in northeast asia using kc eto and surface soil moisture data from satellite images they found that kc estimated from ndvi data correspond well with observed kc consoli and vanella 2014 mapped crop et in southern italy using a soil water balance model driven with vegetation indices and climate data the authors reported that this method has the potential to estimate crop water requirements and water management over large agricultural areas many earlier studies tend to estimate field scale crop coefficient and crop water requirements only for a specific crop such as maize soybean cotton and wheat duchemin et al 2006 irmak et al 2013 campos et al 2017 drerup et al 2017 rozenstein et al 2018 the development of models to estimate aet based on remotely sensed data applicable over large areas in arid regions of middle east can be challenging because irrigation water requirements are essential but available water resources are limited the objectives of the present study are 1 to estimate reference evapotranspiration using data collected from meteorological stations and geographic information system techniques on a grid by grid basis 2 modeling kc as a function of 16 day time series of modis ndvi 3 to estimate aet based on soil water balance kc and eto and 4 to detect change points and trends in long term average daily aet 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is in three provinces of central saudi arabia 1 al riyadh 2 al qassim and 3 hail province fig 1 the al riyadh province has an area of 380 497 8 km² and a population of 6 777 146 2010 making it the second largest province of saudi arabia in terms of both area and population it is located at the center of the arabian peninsula 24 38 n and 46 43 e on a large plateau with an arid climate and an annual rainfall ranging from 41 to 230 mm year the al qassim province is one of the largest agricultural areas of central saudi arabia at 647 m above sea level 26 31 e and 43 77 n the hail province in north central saudi arabia borders provinces of madinah tabouk northern border riyadh and qassim hail is largely agricultural with a significant production of grains date and fruits a large percentage of the kingdom s wheat production comes from ha il provinces hail has a continental desert climate with hot summers and cool winters with an arid to extremely arid climate pattern hail s annual precipitation of about 110 mm comes from two peaks rainfall in march and november 2 2 reference evapotranspiration eto daily climate data between 1950 and 2013 was collected from weather stations located across the study area in this study eto is the evapotranspiration from a hypothetical surface that consists of grass as the reference crop at 0 12 m height actively growing adequately watered and with a surface roughness of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 the eto of this reference surface is estimated according to the following penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 on a grid by

eto was estimated from the penman montieth approach implemented within the main program of gis to produce twelve maps of mean daily reference evapotranspiration for each month mm day 2 3 actual evapotranspiration estimated by a soil water balance model 2 3 1 model structure the model uses soil water balance equations proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 inputs to the water balance model consist of observed climatic data and gridded soil property characteristics two soil parameters obtained from the igbp dis global gridded surfaces of selected soil characteristics database global soil data task group 2000 this soil database was derived from the soil physical attributes of the 1995 digital 1 5 million scale fao soil map of the world and the global pedon database more details about this dataset are given in tempel et al 1996 global soil data task group 2000 and batjes 2002a b the study area s soil parameters were extracted using a 5 5 arc minutes gridded format with arcgis 10 1 the gridded water holding capacity at 0 25 grid resolution was calculated using hydrologic soil properties linked to soil texture and the wilting point wp field capacity fc and saturatedwater content sat for each grid saxton and rowls 2006 the monthly soil water balance in mm of water is 2 δ sw c m e p m ae t m r m mm month where δswcm is the change in soil water content epm the effective precipitation aetm the actual evapotranspiration and rm is the runoff for month m which includes both surface runoff and subsurface drainage swc is less than or at most equal to swcmax which is the total maximum swc available in the soil for evapotranspiration if the monthly water input exceeds swcmax the excess becomes the runoff rm realistic initial swc values are obtained via a trial and error search approach 2 3 2 effective precipitation effective precipitation ep the portion of total precipitation used for crop production is estimated according to the method of the usda soil conservation service dastane 1974 the method assumes that crops can use almost 60 80 percent of the precipitation up to 250 mm month beyond 250 mm month crops would only be able to use about 10 percent of that amount rainfall interception is that intercepted by plant canopy and litter and becomes evaporation loss interception loss plays an important role in the water budget because it reduces the amount of precipitation available for swc ep is the gross precipitation gp minus the precipitation intercepted by canopy cover and litter and interception loss is a function of the storage space of canopy structure the amount of rainfall intercepted is proportional to the interception coefficients kint for each month the effective precipitation is 3 e p m gross p gross p k

vegetation coefficients dependent on vegetation characteristics ksoil the soil stress coefficients dependent on the volumetric soil water content 0 1 ksoil represents a reduction factor resulted from

for this map is based on ndvi estimated from remotely sensed spectral pixel values in the red and near infrared spectra kc is estimated from ndvi data averaged between 2000 and 2013 available from the 16 day ndvi mod13a2 to validate ndvi derived from modis images 258 sampling sites representing different climatology and vegetation covers were selected a database of default kc to be used in the arcgis et calculation tool was also developed the database contains 10 crop types palm trees grape lemon wheat alfalfa orange olive potato sorghum vulgare and millet and land covers such as evergreen forest and scrublands for actual crops kc values are obtained from fao s water development and management unit database which also contains growing season dates kc is estimated from ndvi time series data 7 k c k ndvi n 8 r 2 i 1 n k c k c n d v i n d v i i 1 n k c k c 2 n d v i n d v i 2 1 2 2 kc varies significantly across the growth phase of crops even though inter annual variations are relatively small the k and n coefficients in eq 7 were determined from 10 different agriculture land use datasets throughout the season so that the above equation is applicable to a wide range of agriculture land use over the whole growing season the coefficients of determination r2 is a statistic used to assess the goodness of fit ranging from 0 to 1 perfect fit for 12 linear models shown in table 1 along with the mean square errors mse and the root mean square of the errors rmse these models were developed for each crop considered in this study and for the average monthly kc and ndvi for the study area these regression coefficients were calculated at 0 05 significance level since a high r2 itself may be insufficient to establish a strong relationship between kc and ndvi the f test of equality of variances was also applied to test the statistical significance of the relationship between kc and ndvi assuming both are of normal populations 2 4 long term average annual actual evapotranspiration at stations three popular relationships between a e t p e t and p p e t attributed to schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 and pike 1964 respectively were used to estimate long term average annual aet for the study area as 9 a e t p e t p p e t 1 e x p p e t p 10 a e t p e t tanh p p e t 11 a e t p e t p p e t 1 p p e t 2 where aet and p are the actual evapotranspiration and long term average annual precipitation and pet is the long term average annual potential evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation respectively to select the most representative method from these three methods for the study area long term average values estimated from the three methods are compared with values obtained from the water balance method the buishand s nonparametric detection method was applied to detect change points in the daily aet of the study area this is a test for a null hypothesis no change point and an alternative hypothesis where change point is detected next the nonparametric mann kendall test was applied to estimate the long term trend in daily aet between 1950 and 2016 3 discussions of results 3 1 spatial distribution of reference evapotranspiration the mean annual precipitation in the study area over the 63 year period was less than 140 mm year fig 2b which is very low compared with the global mean annual rainfall of about 1000 mm under such an arid climate the lack of available water will be very severe during drought periods therefore the variability of annual precipitation plays a very important role in the water resources management development and conservation plans of the study area the southeastern and southwestern parts of the al riyadh province and the northwestern parts of hail province have the lowest mean annual rainfall of 41 110 mm year the al qassim province northern regions of the al riyadh and hail provinces except its northwestern parts received the highest mean annual precipitation of 120 230 mm year the spatial distributions of gridded eto computed at 15 m resolution helps us to better understanding the spatial and temporal variability of the crop water demand for each month the long term average daily eto for the study area is shown in supplementary fig 1 the eto of january is the lowest ranging from 2 5 mm day to 4 4 mm day in the study area while the highest eto are in july ranging from 8 2 to 11 4 mm day between all twelve months summer april september evapotranspiration will be the highest as expected therefore in the summer april september eto is the maximum in al qassim province hail province and in the northern portion of al riyadh province from january to march and november to december the maximum eto will shift towards southeastern parts of al qassim province hail province and al riyadh province probably due to the seasonal variation in the relative humidity and wind speed in the study area from spatial distributions of annual eto shown in fig 3 it is obvious that there are a large spatial and seasonal variations in eto in different regions of the study area the mean annual eto ranges from 2127 to 2460 mm yr with the lowest annual eto located in central and southwestern parts of al riyadh province and the northwestern parts of hail province the maximum eto are found mainly over the al qassim province the results appear to provide comparable or better estimates of eto than currently available pet methodologies using ground based observations topography and climatic factors contribute to variations in annual eto values which are also related to latitudes which seem to play a bigger role than the temporal fluctuations of et the results and eto maps can be used for agroclimatic design the results also show that geostatistics idw is useful to represent the spatial variability of eto over large geographical areas 3 2 monthly ndvi and crop coefficients patterns for irrigated crops monthly kc values for crops were developed according to planting dates of actual crop database which and kc for other types of landcover were used to derive the relationships with 16 day modis ndvi mod13a2 data in the study area twelve simple linear regression models were developed to establish a general relationship between ndvi and the daily kc values measured from 258 sampling sites of varying climatology crops and cropping practices the monthly linear regression models developed out of monthly ndvi kc estimated and modeled have an r2 of 0 72 0 74 0 9 0 78 0 93 0 85 0 82 0 95 0 72 0 87 0 9 and 0 76 respectively table 1 these results are comparable to kc ndvi relationships developed in previous studies mutiibwa and irmak 2013 er raki et al 2013 parka et al 2017 for instance mutiibwa and irmak 2013 derived kc from ndvi data in the u s high plains based on a regression model with r2 of 0 72 and rmse of 0 12 which according to the authors represent a good model performance in another study er raki et al 2013 regarded r2 of 0 63 to be acceptable in deriving kc for grapes of northwestern mexico in our study the results also show a strong correlation between monthly kc and ndvi with low mse and rmse table 1 kc obtained from ndvi data of modis images are also comparable to kc provided in fao 56 allen et al 1998 as expected simple regression models of ndvi and kc developed for the 10 selected crops individually show higher goodness of fit statistics higher r2 to field data collected in 258 sampling sites than similar monthly regression models developed for all irrigated crops of each month table 1 the number of days of an average year doy with a maximum ndvi of 0 8 for palm trees doy 241 ndvimax of 0 64 for grape doy 193 ndvimax of 0 79 for wheat doy 129 ndvimax of 0 65 for lemon doy 289 ndvimax of 0 65for potato doy 113 ndvimax of 0 64 for orange doy 241 ndvimax of 0 77 for olive doy 49 ndvimax of 0 9 for sorghum vulgare doy 161 and ndvimax of 0 82 for millet doy 161 respectively it is clear that the ndvi of irrigated alfalfa during the growing season is greater than that of other crops alfalfa seeds are usually planted on 8 march and it is harvested every 30 40 days throughout the year kc derived from the ndvi of each pixel using the ndvi kc regression model developed generally shows strong agreement with actual kc measured in the field over the growing stage of crops twelve monthly kc maps developed from ndvi data of modis images show spatial variability of kc in the study area and also temporal variations over the growing season fig 4 fig 4 shows that the maximum kc of crops for all irrigated lands range from 0 5 to 1 2 for different months such that high kc values are generally observed in january february march may august and november respectively spatial variations in kc are partly attributed to different crop types and partly to different growth stages of crops because of different planting dates 3 3 spatial distribution of monthly and annual actual evapotranspiration aet monthly aet was estimated using the aforementioned soil water balance model driven with soil stress coefficients monthly kc and monthly eto estimated from eq 4 the aet output represents the average monthly evapotranspiration mm of irrigated cropland for the 1950 2013 period it is observed that kc fluctuates between inter monthly low and high values throughout the year with high water consumption by crops due to high irrigation water supply in february march april and may kc in these months also increase dramatically monthly aet maps derived for the study area from the soil water balance model are shown in fig 5 it should be noted that monthly kc map derived from the twelve regression equations were based on ndvi extrapolated from ndvi data of 312 modis images of 16 day time step the monthly aet maps for 1950 2013 show a gradual increase in aet during the crop growing season from january to may but a subsequent decline from june to december as the season progresses from summer to winter and as plant transpiration decreases drastically in june the month when most crops are harvested the aet estimated for january to june arranged in descending order are may 3 67 44 7 mm day april 5 99 36 8 mm day march 2 96 32 7 mm day february 0 68 20 mm day june 2 42 17 7 mm day and january 1 11 mm day respectively high aet losses in these months are of major concern because crops are irrigated from groundwater sources where the rate of withdrawal far exceeds the rate of replenishment the aet losses estimated are similar to aet of other regions of ksa mahmoud and alazba 2016 madugundu et al 2018 for instance madugundu et al 2018 found that crop water requirements for carrot in the riyadh region of saudi arabia in the summer were about 3243 mm about 36 mm day and 620 mm in winter crop water requirements for silage maize was 1622 mm in the summer and 1359 mm in spring using a surface energy balance algorithm mahmoud and alazba 2016 estimated the average daily aet in the southern and western regions of ksa varies widely from 4 97 to 49 mm day in april and from 3 43 to 48 9 mm day in may in the study area high aet losses found in some small spots in aet maps are mainly due to evaporation from water bodies such as lakes impounded behind rain harvesting dams and water storage facilities such high aet values in an arid region such as saudi arabia are examples of mismanagement of irrigation water which could cause soil salinity to increase to address rising soil salinity problems farmers resort to apply excessive amount of irrigation water higher than the crop water requirement for leaching of soil salinity which is a common issue in irrigated land in saudi arabia due to high evaporation loss of irrigated water fig 5 shows the spatial variations of aet over the study area where maximum aet values are found in al qassim province hail province and in the northern portion of al riyadh province the results also show that irrigated cropland has access to moisture because of irrigation and groundwater so monthly aet of irrigated cropland depend on moisture availability and the atmospheric water demand from june to december there were a gradual decrease in aet values where aet estimate ranged from 2 42 to 17 7 mm day in june 0 85 9 1 mm day in july 0 64 6 57 mm day in august the lowest observed values for aet were in september and october where its value ranged from 0 to 3 7 mm day the average annual aet estimated by the soil water balance model given in fig 6 a shows moderate aet in non irrigated areas in the southern parts of riyadh 351 993 mm year in contrast to very high annual aet ranging from 1200 to 2900 mm year in irrigated cropland in the northern and central region of riyadh al qassim province and hail province the average annual aet losses estimated using the pike and ol dekop methods are unrealistically low even in irrigated crop field and the results are not presented on the other hand aet estimated by the schreiber model ranging from 492 to 2710 mm year agrees well with that estimated by the soil water balance model ranging from 351 to 2900 mm year and so it is shown in fig 6b the annual aet estimated by the soil water balance model are about 9 11 greater than that estimate by the schreiber model 3 4 long term average daily actual evapotranspiration long term average daily aet estimated by the soil water balance model for 1950 2016 fig 7 a generally agree with those obtained from field measurements as shown in fig 7b the long term average daily aet ranges from 2 mm day to 30 mm day in some areas in general uniform daily irrigation is applied to crops from 0 to 2 mm day for alfalfa during the initial crop growth stage and from 1 0 to 5 0 mm day for other crops with the highest values for grapes under the driest conditions from buishand s change detection test applied to average daily aet between 1950 and 2016 statistically significant change points in daily aet were detected in 1990 because the average daily aet of 3 6 mm day over 1950 1990 ha d increased to 5 3 mm day over 1990 2016 furthermore the mann kendall trend test also detected a statistically significant positive trend of 1 5 mm decade in the average daily aet over 1990 2016 likely caused by climate warming in the last three decades the recent rising trend in aet detected is expected to cause stress to crops and to enhance drought conditions mahmoud and gan 2018 to validate the soil water balance model developed in this study both models estimated and field observed daily aet via a water balance analysis for alfalfa crop are compared overall fig 7b shows good agreements between model estimated and observed daily aet for alfalfa even though the model estimated daily aet are about 4 5 higher than the observed aet for january to april the period with the best agreement between both datasets between the end of april and the middle of june estimated aet is about 2 lower than the observed aet and even lower from july to august because of lower atmospheric demand of evaporation loss the successful application of the soil water balance model developed in this study in deriving representative aet maps will be useful to achieve the planning and management of sustainable water use in arid regions of middle east such as the kingdom of saudi arabia 4 conclusion this study was designed to estimate average reference and aet over al riyadh al qassim and hail province in the central region of saudi arabia during 1950 2013 using soil water balance model on daily monthly and annual basis firstly the fao penman monteith method was used to model the spatial distribution of eto on a grid by grid basis using data collected from meteorological stations and gis techniques then crop coefficients kc were modeled as a function of 16 day time series modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi next using kc maps and eto as input daily aet was simulated by the soil water balance swb model and aggregated to monthly and annual aet eto is found to be the highest and of the most concern in al qassim province hail province and in the northern portion of al riyadh province from january to march and from november december there is a shift of maximum eto towards southeastern parts of al qassim province hail province and al riyadh province except in its northern portion the annual eto shows very high values in the entire study area as it ranged from 2127 to 2460 mm year from empirical ndvi kc relationships developed and applicable at pixel level kc derived from the ndvi kc relationships agree well with kc recommended by fao over various crop growth stages in the field the monthly aet maps for 1950 2013 show a gradual increase in aet during the crop growing season in january to may but a subsequent decline as the season progresses from june to december the aet estimated for january to june are arranged in descending order which are may 3 67 44 7 mm day april 5 99 36 8 mm day march 2 96 32 7 mm day february 0 68 20 mm day june 2 42 17 7 mm day and january 1 11 mm day respectively statistical analysis shows that statistically significant change point in daily aet generally occurred in 1990 such that the long term average daily aet of 1950 1990 at 3 6 mm day increased to about 5 3 mm day between 1990 and 2016 with a positive trend of 1 5 mm decade the annual aet estimated for irrigated cropland in northern and central regions of riyadh al qassim province and hail province range from 1200 to 2900 mm year in these regions low aet values are found in shrubland grassland and other natural vegetation the annual aet estimated by the swb model are about 9 11 higher than modeled aet in the study area where the long term average daily aet estimated for 1950 2013 range from 2 mm day to 30 mm day the lowest long term average daily aet is observed from the start of august to the end of september the measured daily aet for alfalfa crop used to test and validate the swb model good agreement between swb based daily aet and the measured daily aet for alfalfa overall there was very good agreements between model estimated and observed daily aet for alfalfa even though the model estimated daily aet are about 4 5 higher than the observed aet for january to april the period with the best agreement between both datasets between the end of april and the middle of june estimated aet is about 2 lower than the observed aet and even lower from july to august because of lower atmospheric demand of evaporation loss representative aet maps derived from applying the ndvi kc relationships to the swb model will be

the southern part waihai 0 38 mg p m 2d 1 3 42 mg n m 2d 1 actual loadings exceed the critical nutrient loadings by 82 times and 17 times of caohai and waihai respectively our study illustrates how linking marina with pclake helped to quantify the causes of lake eutrophication and to identify critical loadings for n and p in the lake our study can assist local authorities to formulate management options to reduce nutrient pollution in lake dianchi in the future keywords river export of nutrients critical loading mining marina nutrient model pclake ecosystem model 1 introduction lake dianchi is a lake in yunnan china in a relatively urbanized densely populated area wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the lake is an important drinking water source for cities industries and food production however lake dianchi is listed among the three most heavily polluted lakes in china the water quality stated deteriorating in the 1970s liu and qiu 2007 concentrations of phosphorus p and nitrogen n are high tong et al 2017 as a result algal blooms regularly occur threatening the water availability of people living around the lake liu et al 2012 over the years eutrophication has become a pervasive threat bengtsson et al 2012 lucas et al 2015 and a priority of the yunnan provincial governments environmental protection initiatives this is not only important for water security and economic development but also for ecology lake dianchi s ecology is vulnerable and relatively sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance dai et al 2017 human activities are the main cause of the poor water quality in the lake with population growth and rapid local economic expansion nutrient loadings in the drainage basin of the lake increased significantly since the late 20th century transforming the former oligotrophic lake into a eutrophic one gao et al 2015 excessive fertilizer use increasing manure production industrial waste and domestic wastewater have been suggested as causes of high concentrations of nutrients zhou et al 2014 however a good understanding of the sources of nutrient pollution in the lake from different human activities is lacking over the past decades many efforts have been undertaken by governments and private businesses to solve the eutrophication problems liu et al 2012 the chinese government has spent more than 17 billion approximately 2 8 billion usd since 2006 in projects aimed at reducing nutrient loads and restoring lake ecology liu and wang 2016 already in 1999 a zero o clock action instructed companies around dianchi watershed to treat their discharged wastewater appropriately to meet the state wastewater emission standards zhang et al 2014 in addition six major projects were implemented by kunming city to control pollutions including dredging and recovering of in lake ecology pollution prevention of the surrounding areas river borne pollution control and establishment of water treatment facilities liu et al 2015 some private businesses are using dredging and biotechnology applications to reduce the nutrient pollution zhang et al 2015 and in recent five year plans china s state council included schemes to reduce pollution and improve the water quality of lakes liu et al 2015 however these efforts did not solve the eutrophication problem in lake dianchi mitigating eutrophication generally needs efforts to reduce nutrient loads in the entire drainage area of the lake many studies exist on lake dianchi but most focus on the surface water quality liu et al 2004 or on lake management liu and qiu 2007 schindler 2012 not many studies exist on the land based sources of the nutrients in the lake a better understanding of n and p loadings to lake dianchi by source in a spatially explicit will help to define effective policies in addition to what extent current n and p loadings exceed critical levels is not well studied this prevents the formulation of effective solutions for reducing eutrophication problems over the past decades several models have been developed to quantify nutrient inputs to water systems lewis et al 2007 gao et al 2014 strokal et al 2016a b among them is the marina model model to assess river inputs of nutrient to seas marina quantifies river export of n and p in different forms dissolved inorganic dissolved organic by source at the sub basin scale for chinese rivers strokal et al 2016a b pclake is a dynamic mathematical model used to study eutrophication effects in shallow lakes and ponds pclake accounts for the overall nutrient cycles where the primary biotic groups are introduced and the relationship between them specified janse et al 2008 marina and pclake make it possible to analyze nutrient inputs to lakes by source and sub basin and to determine critical loading in a quantitative systematic and spatially explicit way so far these models have not been used in combination the objective of the research is therefore to improve our understanding of n and p loadings in lake dianchi and to analyze to what extent they exceed critical levels to this end we will first quantify river export of nutrients n and p to lake dianchi from sub basins secondly we will identify the main sources of n and p inputs to the lake thirdly we will quantify the critical loadings for n and p in the lake and to what extent these are exceeded these objectives are met by using the two models marina for river export of n and p to the lake and pclake for critical loading of n and p 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake dianchi located in kunming which is capital of yunnan province in southwest china fig 1 it is situated in an area that is characterized by a developed local economy dense population high level of urbanization and severe water quality issues it is the largest lake in of the nine lakes in yunnan guizhou plateau and is located between 24 01 n and 24 40 n and 102 36 e and 102 47 e the watershed involves four main counties songming kunming chengong and jinning the surface area of the lake is about 309 km2 extends 39 km with a width of 13 5 km the maximum depth of the lake is 10 1 m and the average annual depth is 4 9 m the lake s volume is about 13 9 billion cubic meters of water lake dianchi has been separated into two parts by the xiyuan tunnel since 1996 gong et al 2007 the inner lake is called caohai only accounts for 2 5 of the total lake surface 11 km2 and its average depth is 2 5 m the other part of lake dianchi is waihai outer lake 298km2 and it has an average depth of 5 m fig 1 the drainage area is about 2940 km2 the land use in the drainage area of the lake in 2012 included around 42 forest 25 farmland 11 water systems 16 urban areas and 6 unused land the drainage area of lake dianchi can be divided into 15 sub basins gao et al 2014 2 2 marina model and pclake model in this study we use two models to better understand causes of eutrophication of lake dianchi in yunnan province the marina model quantifies river export of dissolved inorganic and organic n and p at the sub basin scale strokal et al 2016a b marina can be used to assess river inputs of nutrients to the lake by source pclake is a general eutrophication model of shallow lake ecosystems it combines a description of the nutrient cycles and the development of phytoplankton and submerged water plants with a food web approach in the model phytoplankton and macrophytes compete for nutrients and light resulting in two possible alternative stable states turbid phytoplankton dominated or clear macrophyte dominated janse et al 2008 we used the outputs from the marina model to run pclake to identify to what extent the critical loadings of n and p exceed their actual ladings in lake dianchi fig 2 below we describe the two models 2 2 1 marina model 2 2 1 1 model description marina is short for model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas it quantifies river export of dissolved n and p by source at the sub basin scale for the six large rivers of china strokal et al 2016a b these six chinese rivers are the yellow liao hai yangtze huai and pearl rivers in this study we apply the marina model to lake dianchi and its sub basins river export of nutrients to the lake is quantified by source for n and p in dissolved inorganic din dip and dissolved organic don dop forms as 1 m f y j r s f y j f e r i v f o u t l e t j f e r i v f m o u t h j where m f y j is the river export of nutrient form f din don dip dop by source y from sub basin j kg year 1 r s f y j is inputs of nutrient form f to rivers by source y from sub basin j kg year 1 the marina model distinguishes between diffuse r s d i f f y j and point r s p n t f y j sources diffuse sources are synthetic fertilizers for din don dip dop human waste for din don dip and dop animal manure for din don dip and dop weathering of p contained minerals for dip leaching of organic matter for don and dop atmospheric n2 deposition for din and biological n fixation for din for agricultural and non agricultural areas point sources are direct discharges of animal manure to rivers for din don dip and dop human waste for din don dip and dop and detergents for dip from sewage systems and human waste that is not collected by centralized sewage systems but can potentially enter rivers via direct discharges for din don dip and dop in this study we added p mining and processing to the marina model for the southern sub basins see fig 1 mining and processing can be both diffuse and point sources of dip in rivers f e r i v f o u t l e t j is the fraction of r s f y j export to the outlet of sub basin j 0 1 f e r i v f m o u t h j is the fraction of r s f y j f e r i v f o u t l e t j exported to the river mouth 0 1 in our study sub basins directly discharge into the lake this implies that f e r i v f m o u t h j is set as 1 for all sub basins in this study the marina model quantifies river export of nutrients to the lake in two steps first we quantity inputs of nutrients to rivers by sources from agricultural and non agricultural areas r s f y j kg year 1 second we quantity the river export of nutrients to the lake from sources and sub basins f e r i v f o u t l e t j 0 1 step 1 quantifying r s f y j for diffuse r s d i f f y j and point r s p n t f y j sources for agricultural areas inputs of din dip don and dop to the rivers in sub basin j from diffuse source y are calculated using eq 2 except for p weathering for dip leaching of organic matter for don and dop and p mining with rock processing as strokal et al 2016a b 2 r s d i f f y j w s d i f e y j g f j f e w s f j where w s d i f e y j is the input of nutrient element e nitrogen or phosphorus to agricultural land from diffuse source y in sub basin j kg year 1 these inputs are synthetic fertilizers and human waste that are applied to cropland from the rural and urban population animal manure that is applied to cropland atmospheric n deposition and biological n2 fixation g f j is the fraction of nutrient f applied to agricultural land that remained in soils of sub basin j after animal grazing and crop harvesting 0 1 we can calculated it as the 1 amount of element that is export from the soil by animal gazing and harvesting the total amount of element to agricultural soil f e w s f j is the export fraction of nutrient form f entering rivers in sub basin j 0 1 see supplementary materials for non agricultural areas inputs of din to the rivers in sub basin j from diffuse source y are calculated by multiplying nutrient inputs to non agricultural land corrected for nutrient retentions in soils f e w s f j 0 1 nutrients inputs to non agricultural land are from atmospheric n deposition and biological n2 fixation by natural vegetation details are in strokal et al 2016a b and in box a 1 dip inputs to rivers from weathering of p containing minerals and don and dop inputs to rivers from leaching of organic matters from agricultural and non agricultural areas are modeled as a function of annual runoff from land to streams following the marina model strokal et al 2016a b nutrient inputs to rivers from point sources are quantified as strokal et al 2016a b 3 r s p n t f y j r s p n t e y j f e p n t f j where r s p n t e y j is the input of nutrient form f din don dip dop to rivers from point source y in sub basin j kg year 1 r s p n t e y j is the input of nutrient element e n or p to rivers from point source y in sub basin j kg year 1 f e p n t f j is the fraction of nutrient element that is exported to rivers as a form f din don dip and dop 0 1 point sources include sewage systems and direct discharges of animal manure and human waste not collected by sewage systems inputs of nutrient element n or p from sewage systems r s p n t e s e w j kg year 1 are quantified as a function of population connected to sewage systems excretion of n or p in human waste and removal efficiencies of n or p during treatment inputs of nutrient element n or p from direct discharges of animal manure r s p n t e m a j kg year 1 are quantified by correcting animal excretion for losses of n to air e g during storage collection and application and application of n and p manure to land similar modelling approaches are applied to quantify inputs of nutrient element n or p to rivers from direct discharges of uncollected rural and urban human waste r s p n t e h u m j kg year 1 details are given in strokal et al 2016a b and in see box a 3 in supplementary materials in this study we improved the marina model by adding p mining and processing as anthropogenic diffuse and point sources of dip in rivers phosphate is one of the main mineral resources in yunnan there is a phosphate deposits in the southwest part of dianchi sub basins see fig 1 thus mining and rock process can also be important diffuse and point sources of dip in the lake diffuse source inputs of dip from mining and processing r s d i f d i p m i n j kg year 1 are quantified following the modeling approach for weathering of p minerals but with adjusted rate for p mining and processing see box a 2 in supplementary materials point source inputs of dip from mining activities r s p n t d i p m i n j kg year 1 are quantified following eq 3 details are presented in box a 2 in the supplementary materials step 2 quantifying f e r i v f o u t l e t j f e r i v f o u t l e t j is the fraction of r s f y j export to the outlet of sub basin j 0 1 this fraction is quantified as strokal et al 2016a b 4 f e r i v f o u t l e t j 1 d f j 1 l f j 1 f q r e m where d f j and l f j represents the fraction of nutrient forms f din and dip retention in dammed reservoirs and in the river system respectively strokal et al 2016a 0 1 f q r e m j is the fraction of nutrients for all dissolved n and p that is removed from rivers through water consumption such as irrigation and hydropower strokal et al 2016a b nutrient removal from the river system by water consumption is the difference between actual and natural water discharges at the outlet of sub basin the natural water discharge means the amount of water before it is removed for consumption details on how we derived these model parameters are shown in the following paragraphs below 2 2 1 2 model inputs for marina in this study most model inputs were derived from existing datasets of nufer nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use ma et al 2010 2013 wang et al 2018 and marina models table 1 missing inputs were from literature see the supplementary materials below we describe the sources of model inputs and parameters model inputs for synthetic fertilizers and animal manure were taken from the outputs of the nufer model wang et al 2018 for counties covering the drainage area of the lake songming kunming chengong and jinning counties the outputs of the nufer model were on the county scale which is the smallest administrative unit in china in order to estimate data from county to sub basins an area weighted method is used gao et al 2014 thus for each sub basin the data from the nufer model are calculated by multiplying the nufer value in each county by its area proportions in the sub basin to distinguish population connected and unconnected to the sewage system method from morée et al 2013 was applied details in strokal et al 2016a b population information was based on the yunnan statistical yearbook chen 2013 atmospheric n deposition data were derived from xu et al 2015 this study reported average deposition rate per land area for different sampling site in dianchi watershed one sampling site was near agricultural area and other sampling site was in urban area sub basins that located in kunming city daqing baoxiang haihe caohai sub basins took the value from the urban site others shared the value from sites near the cropland biological n2 fixation by crops and natural vegetation were derived from the marina model strokal et al 2016a b in the marina model lake dianchi is a part of jinsha basin jin 2003 thus we used the value of jiansha for biological n2 fixation in our study we downscaled the jinsha value to the sub basins of lake dianchi by the area weighted method this method firstly identified the proportion of each basin within the jinsha basin then multiplying this fraction by biological n2 fixation for the whole jinsha basin from strokal et al 2016a b to downscale to lake dianchi the annual runoff q a c t discharge after taken for consumption km3 year 1 was derived from jin 2003 we calculated natural water discharge q n a t discharge before taken for consumption km3 year 1 from the equation of f q r e m j strokal et al 2016a b we derived din and dip retentions in reservoirs d d i n d d i p 0 1 from the marina model we took the values of the jinsha basin from the model and applied it for our sub basins draining into the dianchi lake the fraction of dip retained or lost from water system l d i p 0 1 was also from the marina model strokal et al 2016a b 2 2 1 3 model evaluation the original marina model was evaluated for nutrient export by the six chinese rivers here we evaluated the model for the lake dianchi we compared modelled fluxes of total n tn and total p tp for 2012 with measurements table 2 since the marina nutrient model only quantified the dissolved forms of nutrients we estimated tn and tp using the modelled fluxes of din don dip and dop tn 1 2tdn tp 2tdp measured fluxes of tn and tp ton year 1 are calculated from nutrient concentrations mg l 1 using reported water discharges km3 year 1 and sub basin areas km2 the observed concentrations of tn and tp are available from literature see table 1 results show that our model values are generally in line with the observed tn and tp fluxes we calculate about 7450 t year 1 of tn and 826 t year 1of tp inputs exported from all sub basins to lake dianchi these values are in reasonable agreement with measurements 1527 8601 t year 1 for tn and 119 703 t year 1 for tp table 1 the measurements for tn and tp vary greatly in the literature that may be associated with different locations of sampling sites and time period 2 2 2 pclake 2 2 2 1 model description pclake is an ecosystem model developed for shallow lakes the model dynamically simulates an aquatic food web which includes among other variables phytoplankton macrophytes and zooplankton the model is commonly used to estimate critical nutrient loads of lakes defined as the transition between a clear state with submerged vegetation dominance and turbid state with abundant phytoplankton janse and aldenberg 1990a b critical nutrient loads are lake specific and depend on lake characteristics janssen et al 2015 the model describes the most important ecological interactions in a shallow lake ecosystem to determine what state will prevail pclake describes a well mixed water body and comprises both the water column and the sediment top layer with the most important biotic and abiotic components janse et al 2010 the model is therefore suitable to study shallow non stratifying lakes such as lake dianchi janse and aldenberg 1990a b to test the effect of eutrophication and oligotrophication the model output is evaluated for a range of nutrient loadings and for two different initial conditions clear and turbid the equilibrium output values for chlorophyll a that were reached after 30 years where used to evaluate the state of the system and to determine the critical nutrient load of two distinct regions of the lake caohai and waihai 2 2 2 2 model inputs for pclake there are four types of lake specific settings to parameterize pclake specific lake characteristics nutrients input lake hydrology and sediment type in this study the ratio between the external nutrient loads n and p load were derived from the marina model outcome to perform a bifurcation analysis with a constant n p ratio next the external nutrient loads from marina were used to identify the required nutrient reductions with respect to the critical nutrient load the lake characteristics depth area main wind direction were from liu et al 2004 and in case of fetch based on gis to calculate the length of the lake in the main wind direction sediment characteristics are parameterized using the default settings from pclake for sandy and peaty sediment that are typical for lake dianchi janse and aldenberg 1990a b jeppesen et al 1990 the outflow in pclake is based on the water balance of lake dianchi and is formulated as follow 5 i n f l o w p r e c i p i t a t i o n e v a p o r a t i o n o u t f l o w here water inflow data to the lake from the marina model and precipitation data from zhou et al 2014 were used evaporation records originate from ji et al 2016 therefore 1999 2009 records of evaporation were picked and average by years to get yearly input all lake specific parameters of the model are included in supplementary materials see table b 1 2 2 2 3 model validation we validated the model based on data of the entire lake since the nutrient inputs were only provided lake wide and yearly averaged jin 2003 the yearly average tp and tn loads for dianchi lake where used in combination with an average fetch and water balance next we compared modelled tn and tp concentration with observations from 1988 to 2012 the observed concentrations originate from jin 2003 and zhang et al 2014 our modelled values are generally in line with the observed tn and tp concentrations we calculate about 3 14 7 35 mg l 1 of tn concentration and 0 51 1 02 mg l 1 for tp in lake dianchi these values are in reasonable agreement with caohai 4 42 6 89 mg l 1 for tn concentration and 0 21 0 88 mg l 1 for tp concentration our validation results also indicate that the values of waihai are simulated too high by the model lake dianchi has mainly floating macrophytes and emergent which can take up nutrients and are present especially in waihai a turbid state with high phytoplankton biomass is the typical eutrophication problem in temperate lakes in tropical lakes large floating macrophyte species and in particular the water hyacinths eichhornia crassipes leave little opportunity for animal or plant life with dark and anoxic conditions under them in this study we use the standard settings for pclake which assume 100 biomass submerged macrophytes and in which floating macrophytes were not included probably the effect of the missing floating macrophytes is main cause why we found the values in the validation were reasonable but a bit too high for waihai table 3 3 results first we present river export of dissolved inorganic and organic n and p to lake dianchi from sub basins second we present the main sources of these nutrients in the lake third we discuss the critical loadings for n and p in the lake and to what extent these are exceeded 3 1 nutrient export by rivers to lake dianchi we estimate total dissolved n inputs to lake dianchi from 15 sub basins to be approximately 6209 ton in 2012 fig 3 two thirds of these inputs are din and one third don which is 5124 ton and 1085 ton respectively inputs of din to the lake are five times higher than that of don inputs of total dissolved p to the lake are estimated at about 413 ton in 2012 the share of dip and dop in total dissolved p inputs is 75 and 25 respectively river export of n to the lake was predominantly from sewage systems for din don and synthetic fertilizers for din human waste from sewage systems was the dominant source of din and don export to the lake fig 3 almost one third of din up to 1892 ton year 1 and half of don 651 ton year 1 entering the lake was from sewage synthetic fertilizers contributed around one third to din in rivers about 1473 ton in 2012 atmospheric n deposition and biological n2 fixation are also important sources accounting for 20 1101 ton of total din human waste used as fertilizer was the least important source of din in rivers in addition direct discharge of animal manure and human waste to surface waters are a relatively small source of don contributing around 13 and 2 respectively river export of p to the lake was mainly from point sources including sewage systems for dip direct discharges of animal manure especially for dop and human waste especially for dop and mining for dip human and animal manure which directly discharge to the rivers brought the majority of total dissolved p fig 3 similar to din export human waste from sewage was mainly responsible for a high proportion of dip approximately 54 the amount of dip from human waste was higher than 135 ton in 2012 in contrast direct discharge of animal manure was the dominant source for dop which account for 47 of dop export direct discharge of human waste was the second important source for dop around 33 tons mining added 19 ton of dip to rivers as diffuse source and 44 ton of dip as a point source in 2012 the share of detergents was comparable to the share of directly discharged animal manure in dip export dip export to the lake from synthetic fertilizers was around 17 ton year 1 which was higher than weathering of p contained mineral according to the marina model weathering of p contained mineral 0 01 ton year 1 and dop 0 05 ton year 1 leaching of organic matter hardly contributed dip and dop to the lake 3 2 sources of nutrients in lake dianchi results show strong spatial patterns of nitrogen distribution along the lake from south to north fig 4 the din ranged when expressed per area of watershed from 835 to 4860 kg km 2 year 1 with an average of 1876 kg km 2 year 1 of the 15 sub basins rivers in sub basins daqing and caohai discharge most din per km2 4860 kg km 2 year 1 and 4426 kg km 2 year 1 respectively similar results also found for don export per km2 caohai sub basin 1496 kg km 2 year 1 and daqing sub basin 1567 kg km 2 year 1 are the important contributors to don export to the lake the contribution of the largest sub basin panlong to din and don export was smaller than the contribution of caohai and daqing sub basins the large contribution of the caohai and daqing sub basins can be explained by the intensive urbanization activities see also fig 5 and the net effect of n retentions in soils and rivers in general the largest river exports of dissolved n are projected for the northern areas which have relatively dense populations high per capita gdp and sewage treatment concentration likewise the river export of dissolved p differs largely among sub basins for the year 2012 p exports range from very low to more than 300 kg km 2 year 1 for dip and more than 50 kg km 2 year 1 for dop as for din caohai 337 kg km 2 year 1 daqing 346 kg km 2 year 1 gucheng 350 kg km 2 year 1 and dongda 264 kg km 2 year 1 export generally more dip per km2 than the other sub basins fig 4 the lowest dip exports are quantified for sub basins in the north of dianchi watershed most of which are rural area and low populations the results for dop are different high dop export in the southern area and dongdahe gets the largest dip export which is 62 kg km 2 year 1 the spatial patterns are driven by many factors such as use of n fertilizers livestock and population densities as well as water consumption the caohai and daqing sub basins are densely populated urban areas where human waste in sewage effluents are important sources of din in surface waters in the lake dianchi watershed six major sewage treatment plants have been constructed in the past decade most of which are located in central urban areas including caohai daqing and haihe sub basins interestingly point sources of din are mainly concentrated in the northern sub basins while diffuse source e g fertilizers dominate in the southern also sources of don differ among sub basins don is mainly from direct discharge of n in human excretion in northern sub basins and mainly from direct discharge of animal manure in southern human waste is also a large source of dip but not in all sub basins in urban areas human waste in sewage effluents is the dominant source contributing to almost 60 of total dip mining activities in gucheng dongda and cigang explain the relatively high loadings in southern sub basins for dop the main source is direct discharge of human waste in the northern sub basins meanwhile a direct discharge of animal manure is a dominant source of dop in southern sub basisns especially in cigang 3 3 critical nutrient loadings in lake dianchi the relationship between nutrient input and chlorophyll a of caohai was highly nonlinear the results for coahai show a rather sudden switch between a macrophyte dominated state with low chlorophyll a values and a phytoplankton dominated state with high chlorophyll a concentrations fig 6 moreover the response showed hysteresis so that the critical nutrient load depends on the previous state in which the lake was either clear or turbid the critical load for the switch from turbid to clear as measured per lake area was much lower than the one for the opposite switch viz ca 0 34 and 2 02 mg p m 2 d 1 respectively for caohai the multiple states only occurred in an intermediate range of nutrient loadings at a lower loading than 0 34 mg p m 2 d 1 3 06 mg n m 2 d 1 the system is always macrophyte dominated whereas for higher loading than 2 02 mg p l 1 d 1 it is always dominated by algae according to the marina model the actual p loading of caohai is 28 mg p m 2 d 1 the critical nutrient load for caohai is 0 34 mg p m 2 d 1 which is exceeded 82 times by the actual loads for waihai alternative stable states are not present and the curve is nonlinear without hysteresis therefore the critical p load only slightly depends on human defined limits to the maximum allowable chlorophyll a the water quality of waihai is targeted for class ⅳ that means the authorities aim for a maximum allowable chlorophyll a of 0 03 mg l 1 in the period 2016 2020 environmental quality standard for surface water 2002 based on this information the critical nutrient load for waihai is about 0 38 mg p m 2 d 1 which is exceeded by 17 times compared to the loading from the marina model 6 5 mg p m 2 d 1 4 discussion this is the first study to link the marina model with the pclake model for dianchi lake this combination of models made it possible to provide a comprehensive assessment of nutrient loadings into the lake by source and sub basin and to identify to what extend these loadings exceed the critical nutrient loadings critical nutrient loadings are the levels of nutrients in the lake above which eutrophication problems may occur this information is the first step towards identifying effective solutions for eutrophication problems however the models have uncertainties these uncertainties are often associated with model inputs and parameters for example we made some simplification and assumptions for some of our model inputs e g retentions factors of n and p in rivers aggregation of the county information to the sub basin information we did this because of the data limitation we realize that this may affect the model results however we believe that such uncertainties will not change the main message of our study because our models perform reasonably well for our study area based on the validation results see sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 some studies have already quantified n and p export to lake dianchi but few studies exist on different nutrient forms furthermore studies generally ignore direct discharge of animal manure to the lake therefore the current nutrient pollution of the lake may be underestimated in the existing studies for example we estimate 690 t of p dissolve inorganic phosphorus and dissolve organic phosphorus per year from point sources which is higher than ma and wang 2015 around 370 t year 1 of p when we excluded the impacts of animal manure p inputs by point source is about 544 t which approaches the result of ma and wang 2015 we calculate 826 t year 1 of tp export to lake dianchi in 2012 this is lower than the results of liu et al 2004 for 2000 1693 t year 1 several reasons may explain the difference one of them is in the difference in the studied year we quantify n and p inputs to the lake for the 2012s while liu et al 2004 for 2000 another reason is in the sources of the nutrients in the lake since 2000 the wastewater treatment in sewage systems has been improved gao et al 2014 leading to lower discharges of the nutrients to the lake in our study compared to liu et al 2004 liu et al 2004 assumed that there was no wastewater treatment in rural area in our study we account for treatment in rural as well as in urban areas liu et al 2004 indicate the important of the human waste in lake pollution and may underestimate the importance of fertilizer and manure inputs to land this may overestimate the importance of rural waste for p export by liu et al 2004 the comparison of n2 fixation by crops and tn export to the lake dianchi is in good agreement with the results of gao et al 2015 biological n2 fixation by crops and tn export to the lake dianchi was 295 kg km 2 year 1 and 8000 t year 1 respectively gao et al 2015 in our study these values are 220 kg km 2 year 1 and 7451 t year 1 respectively likewise our results are for the total loads for riverine inputs and atmospheric n deposition are also close to zhan et al 2017 an important difference of our study from the existing studies is that we specify the sources of the riverine inputs of n and p and that we link these n and p inputs to the pclake model for critical nutrient loadings human waste is a major pollution source for lake dianchi in the urban area although the constructed urban area in kunming occupies only around 17 of lake dianchi watershed gao et al 2015 the tn and tp inputs to the lake from the urban area is about half of the total according to the statistical data the population of kunming was 3 28 million in 2012 even if six major sewage treatment plants have been constructed in the last decade and most of them are located in central urban areas all the sewage cannot be collected and treated thoroughly with the high urbanization and the increase of population human waste from sewage systems became the dominant point source in the urban area and imposes strong pressure on lake dianchi agricultural activities have greatly influenced nutrient export of the sub basin and n input from fertilizer was the largest input source overall in the southern watershed of lake dianchi though the government had banned large scale livestock and poultry breeding in the watershed in 2008 by 2012 still some n and p from direct manure discharges may enter the rivers flowing into the lake some manure is used as fertilizer in agriculture the impact of resources mining and processing is serious in the southern area within the lake s watershed there are 14 types of mineral ores of which most are phosphate ores yang et al 2014 about 19 ton of dip as diffuse pollution by mining was discharged into lake dianchi in 2012 some efforts were made in afforestation the newly established forestlands are covered with small trees and many treatment facilities had been built with the high removal efficiencies of p liu et al 2004 the mining of phosphorus resources at the southern sub basins of the lake is trough topsoil stripping and open casting ways these processes caused serious soil erosion the eroded soil containing high phosphorus flushed with runoff through inflow rivers in our study we calculate 63 ton of dip was export to the lake in 2012 resulted from point industrial processing followed by treatment and diffuse mining activities according to the marina model the actual p loading of lake dianchi for caohai and waihai is 28 and 6 5 g p m 2d 1 respectively as we calculated the nutrient loading with marina caohai near kunming city and human waste was the dominant source for n and p that means if we would like to improve the water quality of caohai the best way is to reduce the nutrients inputs from human waste based on the information on nutrient loading from marina the nutrient inputs are largely attributed to agricultural activities in waihai individual farmer s pursuit of high production the application of synthetic fertilizer increased meanwhile the growth of livestock inevitably leads to a great manure surplus and threatens the water quality of waihai generally water quality in caohai is much worse than in waihai in terms of nutrient pollution because of its relatively smaller area and narrow shape the critical nutrient loads for caihai 0 34 mg p m 2 d 1 and for waihai 0 38 mg p m 2 d 1 are rather low compared to 0 9 mg p m 2 d 1 found by janse et al 2010 the explanation is that the lake dianchi is located in a subtropical region where the drainage area of lake dianchi belongs to the wet monsoon climatic belt of the northern sub tropic zone mainly controlled alternately by the southwest monsoon and sub tropic continental air mass warmer conditions have a large effect on the trophic cascade from fish to phytoplankton and the temperatures of lake dianchi are thereby favouring algal growth scheffer and van nes 2007 for these reasons previous studies for the sub tropical lake taihu located near shanghai also found a relative low critical nutrient load of 0 32 0 73 mg p m 2 d 1 janssen et al 2017 to mitigate nutrient pollution in the lake n and p inputs should be controlled and serious efforts need to be put into releasing environmental pressures by local government in order to reduce pollution effectively we advise to divide the watershed into three zones and take different management actions in each 1 urban zone caohai panlong daqing sub basins sewage collection network and sewage treatment plant construction with good treatment efficiencies are needed to reduce nutrient pollution from these sub basins 2 rural zone haihe baoxiang maliao luolong laoyu nanchong yuni baiyu sub basins precision fertilization e g according to crop needs with recycled animal manure is needed to reduce nutrient pollution from these sub basins 3 mining zone gucheng cigang dongba sub basins improvement of productive efficiency and waste re use within the mining sector and phosphate industries should be the future direction 5 conclusion we analyzed nitrogen n and phosphorus p loadings in lake dianchi using two models marina and pclake it showed that linking these models increase the understanding and quantification of nutrient loads and therefor helps to define improvement policies results show that river export of dissolved n and p was high in 2012 about 6209 ton of total dissolved n tdn is exported to the lake of which more than two thirds in the form of dissolved inorganic n for total dissolved p this export is at about 413 ton with the share of dissolved inorganic p at 75 human waste from urbanization is the major pollution source to lake dianchi in northern sub basins agricultural activities are important sources of the nutrients in rivers in southern sub basins p mining and processing is an important source of dissolved inorganic p in the southern sub basins considerable amounts of nutrient inputs are exported to the lake by rivers draining from caohai and daqing sub basins where urbanization is intensive lake dianchi has serious water pollution where eutrophication increasingly deteriorates water quality the actual nutrient loading exceeded the critical loading by 82 times and 17 times of caohai and waihai respectively in 2012 a series of efforts should be taken to reduce nutrients inputs to the lake and improve water quality we highlight that improving sewage treatment and efficient use of fertilizers synthetic and organic are important for reducing nutrient pollution from the northern and southern sub basins in addition it is important to improve environmental performance of the mining industries to reduce p pollution in the lake acknowledgements this study is financially supported by natioal key r d program of china

11246,lake dianchi suffered from severe eutrophication for decades past efforts to reduce the eutrophication were not very effective the objective of this study is to improve our understanding of nitrogen n and phosphorus p loadings and to analyze to what extent they exceed critical nutrient loadings of lake dianchi to this end we applied the nutrient marina model and the ecosystem model pclake results show that river export of dissolved n and p was high in 2012 about 6 209 ton of total dissolved n tdn was exported to the lake i e 23 6 kg ha 1 of which more than two thirds in the form of dissolved inorganic n for total dissolved p this export was about 413 ton i e 1 6 kg ha 1 of which 75 dissolved inorganic p urban sewage is a major source of nutrients in rivers in the northern sub basins in southern sub basins agriculture is an important source of both n and p while p mining and processing is a major source of dissolved inorganic p nutrient inputs to the lake are particularly high from urbanization sub basins draining into the northern part of the lake caohai critical nutrient loadings for the northern part of the lake caohai are 0 34 mg p m 2d 1 3 06 mg n m 2d 1 and for the southern part waihai 0 38 mg p m 2d 1 3 42 mg n m 2d 1 actual loadings exceed the critical nutrient loadings by 82 times and 17 times of caohai and waihai respectively our study illustrates how linking marina with pclake helped to quantify the causes of lake eutrophication and to identify critical loadings for n and p in the lake our study can assist local authorities to formulate management options to reduce nutrient pollution in lake dianchi in the future keywords river export of nutrients critical loading mining marina nutrient model pclake ecosystem model 1 introduction lake dianchi is a lake in yunnan china in a relatively urbanized densely populated area wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 the lake is an important drinking water source for cities industries and food production however lake dianchi is listed among the three most heavily polluted lakes in china the water quality stated deteriorating in the 1970s liu and qiu 2007 concentrations of phosphorus p and nitrogen n are high tong et al 2017 as a result algal blooms regularly occur threatening the water availability of people living around the lake liu et al 2012 over the years eutrophication has become a pervasive threat bengtsson et al 2012 lucas et al 2015 and a priority of the yunnan provincial governments environmental protection initiatives this is not only important for water security and economic development but also for ecology lake dianchi s ecology is vulnerable and relatively sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance dai et al 2017 human activities are the main cause of the poor water quality in the lake with population growth and rapid local economic expansion nutrient loadings in the drainage basin of the lake increased significantly since the late 20th century transforming the former oligotrophic lake into a eutrophic one gao et al 2015 excessive fertilizer use increasing manure production industrial waste and domestic wastewater have been suggested as causes of high concentrations of nutrients zhou et al 2014 however a good understanding of the sources of nutrient pollution in the lake from different human activities is lacking over the past decades many efforts have been undertaken by governments and private businesses to solve the eutrophication problems liu et al 2012 the chinese government has spent more than 17 billion approximately 2 8 billion usd since 2006 in projects aimed at reducing nutrient loads and restoring lake ecology liu and wang 2016 already in 1999 a zero o clock action instructed companies around dianchi watershed to treat their discharged wastewater appropriately to meet the state wastewater emission standards zhang et al 2014 in addition six major projects were implemented by kunming city to control pollutions including dredging and recovering of in lake ecology pollution prevention of the surrounding areas river borne pollution control and establishment of water treatment facilities liu et al 2015 some private businesses are using dredging and biotechnology applications to reduce the nutrient pollution zhang et al 2015 and in recent five year plans china s state council included schemes to reduce pollution and improve the water quality of lakes liu et al 2015 however these efforts did not solve the eutrophication problem in lake dianchi mitigating eutrophication generally needs efforts to reduce nutrient loads in the entire drainage area of the lake many studies exist on lake dianchi but most focus on the surface water quality liu et al 2004 or on lake management liu and qiu 2007 schindler 2012 not many studies exist on the land based sources of the nutrients in the lake a better understanding of n and p loadings to lake dianchi by source in a spatially explicit will help to define effective policies in addition to what extent current n and p loadings exceed critical levels is not well studied this prevents the formulation of effective solutions for reducing eutrophication problems over the past decades several models have been developed to quantify nutrient inputs to water systems lewis et al 2007 gao et al 2014 strokal et al 2016a b among them is the marina model model to assess river inputs of nutrient to seas marina quantifies river export of n and p in different forms dissolved inorganic dissolved organic by source at the sub basin scale for chinese rivers strokal et al 2016a b pclake is a dynamic mathematical model used to study eutrophication effects in shallow lakes and ponds pclake accounts for the overall nutrient cycles where the primary biotic groups are introduced and the relationship between them specified janse et al 2008 marina and pclake make it possible to analyze nutrient inputs to lakes by source and sub basin and to determine critical loading in a quantitative systematic and spatially explicit way so far these models have not been used in combination the objective of the research is therefore to improve our understanding of n and p loadings in lake dianchi and to analyze to what extent they exceed critical levels to this end we will first quantify river export of nutrients n and p to lake dianchi from sub basins secondly we will identify the main sources of n and p inputs to the lake thirdly we will quantify the critical loadings for n and p in the lake and to what extent these are exceeded these objectives are met by using the two models marina for river export of n and p to the lake and pclake for critical loading of n and p 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake dianchi located in kunming which is capital of yunnan province in southwest china fig 1 it is situated in an area that is characterized by a developed local economy dense population high level of urbanization and severe water quality issues it is the largest lake in of the nine lakes in yunnan guizhou plateau and is located between 24 01 n and 24 40 n and 102 36 e and 102 47 e the watershed involves four main counties songming kunming chengong and jinning the surface area of the lake is about 309 km2 extends 39 km with a width of 13 5 km the maximum depth of the lake is 10 1 m and the average annual depth is 4 9 m the lake s volume is about 13 9 billion cubic meters of water lake dianchi has been separated into two parts by the xiyuan tunnel since 1996 gong et al 2007 the inner lake is called caohai only accounts for 2 5 of the total lake surface 11 km2 and its average depth is 2 5 m the other part of lake dianchi is waihai outer lake 298km2 and it has an average depth of 5 m fig 1 the drainage area is about 2940 km2 the land use in the drainage area of the lake in 2012 included around 42 forest 25 farmland 11 water systems 16 urban areas and 6 unused land the drainage area of lake dianchi can be divided into 15 sub basins gao et al 2014 2 2 marina model and pclake model in this study we use two models to better understand causes of eutrophication of lake dianchi in yunnan province the marina model quantifies river export of dissolved inorganic and organic n and p at the sub basin scale strokal et al 2016a b marina can be used to assess river inputs of nutrients to the lake by source pclake is a general eutrophication model of shallow lake ecosystems it combines a description of the nutrient cycles and the development of phytoplankton and submerged water plants with a food web approach in the model phytoplankton and macrophytes compete for nutrients and light resulting in two possible alternative stable states turbid phytoplankton dominated or clear macrophyte dominated janse et al 2008 we used the outputs from the marina model to run pclake to identify to what extent the critical loadings of n and p exceed their actual ladings in lake dianchi fig 2 below we describe the two models 2 2 1 marina model 2 2 1 1 model description marina is short for model to assess river inputs of nutrients to seas it quantifies river export of dissolved n and p by source at the sub basin scale for the six large rivers of china strokal et al 2016a b these six chinese rivers are the yellow liao hai yangtze huai and pearl rivers in this study we apply the marina model to lake dianchi and its sub basins river export of nutrients to the lake is quantified by source for n and p in dissolved inorganic din dip and dissolved organic don dop forms as 1 m f y j r s f y j f e r i v f o u t l e t j f e r i v f m o u t h j where m f y j is the river export of nutrient form f din don dip dop by source y from sub basin j kg year 1 r s f y j is inputs of nutrient form f to rivers by source y from sub basin j kg year 1 the marina model distinguishes between diffuse r s d i f f y j and point r s p n t f y j sources diffuse sources are synthetic fertilizers for din don dip dop human waste for din don dip and dop animal manure for din don dip and dop weathering of p contained minerals for dip leaching of organic matter for don and dop atmospheric n2 deposition for din and biological n fixation for din for agricultural and non agricultural areas point sources are direct discharges of animal manure to rivers for din don dip and dop human waste for din don dip and dop and detergents for dip from sewage systems and human waste that is not collected by centralized sewage systems but can potentially enter rivers via direct discharges for din don dip and dop in this study we added p mining and processing to the marina model for the southern sub basins see fig 1 mining and processing can be both diffuse and point sources of dip in rivers f e r i v f o u t l e t j is the fraction of r s f y j export to the outlet of sub basin j 0 1 f e r i v f m o u t h j is the fraction of r s f y j f e r i v f o u t l e t j exported to the river mouth 0 1 in our study sub basins directly discharge into the lake this implies that f e r i v f m o u t h j is set as 1 for all sub basins in this study the marina model quantifies river export of nutrients to the lake in two steps first we quantity inputs of nutrients to rivers by sources from agricultural and non agricultural areas r s f y j kg year 1 second we quantity the river export of nutrients to the lake from sources and sub basins f e r i v f o u t l e t j 0 1 step 1 quantifying r s f y j for diffuse r s d i f f y j and point r s p n t f y j sources for agricultural areas inputs of din dip don and dop to the rivers in sub basin j from diffuse source y are calculated using eq 2 except for p weathering for dip leaching of organic matter for don and dop and p mining with rock processing as strokal et al 2016a b 2 r s d i f f y j w s d i f e y j g f j f e w s f j where w s d i f e y j is the input of nutrient element e nitrogen or phosphorus to agricultural land from diffuse source y in sub basin j kg year 1 these inputs are synthetic fertilizers and human waste that are applied to cropland from the rural and urban population animal manure that is applied to cropland atmospheric n deposition and biological n2 fixation g f j is the fraction of nutrient f applied to agricultural land that remained in soils of sub basin j after animal grazing and crop harvesting 0 1 we can calculated it as the 1 amount of element that is export from the soil by animal gazing and harvesting the total amount of element to agricultural soil f e w s f j is the export fraction of nutrient form f entering rivers in sub basin j 0 1 see supplementary materials for non agricultural areas inputs of din to the rivers in sub basin j from diffuse source y are calculated by multiplying nutrient inputs to non agricultural land corrected for nutrient retentions in soils f e w s f j 0 1 nutrients inputs to non agricultural land are from atmospheric n deposition and biological n2 fixation by natural vegetation details are in strokal et al 2016a b and in box a 1 dip inputs to rivers from weathering of p containing minerals and don and dop inputs to rivers from leaching of organic matters from agricultural and non agricultural areas are modeled as a function of annual runoff from land to streams following the marina model strokal et al 2016a b nutrient inputs to rivers from point sources are quantified as strokal et al 2016a b 3 r s p n t f y j r s p n t e y j f e p n t f j where r s p n t e y j is the input of nutrient form f din don dip dop to rivers from point source y in sub basin j kg year 1 r s p n t e y j is the input of nutrient element e n or p to rivers from point source y in sub basin j kg year 1 f e p n t f j is the fraction of nutrient element that is exported to rivers as a form f din don dip and dop 0 1 point sources include sewage systems and direct discharges of animal manure and human waste not collected by sewage systems inputs of nutrient element n or p from sewage systems r s p n t e s e w j kg year 1 are quantified as a function of population connected to sewage systems excretion of n or p in human waste and removal efficiencies of n or p during treatment inputs of nutrient element n or p from direct discharges of animal manure r s p n t e m a j kg year 1 are quantified by correcting animal excretion for losses of n to air e g during storage collection and application and application of n and p manure to land similar modelling approaches are applied to quantify inputs of nutrient element n or p to rivers from direct discharges of uncollected rural and urban human waste r s p n t e h u m j kg year 1 details are given in strokal et al 2016a b and in see box a 3 in supplementary materials in this study we improved the marina model by adding p mining and processing as anthropogenic diffuse and point sources of dip in rivers phosphate is one of the main mineral resources in yunnan there is a phosphate deposits in the southwest part of dianchi sub basins see fig 1 thus mining and rock process can also be important diffuse and point sources of dip in the lake diffuse source inputs of dip from mining and processing r s d i f d i p m i n j kg year 1 are quantified following the modeling approach for weathering of p minerals but with adjusted rate for p mining and processing see box a 2 in supplementary materials point source inputs of dip from mining activities r s p n t d i p m i n j kg year 1 are quantified following eq 3 details are presented in box a 2 in the supplementary materials step 2 quantifying f e r i v f o u t l e t j f e r i v f o u t l e t j is the fraction of r s f y j export to the outlet of sub basin j 0 1 this fraction is quantified as strokal et al 2016a b 4 f e r i v f o u t l e t j 1 d f j 1 l f j 1 f q r e m where d f j and l f j represents the fraction of nutrient forms f din and dip retention in dammed reservoirs and in the river system respectively strokal et al 2016a 0 1 f q r e m j is the fraction of nutrients for all dissolved n and p that is removed from rivers through water consumption such as irrigation and hydropower strokal et al 2016a b nutrient removal from the river system by water consumption is the difference between actual and natural water discharges at the outlet of sub basin the natural water discharge means the amount of water before it is removed for consumption details on how we derived these model parameters are shown in the following paragraphs below 2 2 1 2 model inputs for marina in this study most model inputs were derived from existing datasets of nufer nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use ma et al 2010 2013 wang et al 2018 and marina models table 1 missing inputs were from literature see the supplementary materials below we describe the sources of model inputs and parameters model inputs for synthetic fertilizers and animal manure were taken from the outputs of the nufer model wang et al 2018 for counties covering the drainage area of the lake songming kunming chengong and jinning counties the outputs of the nufer model were on the county scale which is the smallest administrative unit in china in order to estimate data from county to sub basins an area weighted method is used gao et al 2014 thus for each sub basin the data from the nufer model are calculated by multiplying the nufer value in each county by its area proportions in the sub basin to distinguish population connected and unconnected to the sewage system method from morée et al 2013 was applied details in strokal et al 2016a b population information was based on the yunnan statistical yearbook chen 2013 atmospheric n deposition data were derived from xu et al 2015 this study reported average deposition rate per land area for different sampling site in dianchi watershed one sampling site was near agricultural area and other sampling site was in urban area sub basins that located in kunming city daqing baoxiang haihe caohai sub basins took the value from the urban site others shared the value from sites near the cropland biological n2 fixation by crops and natural vegetation were derived from the marina model strokal et al 2016a b in the marina model lake dianchi is a part of jinsha basin jin 2003 thus we used the value of jiansha for biological n2 fixation in our study we downscaled the jinsha value to the sub basins of lake dianchi by the area weighted method this method firstly identified the proportion of each basin within the jinsha basin then multiplying this fraction by biological n2 fixation for the whole jinsha basin from strokal et al 2016a b to downscale to lake dianchi the annual runoff q a c t discharge after taken for consumption km3 year 1 was derived from jin 2003 we calculated natural water discharge q n a t discharge before taken for consumption km3 year 1 from the equation of f q r e m j strokal et al 2016a b we derived din and dip retentions in reservoirs d d i n d d i p 0 1 from the marina model we took the values of the jinsha basin from the model and applied it for our sub basins draining into the dianchi lake the fraction of dip retained or lost from water system l d i p 0 1 was also from the marina model strokal et al 2016a b 2 2 1 3 model evaluation the original marina model was evaluated for nutrient export by the six chinese rivers here we evaluated the model for the lake dianchi we compared modelled fluxes of total n tn and total p tp for 2012 with measurements table 2 since the marina nutrient model only quantified the dissolved forms of nutrients we estimated tn and tp using the modelled fluxes of din don dip and dop tn 1 2tdn tp 2tdp measured fluxes of tn and tp ton year 1 are calculated from nutrient concentrations mg l 1 using reported water discharges km3 year 1 and sub basin areas km2 the observed concentrations of tn and tp are available from literature see table 1 results show that our model values are generally in line with the observed tn and tp fluxes we calculate about 7450 t year 1 of tn and 826 t year 1of tp inputs exported from all sub basins to lake dianchi these values are in reasonable agreement with measurements 1527 8601 t year 1 for tn and 119 703 t year 1 for tp table 1 the measurements for tn and tp vary greatly in the literature that may be associated with different locations of sampling sites and time period 2 2 2 pclake 2 2 2 1 model description pclake is an ecosystem model developed for shallow lakes the model dynamically simulates an aquatic food web which includes among other variables phytoplankton macrophytes and zooplankton the model is commonly used to estimate critical nutrient loads of lakes defined as the transition between a clear state with submerged vegetation dominance and turbid state with abundant phytoplankton janse and aldenberg 1990a b critical nutrient loads are lake specific and depend on lake characteristics janssen et al 2015 the model describes the most important ecological interactions in a shallow lake ecosystem to determine what state will prevail pclake describes a well mixed water body and comprises both the water column and the sediment top layer with the most important biotic and abiotic components janse et al 2010 the model is therefore suitable to study shallow non stratifying lakes such as lake dianchi janse and aldenberg 1990a b to test the effect of eutrophication and oligotrophication the model output is evaluated for a range of nutrient loadings and for two different initial conditions clear and turbid the equilibrium output values for chlorophyll a that were reached after 30 years where used to evaluate the state of the system and to determine the critical nutrient load of two distinct regions of the lake caohai and waihai 2 2 2 2 model inputs for pclake there are four types of lake specific settings to parameterize pclake specific lake characteristics nutrients input lake hydrology and sediment type in this study the ratio between the external nutrient loads n and p load were derived from the marina model outcome to perform a bifurcation analysis with a constant n p ratio next the external nutrient loads from marina were used to identify the required nutrient reductions with respect to the critical nutrient load the lake characteristics depth area main wind direction were from liu et al 2004 and in case of fetch based on gis to calculate the length of the lake in the main wind direction sediment characteristics are parameterized using the default settings from pclake for sandy and peaty sediment that are typical for lake dianchi janse and aldenberg 1990a b jeppesen et al 1990 the outflow in pclake is based on the water balance of lake dianchi and is formulated as follow 5 i n f l o w p r e c i p i t a t i o n e v a p o r a t i o n o u t f l o w here water inflow data to the lake from the marina model and precipitation data from zhou et al 2014 were used evaporation records originate from ji et al 2016 therefore 1999 2009 records of evaporation were picked and average by years to get yearly input all lake specific parameters of the model are included in supplementary materials see table b 1 2 2 2 3 model validation we validated the model based on data of the entire lake since the nutrient inputs were only provided lake wide and yearly averaged jin 2003 the yearly average tp and tn loads for dianchi lake where used in combination with an average fetch and water balance next we compared modelled tn and tp concentration with observations from 1988 to 2012 the observed concentrations originate from jin 2003 and zhang et al 2014 our modelled values are generally in line with the observed tn and tp concentrations we calculate about 3 14 7 35 mg l 1 of tn concentration and 0 51 1 02 mg l 1 for tp in lake dianchi these values are in reasonable agreement with caohai 4 42 6 89 mg l 1 for tn concentration and 0 21 0 88 mg l 1 for tp concentration our validation results also indicate that the values of waihai are simulated too high by the model lake dianchi has mainly floating macrophytes and emergent which can take up nutrients and are present especially in waihai a turbid state with high phytoplankton biomass is the typical eutrophication problem in temperate lakes in tropical lakes large floating macrophyte species and in particular the water hyacinths eichhornia crassipes leave little opportunity for animal or plant life with dark and anoxic conditions under them in this study we use the standard settings for pclake which assume 100 biomass submerged macrophytes and in which floating macrophytes were not included probably the effect of the missing floating macrophytes is main cause why we found the values in the validation were reasonable but a bit too high for waihai table 3 3 results first we present river export of dissolved inorganic and organic n and p to lake dianchi from sub basins second we present the main sources of these nutrients in the lake third we discuss the critical loadings for n and p in the lake and to what extent these are exceeded 3 1 nutrient export by rivers to lake dianchi we estimate total dissolved n inputs to lake dianchi from 15 sub basins to be approximately 6209 ton in 2012 fig 3 two thirds of these inputs are din and one third don which is 5124 ton and 1085 ton respectively inputs of din to the lake are five times higher than that of don inputs of total dissolved p to the lake are estimated at about 413 ton in 2012 the share of dip and dop in total dissolved p inputs is 75 and 25 respectively river export of n to the lake was predominantly from sewage systems for din don and synthetic fertilizers for din human waste from sewage systems was the dominant source of din and don export to the lake fig 3 almost one third of din up to 1892 ton year 1 and half of don 651 ton year 1 entering the lake was from sewage synthetic fertilizers contributed around one third to din in rivers about 1473 ton in 2012 atmospheric n deposition and biological n2 fixation are also important sources accounting for 20 1101 ton of total din human waste used as fertilizer was the least important source of din in rivers in addition direct discharge of animal manure and human waste to surface waters are a relatively small source of don contributing around 13 and 2 respectively river export of p to the lake was mainly from point sources including sewage systems for dip direct discharges of animal manure especially for dop and human waste especially for dop and mining for dip human and animal manure which directly discharge to the rivers brought the majority of total dissolved p fig 3 similar to din export human waste from sewage was mainly responsible for a high proportion of dip approximately 54 the amount of dip from human waste was higher than 135 ton in 2012 in contrast direct discharge of animal manure was the dominant source for dop which account for 47 of dop export direct discharge of human waste was the second important source for dop around 33 tons mining added 19 ton of dip to rivers as diffuse source and 44 ton of dip as a point source in 2012 the share of detergents was comparable to the share of directly discharged animal manure in dip export dip export to the lake from synthetic fertilizers was around 17 ton year 1 which was higher than weathering of p contained mineral according to the marina model weathering of p contained mineral 0 01 ton year 1 and dop 0 05 ton year 1 leaching of organic matter hardly contributed dip and dop to the lake 3 2 sources of nutrients in lake dianchi results show strong spatial patterns of nitrogen distribution along the lake from south to north fig 4 the din ranged when expressed per area of watershed from 835 to 4860 kg km 2 year 1 with an average of 1876 kg km 2 year 1 of the 15 sub basins rivers in sub basins daqing and caohai discharge most din per km2 4860 kg km 2 year 1 and 4426 kg km 2 year 1 respectively similar results also found for don export per km2 caohai sub basin 1496 kg km 2 year 1 and daqing sub basin 1567 kg km 2 year 1 are the important contributors to don export to the lake the contribution of the largest sub basin panlong to din and don export was smaller than the contribution of caohai and daqing sub basins the large contribution of the caohai and daqing sub basins can be explained by the intensive urbanization activities see also fig 5 and the net effect of n retentions in soils and rivers in general the largest river exports of dissolved n are projected for the northern areas which have relatively dense populations high per capita gdp and sewage treatment concentration likewise the river export of dissolved p differs largely among sub basins for the year 2012 p exports range from very low to more than 300 kg km 2 year 1 for dip and more than 50 kg km 2 year 1 for dop as for din caohai 337 kg km 2 year 1 daqing 346 kg km 2 year 1 gucheng 350 kg km 2 year 1 and dongda 264 kg km 2 year 1 export generally more dip per km2 than the other sub basins fig 4 the lowest dip exports are quantified for sub basins in the north of dianchi watershed most of which are rural area and low populations the results for dop are different high dop export in the southern area and dongdahe gets the largest dip export which is 62 kg km 2 year 1 the spatial patterns are driven by many factors such as use of n fertilizers livestock and population densities as well as water consumption the caohai and daqing sub basins are densely populated urban areas where human waste in sewage effluents are important sources of din in surface waters in the lake dianchi watershed six major sewage treatment plants have been constructed in the past decade most of which are located in central urban areas including caohai daqing and haihe sub basins interestingly point sources of din are mainly concentrated in the northern sub basins while diffuse source e g fertilizers dominate in the southern also sources of don differ among sub basins don is mainly from direct discharge of n in human excretion in northern sub basins and mainly from direct discharge of animal manure in southern human waste is also a large source of dip but not in all sub basins in urban areas human waste in sewage effluents is the dominant source contributing to almost 60 of total dip mining activities in gucheng dongda and cigang explain the relatively high loadings in southern sub basins for dop the main source is direct discharge of human waste in the northern sub basins meanwhile a direct discharge of animal manure is a dominant source of dop in southern sub basisns especially in cigang 3 3 critical nutrient loadings in lake dianchi the relationship between nutrient input and chlorophyll a of caohai was highly nonlinear the results for coahai show a rather sudden switch between a macrophyte dominated state with low chlorophyll a values and a phytoplankton dominated state with high chlorophyll a concentrations fig 6 moreover the response showed hysteresis so that the critical nutrient load depends on the previous state in which the lake was either clear or turbid the critical load for the switch from turbid to clear as measured per lake area was much lower than the one for the opposite switch viz ca 0 34 and 2 02 mg p m 2 d 1 respectively for caohai the multiple states only occurred in an intermediate range of nutrient loadings at a lower loading than 0 34 mg p m 2 d 1 3 06 mg n m 2 d 1 the system is always macrophyte dominated whereas for higher loading than 2 02 mg p l 1 d 1 it is always dominated by algae according to the marina model the actual p loading of caohai is 28 mg p m 2 d 1 the critical nutrient load for caohai is 0 34 mg p m 2 d 1 which is exceeded 82 times by the actual loads for waihai alternative stable states are not present and the curve is nonlinear without hysteresis therefore the critical p load only slightly depends on human defined limits to the maximum allowable chlorophyll a the water quality of waihai is targeted for class ⅳ that means the authorities aim for a maximum allowable chlorophyll a of 0 03 mg l 1 in the period 2016 2020 environmental quality standard for surface water 2002 based on this information the critical nutrient load for waihai is about 0 38 mg p m 2 d 1 which is exceeded by 17 times compared to the loading from the marina model 6 5 mg p m 2 d 1 4 discussion this is the first study to link the marina model with the pclake model for dianchi lake this combination of models made it possible to provide a comprehensive assessment of nutrient loadings into the lake by source and sub basin and to identify to what extend these loadings exceed the critical nutrient loadings critical nutrient loadings are the levels of nutrients in the lake above which eutrophication problems may occur this information is the first step towards identifying effective solutions for eutrophication problems however the models have uncertainties these uncertainties are often associated with model inputs and parameters for example we made some simplification and assumptions for some of our model inputs e g retentions factors of n and p in rivers aggregation of the county information to the sub basin information we did this because of the data limitation we realize that this may affect the model results however we believe that such uncertainties will not change the main message of our study because our models perform reasonably well for our study area based on the validation results see sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 some studies have already quantified n and p export to lake dianchi but few studies exist on different nutrient forms furthermore studies generally ignore direct discharge of animal manure to the lake therefore the current nutrient pollution of the lake may be underestimated in the existing studies for example we estimate 690 t of p dissolve inorganic phosphorus and dissolve organic phosphorus per year from point sources which is higher than ma and wang 2015 around 370 t year 1 of p when we excluded the impacts of animal manure p inputs by point source is about 544 t which approaches the result of ma and wang 2015 we calculate 826 t year 1 of tp export to lake dianchi in 2012 this is lower than the results of liu et al 2004 for 2000 1693 t year 1 several reasons may explain the difference one of them is in the difference in the studied year we quantify n and p inputs to the lake for the 2012s while liu et al 2004 for 2000 another reason is in the sources of the nutrients in the lake since 2000 the wastewater treatment in sewage systems has been improved gao et al 2014 leading to lower discharges of the nutrients to the lake in our study compared to liu et al 2004 liu et al 2004 assumed that there was no wastewater treatment in rural area in our study we account for treatment in rural as well as in urban areas liu et al 2004 indicate the important of the human waste in lake pollution and may underestimate the importance of fertilizer and manure inputs to land this may overestimate the importance of rural waste for p export by liu et al 2004 the comparison of n2 fixation by crops and tn export to the lake dianchi is in good agreement with the results of gao et al 2015 biological n2 fixation by crops and tn export to the lake dianchi was 295 kg km 2 year 1 and 8000 t year 1 respectively gao et al 2015 in our study these values are 220 kg km 2 year 1 and 7451 t year 1 respectively likewise our results are for the total loads for riverine inputs and atmospheric n deposition are also close to zhan et al 2017 an important difference of our study from the existing studies is that we specify the sources of the riverine inputs of n and p and that we link these n and p inputs to the pclake model for critical nutrient loadings human waste is a major pollution source for lake dianchi in the urban area although the constructed urban area in kunming occupies only around 17 of lake dianchi watershed gao et al 2015 the tn and tp inputs to the lake from the urban area is about half of the total according to the statistical data the population of kunming was 3 28 million in 2012 even if six major sewage treatment plants have been constructed in the last decade and most of them are located in central urban areas all the sewage cannot be collected and treated thoroughly with the high urbanization and the increase of population human waste from sewage systems became the dominant point source in the urban area and imposes strong pressure on lake dianchi agricultural activities have greatly influenced nutrient export of the sub basin and n input from fertilizer was the largest input source overall in the southern watershed of lake dianchi though the government had banned large scale livestock and poultry breeding in the watershed in 2008 by 2012 still some n and p from direct manure discharges may enter the rivers flowing into the lake some manure is used as fertilizer in agriculture the impact of resources mining and processing is serious in the southern area within the lake s watershed there are 14 types of mineral ores of which most are phosphate ores yang et al 2014 about 19 ton of dip as diffuse pollution by mining was discharged into lake dianchi in 2012 some efforts were made in afforestation the newly established forestlands are covered with small trees and many treatment facilities had been built with the high removal efficiencies of p liu et al 2004 the mining of phosphorus resources at the southern sub basins of the lake is trough topsoil stripping and open casting ways these processes caused serious soil erosion the eroded soil containing high phosphorus flushed with runoff through inflow rivers in our study we calculate 63 ton of dip was export to the lake in 2012 resulted from point industrial processing followed by treatment and diffuse mining activities according to the marina model the actual p loading of lake dianchi for caohai and waihai is 28 and 6 5 g p m 2d 1 respectively as we calculated the nutrient loading with marina caohai near kunming city and human waste was the dominant source for n and p that means if we would like to improve the water quality of caohai the best way is to reduce the nutrients inputs from human waste based on the information on nutrient loading from marina the nutrient inputs are largely attributed to agricultural activities in waihai individual farmer s pursuit of high production the application of synthetic fertilizer increased meanwhile the growth of livestock inevitably leads to a great manure surplus and threatens the water quality of waihai generally water quality in caohai is much worse than in waihai in terms of nutrient pollution because of its relatively smaller area and narrow shape the critical nutrient loads for caihai 0 34 mg p m 2 d 1 and for waihai 0 38 mg p m 2 d 1 are rather low compared to 0 9 mg p m 2 d 1 found by janse et al 2010 the explanation is that the lake dianchi is located in a subtropical region where the drainage area of lake dianchi belongs to the wet monsoon climatic belt of the northern sub tropic zone mainly controlled alternately by the southwest monsoon and sub tropic continental air mass warmer conditions have a large effect on the trophic cascade from fish to phytoplankton and the temperatures of lake dianchi are thereby favouring algal growth scheffer and van nes 2007 for these reasons previous studies for the sub tropical lake taihu located near shanghai also found a relative low critical nutrient load of 0 32 0 73 mg p m 2 d 1 janssen et al 2017 to mitigate nutrient pollution in the lake n and p inputs should be controlled and serious efforts need to be put into releasing environmental pressures by local government in order to reduce pollution effectively we advise to divide the watershed into three zones and take different management actions in each 1 urban zone caohai panlong daqing sub basins sewage collection network and sewage treatment plant construction with good treatment efficiencies are needed to reduce nutrient pollution from these sub basins 2 rural zone haihe baoxiang maliao luolong laoyu nanchong yuni baiyu sub basins precision fertilization e g according to crop needs with recycled animal manure is needed to reduce nutrient pollution from these sub basins 3 mining zone gucheng cigang dongba sub basins improvement of productive efficiency and waste re use within the mining sector and phosphate industries should be the future direction 5 conclusion we analyzed nitrogen n and phosphorus p loadings in lake dianchi using two models marina and pclake it showed that linking these models increase the understanding and quantification of nutrient loads and therefor helps to define improvement policies results show that river export of dissolved n and p was high in 2012 about 6209 ton of total dissolved n tdn is exported to the lake of which more than two thirds in the form of dissolved inorganic n for total dissolved p this export is at about 413 ton with the share of dissolved inorganic p at 75 human waste from urbanization is the major pollution source to lake dianchi in northern sub basins agricultural activities are important sources of the nutrients in rivers in southern sub basins p mining and processing is an important source of dissolved inorganic p in the southern sub basins considerable amounts of nutrient inputs are exported to the lake by rivers draining from caohai and daqing sub basins where urbanization is intensive lake dianchi has serious water pollution where eutrophication increasingly deteriorates water quality the actual nutrient loading exceeded the critical loading by 82 times and 17 times of caohai and waihai respectively in 2012 a series of efforts should be taken to reduce nutrients inputs to the lake and improve water quality we highlight that improving sewage treatment and efficient use of fertilizers synthetic and organic are important for reducing nutrient pollution from the northern and southern sub basins in addition it is important to improve environmental performance of the mining industries to reduce p pollution in the lake acknowledgements this study is financially supported by natioal key r d program of china

11247,produced in huge quantities olive mill wastewater omw causes serious environmental problems in the mediterranean basin where olive growing is concentrated the purpose of this study has been to evaluate the short term effects of various omw quantities application on several sorghum bicolor agro physiological and biochemical parameters as well as the effects on the main properties of the amended soils four doses of omw 25 50 75 and 100 m³ haˉ¹ have been applied in comparison to control soil not treated with omw results have showed an improvement of the organic matter total nitrogen and minerals contents in soils treated with omw proportionally to the increase of the doses applied moreover soils microbiological activities have been strongly enhanced in comparison with control soil furthermore the study of the effects of omw on the sorghum bicolor seeds germination has showed that raw omw has blocked germination seeds however various effects on sorghum bicolor seeds germination have been observed for the omw amended soils extracts related to quantities applied an improvement of the main agro physiological and biochemical parameters as stems height stems thickness leaves number leaves circumferences roots lengths plant productivity proteins content and essential minerals elements rates for the plants growing in soil treated with 25 m3 ha 1 omw dose has been reported nevertheless clear inhibitions have been observed for the highest omw doses applied as 75 and 100 m3 ha 1 keywords olive mill wastewater soil sorghum bicolor germination growth 1 introduction adapted to arid climate and water scarcity the olive tree is the most cultivated plant in the mediterranean basin chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 olive oil industry constitutes the most important sector in the mediterranean countries economies especially spain italy tunisia and greece ioc 2015 actually tunisia s olive growing potential is estimated at nearly 90 million trees occupying an area of 1 8 million hectares corresponding to about 79 of the total arboreal area gdap 2015 despite the economic dominance and the agricultural importance of olive growing no one doubts that the olive oil extraction process generates considerable quantities of agro industrial wastes ayoub et al 2014 rusan munir et al 2016 al imoor et al 2017 the olive oil industry in addition to its main product which is olive oil generates massive amounts of bio wastes mainly olive mill wastewater omw and solid olive husk soh barbera et al 2014 buchmann et al 2015 olive mill wastewater omw is the main liquid effluent produced during the olive oil extraction process chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 worldwide more than 30 million tons of olive mill wastewater have been generated annually belaqziz et al 2016 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 in tunisia alone olive oil extraction process generates an average annual production of 0 8 106 cubic meters gdap 2015 omw is a darker liquid characterized by its undesirable odor acidic ph 4 4 5 high salinity and important chemical and biological oxygen demand ben rouina et al 2014 magdich et al 2015 barbara et al 2017 currently mediterranean countries are facing a major environmental problem due to the large amounts of omw produced within a short period three to four months mechri et al 2011 caputo et al 2013 magdich et al 2015 although different remediation methods for omw treatment such as evaporation ponds thermal concentration physico chemicals and biological processes have been proposed roig et al 2006 khoufi et al 2007 kappekalis et al 2008 mekki et al 2012 however the richness of omw in water 83 94 organic matter 4 15 and mineral matter 0 4 2 5 makes from this waste a low cost soil fertilizer as well as a source of irrigation water in mediterranean countries suffering from water scarcity and soil degradation piotrowska et al 2011 caputo et al 2013 di bene et al 2013 mekki et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 in this view several studies have reported positive effects of omw on soil fertility and plants growth barbera et al 2013 have distinguished that omw spreading on top soil may have beneficial effects such as nutrient availability for plant growth moreover chaari et al 2014 2015 have stated that the soil ph electrical conductivity organic matter total nitrogen phosphorus sodium and potassium contents increased with augmented omw rates similarly mekki et al 2013 have identified that the addition of omw did not presented negative effects on initial soil ph but it has increased the soil electrical conductivity ec chartzoulakis et al 2010 have reported that after 3 years of raw omw application there were no significant differences in ph electrical conductivity ec p na and organic rates between the control and omw treated soils other researchers have demonstrated the effects of this effluent in seeds germination and plants growth casa et al 2003 have showed that raw omw has significantly inhibited triticum durum desf seeds germination moreover mekki et al 2006 have examined the effects of omw on five species seeds germination tomato lycopersicon esculentum chickpea cicer arietinum bean vicia faba wheat triticum durum and barley hordeum vulgare and have reported that raw omw has strongly inhibited seeds germination furthermore the results obtained by magdich et al 2015 have showed that the application of omw for six successive years has improved olive productivity and oil quality recently belaqziz et al 2016 have distinguished no negative effects of omw on maize crop despite amelioration in terms of fresh leaves leaf area dry weight and kernel weight have been noted in tunisia water shortage has a serious impact on the local economy mostly based on agriculture gdap 2015 the irregularity and the scarcity of rainfall and the poverty of soils in organic matter have led the tunisian authorities to opt for the use of omw in the agricultural sector as soil fertilizer decree 1306 of february 26 2013 the present work aims to valorize raw omw as an organic fertilizer in a sorghum bicolor cultivation in a sandy soil initially very poor in organic matter and nutrients the short term effects of various omw quantities application on the major characteristics of a sandy soil have been investigated in addition the belongings of omw on several sorghum bicolor agro physiological parameters and the assessment of the plants growth for six months under field conditions have been studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 omw origin and sampling the olive mill wastewater used in this study has been taken from a three phase continuous extraction factory located at sfax tunisia omw homogeneous samples have been brought back to the laboratory for analyses 2 2 olive mill wastewaters characterization the ph and ec have been determined according to a standard method sierra et al 2007 dry matter and moisture contents have been evaluated by drying a fresh sample of omw at 105 c total organic carbon toc and organic matter om have been estimated as the difference between dry matter and the residue after calcinations at 550 c for 4 h total nitrogen has been assessed by kjeldahl method kandeler 1995 the chemical oxygen demand cod has been evaluated according to knechtel 1978 standard method five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 has been determined by the manometric method with a respirometer the exchangeable bases potassium and sodium k and na have been extracted with a nitric acid in ash of dry matter after calcinations for 4 h in 550 by using a flame photometer model pfp7 jenway total phenolic compounds have been determined by using the folin ciocalteau method box 1983 2 3 soil origin description and sampling the used soil has been taken from the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute at sfax tunisia north latitude 34 3 east longitude 10 20 the climate of the region is typical mediterranean the mean annual rainfall is 200 mm with average air temperatures around 27 8 c in summer and 11 1 c in winter soils samples have been taken from one depth 0 20 cm and have been brought back to the laboratory for granulometric and physicochemical analyses fresh soils samples necessary to mineral nitrogen and microbiological analyses have been stored at 4 c for a maximum of 48 h before analysis 2 4 experimental setup soil samples have been well homogenized then distributed in plastic pots the pots used have been 30 cm of diameter and 30 cm of depth each pot has been received 25 kg of control soil just after sampling and has been inoculated with 5 sorghum bicolor seeds the experiment has been carried out under field conditions regarding omw addition four doses have been tested respectively 25 50 75 and 100 m³ ha 1 the omws amounts have been calculated based on the pots surface and not on the pots volume since the doses have been in m³ ha 1 the omws added quantities corresponded to 250 ml 500 ml 750 ml and 1 l omws pot 1 respectively for the doses mentioned above these treatments have been compared to a control soil irrigated with water 5 repetitions for each omw dose in comparison with a control soil irrigated with water so 25 seeds per batch of pots have been installed pots irrigation has been done manually every week at 25 of the soil water retention capacity swrc referred to the water holding capacity soils samplings have been initiated 30 days after the omw application and have been then done monthly up to 150 days according to standard method ohlinger 1995 all control and omw amended soils samples have been air dried sieved at 2 mm and analyzed for granulometric and physico chemical properties soil texture has been determined using the pipette method thomas et al 2012 the soil water retention capacity swrc has been determined gravimetrically by saturating the soil overnight saturate a volume of soil with the same volume of water and let the water percolate all night 12 h ph and electrical conductivity ec have been determined in soil water extract 1 2 5 soil weight volume distillated water and have been measured with ph meter and conductivity meter paredes et al 1987 walkley black method has been used for the soil total organic carbon toc analysis the organic matter om rate has been calculated by the equation om 1 725 x toc majbar et al 2017 total nitrogen has been determined by kjeldahl method kandeler 1995 phosphorus p content has been assessed by olsen and sommers method 1982 the soil cation exchange capacity cec has been evaluated according to standard method ohlinger 1995 soil microbiological enumeration as cultivable aerobic microflora cam fungi f sporulating bacteria sb and total coliforms tc have been determined according to mekki et al 2006 soils respirometric activities have been assessed according to mekki et al 2012 2 5 choice criteria and description of sorghum bicolor sorghum is an herbaceous grass plant grown for its seeds and fodder arvalis 2003 it has a long and strong root system allowing a great resistance to drought for this reason it is mainly grown in arid climates as in the southern mediterranean countries chantereau et al 2013 the sorghum development cycle is relatively short and depending on the weather and watering conditions several harvests can be made in the same year clerget 2004 sorghum seeds are gluten free and rich in proteins dehaynin 2007 in recent years tunisia has significantly developed its livestock especially dairy farming gdap 2015 in this context sorghum presents some very interesting assets in addition this plant is characterized by a sowing period march may which corresponds to that of the omw production which gives it importance to test the omw fertilizing potential in its culture 2 6 omw phytotoxicity assessment phytotoxicity of omw has been assessed by measuring sorghum bicolor seeds germination index zucconi et al 1981 the soils extracts have been obtained from omw treated soils in comparison with unamended soil extract after one month of omw application a control medium with distilled water has been used as reference all samples including the control have been run in triplicate 2 7 plants agro physiological and biochemical parameters measurements after seeds germination only three plants have been kept per pot 15 plants per batch of pots stems height stems thickness leaves number and leaves circumferences have been determined twice every week at the end of plants cycles plants have been harvested root and shoot parts have been separated roots lengths have been measured fresh weights of root and shoot parts have been expected dry weights have been determined at 70 c for 72 h for each part of plants organic nitrogen has been assessed using kjeldahl method kandeler 1995 potassium k calcium ca and sodium na have been evaluated by extraction with nitric acid hno3 in ash after calcinations of dry matter at 550 for 4 h 2 8 statistical analysis for each parameter analyzed for omw soils and plants three replicate have been used all data obtained have been analyzed by the spss statistical software statistical package for the social sciences version 20 differences between mean values have been calculated by analysis of variance anova with a duncan s test at probably level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characteristics of olive mill wastewater the olive mill wastewater chemical characteristics have been presented in table 1 the analysis has showed that omw is an acidic liquid waste ph 4 46 with a high electrical conductivity ec 15 94 ms cm 1 this can be explained by the high amount of salts added to conserve olive before extraction zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 saadi et al 2007 the studied omw has been rich in organic matter om 26 09 g l 1 and in mineral elements especially in potassium k 6 5 g l 1 the content in total nitrogen ntk has been low 0 43 g l 1 what has been explained by the very high c n ratio 35 18 omw pollutant load expressed in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod 60 g l 1 and biological oxygen demand bod5 16 2 g l 1 has been in accordance with the values cited by others researchers khoufi et al 2007 also the studied omw has presented relatively low amounts of phenolic compounds 1 74 g l 1 which has been significantly lower than the values cited by ranalli 1991 and which have been between 3 g l 1 and 9 g l 1 in fact omw phenolic compounds constitute the main origin of its toxicity mekki et al 2013 chaari et al 2014 our results have showed that the omw characteristics variability depends on the various factors like the olive variety the climatic conditions the type of extraction process the use of pesticides and fertilizers and the ripening of olives mechri et al 2011 mekki et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 barbara et al 2017 3 2 control soil characterization soil is the top layer of the earth s surface in which plants can grow consisting of rock and mineral particles mixed with decayed organic matter mekki and sayadi 2017 before omw application the used control soil has been characterized based on the granulometric analysis the studied soil can be classified as sandy soil sand 84 2 clay 14 and silt 1 8 it has an alkaline ph ph 8 76 and a low electrical conductivity ec 348 5 μs cm 1 such ec value has been referred to 1 2 5 soil water ratio this soil has been initially very poor in organic matter content om 3 95 g kg 1dm and has presented very low level of total nitrogen tn 0 027 g kg 1dm and mineral elements k 0 11 g kg 1dm p 0 02 g kg 1dm such results have been consistent with those obtained by abichou et al 2014 who have showed that tunisian soils have deficiencies of organic matter and have presented low nitrogen and phosphorus contents indeed the studied soil has been taken from a region under arid mediterranean climate sfax southern tunisia characterized by the scarcity and irregularity of rain hachicha et al 2006 ben rouina et al 2014 based on these findings the use of omw as organic fertilizer can constitute a potential solution to improve soil fertility and assure plants nutriment availability abichou et al 2014 magdich et al 2016 3 3 effects of omw application on soil physicochemical properties although it s high acidity ph 4 46 the spreading of omw did not remarkably changed the initial ph of the soil in fact a slight decrease in ph has been observed for all omw amended soils soil irrigated with 25 m3 ha 1 s25 soil irrigated with 50 m3 ha 1 s50 soil irrigated with 75 m3 ha 1 s75 and soil irrigated with 100 m3 ha 1 s100 respectively in comparison to the control soil table 2 thus the ph values recorded for the different treatments after 150 incubation days have been always slightly alkaline 7 8 8 2 in this context chaari et al 2015 have noticed no significant difference of the soil ph in response to the application of increasing omw doses moreover chartzoulakis et al 2010 have showed no difference in ph after three years of omw application this can be explained by the buffering capacity of the soil neutralizing the acidity of the omw gargouri et al 2014 chaari et al 2014 in fact the transformation of the carbonates present in the superficial horizon of the soil into bicarbonates allows the neutralization of the omw acidic ph sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2013 on the other hand a significant increase p 0 05 in soils electrical conductivities ec has been observed with the increase of the doses applied as well as in function of the incubation time indeed the soil ec has increased from 348 5 μs cm 1 in the control soil to 726 4 μs cm 1 in the soil s100 after 150 incubation days table 2 thus the electrical conductivity reflects the amount of salts present in the soil solution sierra et al 2007 our results have been in accordance with those obtained by mekki et al 2013 who have noticed that omw application has increased soil ec proportional with the added omw quantities likewise di bene et al 2013 have reported that spreading of omw has induced an increase in soil salinity this increase has been mainly due to salts concentration in the omw chaari et al 2015 also sierra et al 2001 have showed the raise of the soil ec with increasing omw rates and the highest omw dose applied almost duplicate the soil salinity kokkora et al 2015 have noticed a gradual rise of soil ec following the application of increasing quantities of treated omw rich in organic matter 26 09 g l 1 the omw application has improved the contents of soil organic matter comparatively to control soil cs a significant increase of organic matter has been showed relatively to the increase of omw added quantities table 2 however the amount of om has augmented from 3 95 g kg 1dm in the control soil to 14 8 g kg 1dm in soil amended with 100 m³ ha 1 after five months of omw application these results have been consistent with those obtained by previous studies saadi et al 2007 sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2009 chartzoulakis et al 2010 in effect organic matter has strongly modified the soil structure by improving the levels of exchangeable ions abichou et al 2014 the monitoring of the evolution of cation exchange capacity cec of the soils amended by omw has showed an increase of the cec proportionally to the omw applied doses table 2 such increase can be explained by the interactions of added organic molecules with the soil components hence the stimulation of the cationic exchange capacity of the soil mechri et al 2011 abichou et al 2014 in this context many researchers have showed a positive effect of omw application on soil fertilization by enriching organic matter and macronutrients which strongly enhances their cec gargouri et al 2014 ben rouina et al 2014 compared to the control soils spread with omw have retained more water table 2 has showed that the soil water retention capacity swrc has increased with the amount of omw applied in fact the soil that has received omw besides its darker color also becomes less permeable to water infiltration abichou et al 2014 such increase in the swrc can be explained by the effect of the lipid compounds contained in omw that forms mulch which reduced soil water evaporation mekki et al 2006 abichou et al 2014 ben rouina et al 2014 in contrast to their high levels of carbon and phosphorus theomw content in nitrogen has been relatively weak 0 43 g l 1 however a significant p 0 05 increase in total nitrogen has been observed for soils irrigated by omw compared to the control soil table 2 almost constant concentration of soils total nitrogen has been noted throughout the incubation period no significant differences p 0 05 has been recorded over time for different types of soils amended results have showed also that the largest fraction of soils nitrogen has been in organic form for mineral nitrogen low concentrations have been recorded for all soils amended with a significant difference p 0 05 in comparison with the control soil however after 120 incubation days a slight decrease in the n mineral content has been observed in the treated soils data not shown this can be explained by the important growth of cultivated plants then the plants root system has been well developed so they can absorb more nitrogen essentially in the form of nitrate ions n no3 very soluble in water hachicha et al 2006 chaari et al 2015 in line with these findings several studies have showed the beneficial effect of omw on nitrogen soil enrichment mekki et al 2006 sierra et al 2007 mechri et al 2008 chaari et al 2014 however chartzoulakis et al 2010 and gargouri et al 2014 have reported that the contribution of omw to nitrogen soil enrichment remains minor and insignificant compared to other mineral elements k p na compared to the control soil a significant increases in potassium sodium and calcium levels in relation to the added omw quantities table 2 moreover omw has enhanced soil fertility by enriching soil with phosphorus this element has increased from 0 02 g kg 1 dry soil in control soil to 0 038 g kg 1 0 039 g kg 1 and to 0 04 g kg 1 in soil amended with 25 50 75 and 100 m3 ha 1 respectively these results have been consistent to those obtained by chaari et al 2015 who have showed a slight increase in the soil phosphorus after application of gradual omw doses 3 4 effects of omw on soils microbiological activities the omw application effects on the soil microbiological activities have been carried out through i the enumeration of the cultivable aerobic microflora cam the fungi f the sporulating bacteria sb and the total coliforms tc ii through the follow up of the respiratory activity of the different omw amended soils according to the applied doses the incubation time and in comparison with the control soil results have showed that omw amendment has induced a clear increase in the cam number table 2 nevertheless this increase has been not proportional to the dose applied since above the dose 50 m3 ha 1 a decrease in the cam count number for the soils s75 and s100 has been observed such decrease can be explained by the omw higher doses antimicrobial inhibitory effect barbera et al 2013 kavvadias et al 2015 likewise for fungi f the omw addition has induced an enhancement of the soil in these germs although this raise has been clear until the dose 75 m3 ha 1 thus even though fungi are acidophilic and halophilic and can tolerate omw acidity and salinity they are aerobic germs greatly inhibited by omw large amounts that induce an anaerobic environment aviani et al 2009 barbera et al 2014 on the contrary to fungi sporulating bacteria sb have showed a relative proliferation to omw applied doses table 2 indeed sb are known by their sporulation strategy to such stressful conditions as acidity salinity and anaerobiosis buchmann et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 concerning total coliforms tc omw are known by their high antimicrobial and specifically anti pathogenic properties mekki et al 2006 saadi et al 2007 thus the enumeration of these germs has showed their total absence as well in the control soil and in the omw amended soils table 2 monitoring the amended soils microbiological activities provides an overall picture of the capacity of the soil microflora to mineralize the added organic matter hollender et al 2003 dzul puc et al 2005 consequently the evaluation of the cumulative respiratory activity of the different soils has been assessed 3 months after the omw application during 28 days of incubation results have indicated that the om mineralization kinetics as cumulative c co2 has been proportional to the omw doses applied fig 1 however the specific respiration expressed as the c co2 toc ratio has allowed us to assess the capacity of the soil microflora to biodegrade the added om and then the degree of biodegradability of such organic matter mancera lopeza et al 2008 fig 1 has showed an optimum for the s50 respirometric activity explained as c co2 toc ratio and then a decrease in this ratio for the higher omw doses s75 and s100 such findings have confirmed the previous results regarding microflora count evolution in different soils studied and have been in accordance with many previous studies mantzavinos and kalogerakis 2005 yaakoubi et al 2009 mekki et al 2012 barbara et al 2017 3 5 effects of omw on sorghum bicolor germination and growth 3 5 1 omw phytotoxicty assessment various extracts from raw omw control soil irrigated with pure water and omw treated soils have been used in comparison with pure water fig 2 results have showed that even after 48 h the germination index gi in the presence of raw omw has been 0 compared to pure water whose gi has been 100 thus raw omw has blocked the germination of sorghum bicolor and can never be a suitable medium for germination of the tested seeds fig 2 for the control soil extract the gi has been of the order of 109 compared to the water control as regards to the omw irrigated soils extracts the gi has reached the optimum 135 for the s25 extract fig 2 however for the highest doses s75 and s100 extracts a decrease in the gi 53 and 24 for s75 and s100 respectively compared to other doses s25 and s50 and to the water control has been noticed indeed the omw in their raw state have been very phytotoxic komilis et al 2005 mekki et al 2013 nevertheless added to soils the phytotoxicity has decreased and the nutrients contained in these effluents have stimulated the seeds germination mekki et al 2006 saadi et al 2007 yet at high dose s100 the phytotoxicity has been expressed again which has explained the inhibition of some tested seeds germination fig 2 such results have been in agreement with several previous researches which have demonstrated that omw have very phytotoxic effects when applied at large amounts chaari et al 2014 belaqziz et al 2016 magdich et al 2016 3 5 2 effects of omw on sorghum bicolor growth and productivity the effects of the different omw doses applied on the sorghum bicolor growth and productivity have been achieved by monitoring several agro physiological and biochemical parameters such as stems height stems thickness leaves number leaves circumferences roots lengths plant productivity as fresh weight and dry weight proteins content and essential minerals elements rates figs 3 5 as revealed in fig 3 the omw irrigated soils have showed a clear increase in the plants stems length compared to those of control soil the optimum plants growth has been observed for the soil s25 with an average of 107 9 cm as maximum height the minimum stems length 75 8 cm has been recorded for plants grown in the soil s100 this is also valid for the stems thickness which has increased from a mean value of 1 72 cm in the control soil to reach 1 82 cm in the soil s25 then it has decreased to stabilize in the mean of 1 7 cm for the plants grown in soils treated with higher doses s50 s75 and s100 fig 3 this can be due to the phytotoxicity caused by higher omw doses applied chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 the leaves number has showed a slight increase from 12 3 leaves per plant in control soil to 13 leaves per plant in s25 and then this number has decreased to an average number of 11 leaves per plant for the soils s50 s75 and s100 similarly for leaves circumferences which have showed an optimum 69 63 cm for the plants grown in the s25 compared to those in control soil 63 25 cm and plants grown in soils s50 48 2 cm s75 41 77 cm and s100 30 82 cm such results have confirmed previous findings concerning germination indexes which have been optimal in s25 extract and has decreased in the higher doses this can be also explained by the high load of om and mineral elements brought by the higher omw doses which in turn mainly exerts a saline stress affecting leaves plant growth buchmann et al 2015 al imoor et al 2017 fig 6 as regards to the effects of omw on the sorghum plants biomass productivity in terms of fresh biomass g plant 1 dry biomass g plant 1 and dry weight fresh weight ratio the results have clearly showed that plants grown in the soil s25 have presented the optimal productivity compared to control plants fig 4 while for plants grown in greater doses a gradual decrease in their productivities compared to control plants and those of s25 has been distinguished thus the lowest productivity has been recorded for plants grown in the soil s100 fig 4 this can be explained by the high salinity of the omw dose applied which can exert phytotoxic and nutritional disturbances for the soil plant interactions barbera et al 2014 kavvadias et al 2015 belaqziz et al 2016 barbara et al 2017 the rhizosphere is the soil compartment where the roots are located and an environment of flows of matter and energy between the soil and the plant cleyet marel and hinsinger 2000 the monitoring of the tested plants roots lengths has showed a maximum roots length for plants grown in the soil s25 which confirms the previous findings related to stems and leaves development fig 3 the roots lengthening have decreased with the increase of omw applied doses compared to control soil fig 3 in line with these results proteins levels have showed an optimum amount in plants grown in the s25 also for the aerial part 42 68 mg g 1 dry matter for the roots part 39 05 mg g 1 dry matter and so for the total proteins content 81 54 mg g 1 dry matter fig 4 such omw dose has offered the optimal om quantity necessary for the growth and the multiplication of the rhizospheric microflora saadi et al 2007 mekki et al 2013 alternatively the analysis of the principal mineral elements k ca and na in the various plants cultivated has showed the harmful effects of the omw large doses applied indeed and in contrast to the other parameters studied the contents of these mineral elements also in the aerial parts as in the roots parts have increased gradually as a function of the increase of the applied doses fig 5 also the maximum values of the different mineral elements studied have been recorded in plants grown in the s100 fig 5 this has explained the phytotoxic effects of such omw over dose on the plants growth and productivity and which has been due essentially to the high salinity caused brunetti et al 2007 buchmann et al 2015 chaari et al 2015 barbara et al 2017 4 conclusion this work has aimed to the search for a solution for the depollution and valorization of the main olive oil industry biowaste as olive mill wastewaters omw such agro waste constitutes a serious environmental problem for all olive oil producing countries however at the same time omw can constitutes a strong fertilizing potential for countries suffering from water scarcity and soil organic matter poverty as the case for tunisia our results have showed that the amendment of sandy soil by different omw doses has strongly enhanced its physicochemical properties in terms of organic matter nitrogen and potassium significant proliferations of the soil microbiological activity have been noticed in proportion to the increase of omw doses applied the monitoring of the soil respirometric activity has revealed that the addition of omw at a dose of 50 m3 ha 1 has significantly improved its biological activity correlated with the enrichment of the soil with organic matter and microflora besides results have showed that raw omw has completely blocked sorghum bicolor seeds germination whereas omw treated soil extracts have stimulated germination compared to control soil extract the growth and productivity of the sorghum bicolor plants have been greatly improved in omw amended soils indeed although the 50 m3 ha 1 dose has been the most adequate to the soil characteristics amelioration the results have showed that the 25 m3 ha 1 dose has constituted the best appropriate omw dose to the sorghum bicolor vegetative development and productivity acknowledgements this work has been carried out in the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia the facilities and services of the direction of the institute and the staff of the experimental station are gratefully acknowledged 
11247,produced in huge quantities olive mill wastewater omw causes serious environmental problems in the mediterranean basin where olive growing is concentrated the purpose of this study has been to evaluate the short term effects of various omw quantities application on several sorghum bicolor agro physiological and biochemical parameters as well as the effects on the main properties of the amended soils four doses of omw 25 50 75 and 100 m³ haˉ¹ have been applied in comparison to control soil not treated with omw results have showed an improvement of the organic matter total nitrogen and minerals contents in soils treated with omw proportionally to the increase of the doses applied moreover soils microbiological activities have been strongly enhanced in comparison with control soil furthermore the study of the effects of omw on the sorghum bicolor seeds germination has showed that raw omw has blocked germination seeds however various effects on sorghum bicolor seeds germination have been observed for the omw amended soils extracts related to quantities applied an improvement of the main agro physiological and biochemical parameters as stems height stems thickness leaves number leaves circumferences roots lengths plant productivity proteins content and essential minerals elements rates for the plants growing in soil treated with 25 m3 ha 1 omw dose has been reported nevertheless clear inhibitions have been observed for the highest omw doses applied as 75 and 100 m3 ha 1 keywords olive mill wastewater soil sorghum bicolor germination growth 1 introduction adapted to arid climate and water scarcity the olive tree is the most cultivated plant in the mediterranean basin chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 olive oil industry constitutes the most important sector in the mediterranean countries economies especially spain italy tunisia and greece ioc 2015 actually tunisia s olive growing potential is estimated at nearly 90 million trees occupying an area of 1 8 million hectares corresponding to about 79 of the total arboreal area gdap 2015 despite the economic dominance and the agricultural importance of olive growing no one doubts that the olive oil extraction process generates considerable quantities of agro industrial wastes ayoub et al 2014 rusan munir et al 2016 al imoor et al 2017 the olive oil industry in addition to its main product which is olive oil generates massive amounts of bio wastes mainly olive mill wastewater omw and solid olive husk soh barbera et al 2014 buchmann et al 2015 olive mill wastewater omw is the main liquid effluent produced during the olive oil extraction process chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 worldwide more than 30 million tons of olive mill wastewater have been generated annually belaqziz et al 2016 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 in tunisia alone olive oil extraction process generates an average annual production of 0 8 106 cubic meters gdap 2015 omw is a darker liquid characterized by its undesirable odor acidic ph 4 4 5 high salinity and important chemical and biological oxygen demand ben rouina et al 2014 magdich et al 2015 barbara et al 2017 currently mediterranean countries are facing a major environmental problem due to the large amounts of omw produced within a short period three to four months mechri et al 2011 caputo et al 2013 magdich et al 2015 although different remediation methods for omw treatment such as evaporation ponds thermal concentration physico chemicals and biological processes have been proposed roig et al 2006 khoufi et al 2007 kappekalis et al 2008 mekki et al 2012 however the richness of omw in water 83 94 organic matter 4 15 and mineral matter 0 4 2 5 makes from this waste a low cost soil fertilizer as well as a source of irrigation water in mediterranean countries suffering from water scarcity and soil degradation piotrowska et al 2011 caputo et al 2013 di bene et al 2013 mekki et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 in this view several studies have reported positive effects of omw on soil fertility and plants growth barbera et al 2013 have distinguished that omw spreading on top soil may have beneficial effects such as nutrient availability for plant growth moreover chaari et al 2014 2015 have stated that the soil ph electrical conductivity organic matter total nitrogen phosphorus sodium and potassium contents increased with augmented omw rates similarly mekki et al 2013 have identified that the addition of omw did not presented negative effects on initial soil ph but it has increased the soil electrical conductivity ec chartzoulakis et al 2010 have reported that after 3 years of raw omw application there were no significant differences in ph electrical conductivity ec p na and organic rates between the control and omw treated soils other researchers have demonstrated the effects of this effluent in seeds germination and plants growth casa et al 2003 have showed that raw omw has significantly inhibited triticum durum desf seeds germination moreover mekki et al 2006 have examined the effects of omw on five species seeds germination tomato lycopersicon esculentum chickpea cicer arietinum bean vicia faba wheat triticum durum and barley hordeum vulgare and have reported that raw omw has strongly inhibited seeds germination furthermore the results obtained by magdich et al 2015 have showed that the application of omw for six successive years has improved olive productivity and oil quality recently belaqziz et al 2016 have distinguished no negative effects of omw on maize crop despite amelioration in terms of fresh leaves leaf area dry weight and kernel weight have been noted in tunisia water shortage has a serious impact on the local economy mostly based on agriculture gdap 2015 the irregularity and the scarcity of rainfall and the poverty of soils in organic matter have led the tunisian authorities to opt for the use of omw in the agricultural sector as soil fertilizer decree 1306 of february 26 2013 the present work aims to valorize raw omw as an organic fertilizer in a sorghum bicolor cultivation in a sandy soil initially very poor in organic matter and nutrients the short term effects of various omw quantities application on the major characteristics of a sandy soil have been investigated in addition the belongings of omw on several sorghum bicolor agro physiological parameters and the assessment of the plants growth for six months under field conditions have been studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 omw origin and sampling the olive mill wastewater used in this study has been taken from a three phase continuous extraction factory located at sfax tunisia omw homogeneous samples have been brought back to the laboratory for analyses 2 2 olive mill wastewaters characterization the ph and ec have been determined according to a standard method sierra et al 2007 dry matter and moisture contents have been evaluated by drying a fresh sample of omw at 105 c total organic carbon toc and organic matter om have been estimated as the difference between dry matter and the residue after calcinations at 550 c for 4 h total nitrogen has been assessed by kjeldahl method kandeler 1995 the chemical oxygen demand cod has been evaluated according to knechtel 1978 standard method five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 has been determined by the manometric method with a respirometer the exchangeable bases potassium and sodium k and na have been extracted with a nitric acid in ash of dry matter after calcinations for 4 h in 550 by using a flame photometer model pfp7 jenway total phenolic compounds have been determined by using the folin ciocalteau method box 1983 2 3 soil origin description and sampling the used soil has been taken from the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute at sfax tunisia north latitude 34 3 east longitude 10 20 the climate of the region is typical mediterranean the mean annual rainfall is 200 mm with average air temperatures around 27 8 c in summer and 11 1 c in winter soils samples have been taken from one depth 0 20 cm and have been brought back to the laboratory for granulometric and physicochemical analyses fresh soils samples necessary to mineral nitrogen and microbiological analyses have been stored at 4 c for a maximum of 48 h before analysis 2 4 experimental setup soil samples have been well homogenized then distributed in plastic pots the pots used have been 30 cm of diameter and 30 cm of depth each pot has been received 25 kg of control soil just after sampling and has been inoculated with 5 sorghum bicolor seeds the experiment has been carried out under field conditions regarding omw addition four doses have been tested respectively 25 50 75 and 100 m³ ha 1 the omws amounts have been calculated based on the pots surface and not on the pots volume since the doses have been in m³ ha 1 the omws added quantities corresponded to 250 ml 500 ml 750 ml and 1 l omws pot 1 respectively for the doses mentioned above these treatments have been compared to a control soil irrigated with water 5 repetitions for each omw dose in comparison with a control soil irrigated with water so 25 seeds per batch of pots have been installed pots irrigation has been done manually every week at 25 of the soil water retention capacity swrc referred to the water holding capacity soils samplings have been initiated 30 days after the omw application and have been then done monthly up to 150 days according to standard method ohlinger 1995 all control and omw amended soils samples have been air dried sieved at 2 mm and analyzed for granulometric and physico chemical properties soil texture has been determined using the pipette method thomas et al 2012 the soil water retention capacity swrc has been determined gravimetrically by saturating the soil overnight saturate a volume of soil with the same volume of water and let the water percolate all night 12 h ph and electrical conductivity ec have been determined in soil water extract 1 2 5 soil weight volume distillated water and have been measured with ph meter and conductivity meter paredes et al 1987 walkley black method has been used for the soil total organic carbon toc analysis the organic matter om rate has been calculated by the equation om 1 725 x toc majbar et al 2017 total nitrogen has been determined by kjeldahl method kandeler 1995 phosphorus p content has been assessed by olsen and sommers method 1982 the soil cation exchange capacity cec has been evaluated according to standard method ohlinger 1995 soil microbiological enumeration as cultivable aerobic microflora cam fungi f sporulating bacteria sb and total coliforms tc have been determined according to mekki et al 2006 soils respirometric activities have been assessed according to mekki et al 2012 2 5 choice criteria and description of sorghum bicolor sorghum is an herbaceous grass plant grown for its seeds and fodder arvalis 2003 it has a long and strong root system allowing a great resistance to drought for this reason it is mainly grown in arid climates as in the southern mediterranean countries chantereau et al 2013 the sorghum development cycle is relatively short and depending on the weather and watering conditions several harvests can be made in the same year clerget 2004 sorghum seeds are gluten free and rich in proteins dehaynin 2007 in recent years tunisia has significantly developed its livestock especially dairy farming gdap 2015 in this context sorghum presents some very interesting assets in addition this plant is characterized by a sowing period march may which corresponds to that of the omw production which gives it importance to test the omw fertilizing potential in its culture 2 6 omw phytotoxicity assessment phytotoxicity of omw has been assessed by measuring sorghum bicolor seeds germination index zucconi et al 1981 the soils extracts have been obtained from omw treated soils in comparison with unamended soil extract after one month of omw application a control medium with distilled water has been used as reference all samples including the control have been run in triplicate 2 7 plants agro physiological and biochemical parameters measurements after seeds germination only three plants have been kept per pot 15 plants per batch of pots stems height stems thickness leaves number and leaves circumferences have been determined twice every week at the end of plants cycles plants have been harvested root and shoot parts have been separated roots lengths have been measured fresh weights of root and shoot parts have been expected dry weights have been determined at 70 c for 72 h for each part of plants organic nitrogen has been assessed using kjeldahl method kandeler 1995 potassium k calcium ca and sodium na have been evaluated by extraction with nitric acid hno3 in ash after calcinations of dry matter at 550 for 4 h 2 8 statistical analysis for each parameter analyzed for omw soils and plants three replicate have been used all data obtained have been analyzed by the spss statistical software statistical package for the social sciences version 20 differences between mean values have been calculated by analysis of variance anova with a duncan s test at probably level p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characteristics of olive mill wastewater the olive mill wastewater chemical characteristics have been presented in table 1 the analysis has showed that omw is an acidic liquid waste ph 4 46 with a high electrical conductivity ec 15 94 ms cm 1 this can be explained by the high amount of salts added to conserve olive before extraction zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 saadi et al 2007 the studied omw has been rich in organic matter om 26 09 g l 1 and in mineral elements especially in potassium k 6 5 g l 1 the content in total nitrogen ntk has been low 0 43 g l 1 what has been explained by the very high c n ratio 35 18 omw pollutant load expressed in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod 60 g l 1 and biological oxygen demand bod5 16 2 g l 1 has been in accordance with the values cited by others researchers khoufi et al 2007 also the studied omw has presented relatively low amounts of phenolic compounds 1 74 g l 1 which has been significantly lower than the values cited by ranalli 1991 and which have been between 3 g l 1 and 9 g l 1 in fact omw phenolic compounds constitute the main origin of its toxicity mekki et al 2013 chaari et al 2014 our results have showed that the omw characteristics variability depends on the various factors like the olive variety the climatic conditions the type of extraction process the use of pesticides and fertilizers and the ripening of olives mechri et al 2011 mekki et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 barbara et al 2017 3 2 control soil characterization soil is the top layer of the earth s surface in which plants can grow consisting of rock and mineral particles mixed with decayed organic matter mekki and sayadi 2017 before omw application the used control soil has been characterized based on the granulometric analysis the studied soil can be classified as sandy soil sand 84 2 clay 14 and silt 1 8 it has an alkaline ph ph 8 76 and a low electrical conductivity ec 348 5 μs cm 1 such ec value has been referred to 1 2 5 soil water ratio this soil has been initially very poor in organic matter content om 3 95 g kg 1dm and has presented very low level of total nitrogen tn 0 027 g kg 1dm and mineral elements k 0 11 g kg 1dm p 0 02 g kg 1dm such results have been consistent with those obtained by abichou et al 2014 who have showed that tunisian soils have deficiencies of organic matter and have presented low nitrogen and phosphorus contents indeed the studied soil has been taken from a region under arid mediterranean climate sfax southern tunisia characterized by the scarcity and irregularity of rain hachicha et al 2006 ben rouina et al 2014 based on these findings the use of omw as organic fertilizer can constitute a potential solution to improve soil fertility and assure plants nutriment availability abichou et al 2014 magdich et al 2016 3 3 effects of omw application on soil physicochemical properties although it s high acidity ph 4 46 the spreading of omw did not remarkably changed the initial ph of the soil in fact a slight decrease in ph has been observed for all omw amended soils soil irrigated with 25 m3 ha 1 s25 soil irrigated with 50 m3 ha 1 s50 soil irrigated with 75 m3 ha 1 s75 and soil irrigated with 100 m3 ha 1 s100 respectively in comparison to the control soil table 2 thus the ph values recorded for the different treatments after 150 incubation days have been always slightly alkaline 7 8 8 2 in this context chaari et al 2015 have noticed no significant difference of the soil ph in response to the application of increasing omw doses moreover chartzoulakis et al 2010 have showed no difference in ph after three years of omw application this can be explained by the buffering capacity of the soil neutralizing the acidity of the omw gargouri et al 2014 chaari et al 2014 in fact the transformation of the carbonates present in the superficial horizon of the soil into bicarbonates allows the neutralization of the omw acidic ph sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2013 on the other hand a significant increase p 0 05 in soils electrical conductivities ec has been observed with the increase of the doses applied as well as in function of the incubation time indeed the soil ec has increased from 348 5 μs cm 1 in the control soil to 726 4 μs cm 1 in the soil s100 after 150 incubation days table 2 thus the electrical conductivity reflects the amount of salts present in the soil solution sierra et al 2007 our results have been in accordance with those obtained by mekki et al 2013 who have noticed that omw application has increased soil ec proportional with the added omw quantities likewise di bene et al 2013 have reported that spreading of omw has induced an increase in soil salinity this increase has been mainly due to salts concentration in the omw chaari et al 2015 also sierra et al 2001 have showed the raise of the soil ec with increasing omw rates and the highest omw dose applied almost duplicate the soil salinity kokkora et al 2015 have noticed a gradual rise of soil ec following the application of increasing quantities of treated omw rich in organic matter 26 09 g l 1 the omw application has improved the contents of soil organic matter comparatively to control soil cs a significant increase of organic matter has been showed relatively to the increase of omw added quantities table 2 however the amount of om has augmented from 3 95 g kg 1dm in the control soil to 14 8 g kg 1dm in soil amended with 100 m³ ha 1 after five months of omw application these results have been consistent with those obtained by previous studies saadi et al 2007 sierra et al 2007 mekki et al 2009 chartzoulakis et al 2010 in effect organic matter has strongly modified the soil structure by improving the levels of exchangeable ions abichou et al 2014 the monitoring of the evolution of cation exchange capacity cec of the soils amended by omw has showed an increase of the cec proportionally to the omw applied doses table 2 such increase can be explained by the interactions of added organic molecules with the soil components hence the stimulation of the cationic exchange capacity of the soil mechri et al 2011 abichou et al 2014 in this context many researchers have showed a positive effect of omw application on soil fertilization by enriching organic matter and macronutrients which strongly enhances their cec gargouri et al 2014 ben rouina et al 2014 compared to the control soils spread with omw have retained more water table 2 has showed that the soil water retention capacity swrc has increased with the amount of omw applied in fact the soil that has received omw besides its darker color also becomes less permeable to water infiltration abichou et al 2014 such increase in the swrc can be explained by the effect of the lipid compounds contained in omw that forms mulch which reduced soil water evaporation mekki et al 2006 abichou et al 2014 ben rouina et al 2014 in contrast to their high levels of carbon and phosphorus theomw content in nitrogen has been relatively weak 0 43 g l 1 however a significant p 0 05 increase in total nitrogen has been observed for soils irrigated by omw compared to the control soil table 2 almost constant concentration of soils total nitrogen has been noted throughout the incubation period no significant differences p 0 05 has been recorded over time for different types of soils amended results have showed also that the largest fraction of soils nitrogen has been in organic form for mineral nitrogen low concentrations have been recorded for all soils amended with a significant difference p 0 05 in comparison with the control soil however after 120 incubation days a slight decrease in the n mineral content has been observed in the treated soils data not shown this can be explained by the important growth of cultivated plants then the plants root system has been well developed so they can absorb more nitrogen essentially in the form of nitrate ions n no3 very soluble in water hachicha et al 2006 chaari et al 2015 in line with these findings several studies have showed the beneficial effect of omw on nitrogen soil enrichment mekki et al 2006 sierra et al 2007 mechri et al 2008 chaari et al 2014 however chartzoulakis et al 2010 and gargouri et al 2014 have reported that the contribution of omw to nitrogen soil enrichment remains minor and insignificant compared to other mineral elements k p na compared to the control soil a significant increases in potassium sodium and calcium levels in relation to the added omw quantities table 2 moreover omw has enhanced soil fertility by enriching soil with phosphorus this element has increased from 0 02 g kg 1 dry soil in control soil to 0 038 g kg 1 0 039 g kg 1 and to 0 04 g kg 1 in soil amended with 25 50 75 and 100 m3 ha 1 respectively these results have been consistent to those obtained by chaari et al 2015 who have showed a slight increase in the soil phosphorus after application of gradual omw doses 3 4 effects of omw on soils microbiological activities the omw application effects on the soil microbiological activities have been carried out through i the enumeration of the cultivable aerobic microflora cam the fungi f the sporulating bacteria sb and the total coliforms tc ii through the follow up of the respiratory activity of the different omw amended soils according to the applied doses the incubation time and in comparison with the control soil results have showed that omw amendment has induced a clear increase in the cam number table 2 nevertheless this increase has been not proportional to the dose applied since above the dose 50 m3 ha 1 a decrease in the cam count number for the soils s75 and s100 has been observed such decrease can be explained by the omw higher doses antimicrobial inhibitory effect barbera et al 2013 kavvadias et al 2015 likewise for fungi f the omw addition has induced an enhancement of the soil in these germs although this raise has been clear until the dose 75 m3 ha 1 thus even though fungi are acidophilic and halophilic and can tolerate omw acidity and salinity they are aerobic germs greatly inhibited by omw large amounts that induce an anaerobic environment aviani et al 2009 barbera et al 2014 on the contrary to fungi sporulating bacteria sb have showed a relative proliferation to omw applied doses table 2 indeed sb are known by their sporulation strategy to such stressful conditions as acidity salinity and anaerobiosis buchmann et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 concerning total coliforms tc omw are known by their high antimicrobial and specifically anti pathogenic properties mekki et al 2006 saadi et al 2007 thus the enumeration of these germs has showed their total absence as well in the control soil and in the omw amended soils table 2 monitoring the amended soils microbiological activities provides an overall picture of the capacity of the soil microflora to mineralize the added organic matter hollender et al 2003 dzul puc et al 2005 consequently the evaluation of the cumulative respiratory activity of the different soils has been assessed 3 months after the omw application during 28 days of incubation results have indicated that the om mineralization kinetics as cumulative c co2 has been proportional to the omw doses applied fig 1 however the specific respiration expressed as the c co2 toc ratio has allowed us to assess the capacity of the soil microflora to biodegrade the added om and then the degree of biodegradability of such organic matter mancera lopeza et al 2008 fig 1 has showed an optimum for the s50 respirometric activity explained as c co2 toc ratio and then a decrease in this ratio for the higher omw doses s75 and s100 such findings have confirmed the previous results regarding microflora count evolution in different soils studied and have been in accordance with many previous studies mantzavinos and kalogerakis 2005 yaakoubi et al 2009 mekki et al 2012 barbara et al 2017 3 5 effects of omw on sorghum bicolor germination and growth 3 5 1 omw phytotoxicty assessment various extracts from raw omw control soil irrigated with pure water and omw treated soils have been used in comparison with pure water fig 2 results have showed that even after 48 h the germination index gi in the presence of raw omw has been 0 compared to pure water whose gi has been 100 thus raw omw has blocked the germination of sorghum bicolor and can never be a suitable medium for germination of the tested seeds fig 2 for the control soil extract the gi has been of the order of 109 compared to the water control as regards to the omw irrigated soils extracts the gi has reached the optimum 135 for the s25 extract fig 2 however for the highest doses s75 and s100 extracts a decrease in the gi 53 and 24 for s75 and s100 respectively compared to other doses s25 and s50 and to the water control has been noticed indeed the omw in their raw state have been very phytotoxic komilis et al 2005 mekki et al 2013 nevertheless added to soils the phytotoxicity has decreased and the nutrients contained in these effluents have stimulated the seeds germination mekki et al 2006 saadi et al 2007 yet at high dose s100 the phytotoxicity has been expressed again which has explained the inhibition of some tested seeds germination fig 2 such results have been in agreement with several previous researches which have demonstrated that omw have very phytotoxic effects when applied at large amounts chaari et al 2014 belaqziz et al 2016 magdich et al 2016 3 5 2 effects of omw on sorghum bicolor growth and productivity the effects of the different omw doses applied on the sorghum bicolor growth and productivity have been achieved by monitoring several agro physiological and biochemical parameters such as stems height stems thickness leaves number leaves circumferences roots lengths plant productivity as fresh weight and dry weight proteins content and essential minerals elements rates figs 3 5 as revealed in fig 3 the omw irrigated soils have showed a clear increase in the plants stems length compared to those of control soil the optimum plants growth has been observed for the soil s25 with an average of 107 9 cm as maximum height the minimum stems length 75 8 cm has been recorded for plants grown in the soil s100 this is also valid for the stems thickness which has increased from a mean value of 1 72 cm in the control soil to reach 1 82 cm in the soil s25 then it has decreased to stabilize in the mean of 1 7 cm for the plants grown in soils treated with higher doses s50 s75 and s100 fig 3 this can be due to the phytotoxicity caused by higher omw doses applied chaari et al 2015 magdich et al 2016 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 the leaves number has showed a slight increase from 12 3 leaves per plant in control soil to 13 leaves per plant in s25 and then this number has decreased to an average number of 11 leaves per plant for the soils s50 s75 and s100 similarly for leaves circumferences which have showed an optimum 69 63 cm for the plants grown in the s25 compared to those in control soil 63 25 cm and plants grown in soils s50 48 2 cm s75 41 77 cm and s100 30 82 cm such results have confirmed previous findings concerning germination indexes which have been optimal in s25 extract and has decreased in the higher doses this can be also explained by the high load of om and mineral elements brought by the higher omw doses which in turn mainly exerts a saline stress affecting leaves plant growth buchmann et al 2015 al imoor et al 2017 fig 6 as regards to the effects of omw on the sorghum plants biomass productivity in terms of fresh biomass g plant 1 dry biomass g plant 1 and dry weight fresh weight ratio the results have clearly showed that plants grown in the soil s25 have presented the optimal productivity compared to control plants fig 4 while for plants grown in greater doses a gradual decrease in their productivities compared to control plants and those of s25 has been distinguished thus the lowest productivity has been recorded for plants grown in the soil s100 fig 4 this can be explained by the high salinity of the omw dose applied which can exert phytotoxic and nutritional disturbances for the soil plant interactions barbera et al 2014 kavvadias et al 2015 belaqziz et al 2016 barbara et al 2017 the rhizosphere is the soil compartment where the roots are located and an environment of flows of matter and energy between the soil and the plant cleyet marel and hinsinger 2000 the monitoring of the tested plants roots lengths has showed a maximum roots length for plants grown in the soil s25 which confirms the previous findings related to stems and leaves development fig 3 the roots lengthening have decreased with the increase of omw applied doses compared to control soil fig 3 in line with these results proteins levels have showed an optimum amount in plants grown in the s25 also for the aerial part 42 68 mg g 1 dry matter for the roots part 39 05 mg g 1 dry matter and so for the total proteins content 81 54 mg g 1 dry matter fig 4 such omw dose has offered the optimal om quantity necessary for the growth and the multiplication of the rhizospheric microflora saadi et al 2007 mekki et al 2013 alternatively the analysis of the principal mineral elements k ca and na in the various plants cultivated has showed the harmful effects of the omw large doses applied indeed and in contrast to the other parameters studied the contents of these mineral elements also in the aerial parts as in the roots parts have increased gradually as a function of the increase of the applied doses fig 5 also the maximum values of the different mineral elements studied have been recorded in plants grown in the s100 fig 5 this has explained the phytotoxic effects of such omw over dose on the plants growth and productivity and which has been due essentially to the high salinity caused brunetti et al 2007 buchmann et al 2015 chaari et al 2015 barbara et al 2017 4 conclusion this work has aimed to the search for a solution for the depollution and valorization of the main olive oil industry biowaste as olive mill wastewaters omw such agro waste constitutes a serious environmental problem for all olive oil producing countries however at the same time omw can constitutes a strong fertilizing potential for countries suffering from water scarcity and soil organic matter poverty as the case for tunisia our results have showed that the amendment of sandy soil by different omw doses has strongly enhanced its physicochemical properties in terms of organic matter nitrogen and potassium significant proliferations of the soil microbiological activity have been noticed in proportion to the increase of omw doses applied the monitoring of the soil respirometric activity has revealed that the addition of omw at a dose of 50 m3 ha 1 has significantly improved its biological activity correlated with the enrichment of the soil with organic matter and microflora besides results have showed that raw omw has completely blocked sorghum bicolor seeds germination whereas omw treated soil extracts have stimulated germination compared to control soil extract the growth and productivity of the sorghum bicolor plants have been greatly improved in omw amended soils indeed although the 50 m3 ha 1 dose has been the most adequate to the soil characteristics amelioration the results have showed that the 25 m3 ha 1 dose has constituted the best appropriate omw dose to the sorghum bicolor vegetative development and productivity acknowledgements this work has been carried out in the experimental station taous of the olive tree institute of sfax tunisia the facilities and services of the direction of the institute and the staff of the experimental station are gratefully acknowledged

water requirements are interchangeably used with evapotranspiration et a measurable or estimated hydrological parameter reference et et0 is the maximum possible et that can occur from a well watered standard vegetation surface for given meteorological conditions united nations food and agriculture organization irrigation and drainage paper guidelines fao 56 are widely adopted in estimating the crop water requirements allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 liu and luo 2010 fao 56 relates crop evapotranspiration e t a with e t 0 through crop coefficient k c given by allen et al 1998 1 e t a k c e t o methods for estimating e t 0 can be grouped into i mass transfer models such as dalton meyer penman djaman et al 2017 valipour et al 2017 ii radiation models such as priestley taylor ritchie tabari et al 2013 iii temperature based models such as hargreaves smani blaney criddle bormann 2011 muniandy et al 2016 valipour et al 2017 and iv pan evaporation models grismer et al 2002 zuo et al 2016 nevertheless each method has advantages and application limitations in terms of data requirement accuracy simulation period and global validity numerous studies across the world have concluded that fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 that combines energy and mass balance approaches is the most accurate reliable and standard method in estimating e t 0 djaman et al 2015 pandey et al 2016 sentelhas et al 2010 tabari et al 2011 following eq 1 e t a can be estimated from e t 0 using the scaling factor i e crop coefficient k c that accounts for soil crop phenological and management conditions fao 56 uses two approaches to define this scaling factor viz i single crop coefficient k c that considers the integrated effect of soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t averaged over each growing season and ii dual crop coefficient that is further portioned into soil evaporation coefficient k e and basal crop coefficient in the presence of water stress k c b k e allen et al 1988 in spite of readily available crop coefficient curves defined for a number of crops considering standard and non standard conditions e t a estimation from fao 56 guidelines suffers from the following drawbacks i season specific e t a data need to be adjusted and validated considering local agro climatic conditions ii crop coefficients are averaged over each growth stage and hence neglect intra seasonal variability iii influence of water saving strategies on the dynamics of e t a cannot be readily evaluated and iv ignorance of health of the tree can hamper management strategies when applied to diseased trees commonly used methods for quantification of e t a include soil water balance bodner et al 2007 senay et al 2011 bowen ratio energy balance inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 malek 1993 lysimeters liu and luo 2010 miranda et al 2006 and micro meteorological techniques including ec er raki et al 2009 peddinti et al 2018 even though diurnal e t a variations are obtained these methods can not partition e t a and hence limit their applications mostly to single crop coefficient analysis gowda et al 2008 a number of studies have concluded that dual crop coefficient technique outperforms its counterpart in estimating e t a for a wide range of cropping systems like maize wheat citrus pecans er raki et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 ibraimo et al 2016 under different water conservating strategies including drip irrigation plastic or organic mulching partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation anderson et al 2017 direct measurement of e and t fluxes using micro lysimetry liu et al 2002 and sap flow techniques rana et al 2005 are expensive and time consuming hence limit their role to performance evaluation and validation of estimation methods of the available indirect methods for partitioning et fluxes methods based on micro meteorological measurements and hydrological balance are more common zhao et al 2015 globally india ranks fourth in

india is the leading producer of mandarin oranges citrus reticulata accounting for 40 of country s production with a yield of 6 tons ha far below the nation s average peddinti et al 2018 low crop yield in vidarbha region is chiefly attributed to i improper management activities assisted with erratic rainfall patterns and ii propagation of a water mold disease root rot gummosis phytophthora spp the disease propagation has a strong correlation with soil moisture and temperature choudhari et al 2018 savita and avinash 2012 irrigation in excess of crop water demand increases soil moisture within the rhizosphere a condition favorable for further growth of disease causing bacteria sub optimal irrigation strategies result in increased water stress thereby reducing root water uptake and crop yield hence an accurate assessment of citrus crop water requirements is not only important from irrigation scheduling viewpoint but also in managing and controlling the disease choudhari et al 2018 peddinti et al 2018 this research is aimed at understanding the dynamics of crop water requirements in citrus orchards of central india tower based ec flux measurements were collected at high frequency for one crop cycle to develop diurnal and seasonal k c curves and adjust the fao 56 specified crop coefficients applicable to the region dual crop coefficients k e and k c b k s were analyzed using water balance and flux partitioning techniques the water balance was performed separately for soil evaporation and root zone layers using simdualkc model ec flux partitioning was done by cross correlating stomatal photosynthesis and transpiration and non stomatal respiration and evaporation exchanges of high frequency co2 and h2o concentrations using flux variance similarity theory intermodel comparison for dual crop coefficients was performed using residual statistical indicators applicability of the two models to partition e t a is further validated using the measured

crop characteristics within the flux footprint were observed to be homogeneous for at least 500 m in the prevailing wind direction and hence the measured fluxes are considered to be representative of

solving for the energy balance ratio ebr the ec tower had a reasonable energy closure error r2 0 86 with a slope of 0 74 and ebr of 1 22 fig 1 these quality indices are within limits commonly found with fluxnet sites wilson 2002 conceição et al 2017 and hence the flux measurements are considered to be reliable during the crop period lack of perfect energy balance closure can be attributed to the ignorance of canopy heat storage and photosynthetic radiative energy er raki et al 2009 2 3 single crop coefficient approach the fao 56 penman monteith combined equation allen et al 1998 monteith 1965

crop cycle the daily k c values were averaged over each growth stage to represent seasonal k c values that are in line with fao 56 specified coefficients additionally weekly 7 day averaged k c curves were developed for ease with the management and scheduling operations 2 4 dual crop coefficient approach sustainable irrigation strategies in water scarce regions aim at improving t at the expense of e and hence demand for the partition of et fluxes for critical evaluation dual crop coefficient approach proposed by allen et al 1998 is accepted as a standard method to partition et fluxes in the absence of measured data phogat et al 2016 under water full condition e t a from dual crop coefficient approach is given by allen et al 1998 3 e t a k c b k e e t o where k e is soil evaporation coefficient and k c b is basal crop coefficient when the available soil water in the root zone drops below a critical level crop water stress can occur to reduce e t a given by 4 e t a k s k c b k e e t 0 where ks is crop water stress that can be estimated either by considering root zone moisture depletion rosa et al 2012 or by measuring soil suction at the root zone feddes et al 1978 the intricacy in the estimation of e and t fluxes and adjustment of individual coefficients to suit local agro climatic conditions makes dual crop coefficient approach to be computationally intensive 2 5 a simdualkc model simdualkc model applies fao 56 version of dual crop coefficient approach to partition e t a fluxes by considering non standard conditions allen et al 1998 2005 the model can separate evaporation from the soil wetted by precipitation and irrigation thus improving the accuracy of computations rosa et al 2012 soil water balance model in the upper root zone is performed at daily scale using a traditional bulk layer model allen et al 1998 2005 5 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c d p i where dr is root zone depletion at the end of day i ro is surface runoff i is irrigation depth cr is capillary rise from groundwater table e t a is actual crop et and dp is deep percolation to the bottom of root zone all in length units for the study region return flows are insignificant and depth to water table is much below the root zone and hence ro and cr components were neglected the model initiates with fao 56 tabulated basal crop coefficients k c b and progressively corrects k c b considering local climatic soil crop and management conditions evaporation coefficient k e is computed by applying daily water balance for the top soil layer that is characterized by depth and evaporable water pereira et al 2015 additionally soil water stress ks is computed by considering the amount of available water within the effective root zone allen et al 1998 2005 the model requires climate fig 2 crop phenology initial crop coefficients root zone characteristics etc soil table 1 and management irrigation scheduling fraction wetted by irrigation parameters a number of studies have concluded that when calibrated against soil water content swc observations in field crops and orchards the performance of simdualkc model can be significantly improved pereira et al 2015 wu et al 2015 we conducted time lapse three dimensional 3d ert at selective trees to capture root zone soil moisture profiles for use with model calibration ert data quality was improved by considering stacking and reciprocal measurements sreeparvathy et al 2018 for a detailed description of simdualkc model description and working the reader is advised to refer rosa et al 2012 2016 2 6 b ec fp model we adopted flux variance similarity theory proposed by scanlon and sahu 2008 to convert high frequency co2 and h2o concentrations into individual stomatal and non stomatal fluxes in the presence of leaf level water use efficiency wue scanlon and sahu 2008 scanlon and kustas 2010 this theory is based on the fundamental hypothesis that i stomatal carbon and water fluxes are negatively correlated ρcp qt 1 with slope equal to wue ii non stomatal carbon and water fluxes are positively correlated ρcr qe 1 and iii combined stomatal and non stomatal fluxes that contribute to ec tower measurements are negatively correlated with slope deviating from wue the model first establishes the relation between photosynthetic carbon variance σ c p 2 and cross correlation between stomatal and non stomatal

respectively the perturbation of vertical wind speed evaporation transpiration respiration and photosynthetic fluxes from their respective means the overbar signifies the time average 30 min set of individual fluxes obtained for each combination of σ c p 2 and ρ c p c r were narrowed down subjected to the constraints that are meaningful during daytime measurements a more detail description of the analytical procedure is given in scanlon and sahu 2008 following anderson et al 2017 half hourly partitioned fluxes e and t were averaged over each day to obtain the daily fractions of

transpiration measurements daily evaporation from bare soil was measured using four micro lysimeters installed within the flux tower fetch lysimeters are made of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes having wall thinness of 2 mm and consist of two concentric open cylinders of length 20 cm with diameters of 15 cm and 18 cm the inner cylinder is capable of moving in and out for sample collection whereas the outer cylinder is permanently buried to prevent possible soil collapse facchi et al 2017 liu et al 2002 bottom of the inner cylinder is screened to prevent the loss of soil during sampling evett et al 1995 facchi et al 2017 cumulative daily soil evaporation from each lysimeter is estimated by gravimetric method using high precision electronic balance and the average of four is reported plant transpiration was measured using sfm1 sap flow meters ict international armidale nsw australia that are placed in four citrus trees located within the flux tower fetch sap flow meter utilizes heat ratio method hrm to measure high low and reverse sap flows using a set of three measurement needles having 35 mm stainless steel probes placed at 5 mm spacing barron gafford et al 2017 we installed sap flow sensors at tree trunk above the ground surface and monitored the fluxes at 15 min interval a cumulative daily average of all four sap flow measurements was reported for use with analysis 2 8 inter model comparison and performance evaluation performance of simdualkc and ec fp models to bifurcate et fluxes is evaluated using goodness of fit indicators including coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and index of agreement di qiu et al 2015 direct measurement of e and t fluxes using micro lysimeters and sap flow measurements at four tree locations were used in performance evaluation additionally simdualkc derived soil moistures were compared with ert derived moistures under water unlimited after irrigation and water stress before irrigation conditions 3 results and discussion this section first discusses the role of site specific meteorological parameters on e t 0 estimates diurnal and seasonal variations in k c obtained from ec flux data were discussed in relation to crop phenology applicability of soil water balance and ec fp models to partition eta fluxes were evaluated and validated considering direct measurements of e and t for ease with analysis and implementing management practices we considered four growth seasons viz initial doy 62 to 115 crop development doy 116 to 148 mid season doy 149 to 325 and late season doy 326 to 365 3 1 meteorological conditions and reference et weather data was collected at 30 min interval using slow response sensors mounted at a height of 5 m and averaged for each day dynamics of key meteorological parameters contributing to e t 0 during the crop period mar dec are represented in fig 2 at a daily scale both solar radiation and air temperature patterns are in synchronous with e t 0 variability the gap between rhmax and rhmin is high during the initial and crop development stages leading to high vapour pressure deficit vpd and thus the evaporative demand a high wind speed 2 m s during crop development stage is replacing the evaporable layer with dry air thereby increasing vpd and hence e t 0 temporal patterns of e t 0 fig 3 were observed to be similar to that of a semi arid savanna climate found elsewhere er raki et al 2009 characterized by high climatic demand in excess of precipitation annual average rainfall 500 mm is much lower than average crop water requirement i e k c x e t 0 792 mm indicating the necessity to irrigate citrus orchards to avoid water stress and reduced crop productivity er raki et al 2009 during the crop period daily e t 0 was varied from 1 2 mm day harvest to 8 1 mm day crop development with an average of 4 3 mm day and a total of 1300 mm maximum e t 0 during crop development stage doy 116 to 148 is in congruence with the period of highest radiation and air temperature seasonal dynamics conclude that e t 0 is rapidly increasing during initial and crop development stages followed by a gradual decrease towards the harvest 3 2 dynamics of single crop coefficient single k c values published in fao 56 for citrus orchards allen et al 1998 need to be adjusted to suit local agro climatic conditions and account for management activities muniandy et al 2016 variability in k c at scales ranging from daily to weekly to seasonal are provided in fig 4 during initial and crop development stages fao 56 has significantly overestimated the crop coefficients low k c values during these periods can be due to conscious water stressing of the plants being practiced in the study region to initiate blooming despite a few rain spells crop development stage has recorded lower k c during the development stage due to high atmospheric demand e t 0 during mid and late seasons fao 56 has significantly underestimated the crop coefficients high k c values are due to increased precipitation events and the highest leaf area that translates into maximum water use mahohoma 2016 the percentage difference in seasonal k c ranges from 16 mid season to 62 initial stage also we observed an increase in citrus crop coefficient during mid season similar to annual crops which is contradicting with fao 56 published values specific to mrig bahar farmers of the region intentionally water stress the crops during summer months initial stage that helps in rapid blooming with fruit development and growth stages coinciding with the monsoon hence the highest discrepancy in seasonal k c from fao 56 was observed during initial to mid seasons overall deviation in k c throughout the crop cycle can be attributed to semi arid tropical climate conditions plant physiological characteristics and management activities practiced in the region as on farm management activities are being practiced at scales between daily to seasonal we developed k c curves by considering weekly aggregates fig 4 a wide range of seasonal crop coefficients in citrus trees have been reported by various researchers across the globe in tropical to dry climates of usa seasonal crop coefficients during initial mid and late seasons were reported as 0 80 0 22 0 87 0 14 and 0 91 0 13 fares et al 2008 hoffman et al 1982 rogers et al 1983 snyder and o connell 2007 van bavel et al 1967 in tropical to temperate climates of brazil seasonal citrus crop coefficients were reported as 0 55 0 24 0 51 0 18 and 0 62 0 12 alves et al 2007 marin and angelocci 2011 in mediterranean climates of spain seasonal crop coefficients were reported as 0 39 0 13 0 87 0 17 and 0 91 0 09 castel et al 1987 romero et al 2006 villalobos et al 2009 seasonal crop coefficients for citrus orchards obtained in this study 0 43 0 78 0 80 were in agreement with the published reports typical to tropical savanna climate and fao 56 specified values except for the initial growth stage 3 3 dynamics of dual crop coefficient variation in simdulakc simulated soil water content swc within the root zone is represented in fig 5 scanty rainfall and intentional water stressing of the crop during initial stages has resulted in low soil moisture just above the wilting point following this period water is readily available for plant growth due to supplemental irrigation abundant rain during mid season doy 180 230 has resulted in swc to be slightly more than field capacity resulting in waterlogged conditions even though irrigation was ceased before harvesting increased rain spells have prevented water stress conditions spatial distribution of ert derived soil moisture lumped over the root zone was considered to represent the soil moisture observations peddinti et al 2018 throughout the crop period simulated swc is well in agreement with the observed moistures r2 0 81 rmse 0 021 cm3 cm 3 n 27 with a low bias 2 13 of estimation the residuals oi pi of the estimated swc were found to be small and stationary with a mean and variance of 0 008 and 0 0003 respectively diurnal variation in basal crop coefficients k c b k s and their seasonal averages adjusted to local agro climatic conditions resulting from simdualkc and ec fp models are presented in fig 6 three stage kcb values from simdualkc and ec fp methods were found to be 0 18 0 57 0 63 and 0 26 0 51 0 59 respectively simdualkc simulated mid and late season kcb curves are well in agreement with fao 56 tabulated values as the deviation from the standard conditions is minimal the discrepancy between the two model results is mainly attributed to the fundamental difference in the methodology adopted and data requirement while partitioning et fluxes during initial and crop development stages fao 56 specified k c b values were significantly higher than the region specific coefficients this is due to the antithetical treatment conditions being followed within the study area an increase in daily k e at the expense of k c b from simdualkc model during initial stage is in congruence with the high water stress experienced by the plants as simdualkc model starts with fao 56 dataset and progressively updates to suit local conditions their seasonal means were less departed from fao 56 tabulated k c values accumulated e t a for the entire crop cycle from simdualkc and ec fp models are 1008 mm and 725 mm respectively low crop water requirement resulting from ec fp is attributed to the inability of model to find a solution to eq 9 a and 9 b for a few days of the crop period in comparison to simdualkc ec fp model has overestimated k c b during the initial stage by 44 and underestimated during mid and harvest stages by about 11 and 7 respectively the contribution of e and t fluxes to measured daily eta values from the two methods is represented in fig 7 maximum daily e t a from ec fp method 5 4 mm day is slightly lower than from simdualkc approach 5 8 mm day partitioning results are deviating between the two methods particularly during the initial stage the fraction of e and t to total et fluxes during the crop cycle using simdualkc and ec fp methods are 38 62 and 33 66 respectively the contribution of t to et fluxes is significantly high during mid and harvest seasons it can be observed that ec fp method was failed to obtain a solution during mid season resulting in few data gaps doy 160 to 170 and 230 to 240 the basal crop coefficients obtained in this study using simdualkc and ec fp methods are in agreement with the published literature except for the initial stage er raki et al 2009 observed the three stage basal crop coefficients for the citrus orchards in morocco under flood and drip irrigation system to be 0 3 05 0 4 and 0 35 0 55 0 45 respectively alves et al 2007 have been reported that the k c b for young lime orchards citrus latifolia tanaka were varying from 0 4 to 1 0 in the tropical to temperate climates of brazil 3 4 performance evaluation goodness of fit indicators play a crucial role in evaluating the performance of various modeling strategies in replicating field conditions most of these indicators work on model simulated deviations known as errors for a set of observations more description on goodness of indictors can be found in pereira et al 2015 the ability of two models viz simdualkc and ec fp to bifurcate e t a fluxes is evaluated by comparing with field measurements fig 8 simdualkc has outperformed ec fp model in simulating t fluxes during mid and late growth stages both models are well reproducing the measured e and t fluxes with r2 0 5 and d 0 8 bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration were measured using micro lysimeter and sap flow meter at four trees within the study area for use with model comparison if the deviation in measured e and t fluxes is within 10 of cluster mean the data is included in performance evaluation a total of 6 performance indicators table 2 were considered in this study it can be concluded that both methods are reliable in partitioning the eta fluxes for the study region however ability of simdualkc to couple with a crop yield model can aid in evaluating the role of water saving strategies on crop water productivity 4 conclusions the objective of this study is to model crop water requirements and develop single and dual crop coefficients

different conscious water stressing of the crop to initiate blooming during initial stages has resulted in low crop coefficients both methods are reliable in partitioning eta fluxes however the ability of simdualkc to couple with a crop model is recommended for use in evaluating the role of water saving strategies acknowledgement this research is carried as a part of itra water project that

11248,accurate quantification of crop water demand and characterizing its temporal variability is essential in evaluating the role of water saving strategies for sustainable production representing

organize irrigation amount and timing ii maximize crop yield and iii minimize water losses and crop stress anderson et al 2017 in semi arid developing countries like india optimal irrigation

water requirements are interchangeably used with evapotranspiration et a measurable or estimated hydrological parameter reference et et0 is the maximum possible et that can occur from a well watered standard vegetation surface for given meteorological conditions united nations food and agriculture organization irrigation and drainage paper guidelines fao 56 are widely adopted in estimating the crop water requirements allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 liu and luo 2010 fao 56 relates crop evapotranspiration e t a with e t 0 through crop coefficient k c given by allen et al 1998 1 e t a k c e t o methods for estimating e t 0 can be grouped into i mass transfer models such as dalton meyer penman djaman et al 2017 valipour et al 2017 ii radiation models such as priestley taylor ritchie tabari et al 2013 iii temperature based models such as hargreaves smani blaney criddle bormann 2011 muniandy et al 2016 valipour et al 2017 and iv pan evaporation models grismer et al 2002 zuo et al 2016 nevertheless each method has advantages and application limitations in terms of data requirement accuracy simulation period and global validity numerous studies across the world have concluded that fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 that combines energy and mass balance approaches is the most accurate reliable and standard method in estimating e t 0 djaman et al 2015 pandey et al 2016 sentelhas et al 2010 tabari et al 2011 following eq 1 e t a can be estimated from e t 0 using the scaling factor i e crop coefficient k c that accounts for soil crop phenological and management conditions fao 56 uses two approaches to define this scaling factor viz i single crop coefficient k c that considers the integrated effect of soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t averaged over each growing season and ii dual crop coefficient that is further portioned into soil evaporation coefficient k e and basal crop coefficient in the presence of water stress k c b k e allen et al 1988 in spite of readily available crop coefficient curves defined for a number of crops considering standard and non standard conditions e t a estimation from fao 56 guidelines suffers from the following drawbacks i season specific e t a data need to be adjusted and validated considering local agro climatic conditions ii crop coefficients are averaged over each growth stage and hence neglect intra seasonal variability iii influence of water saving strategies on the dynamics of e t a cannot be readily evaluated and iv ignorance of health of the tree can hamper management strategies when applied to diseased trees commonly used methods for quantification of e t a include soil water balance bodner et al 2007 senay et al 2011 bowen ratio energy balance inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 malek 1993 lysimeters liu and luo 2010 miranda et al 2006 and micro meteorological techniques including ec er raki et al 2009 peddinti et al 2018 even though diurnal e t a variations are obtained these methods can not partition e t a and hence limit their applications mostly to single crop coefficient analysis gowda et al 2008 a number of studies have concluded that dual crop coefficient technique outperforms its counterpart in estimating e t a for a wide range of cropping systems like maize wheat citrus pecans er raki et al 2009 zhao et al 2013 ibraimo et al 2016 under different water conservating strategies including drip irrigation plastic or organic mulching partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation anderson et al 2017 direct measurement of e and t fluxes using micro lysimetry liu et al 2002 and sap flow techniques rana et al 2005 are expensive and time consuming hence limit their role to performance evaluation and validation of estimation methods of the available indirect methods for partitioning et fluxes methods based on micro meteorological measurements and hydrological balance are more common zhao et al 2015 globally india ranks fourth in

india is the leading producer of mandarin oranges citrus reticulata accounting for 40 of country s production with a yield of 6 tons ha far below the nation s average peddinti et al 2018 low crop yield in vidarbha region is chiefly attributed to i improper management activities assisted with erratic rainfall patterns and ii propagation of a water mold disease root rot gummosis phytophthora spp the disease propagation has a strong correlation with soil moisture and temperature choudhari et al 2018 savita and avinash 2012 irrigation in excess of crop water demand increases soil moisture within the rhizosphere a condition favorable for further growth of disease causing bacteria sub optimal irrigation strategies result in increased water stress thereby reducing root water uptake and crop yield hence an accurate assessment of citrus crop water requirements is not only important from irrigation scheduling viewpoint but also in managing and controlling the disease choudhari et al 2018 peddinti et al 2018 this research is aimed at understanding the dynamics of crop water requirements in citrus orchards of central india tower based ec flux measurements were collected at high frequency for one crop cycle to develop diurnal and seasonal k c curves and adjust the fao 56 specified crop coefficients applicable to the region dual crop coefficients k e and k c b k s were analyzed using water balance and flux partitioning techniques the water balance was performed separately for soil evaporation and root zone layers using simdualkc model ec flux partitioning was done by cross correlating stomatal photosynthesis and transpiration and non stomatal respiration and evaporation exchanges of high frequency co2 and h2o concentrations using flux variance similarity theory intermodel comparison for dual crop coefficients was performed using residual statistical indicators applicability of the two models to partition e t a is further validated using the measured

phytophthora spp and planted at 5 m spacing water requirement of citrus trees is generally met through flood system during flowering and early growth stages for the ease with fertilizer application

ground water board 2013 2 2 eddy covariance data collection and processing ec flux tower was installed to measure fast and slow response meteorological parameters during the crop cycle doy 62 365 2017 carbon co2 water h2o fluxes were measured at 5 m height using an open path fast response infrared gas analyzer irgason eb ic campbell sci inc usa and a 3d sonic anemometer flux data was sampled at 10

crop characteristics within the flux footprint were observed to be homogeneous for at least 500 m in the prevailing wind direction and hence the measured fluxes are considered to be representative of

solving for the energy balance ratio ebr the ec tower had a reasonable energy closure error r2 0 86 with a slope of 0 74 and ebr of 1 22 fig 1 these quality indices are within limits commonly found with fluxnet sites wilson 2002 conceição et al 2017 and hence the flux measurements are considered to be reliable during the crop period lack of perfect energy balance closure can be attributed to the ignorance of canopy heat storage and photosynthetic radiative energy er raki et al 2009 2 3 single crop coefficient approach the fao 56 penman monteith combined equation allen et al 1998 monteith 1965

crop cycle the daily k c values were averaged over each growth stage to represent seasonal k c values that are in line with fao 56 specified coefficients additionally weekly 7 day averaged k c curves were developed for ease with the management and scheduling operations 2 4 dual crop coefficient approach sustainable irrigation strategies in water scarce regions aim at improving t at the expense of e and hence demand for the partition of et fluxes for critical evaluation dual crop coefficient approach proposed by allen et al 1998 is accepted as a standard method to partition et fluxes in the absence of measured data phogat et al 2016 under water full condition e t a from dual crop coefficient approach is given by allen et al 1998 3 e t a k c b k e e t o where k e is soil evaporation coefficient and k c b is basal crop coefficient when the available soil water in the root zone drops below a critical level crop water stress can occur to reduce e t a given by 4 e t a k s k c b k e e t 0 where ks is crop water stress that can be estimated either by considering root zone moisture depletion rosa et al 2012 or by measuring soil suction at the root zone feddes et al 1978 the intricacy in the estimation of e and t fluxes and adjustment of individual coefficients to suit local agro climatic conditions makes dual crop coefficient approach to be computationally intensive 2 5 a simdualkc model simdualkc model applies fao 56 version of dual crop coefficient approach to partition e t a fluxes by considering non standard conditions allen et al 1998 2005 the model can separate evaporation from the soil wetted by precipitation and irrigation thus improving the accuracy of computations rosa et al 2012 soil water balance model in the upper root zone is performed at daily scale using a traditional bulk layer model allen et al 1998 2005 5 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c d p i where dr is root zone depletion at the end of day i ro is surface runoff i is irrigation depth cr is capillary rise from groundwater table e t a is actual crop et and dp is deep percolation to the bottom of root zone all in length units for the study region return flows are insignificant and depth to water table is much below the root zone and hence ro and cr components were neglected the model initiates with fao 56 tabulated basal crop coefficients k c b and progressively corrects k c b

concluded that when calibrated against soil water content swc observations in field crops and orchards the performance of simdualkc model can be significantly improved pereira et al 2015 wu et al 2015 we conducted time lapse three dimensional 3d ert at selective trees to capture root zone soil moisture profiles for use with model calibration ert data quality was improved by considering stacking and reciprocal measurements sreeparvathy et al 2018 for a detailed description of simdualkc model description and working the reader is advised to refer rosa et al 2012 2016 2 6 b ec fp model we adopted flux variance similarity theory proposed by scanlon and sahu 2008 to convert high frequency co2 and h2o concentrations into individual stomatal and non stomatal fluxes in the presence of leaf level water use efficiency wue scanlon and sahu 2008 scanlon and kustas 2010 this theory is based on the fundamental hypothesis that i stomatal carbon and water fluxes are negatively correlated ρcp qt 1 with slope equal to wue ii non stomatal carbon and water fluxes are positively correlated ρcr qe 1 and iii combined stomatal and non stomatal fluxes that contribute to ec tower measurements are negatively correlated with slope deviating from wue the model first establishes the relation between photosynthetic carbon variance σ c p 2 and cross correlation between stomatal and non stomatal

individual fluxes obtained for each combination of σ c p 2 and ρ c p c r were narrowed down subjected to the constraints that are meaningful during daytime measurements a more detail description of the analytical procedure is given in scanlon and sahu 2008 following anderson et al 2017 half hourly partitioned fluxes e and t were averaged over each day to obtain the daily fractions of

wall thinness of 2 mm and consist of two concentric open cylinders of length 20 cm with diameters of 15 cm and 18 cm the inner cylinder is capable of moving in and out for sample collection whereas the outer cylinder is permanently buried to prevent possible soil collapse facchi et al 2017 liu et al 2002 bottom of the inner cylinder is screened to prevent the loss of soil during sampling evett et al 1995 facchi et al 2017 cumulative daily soil evaporation from each lysimeter is estimated by gravimetric method using high precision electronic balance and the average of four is reported plant transpiration was measured using sfm1 sap flow meters ict international armidale nsw australia that are placed in four citrus trees located within the flux tower fetch sap flow meter utilizes heat ratio method hrm to measure high low and reverse sap flows using a set of three measurement needles having 35 mm stainless steel probes placed at 5 mm spacing barron gafford et al 2017 we installed sap flow sensors at tree trunk above the ground surface and monitored the fluxes at 15 min interval a cumulative daily average of all four sap flow measurements was reported for use with analysis 2 8 inter model comparison and performance evaluation performance of simdualkc and ec fp models to bifurcate et fluxes is evaluated using goodness of fit indicators including coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and index of agreement di qiu et al 2015 direct measurement of e and t fluxes using micro lysimeters and sap flow measurements at four tree locations were used in performance evaluation additionally simdualkc derived soil moistures were compared with ert derived moistures under water unlimited after irrigation and water stress before irrigation conditions 3 results and discussion this section first discusses the role of site specific meteorological parameters on e t 0 estimates diurnal and seasonal variations in k c obtained from ec flux data were discussed in relation to crop phenology applicability of soil water balance and ec fp models to partition eta fluxes were evaluated and validated considering direct measurements of e and t for ease with analysis and implementing management practices we considered four growth seasons viz initial doy 62 to 115 crop development doy 116 to 148 mid season doy 149 to 325 and late season doy 326 to 365 3 1 meteorological conditions and reference et weather data was collected at 30 min interval using slow response sensors mounted at a height of 5 m and averaged for each day dynamics of key meteorological parameters contributing to e t 0 during the crop period mar dec are represented in fig 2 at a daily scale both solar radiation and air temperature patterns are in synchronous with e t 0 variability the gap between rhmax and rhmin is high during the initial and crop development stages leading to high vapour pressure deficit vpd and thus the evaporative demand a high wind speed 2 m s during crop development stage is replacing the evaporable layer with dry air thereby increasing vpd and hence e t 0 temporal patterns of e t 0 fig 3 were observed to be similar to that of a semi arid savanna climate found elsewhere er raki et al 2009 characterized by high climatic demand in excess of precipitation annual average rainfall 500 mm is much lower than average crop water requirement i e k c x e t 0 792 mm indicating the necessity to irrigate citrus orchards to avoid water stress and reduced crop productivity er raki et al 2009 during the crop period daily e t 0 was varied from 1 2 mm day harvest to 8 1 mm day crop development with an average of 4 3 mm day and a total of 1300 mm maximum e t 0 during crop development stage doy 116 to 148 is in congruence with the period of highest radiation and air temperature seasonal dynamics conclude that e t 0 is rapidly increasing during initial and crop development stages followed by a gradual decrease towards the harvest 3 2 dynamics of single crop coefficient single k c values published in fao 56 for citrus orchards allen et al 1998 need to be adjusted to suit local agro climatic conditions and account for management activities muniandy et al 2016 variability in k c at scales ranging from daily to weekly to seasonal are provided in fig 4 during initial and crop development stages fao 56 has significantly overestimated the crop coefficients low k c values during these periods can be due to conscious water stressing of the plants being practiced in the study region to initiate blooming despite a few rain spells crop development stage has recorded lower k c during the development stage due to high atmospheric demand e t 0 during mid and late seasons fao 56 has significantly underestimated the crop coefficients high k c values are due to increased precipitation events and the highest leaf area that translates into maximum water use mahohoma 2016 the percentage difference in seasonal k c ranges from 16 mid season to 62 initial stage also we observed an increase in citrus crop coefficient during mid season similar to annual crops which is contradicting with fao 56 published values specific to mrig bahar farmers of the region intentionally water stress the crops during summer months initial stage that helps in rapid blooming with fruit development and growth stages coinciding with the monsoon hence the highest discrepancy in seasonal k c from fao 56 was observed during initial to mid seasons overall deviation in k c throughout the crop cycle can be attributed to semi arid tropical climate conditions plant physiological characteristics and management activities practiced in the region as on farm management activities are being practiced at scales between daily to seasonal we developed k c curves by considering weekly aggregates fig 4 a wide range of seasonal crop coefficients in citrus trees have been reported by various researchers across the globe in tropical to dry climates of usa seasonal crop coefficients during initial mid and late seasons were reported as 0 80 0 22 0 87 0 14 and 0 91 0 13 fares et al 2008 hoffman et al 1982 rogers et al 1983 snyder and o connell 2007 van bavel et al 1967 in tropical to temperate climates of brazil seasonal citrus crop coefficients were reported as 0 55 0 24 0 51 0 18 and 0 62 0 12 alves et al 2007 marin and angelocci 2011 in mediterranean climates of spain seasonal crop coefficients were reported as 0 39 0 13 0 87 0 17 and 0 91 0 09 castel et al 1987 romero et al 2006 villalobos et al 2009 seasonal crop coefficients for citrus orchards obtained in this study 0 43 0 78 0 80 were in agreement with the published reports typical to tropical savanna climate and fao 56 specified values except for the initial growth stage 3 3 dynamics of dual crop coefficient variation in simdulakc simulated soil water content swc within the root zone is represented in fig 5 scanty rainfall and intentional water stressing of the crop during initial stages has resulted in low soil moisture just above the wilting point following this period water is readily available for plant growth due to supplemental irrigation abundant rain during mid season doy 180 230 has resulted in swc to be slightly more than field capacity resulting in waterlogged conditions even though irrigation was ceased before harvesting increased rain spells have prevented water stress conditions spatial distribution of ert derived soil moisture lumped over the root zone was considered to represent the soil moisture observations peddinti et al 2018 throughout the crop period simulated swc is well in agreement with the observed moistures r2 0 81 rmse 0 021 cm3 cm 3 n 27 with a low bias 2 13 of estimation the residuals oi pi of the estimated swc were found to be small and stationary with a mean and variance of 0 008 and 0 0003 respectively diurnal variation in basal crop coefficients k c b k s and their seasonal averages adjusted to local agro climatic conditions resulting from simdualkc and ec fp models are presented in fig 6 three stage kcb values from simdualkc and ec fp methods were found to be 0 18 0 57 0 63 and 0 26 0 51 0 59 respectively simdualkc simulated mid and late season kcb curves are well in agreement with fao 56 tabulated values as the deviation from the standard conditions is minimal the discrepancy between the two model results is mainly attributed to the fundamental difference in the methodology adopted and data requirement while partitioning et fluxes during initial and crop development stages fao 56 specified k c b values were significantly higher than the region specific coefficients this is due to the antithetical treatment conditions being followed within the study area an increase in daily k e at the expense of k c b from simdualkc model during initial stage is in congruence with the high water stress experienced by the plants as simdualkc model starts with fao 56 dataset and progressively updates to suit local conditions their seasonal means were less departed from fao 56 tabulated k c values accumulated e t a for the entire crop cycle from simdualkc and ec fp models are 1008 mm and 725 mm respectively low crop water requirement resulting from ec fp is attributed to the inability of model to find a solution to eq 9 a and 9 b for a few days of the crop period in comparison to simdualkc ec fp model has overestimated k c b during the initial stage by 44 and underestimated during mid and harvest stages by about 11 and 7 respectively the contribution of e and t fluxes to measured daily eta values from the two methods is represented in fig 7 maximum daily e t a from ec fp method 5 4 mm day is slightly lower than from simdualkc approach 5 8 mm day partitioning results are deviating between the two methods particularly during the initial stage the fraction of e and t to total et fluxes during the crop cycle using simdualkc and ec fp methods are 38 62 and 33 66 respectively the contribution of t to et fluxes is significantly high during mid and harvest seasons it can be observed that ec fp method was failed to obtain a solution during mid season resulting in few data gaps doy 160 to 170 and 230 to 240 the basal crop coefficients obtained in this study using simdualkc and ec fp methods are in agreement with the published literature except for the initial stage er raki et al 2009 observed the three stage basal crop coefficients for the citrus orchards in morocco under flood and drip irrigation system to be 0 3 05 0 4 and 0 35 0 55 0 45 respectively alves et al 2007 have been reported that the k c b for young lime orchards citrus latifolia tanaka were varying from 0 4 to 1 0 in the tropical to temperate climates of brazil 3 4 performance evaluation goodness of fit indicators play a crucial role in evaluating the performance of various modeling strategies in replicating field conditions most of these indicators work on model simulated deviations known as errors for a set of observations more description on goodness of indictors can be found in pereira et al 2015 the ability of two models viz simdualkc and ec fp to bifurcate e t a fluxes is evaluated by comparing with field measurements fig 8 simdualkc has outperformed ec fp model in simulating t fluxes during mid and late growth stages both models are well reproducing the measured e and t fluxes with r2 0 5 and d 0 8 bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration were measured using micro lysimeter and sap flow meter at four trees within the study area for use with model comparison if the deviation in measured e and t fluxes is within 10 of cluster mean the data is included in performance evaluation a total of 6 performance indicators table 2 were considered in this study it can be concluded that both methods are reliable in partitioning the eta fluxes for the study region however ability of simdualkc to couple with a crop yield model can aid in evaluating the role of water saving strategies on crop water productivity 4 conclusions the objective of this study is to model crop water requirements and develop single and dual crop coefficients for the citrus orchards grown in central india tower based weather and micro meteorological fluxes were used to develop daily and seasonal k c e t a e t 0 variations region specific seasonal k c values k c i n i 0 43 k c m i d 0 78 k c e n d 0 80 were slightly deviating from fao 56 tabulated values due to the divergent irrigation practices and varying climatic conditions for dual crop coefficients we have tested the applicability of fao 56 specified soil water balance simdualkc and ec fp models simdualkc model simulated swc was agreed well with ert observations with an r2 of 0 76 and rmse of 0 018 cm3 cm 3 direct measurement of e and t fluxes using micro lysimeters and sap flow meter at selective trees was used to evaluate the performance of two models using six goodness of

different conscious water stressing of the crop to initiate blooming during initial stages has resulted in low crop coefficients both methods are reliable in partitioning eta fluxes however the ability of simdualkc to couple with a crop model is recommended for use in evaluating the role of water saving strategies acknowledgement this research is carried as a part of itra water project that

11249,efficient use of water by selection of appropriate plant species is becoming increasingly important in semi arid and arid regions to save scarce water resources in this study the effects of water deficit irrigation on physiological responses water use efficiency wue and visual quality of four herbaceous ornamental species malva sylvestris althea rosea callistephus chinensis and rudbeckia hirta were investigated the experiment was a split plot treatment based on a randomized complete block design experiment with four irrigation levels 25 50 75 and 100 reference evapotranspiration et0 and four replications althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta showed dehydration avoidance by modifying their leaf shape decreasing stomatal conductance and increasing water use efficiency wuei the lowest specific leaf area and highest root shoot ratio were seen in althaea rosea at 25 and 50 et0 respectively malva sylvestris used a drought escape strategy by early flowering in terms of landscape aesthetic values malva sylvestris performed well with a minimum of 75 et0 althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta were well maintained with 25 50 et0 irrigation levels however for an acceptable aesthetic landscape appearance the minimum level of irrigation for callistephus chinensis was 50 et0 these results suggest that use of drought tolerant spices such as althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta can improve irrigation management and conserve aesthetic performance in urban landscapes keywords herbaceous spices drought irrigation management water use efficiency 1 introduction increased industrialization rising population and climate change have resulted in water conflicts especially in urban environments lea cox and ross 2001 in many urban communities irrigation of urban landscapes is a considerable fraction of urban water consumption between 40 and 70 lockett et al 2002 the absence of a perceptible association between landscape performance and resources such as water makes water conservation difficult water management is difficult when there are wide fields of expectations and end users kjelgren et al 2000 species diversity and their water need characteristics kjelgren et al 2000 differences in regions management practices and landscape types make a determination of irrigation requirements more complex hilaire et al 2008 to mitigate demand problems water managers are looking to achieve significant long and short term water saving strategies brown et al 2004 therefore some conservation strategies are implemented such as using precision landscape irrigation kjelgren et al 2000 using alternative water sources hilaire et al 2008 using native and drought tolerant plant species lockett et al 2002 applying deficit irrigation strategies hilaire et al 2008 mansour et al 2017 and identifying the varying water needs in the developmental stages stabler and martin 2000 studies to define the minimum irrigation need for maintenance of plants with acceptable aesthetics display are surprising possibilities for water conservation in landscaping for example many non turf landscape plants can sustain acceptable aesthetics under some levels of water deficit protocols kjelgren et al 2000 investigations on irrigation of enera landscape groundcovers showed several species had acceptable performance at 20 or 50 of reference evapotranspiration et0 staats and klett 1995 pittenger et al 2001 a study showed 11 and 14 shrub species maintained acceptable aesthetic appearance at irrigation amounts equal to 0 and 18 of et0 respectively shaw and pittenger 2004 for example the species such as workwood feathery cassia orchid spot rockrose pride of madeira bush snapdragon noell grevillea toyon green cloud texas ranger prostrate myoporum and santa cruz firethorn goldmoss had acceptable appearance in no irrigation costello et al 2005 reported no difference among irrigation at 0 25 or 50 et0 in the growth of 2 year oaks furthermore the results from studies on water use of some landscape trees illustrated that increases of water use are associated with plant species type plant size and or soil moisture content devitt et al 1994 1995 vrecenak and herrington 1984 based on stabler and martin 2000 2004 water use efficiency wue for established cercidium floridum nerium oleander and leucophyllum frutescens could be optimized by deficit irrigation regimens water conservation can also be achieved using such strategies as water sensitive urban design kazemi et al 2009 2011 while keeping landscape aesthetic values at the same time is still a challenge hurd et al 2006 several research works have been conducted in this area which focuses on how to create low maintenance and attractive meadows in urban landscapes hitchmough et al 2004 dunnett and hitchmough 2007 due to the beauty of flowering herbaceous species it is hard to convince people to eliminate them from urban landscaping rutgers master gardeners 2016 these plants are the first group which shows symptoms of water deficiency therefore to optimize landscape aesthetic performances of water wise landscaping sun et al 2012 studies have been focused on drought effects on herbaceous flowering plants moosavi et al 2014 due to morphological and physiological adaptations using native plants is as a way to maintain acceptable landscape appearance starman and lombardini 2006 and support local wildlife ober and knox 2017 however the complexities of urban microclimates have resulted in not adapting of some native plants to a harsh new habitat wade et al 2010 to obtain an exceptional landscape performance a mix of adapted exotics and native plant species should be applied in municipal landscaping the whole plant characters blum 2005 and atmospheric demand for moisture have effects on plant water needs kjelgren et al 2000 plants adjust their water demand by dehydration avoidance characters such as creating more trichomes ehleringer et al 1976 reducing lower specific leaf area fonseca et al 2000 increase their rooting depth kjelgren et al 2009 and changing their stomatal size and density masle et al 2005 native plants obtain accommodation mainly by dehydration escape and dehydration avoidance rather than dehydration tolerance blum 2005 however having drought tolerance potential plants experience some degree of wilting leaf burn reduction in growth flower size number of flowers and quality zollinger et al 2006 therefore understanding the minimum water needs for desirable plant quality henson et al 2006 and the varying degree of adaptation and water use efficiency may assist in keeping landscape visual quality to an acceptable level cameron et al 2006 andrew et al 2013 in the current study the effect of water deficit irrigation on physio morphological and landscape performance of two native herbaceous species althaea rosea malva sylvestris and two adapted exotic plant species to iran rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinensis were examined the main aim was to provide knowledge on the lowest watering level for acceptable maintenance which may help to design future water management framework for a mix of native and non native urban landscaping 2 material and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design this field study was conducted in mashhad botanic garden longitude e59 36 latitude n36 15 and 985 m above sea level average rainfall per year 233 8 mm located in south part of the city of mashhad iran during 2016 physical and chemical characteristics of the soil of the experimental site are listed in table 1 the experimental design was a split plot treatment based on a randomized complete block design with four replications the irrigation treatments were in four levels including 25 50 75 and 100 of the reference evapotranspiration et0 required to optimize growth of poa pratensis kentucky bluegrass the hourly weather data air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and rainfall were achieved from local weather station records local reference evapotranspiration et0 was obtained from weather data using penman montieth equation allen et al 2000 the study examined four herbaceous flowering plant species including rudbeckia hirta callistephus chinensis althaea rosea malva sylvestris the size of each of the 64 plots was 1 m 1 5 m and they were separated by a 1 meter distance the plots of althaea rosea malva sylvestris rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinensis species we consisted of 6 12 plants respectively althaea rosea malva sylvestris and rudbeckia hirta callistephus chinensis species were spaced a minimum of 0 5 0 3 m apart 4 and 8 plants per square meter respectively in april 2016 the seeds were sown in plastic trays and uniform seedlings 6 to 8 leaf stage were transplanted approximately one month after planting the seeds the plants were allowed to establish one month prior to the treatment initiation the weeds were removed using a hand removal then the plants were treated with four irrigation levels until the end of the season rainfall per day was subtracted from the amount of each treatment the total available moisture content in the soil was 14 9 table 1 pure irrigation depth pid which is dependent on the root depth of the experimental species was calculated 4 47 cm or 44 mm the maximum irrigation interval 4 days was calculated as the ratio of pid to maximum water requirement at the maximum growth stage which was 10 mm day in this research irrigation intervals were considered every second days the total amount of water taken up by the plants in each plot was calculated in all the treatments during the period of the experiment to measure water use efficiency 2 2 measurements at the end of the study period landscape impact floral impact and appearance impact of the studied species were assessed applying a modified method of rozum 2014 appearance impact rating was evaluated base on a 1 5 likert type scale complete death of plants and leaves was scored 1 dead 2 visible witling firing and green leaf 50 3 slow growth green leaves 50 4 good growth green leaves 75 and 5 exceptional growth floral impact rating was based on how much plant s appearance is improved by flowering it was rated on a scale of 1 5 where 1 no flowering 2 25 impact 3 50 impact 4 75 impact and 5 95 impact very showy inflorescence landscape impact rating was assessed based on how the general appearance of the plants their flowering and their insect and disease symptoms impacted on the landscape quality the gradations of the scales were as follows 1 having a weak growth in the landscape sparse flowering or without ornamental value 5 having a pleasurable landscape appearance althea rosea displayed a degree of leaf rolling which was rated on a scale of 1 5 1 no rolling 5 full leaf rolling after conducting a visual rating the plants were harvested their roots were washed and then the fresh weight of the roots and shoots were measured to measure the dry mass dm and root shoot ratio the plants were placed in an oven at 65 c until a constant weight was obtained kazemi et al 2011 in this research work two concepts were used to describe water use efficiency water use efficiency based on growth index wuei and wue based on biomass production wueb the first was calculated by dividing the growth index gi difference subtracting the final from the initial gi by the total water applied fernandez et al 2009 growth index was measured by multiplying the plant height to canopy width on a north south axis and canopy width on an east west axis wue based on biomass production wueb was measured by dividing the difference of initial and final total biomass by the amount of water applied to the plants during the experiment medrano et al 2015 leaf area cm2 was calculated using a leaf area meter li 3000c li cor ltd lincoln nebraska usa specific leaf area sla was calculated by dividing the leaf area by leaf dry weight the ash content was obtained by burning 2 0 g sample on a muffle furnace at 550 c for 4 h and then weighing the residue latimer 2012 leaf stomatal conductance was measured on the young fully expanded leaves by a sc 1 porometer sc 1 decagon pullman usa between 12 30 and 1 30 pm mean of the two readings per plant were taken every two weeks the canopy temperature was measured by a handheld infra red thermometer sixth sense lt 300 infrared thermometer usa at a height of 45 5 cm above each plant height at noon every four weeks and before irrigation was applied mean of the two readings was recorded 2 3 data analysis the data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova using the mixed procedure in spss software package version 25 the irrigation treatments and plant species were considered as fixed factors the significance of between treatment means was tested at p 0 05 levels the experiment was analyzed as a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement the relationships between the parameters were measured using pearson s simple correlation tests 3 results and discussion the results of the analysis of variance showed that the effects of drought stress and plant species types on the measured factors were significant at p 0 01 also interactions between the drought levels and the plant species were significant for all the measured traits except for stomatal conductance p 0 01 table 2 3 1 plant biomass the treatment effects on the biomass of the four plant species were highly significant in all the plant species the plants treated with 100 et0 had the greatest biomass while the lowest biomasses were associated with 25 et0 comparisons between the biomass of the plant species showed that the highest 1071 20 g and the lowest biomass values 199 53 g were obtained in althea rosea and callistephus chinensis respectively also no significant difference was found between althaea rosea and malva sylvestris in the case of 25 et0 malva sylvestris produced the highest biomass followed by althaea rosea the highest 70 and the lowest 58 reductions in biomasses were found in althaea rosea and malva sylvestris compared to the control irrigation treatment respectively table 3 drought is one of the most important environmental stresses to limit plant establishment and growth cregg 2002 while the prime effect of water stress on agricultural crops is yield reduction passioura 1996 the most important drought stress effect in ornamental plants is negative effects on their visual quality in ornamental plants the intensity of response to water stress declining the daily et is dependent on the species variety lenzi et al 2009 species responses to drought stress have been discussed by many researchers for example biomass accumulation in stressed plants is almost limited to c monspeliensis cistus albidus oleander rose and geranium sp sánchez blanco et al 2002 niu et al 2008 niu and rodriguez 2009 álvarez et al 2013 andrew et al 2013 observed that the seedlings of e excelsa and e grandis in well watered situations 100 field capacity produced greater total biomass 54 6 g and 27 7 g respectively compared to the drought treatments 12 5 25 and 50 field capacity moreover gonzález rodríguez et al 2010 showed that the plants in 100 field capacity had large foliage compared to them in 40 field capacity this means that the higher drought stress levels induced the lower leaf emergence rate lower photosynthesis rate and thus lower biomass assimilation andrew et al 2013 our results on rudbeckia hirta were in contrast to the results in henson s report 2005 he found that irrigation at 0 25 50 75 or 100 had no effect on biomass of rudbeckia hirta also irrigation at 50 100 et0 had no significant effect on the growth of rudbeckia hirta in the current study poor visual quality and less biomass reduction in malva sylvestris suggest that having high biomass or keeping it during the drought does not necessarily guaranty high aesthetic values 3 2 root shoot ratio r s comparisons among the plant species showed significant differences in their root shoot ratio althea rosea had the greatest root shoot ratio 0 419 followed by malva sylvestris rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinensis table 3 showed that the plants treated with 50 et0 ranked the highest in their root shoot ratio 0 278 however there were no significant differences on root shoot ratio of the plants treated by 75 et0 and 25 et0 in callistephus chinensis no significant differences were detected between 75 et0 and 25 et0 there was no significant difference between rudbeckia hirta under 25 et0 treatment and callistephus chinensis under 75 et0 treatement in rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea the plants treated with 50 et0 significantly had an increase in their r s ratio as compared to the control conditions 2 02 and 1 59 respectively due to fast osmotic adjustment in roots sharp 2004 drought stress had less effect on root growth than on shoot growth franco et al 2011 cai et al 2012 reported that increased root shoot ratio is one of the characteristics of drought tolerant species this phenomenon affects faster establishment and maintenance of the seedlings in such conditions andrew et al 2013 with an exception of 25 et0 treatment the root shoot ratio increased in rudbeckia hirta in the other irrigation treatments the higher root shoot ratio in althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta enhances source sink ratio for nutrients and water in semi arid environments nevertheless this ratio is not always changed by drought stress sánchez blanco et al 2014 reported that the root to shoot ratio in pistacia lentiscus and phillyrea angustifolia was not affected under drought condition with 75 et0 exception the same response was observed in callistephus chinensis the opposite effect of severe stress compared to moderate stress on root shoot ratio in malva sylvestris was in agreement with the findings of navarro et al 2009 they mentioned that differences in water deficit levels led to differences in the root shoot ratio of myrtus communis after 5 months a moderate water stress had no significant effect on root development while a severe water deficit significantly reduced root and shoot ratio in myrtus plants 3 3 specific leaf area the average effects of water regimes on all the plant species showed that with increasing the drought stress sla significantly decreased table 3 species comparisons indicated that malva sylvestris was superior in terms of this factor compared to the rest of the species 286 86 cm2 g 1 there was no significant difference between rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea in terms of sla under the control irrigation treatment malva sylvestris had the highest sla 334 70 cm2 g 1 and this value was followed by the equivalent value for callistephus chinensis 163 79 cm2 g 1 however no significant difference was detected among callistephus chinensis rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea under 25 et0 irrigation treatment comparisons also revealed that sla had no significant difference between 50 et0 and 75 et0 in rudbeckia hirta specific leaf area has been reported to be declined under drought stress marcelis et al 1998 low specific leaf area is an index of drought resistance due to having more photosynthetic capacity painawadee et al 2009 which can be used to select herbaceous species for adverse environmental conditions maroco et al 2000 specific leaf area varied strongly across the plant species within the control treatment in the current study so that the papery leaves higher sla in malva sylvestris can be used as a species indicator not only for prediction of drought tolerance but also for competitive effects on landscape plantings the lowest specific leaf area was found in althaea rosea due to a significant rolling blum 1996 and higher tissue density under drought stress conditions castro díez et al 2000 leaf rolling is one of the adapting mechanisms that reduces leaf area blum 1996 transpiration through abaxial stomatal closure begg 1980 water usage and preserves photosystem ii psii performance nar et al 2009 3 4 canopy temperature it was clear from table 4 that the variation in δtc canopy temperature air temperature between the plant species was considerable malva sylvestris obtained the greatest δtc 3 52 c followed by callistephus chinesis althea rosea and rudbeckia hirta in decreasing order it was evident that increasing the stress level resulted in a significant increase in δtc there was no significant difference in δtc between malva sylvestris and callistephus chinesis at 25 et0 similar results was obtained at 50 of et0 rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea with 25 et0 also had no significant differences with the control plants of malva sylvestris in terms of δtc δtc in rudbeckia hirta was negative in 100 to 50 et0 among the plant species malva sylvestris was the only plant species that showed positive δtc 1 44 c even in the control irrigation treatment callistephus chinesis had the highest change in δtc 10 48 c from 100 et0 to 25 et0 as compared to the other plant species in stressed irrigation levels 75 et0 50 et0 and 25 et0 the lowest δtc values were observed in rudbeckia hirta followed by althaea rosea leaf shape and size variations can affect canopy temperature in similar conditions basra 1997 the difference between canopy temperature tc and air temperature ta has been used to assess stress responses howell et al 1986 water use pinter et al 1990 and tolerance to drought in plants blum et al 1989 therefore this trait may have more utility for indirect estimating of gs in breeding schedules roohi et al 2015 the lower δtc in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea could be explained by changes in leaf angle zheng et al 2008 and the degree of pubescence of the stems and leaves gersony et al 2016 in fact low δtc led to drought tolerance by maintenance of physiological function and turgor olivares villegas et al 2007 the canopy temperatures of malva sylvestris at all levels of irrigation were greater than air temperatures henson 2005 reported similar responses in impatiens x walleriana and begonia carrieri hort vodka in his report rudbeckia hirta had the greatest canopy temperatures at 0 et0 and 25 et0 5 169 and 2 62 c respectively and there was no significant difference through 50 et0 to 100 et0 and through 25 et0 to 75 et0 greater δtcs and higher leaf desiccation values in malva sylvestris and callistephus chinesis in 25 et0 were in agreement with the results obtained by blum et al 1999 on rice the data also indicated that there were significant negative relationships between δtc and biomass for plant species under drought stress conditions table 6 landscape plant species are assessed for their aesthetic appearance and not for their yield therefore the conception of optimum yield and growth is not applicable to urban landscape plants shaw and pittenger 2004 as previously reported cooler canopy led to more grain yield in wheat triticale and barley ayeneh et al 2002 roohi et al 2015 our results indicated a significant negative correlation between δtc and plants appearance floral and landscape impact rating under drought conditions a positive correlation was found between δtc and sla in althaea rosea under drought stress condition r 996 p 0 01 while there was no significant correlation for these factors among other species similar to these results a significantly positive correlation between sla and canopy temperature was previously reported in three cereal species under drought conditions roohi et al 2015 the δtc was not correlated with wuei and wueb in our current study contrary to these results alderfasi and morgan 1998 reported that there was negative associations between canopy temperature and crop water use efficiency of biomass in addition a negative correlation was observed between δtc and stomatal conductance under drought conditions table 6 roohi et al 2015 had similar report for relationship of canopy temperature and gs on cereal species 3 5 stomatal conductance regardless of the irrigation regime there was no significant difference in stomatal conductance of malva sylvestris when compared with rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinesis plants in the control treatment 100 et0 had 4 17 and 27 higher stomatal conductance than the plants treated with 75 et0 50 et0 and 25 et0 respectively no significant difference was observed between all the plant species at 25 et0 malva sylvestris rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinesis had similar pattern at 50 et0 and 75 et0 comparison of the different irrigation treatments within althaea rosea showed a significant decreases in stomatal conductance althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta with 25 et0 showed the most decreases in this trait as compared to their control plants 31 and 28 respectively 3 6 ash content a comparison between the leaf ash means of the four species illustrated that rudbeckia hirta had the highest value followed by malva sylvestris althaea rosea and callistephus chinesis respectively table 4 as expected there was a significant decreasing trend in ash content of the plants as drought stress treatment become severe leaf ash varied from 14 63 to 22 98 under the control irrigation conditions with the minimum and maximum belonging to callistephus chinesis and rudbeckia hirta respectively in althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta this trait was significantly decreased as the irrigation level was decreased rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea under 25 et0 indicated a greater decrease in this trait as compared to their corresponding control plants 29 and 26 respectively leaf ash content was decreased with increasing the level of drought stress as previously observed in barley and wheat voltas et al 1998 araus et al 1998 drought stress affects the species by inducing stomata closure cai et al 2012 the stomatal closure as a response to drought stress levels were similar among rudbeckia hirta callistephus chinensis and malva sylvestris species in the current study callistephus chinensis and malva sylvestris had less sensitive stomatas to drought levels compared with althaea rosea it has been documented that osmotic adjustment plays an important role in maintenance of higher stomatal conductance and drought resistance therefore as an additional drought resistance strategy higher visual quality in rudbeckia hirta like other rudbeckia species could be related to osmotic adjustment prevete et al 2000 observational comparisons of the results showed that the pattern of stomatal conductance gs between the plant species was similar to that for ash contents among the species table 4 furthermore significant positive correlations were observed between the leaf ash content and the stomatal conductance gs across the plant species when treatments were plotted together see fig 5 there is a close correlation between water status of the plants gs and mineral accumulation in leaves which is discussed by cabrera bosquet et al 2009 on maize 3 7 water use efficiency wue in ranking the plant species rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea were seen as superior in term of wuei 6 76 cm l and wueb 3 73 g l compared to the rest of the plant species respectively this wuei value was 93 60 and 29 greater than the wuei values of callistephus chinensis malva sylvestris and althaea rosea respectively the amount of wueb was 30 35 and 88 higher than wueb amounts of rudbeckia hirta malva sylvestris and callistephus chinensis respectively treatment comparisons average for all species indicated that differences in wuei were significantly increased as the degree of drought stress increased in case of wueb none of the irrigation treatments except 25 et0 was found to be significantly different irrigation treatment regimens had no significant effects on wueb and wuei of callistephus chinensis in case of wuei similar response was found in malva sylvestris compared with the control irrigated plants wuei of rudbeckia hirta althaea rosea and malva sylvestris was increased by 179 102 and 28 respectively under 25 et0 table 5 there is no general agreement on how water deficiency affects water use efficiency tanner and sinclair 1983 discussed that reduction of dry matter is almost as much as the decline in transpiration is thus wue is not affected higher wue is mostly influenced by a consequence of decreased water use rather than assimilation or pure enhancement in plant production blum 2005 unlike agriculture in urban landscape improving wue does not necessarily mean improving the overall yield or growth the ultimate goal is rather to achieve more efficient use of water for suitable aesthetic appearance and plant fitness stabler and martin 2000 an increase in wue under drought stress has been observed by several researchers in ornamental plant species such as woody ornamentals cameron et al 2006 catharanthus roseus jaleel et al 2008 dianthus álvarez et al 2009 and callistemon citrinus álvarez and sánchez blanco 2013 our estimation of higher wue under lower irrigation agreed with those of tyler et al 1996 who observed cotoneaster dammeri skogholm under a leaching fraction lf 0 0 0 2 had 29 greater water use efficiency than plants under high lf 0 4 0 6 similar response of water stress on wue which we achieved in callistephus chinensis has been reported in pelargonium zonale andersson 2000 in case of althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta higher thickness better light interception chaves et al 2002 presence of trichomes dunkić et al 2001 and decreased leaf area lazaridou and koutroubas 2004 huang et al 2005 may lead to a better water saving and improvement in wue therefore wue could be considered as an index of the ability of the plant species to save water under dry conditions fang et al 2010 3 8 relationship between wue and stress related parameters there were negative relationships between wueb and stomatal conductance r2 0 71 and r2 0 70 and a highly negative relationship between wuei and stomatal conductance r2 0 86 and r2 0 89 for rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea respectively it was shown that there was negative relationship between wuei and stomatal conductance for malva sylvestris r2 0 61 also ash content had negative relationships with wuei r2 0 85 r2 0 88 and wueb r2 0 59 r2 0 74 in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea respectively such negative relationships between sla and wuei r2 0 87 r2 0 87 and sla and wueb r2 0 59 r2 0 66 was also observed in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea as mentioned above there was no relationship between wue and δtc among the plant species some researchers reported a negative correlation between wue and sla assuming an adaptive value of sla by water loss reduction in thicker leaves warren et al 2005 stomatal conductance had a critical role for water balance and wue tuberosa 2012 our result was consistent with mckay et al 2003 who reported that decreasing stomatal conductance and increasing wue could led to more drought resistance also the relationship between ash content and wue indicated that using ash as selection criteria for species with higher wue would present a reasonable cost and simple procedure frank et al 1997 3 9 irrigation level thresholds the experiment determined the following irrigation level thresholds for each species to attain satisfying growth and visual quality in case of malva sylvestris critical level of irrigation was between 75 and 100 et0 for althaea rosea it lied between 25 and 50 et0 for callistephus chinensis it was between 50 and 75 et0 and for rudbeckia hirta it was between 25 and 50 et0 the critical level of irrigation of malva sylvestris and callistephus chinensis were similar to the critical irrigation level in impatiens x walleriana and begonia carrieri hort vodka henson 2005 the lowest irrigation level for maintaining acceptable quality in rudbeckia hirta was opposed to henson 2005 results in his report the critical level of irrigation for acceptable visual scores were between 0 and 25 et0 while the essential level of irrigation for final percent cover was between 25 and 50 et0 3 10 visual ratings landscape impact appearance impact and floral impact were meaningfully different at the treatment species and species treatment levels landscape impact rating indicated the overall influence of plants on the landscape appearance from floral and foliage appearance to the appearance that pest or disease problems may bring through all the drought stress levels rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea had the greatest landscape impacts see fig 1 althaea rosea showed a significantly different leaf rolling under 50 and 25 irrigation levels see fig 2 in presence of direct sunlight and once every two days irrigation frequency malva sylvestris s leaf edges were burned even under 100 et0 irrigation treatment therefore daily irrigation and growing in partly shade conditions would be important factors for increasing visual quality of malva sylvestris in our study althaea rosea and callistephus chinensis took the highest and lowest floral impact in 25 et0 irrigation treatment respectively drought had detrimental effects on foliage and plant appearance of malva sylvestris however there was no significant effect on its floral appearance across irrigation treatment levels from 75 to 25 et0 see fig 3 only althaea rosea maintained a plant appearance rating of three scores or more out of 5 for the lowest watering level of 25 et0 the plant appearance findings indicated that 75 et0 was a minimum irrigation level to maintain plant appearance in callistephus chinensis and malva sylvestris whereas this level was 50 et0 for rudbeckia hirta see fig 4 regarding the conducted investigations in malva sylvestris and althaea rosea there are differences on trichome types and also on the length of the trichomes kim and lee 2005 romitelli and martins 2013 therefore longer four types of trichomes of althaea rosea had more important role in protection of the plant against drought stress compared to the shorter one type of the trichomes in malva sylvestris in spite of being native to iran malva sylvestris had less ability to maintain landscape performance and adapt to conditions of limited available water than an exotic species as rudbeckia hirta therefore a native plant is not certainly the most drought resistant wade et al 2010 combining well adapted exotic with native species is as a way to create a beautiful landscape with conserving water several factors contribute to drought tolerance of plants for example rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea reduced their water loss by modifying their leaf shape or orientation lampinen et al 2004 decreasing their leaf and shoot growth cameron et al 1999 and closing their stomata panković et al 1999 4 conclusion our results showed that drought tolerance of plants is associated with fundamental plant traits and there is a large variation on drought tolerance mechanism among the plant species the higher thickness decreased leaf area and trichomes are suitable indices for prospecting drought tolerance in species althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta use stomatal closure to fit as drought tolerant plants althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta compared to other plant species had higher wuei under drought it appears callistephus chinensis and especially malva sylvestris are not proper species under minimal landscape irrigation due to witling and leaf firing responses of rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea to drought stress can be attributed to their desiccation avoidance strategies these strategies are achieved via decreasing water loss by trichomes modifying shape and leaf orientation reducing stomatal aperture and leaf area these responses are more aesthetically acceptable than desiccation tolerance mechanisms such as wilting in landscape planting all in all considering propensity responses for drought tolerance in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea these plant species appears to be appropriate plant candidates for water wise landscaping the results of this study showed that even though malva sylvestris was a native species it did not pass the test for urban landscaping with low water use rudbeckia hirta was not native but showed a great positive response to drought stress therefore having a strategy to use both native and exotic drought resistant plants may better assist in achieving more sustainable low water use landscaping acknowledgements we would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their constructive comments and advice also we appreciate editorial corrections by an anonymous native english speaker this research was supported by ferdowsi university of mashhad under grant number 40947 for which we are grateful 
11249,efficient use of water by selection of appropriate plant species is becoming increasingly important in semi arid and arid regions to save scarce water resources in this study the effects of water deficit irrigation on physiological responses water use efficiency wue and visual quality of four herbaceous ornamental species malva sylvestris althea rosea callistephus chinensis and rudbeckia hirta were investigated the experiment was a split plot treatment based on a randomized complete block design experiment with four irrigation levels 25 50 75 and 100 reference evapotranspiration et0 and four replications althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta showed dehydration avoidance by modifying their leaf shape decreasing stomatal conductance and increasing water use efficiency wuei the lowest specific leaf area and highest root shoot ratio were seen in althaea rosea at 25 and 50 et0 respectively malva sylvestris used a drought escape strategy by early flowering in terms of landscape aesthetic values malva sylvestris performed well with a minimum of 75 et0 althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta were well maintained with 25 50 et0 irrigation levels however for an acceptable aesthetic landscape appearance the minimum level of irrigation for callistephus chinensis was 50 et0 these results suggest that use of drought tolerant spices such as althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta can improve irrigation management and conserve aesthetic performance in urban landscapes keywords herbaceous spices drought irrigation management water use efficiency 1 introduction increased industrialization rising population and climate change have resulted in water conflicts especially in urban environments lea cox and ross 2001 in many urban communities irrigation of urban landscapes is a considerable fraction of urban water consumption between 40 and 70 lockett et al 2002 the absence of a perceptible association between landscape performance and resources such as water makes water conservation difficult water management is difficult when there are wide fields of expectations and end users kjelgren et al 2000 species diversity and their water need characteristics kjelgren et al 2000 differences in regions management practices and landscape types make a determination of irrigation requirements more complex hilaire et al 2008 to mitigate demand problems water managers are looking to achieve significant long and short term water saving strategies brown et al 2004 therefore some conservation strategies are implemented such as using precision landscape irrigation kjelgren et al 2000 using alternative water sources hilaire et al 2008 using native and drought tolerant plant species lockett et al 2002 applying deficit irrigation strategies hilaire et al 2008 mansour et al 2017 and identifying the varying water needs in the developmental stages stabler and martin 2000 studies to define the minimum irrigation need for maintenance of plants with acceptable aesthetics display are surprising possibilities for water conservation in landscaping for example many non turf landscape plants can sustain acceptable aesthetics under some levels of water deficit protocols kjelgren et al 2000 investigations on irrigation of enera landscape groundcovers showed several species had acceptable performance at 20 or 50 of reference evapotranspiration et0 staats and klett 1995 pittenger et al 2001 a study showed 11 and 14 shrub species maintained acceptable aesthetic appearance at irrigation amounts equal to 0 and 18 of et0 respectively shaw and pittenger 2004 for example the species such as workwood feathery cassia orchid spot rockrose pride of madeira bush snapdragon noell grevillea toyon green cloud texas ranger prostrate myoporum and santa cruz firethorn goldmoss had acceptable appearance in no irrigation costello et al 2005 reported no difference among irrigation at 0 25 or 50 et0 in the growth of 2 year oaks furthermore the results from studies on water use of some landscape trees illustrated that increases of water use are associated with plant species type plant size and or soil moisture content devitt et al 1994 1995 vrecenak and herrington 1984 based on stabler and martin 2000 2004 water use efficiency wue for established cercidium floridum nerium oleander and leucophyllum frutescens could be optimized by deficit irrigation regimens water conservation can also be achieved using such strategies as water sensitive urban design kazemi et al 2009 2011 while keeping landscape aesthetic values at the same time is still a challenge hurd et al 2006 several research works have been conducted in this area which focuses on how to create low maintenance and attractive meadows in urban landscapes hitchmough et al 2004 dunnett and hitchmough 2007 due to the beauty of flowering herbaceous species it is hard to convince people to eliminate them from urban landscaping rutgers master gardeners 2016 these plants are the first group which shows symptoms of water deficiency therefore to optimize landscape aesthetic performances of water wise landscaping sun et al 2012 studies have been focused on drought effects on herbaceous flowering plants moosavi et al 2014 due to morphological and physiological adaptations using native plants is as a way to maintain acceptable landscape appearance starman and lombardini 2006 and support local wildlife ober and knox 2017 however the complexities of urban microclimates have resulted in not adapting of some native plants to a harsh new habitat wade et al 2010 to obtain an exceptional landscape performance a mix of adapted exotics and native plant species should be applied in municipal landscaping the whole plant characters blum 2005 and atmospheric demand for moisture have effects on plant water needs kjelgren et al 2000 plants adjust their water demand by dehydration avoidance characters such as creating more trichomes ehleringer et al 1976 reducing lower specific leaf area fonseca et al 2000 increase their rooting depth kjelgren et al 2009 and changing their stomatal size and density masle et al 2005 native plants obtain accommodation mainly by dehydration escape and dehydration avoidance rather than dehydration tolerance blum 2005 however having drought tolerance potential plants experience some degree of wilting leaf burn reduction in growth flower size number of flowers and quality zollinger et al 2006 therefore understanding the minimum water needs for desirable plant quality henson et al 2006 and the varying degree of adaptation and water use efficiency may assist in keeping landscape visual quality to an acceptable level cameron et al 2006 andrew et al 2013 in the current study the effect of water deficit irrigation on physio morphological and landscape performance of two native herbaceous species althaea rosea malva sylvestris and two adapted exotic plant species to iran rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinensis were examined the main aim was to provide knowledge on the lowest watering level for acceptable maintenance which may help to design future water management framework for a mix of native and non native urban landscaping 2 material and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design this field study was conducted in mashhad botanic garden longitude e59 36 latitude n36 15 and 985 m above sea level average rainfall per year 233 8 mm located in south part of the city of mashhad iran during 2016 physical and chemical characteristics of the soil of the experimental site are listed in table 1 the experimental design was a split plot treatment based on a randomized complete block design with four replications the irrigation treatments were in four levels including 25 50 75 and 100 of the reference evapotranspiration et0 required to optimize growth of poa pratensis kentucky bluegrass the hourly weather data air temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed and rainfall were achieved from local weather station records local reference evapotranspiration et0 was obtained from weather data using penman montieth equation allen et al 2000 the study examined four herbaceous flowering plant species including rudbeckia hirta callistephus chinensis althaea rosea malva sylvestris the size of each of the 64 plots was 1 m 1 5 m and they were separated by a 1 meter distance the plots of althaea rosea malva sylvestris rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinensis species we consisted of 6 12 plants respectively althaea rosea malva sylvestris and rudbeckia hirta callistephus chinensis species were spaced a minimum of 0 5 0 3 m apart 4 and 8 plants per square meter respectively in april 2016 the seeds were sown in plastic trays and uniform seedlings 6 to 8 leaf stage were transplanted approximately one month after planting the seeds the plants were allowed to establish one month prior to the treatment initiation the weeds were removed using a hand removal then the plants were treated with four irrigation levels until the end of the season rainfall per day was subtracted from the amount of each treatment the total available moisture content in the soil was 14 9 table 1 pure irrigation depth pid which is dependent on the root depth of the experimental species was calculated 4 47 cm or 44 mm the maximum irrigation interval 4 days was calculated as the ratio of pid to maximum water requirement at the maximum growth stage which was 10 mm day in this research irrigation intervals were considered every second days the total amount of water taken up by the plants in each plot was calculated in all the treatments during the period of the experiment to measure water use efficiency 2 2 measurements at the end of the study period landscape impact floral impact and appearance impact of the studied species were assessed applying a modified method of rozum 2014 appearance impact rating was evaluated base on a 1 5 likert type scale complete death of plants and leaves was scored 1 dead 2 visible witling firing and green leaf 50 3 slow growth green leaves 50 4 good growth green leaves 75 and 5 exceptional growth floral impact rating was based on how much plant s appearance is improved by flowering it was rated on a scale of 1 5 where 1 no flowering 2 25 impact 3 50 impact 4 75 impact and 5 95 impact very showy inflorescence landscape impact rating was assessed based on how the general appearance of the plants their flowering and their insect and disease symptoms impacted on the landscape quality the gradations of the scales were as follows 1 having a weak growth in the landscape sparse flowering or without ornamental value 5 having a pleasurable landscape appearance althea rosea displayed a degree of leaf rolling which was rated on a scale of 1 5 1 no rolling 5 full leaf rolling after conducting a visual rating the plants were harvested their roots were washed and then the fresh weight of the roots and shoots were measured to measure the dry mass dm and root shoot ratio the plants were placed in an oven at 65 c until a constant weight was obtained kazemi et al 2011 in this research work two concepts were used to describe water use efficiency water use efficiency based on growth index wuei and wue based on biomass production wueb the first was calculated by dividing the growth index gi difference subtracting the final from the initial gi by the total water applied fernandez et al 2009 growth index was measured by multiplying the plant height to canopy width on a north south axis and canopy width on an east west axis wue based on biomass production wueb was measured by dividing the difference of initial and final total biomass by the amount of water applied to the plants during the experiment medrano et al 2015 leaf area cm2 was calculated using a leaf area meter li 3000c li cor ltd lincoln nebraska usa specific leaf area sla was calculated by dividing the leaf area by leaf dry weight the ash content was obtained by burning 2 0 g sample on a muffle furnace at 550 c for 4 h and then weighing the residue latimer 2012 leaf stomatal conductance was measured on the young fully expanded leaves by a sc 1 porometer sc 1 decagon pullman usa between 12 30 and 1 30 pm mean of the two readings per plant were taken every two weeks the canopy temperature was measured by a handheld infra red thermometer sixth sense lt 300 infrared thermometer usa at a height of 45 5 cm above each plant height at noon every four weeks and before irrigation was applied mean of the two readings was recorded 2 3 data analysis the data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova using the mixed procedure in spss software package version 25 the irrigation treatments and plant species were considered as fixed factors the significance of between treatment means was tested at p 0 05 levels the experiment was analyzed as a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement the relationships between the parameters were measured using pearson s simple correlation tests 3 results and discussion the results of the analysis of variance showed that the effects of drought stress and plant species types on the measured factors were significant at p 0 01 also interactions between the drought levels and the plant species were significant for all the measured traits except for stomatal conductance p 0 01 table 2 3 1 plant biomass the treatment effects on the biomass of the four plant species were highly significant in all the plant species the plants treated with 100 et0 had the greatest biomass while the lowest biomasses were associated with 25 et0 comparisons between the biomass of the plant species showed that the highest 1071 20 g and the lowest biomass values 199 53 g were obtained in althea rosea and callistephus chinensis respectively also no significant difference was found between althaea rosea and malva sylvestris in the case of 25 et0 malva sylvestris produced the highest biomass followed by althaea rosea the highest 70 and the lowest 58 reductions in biomasses were found in althaea rosea and malva sylvestris compared to the control irrigation treatment respectively table 3 drought is one of the most important environmental stresses to limit plant establishment and growth cregg 2002 while the prime effect of water stress on agricultural crops is yield reduction passioura 1996 the most important drought stress effect in ornamental plants is negative effects on their visual quality in ornamental plants the intensity of response to water stress declining the daily et is dependent on the species variety lenzi et al 2009 species responses to drought stress have been discussed by many researchers for example biomass accumulation in stressed plants is almost limited to c monspeliensis cistus albidus oleander rose and geranium sp sánchez blanco et al 2002 niu et al 2008 niu and rodriguez 2009 álvarez et al 2013 andrew et al 2013 observed that the seedlings of e excelsa and e grandis in well watered situations 100 field capacity produced greater total biomass 54 6 g and 27 7 g respectively compared to the drought treatments 12 5 25 and 50 field capacity moreover gonzález rodríguez et al 2010 showed that the plants in 100 field capacity had large foliage compared to them in 40 field capacity this means that the higher drought stress levels induced the lower leaf emergence rate lower photosynthesis rate and thus lower biomass assimilation andrew et al 2013 our results on rudbeckia hirta were in contrast to the results in henson s report 2005 he found that irrigation at 0 25 50 75 or 100 had no effect on biomass of rudbeckia hirta also irrigation at 50 100 et0 had no significant effect on the growth of rudbeckia hirta in the current study poor visual quality and less biomass reduction in malva sylvestris suggest that having high biomass or keeping it during the drought does not necessarily guaranty high aesthetic values 3 2 root shoot ratio r s comparisons among the plant species showed significant differences in their root shoot ratio althea rosea had the greatest root shoot ratio 0 419 followed by malva sylvestris rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinensis table 3 showed that the plants treated with 50 et0 ranked the highest in their root shoot ratio 0 278 however there were no significant differences on root shoot ratio of the plants treated by 75 et0 and 25 et0 in callistephus chinensis no significant differences were detected between 75 et0 and 25 et0 there was no significant difference between rudbeckia hirta under 25 et0 treatment and callistephus chinensis under 75 et0 treatement in rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea the plants treated with 50 et0 significantly had an increase in their r s ratio as compared to the control conditions 2 02 and 1 59 respectively due to fast osmotic adjustment in roots sharp 2004 drought stress had less effect on root growth than on shoot growth franco et al 2011 cai et al 2012 reported that increased root shoot ratio is one of the characteristics of drought tolerant species this phenomenon affects faster establishment and maintenance of the seedlings in such conditions andrew et al 2013 with an exception of 25 et0 treatment the root shoot ratio increased in rudbeckia hirta in the other irrigation treatments the higher root shoot ratio in althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta enhances source sink ratio for nutrients and water in semi arid environments nevertheless this ratio is not always changed by drought stress sánchez blanco et al 2014 reported that the root to shoot ratio in pistacia lentiscus and phillyrea angustifolia was not affected under drought condition with 75 et0 exception the same response was observed in callistephus chinensis the opposite effect of severe stress compared to moderate stress on root shoot ratio in malva sylvestris was in agreement with the findings of navarro et al 2009 they mentioned that differences in water deficit levels led to differences in the root shoot ratio of myrtus communis after 5 months a moderate water stress had no significant effect on root development while a severe water deficit significantly reduced root and shoot ratio in myrtus plants 3 3 specific leaf area the average effects of water regimes on all the plant species showed that with increasing the drought stress sla significantly decreased table 3 species comparisons indicated that malva sylvestris was superior in terms of this factor compared to the rest of the species 286 86 cm2 g 1 there was no significant difference between rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea in terms of sla under the control irrigation treatment malva sylvestris had the highest sla 334 70 cm2 g 1 and this value was followed by the equivalent value for callistephus chinensis 163 79 cm2 g 1 however no significant difference was detected among callistephus chinensis rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea under 25 et0 irrigation treatment comparisons also revealed that sla had no significant difference between 50 et0 and 75 et0 in rudbeckia hirta specific leaf area has been reported to be declined under drought stress marcelis et al 1998 low specific leaf area is an index of drought resistance due to having more photosynthetic capacity painawadee et al 2009 which can be used to select herbaceous species for adverse environmental conditions maroco et al 2000 specific leaf area varied strongly across the plant species within the control treatment in the current study so that the papery leaves higher sla in malva sylvestris can be used as a species indicator not only for prediction of drought tolerance but also for competitive effects on landscape plantings the lowest specific leaf area was found in althaea rosea due to a significant rolling blum 1996 and higher tissue density under drought stress conditions castro díez et al 2000 leaf rolling is one of the adapting mechanisms that reduces leaf area blum 1996 transpiration through abaxial stomatal closure begg 1980 water usage and preserves photosystem ii psii performance nar et al 2009 3 4 canopy temperature it was clear from table 4 that the variation in δtc canopy temperature air temperature between the plant species was considerable malva sylvestris obtained the greatest δtc 3 52 c followed by callistephus chinesis althea rosea and rudbeckia hirta in decreasing order it was evident that increasing the stress level resulted in a significant increase in δtc there was no significant difference in δtc between malva sylvestris and callistephus chinesis at 25 et0 similar results was obtained at 50 of et0 rudbeckia hirta and althea rosea with 25 et0 also had no significant differences with the control plants of malva sylvestris in terms of δtc δtc in rudbeckia hirta was negative in 100 to 50 et0 among the plant species malva sylvestris was the only plant species that showed positive δtc 1 44 c even in the control irrigation treatment callistephus chinesis had the highest change in δtc 10 48 c from 100 et0 to 25 et0 as compared to the other plant species in stressed irrigation levels 75 et0 50 et0 and 25 et0 the lowest δtc values were observed in rudbeckia hirta followed by althaea rosea leaf shape and size variations can affect canopy temperature in similar conditions basra 1997 the difference between canopy temperature tc and air temperature ta has been used to assess stress responses howell et al 1986 water use pinter et al 1990 and tolerance to drought in plants blum et al 1989 therefore this trait may have more utility for indirect estimating of gs in breeding schedules roohi et al 2015 the lower δtc in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea could be explained by changes in leaf angle zheng et al 2008 and the degree of pubescence of the stems and leaves gersony et al 2016 in fact low δtc led to drought tolerance by maintenance of physiological function and turgor olivares villegas et al 2007 the canopy temperatures of malva sylvestris at all levels of irrigation were greater than air temperatures henson 2005 reported similar responses in impatiens x walleriana and begonia carrieri hort vodka in his report rudbeckia hirta had the greatest canopy temperatures at 0 et0 and 25 et0 5 169 and 2 62 c respectively and there was no significant difference through 50 et0 to 100 et0 and through 25 et0 to 75 et0 greater δtcs and higher leaf desiccation values in malva sylvestris and callistephus chinesis in 25 et0 were in agreement with the results obtained by blum et al 1999 on rice the data also indicated that there were significant negative relationships between δtc and biomass for plant species under drought stress conditions table 6 landscape plant species are assessed for their aesthetic appearance and not for their yield therefore the conception of optimum yield and growth is not applicable to urban landscape plants shaw and pittenger 2004 as previously reported cooler canopy led to more grain yield in wheat triticale and barley ayeneh et al 2002 roohi et al 2015 our results indicated a significant negative correlation between δtc and plants appearance floral and landscape impact rating under drought conditions a positive correlation was found between δtc and sla in althaea rosea under drought stress condition r 996 p 0 01 while there was no significant correlation for these factors among other species similar to these results a significantly positive correlation between sla and canopy temperature was previously reported in three cereal species under drought conditions roohi et al 2015 the δtc was not correlated with wuei and wueb in our current study contrary to these results alderfasi and morgan 1998 reported that there was negative associations between canopy temperature and crop water use efficiency of biomass in addition a negative correlation was observed between δtc and stomatal conductance under drought conditions table 6 roohi et al 2015 had similar report for relationship of canopy temperature and gs on cereal species 3 5 stomatal conductance regardless of the irrigation regime there was no significant difference in stomatal conductance of malva sylvestris when compared with rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinesis plants in the control treatment 100 et0 had 4 17 and 27 higher stomatal conductance than the plants treated with 75 et0 50 et0 and 25 et0 respectively no significant difference was observed between all the plant species at 25 et0 malva sylvestris rudbeckia hirta and callistephus chinesis had similar pattern at 50 et0 and 75 et0 comparison of the different irrigation treatments within althaea rosea showed a significant decreases in stomatal conductance althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta with 25 et0 showed the most decreases in this trait as compared to their control plants 31 and 28 respectively 3 6 ash content a comparison between the leaf ash means of the four species illustrated that rudbeckia hirta had the highest value followed by malva sylvestris althaea rosea and callistephus chinesis respectively table 4 as expected there was a significant decreasing trend in ash content of the plants as drought stress treatment become severe leaf ash varied from 14 63 to 22 98 under the control irrigation conditions with the minimum and maximum belonging to callistephus chinesis and rudbeckia hirta respectively in althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta this trait was significantly decreased as the irrigation level was decreased rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea under 25 et0 indicated a greater decrease in this trait as compared to their corresponding control plants 29 and 26 respectively leaf ash content was decreased with increasing the level of drought stress as previously observed in barley and wheat voltas et al 1998 araus et al 1998 drought stress affects the species by inducing stomata closure cai et al 2012 the stomatal closure as a response to drought stress levels were similar among rudbeckia hirta callistephus chinensis and malva sylvestris species in the current study callistephus chinensis and malva sylvestris had less sensitive stomatas to drought levels compared with althaea rosea it has been documented that osmotic adjustment plays an important role in maintenance of higher stomatal conductance and drought resistance therefore as an additional drought resistance strategy higher visual quality in rudbeckia hirta like other rudbeckia species could be related to osmotic adjustment prevete et al 2000 observational comparisons of the results showed that the pattern of stomatal conductance gs between the plant species was similar to that for ash contents among the species table 4 furthermore significant positive correlations were observed between the leaf ash content and the stomatal conductance gs across the plant species when treatments were plotted together see fig 5 there is a close correlation between water status of the plants gs and mineral accumulation in leaves which is discussed by cabrera bosquet et al 2009 on maize 3 7 water use efficiency wue in ranking the plant species rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea were seen as superior in term of wuei 6 76 cm l and wueb 3 73 g l compared to the rest of the plant species respectively this wuei value was 93 60 and 29 greater than the wuei values of callistephus chinensis malva sylvestris and althaea rosea respectively the amount of wueb was 30 35 and 88 higher than wueb amounts of rudbeckia hirta malva sylvestris and callistephus chinensis respectively treatment comparisons average for all species indicated that differences in wuei were significantly increased as the degree of drought stress increased in case of wueb none of the irrigation treatments except 25 et0 was found to be significantly different irrigation treatment regimens had no significant effects on wueb and wuei of callistephus chinensis in case of wuei similar response was found in malva sylvestris compared with the control irrigated plants wuei of rudbeckia hirta althaea rosea and malva sylvestris was increased by 179 102 and 28 respectively under 25 et0 table 5 there is no general agreement on how water deficiency affects water use efficiency tanner and sinclair 1983 discussed that reduction of dry matter is almost as much as the decline in transpiration is thus wue is not affected higher wue is mostly influenced by a consequence of decreased water use rather than assimilation or pure enhancement in plant production blum 2005 unlike agriculture in urban landscape improving wue does not necessarily mean improving the overall yield or growth the ultimate goal is rather to achieve more efficient use of water for suitable aesthetic appearance and plant fitness stabler and martin 2000 an increase in wue under drought stress has been observed by several researchers in ornamental plant species such as woody ornamentals cameron et al 2006 catharanthus roseus jaleel et al 2008 dianthus álvarez et al 2009 and callistemon citrinus álvarez and sánchez blanco 2013 our estimation of higher wue under lower irrigation agreed with those of tyler et al 1996 who observed cotoneaster dammeri skogholm under a leaching fraction lf 0 0 0 2 had 29 greater water use efficiency than plants under high lf 0 4 0 6 similar response of water stress on wue which we achieved in callistephus chinensis has been reported in pelargonium zonale andersson 2000 in case of althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta higher thickness better light interception chaves et al 2002 presence of trichomes dunkić et al 2001 and decreased leaf area lazaridou and koutroubas 2004 huang et al 2005 may lead to a better water saving and improvement in wue therefore wue could be considered as an index of the ability of the plant species to save water under dry conditions fang et al 2010 3 8 relationship between wue and stress related parameters there were negative relationships between wueb and stomatal conductance r2 0 71 and r2 0 70 and a highly negative relationship between wuei and stomatal conductance r2 0 86 and r2 0 89 for rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea respectively it was shown that there was negative relationship between wuei and stomatal conductance for malva sylvestris r2 0 61 also ash content had negative relationships with wuei r2 0 85 r2 0 88 and wueb r2 0 59 r2 0 74 in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea respectively such negative relationships between sla and wuei r2 0 87 r2 0 87 and sla and wueb r2 0 59 r2 0 66 was also observed in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea as mentioned above there was no relationship between wue and δtc among the plant species some researchers reported a negative correlation between wue and sla assuming an adaptive value of sla by water loss reduction in thicker leaves warren et al 2005 stomatal conductance had a critical role for water balance and wue tuberosa 2012 our result was consistent with mckay et al 2003 who reported that decreasing stomatal conductance and increasing wue could led to more drought resistance also the relationship between ash content and wue indicated that using ash as selection criteria for species with higher wue would present a reasonable cost and simple procedure frank et al 1997 3 9 irrigation level thresholds the experiment determined the following irrigation level thresholds for each species to attain satisfying growth and visual quality in case of malva sylvestris critical level of irrigation was between 75 and 100 et0 for althaea rosea it lied between 25 and 50 et0 for callistephus chinensis it was between 50 and 75 et0 and for rudbeckia hirta it was between 25 and 50 et0 the critical level of irrigation of malva sylvestris and callistephus chinensis were similar to the critical irrigation level in impatiens x walleriana and begonia carrieri hort vodka henson 2005 the lowest irrigation level for maintaining acceptable quality in rudbeckia hirta was opposed to henson 2005 results in his report the critical level of irrigation for acceptable visual scores were between 0 and 25 et0 while the essential level of irrigation for final percent cover was between 25 and 50 et0 3 10 visual ratings landscape impact appearance impact and floral impact were meaningfully different at the treatment species and species treatment levels landscape impact rating indicated the overall influence of plants on the landscape appearance from floral and foliage appearance to the appearance that pest or disease problems may bring through all the drought stress levels rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea had the greatest landscape impacts see fig 1 althaea rosea showed a significantly different leaf rolling under 50 and 25 irrigation levels see fig 2 in presence of direct sunlight and once every two days irrigation frequency malva sylvestris s leaf edges were burned even under 100 et0 irrigation treatment therefore daily irrigation and growing in partly shade conditions would be important factors for increasing visual quality of malva sylvestris in our study althaea rosea and callistephus chinensis took the highest and lowest floral impact in 25 et0 irrigation treatment respectively drought had detrimental effects on foliage and plant appearance of malva sylvestris however there was no significant effect on its floral appearance across irrigation treatment levels from 75 to 25 et0 see fig 3 only althaea rosea maintained a plant appearance rating of three scores or more out of 5 for the lowest watering level of 25 et0 the plant appearance findings indicated that 75 et0 was a minimum irrigation level to maintain plant appearance in callistephus chinensis and malva sylvestris whereas this level was 50 et0 for rudbeckia hirta see fig 4 regarding the conducted investigations in malva sylvestris and althaea rosea there are differences on trichome types and also on the length of the trichomes kim and lee 2005 romitelli and martins 2013 therefore longer four types of trichomes of althaea rosea had more important role in protection of the plant against drought stress compared to the shorter one type of the trichomes in malva sylvestris in spite of being native to iran malva sylvestris had less ability to maintain landscape performance and adapt to conditions of limited available water than an exotic species as rudbeckia hirta therefore a native plant is not certainly the most drought resistant wade et al 2010 combining well adapted exotic with native species is as a way to create a beautiful landscape with conserving water several factors contribute to drought tolerance of plants for example rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea reduced their water loss by modifying their leaf shape or orientation lampinen et al 2004 decreasing their leaf and shoot growth cameron et al 1999 and closing their stomata panković et al 1999 4 conclusion our results showed that drought tolerance of plants is associated with fundamental plant traits and there is a large variation on drought tolerance mechanism among the plant species the higher thickness decreased leaf area and trichomes are suitable indices for prospecting drought tolerance in species althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta use stomatal closure to fit as drought tolerant plants althaea rosea and rudbeckia hirta compared to other plant species had higher wuei under drought it appears callistephus chinensis and especially malva sylvestris are not proper species under minimal landscape irrigation due to witling and leaf firing responses of rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea to drought stress can be attributed to their desiccation avoidance strategies these strategies are achieved via decreasing water loss by trichomes modifying shape and leaf orientation reducing stomatal aperture and leaf area these responses are more aesthetically acceptable than desiccation tolerance mechanisms such as wilting in landscape planting all in all considering propensity responses for drought tolerance in rudbeckia hirta and althaea rosea these plant species appears to be appropriate plant candidates for water wise landscaping the results of this study showed that even though malva sylvestris was a native species it did not pass the test for urban landscaping with low water use rudbeckia hirta was not native but showed a great positive response to drought stress therefore having a strategy to use both native and exotic drought resistant plants may better assist in achieving more sustainable low water use landscaping acknowledgements we would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their constructive comments and advice also we appreciate editorial
