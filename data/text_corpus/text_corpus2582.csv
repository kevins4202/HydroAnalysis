oxidizing enzyme by introducing mnb technology graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micro nano bubbles laccase bisphenol hydroxyl radical degradation 1 introduction phenolic compounds as important industrial materials have garnered substantial interest due to their poor biodegradability long term ecological damage and high toxicity 1 they frequently occur in industrial wastewater and cause serious harm to the aqueous environment and human health 2 4 bisphenols like bisphenol a bpa bisphenol b bpb bisphenol c bpc bisphenol f bpf and bisphenol s bps are a class of compounds containing two phenol rings which are connected by a short spacer group bpa is the most commonly known bisphenol and has been widely used for the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins 5 numerous studies have shown that bpa is an endocrine disrupting chemical that interferes functions of the hormonal system in humans and animals and even has been shown to cause diverse diseases 6 8 many techniques including adsorption 9 fenton reaction 10 activated persulfate oxidation 11 ozonation 12 catalytic oxidation 13 photocatalysis 14 electrocatalysis 15 sonocatalytic degradation 16 biodegradation 17 and enzyme degradation 18 19 have been explored to remove bpa from wastewater however the adoption of these remediation strategies is limited due to high cost low efficiency and toxic by products enzymatic treatment of contaminants in wastewater has the advantages of high catalytic efficiency strong substrate specificity mild operation conditions and low toxic degradation byproducts are considerably significant 20 laccase lac a copper containing oxidative enzyme that has been applied in industrial applications extensively exhibits excellent catalytic activity to convert phenolic compounds 21 24 a considerable research effort has been focused on the immobilization of lac to improve the enzyme performance and to realize a continuous process for bpa removal 25 28 although the enzyme stability is generally improved enzyme immobilization approaches can be expensive and commonly result in 10 90 decrease in enzyme activity 29 the addition of rhamnolipids enhances bpa removal about 23 increase by free lac due to improved enzyme stability in the presence of the biosurfactant 30 ji zhang huang and huang 31 found that the addition of nonionic surfactant triton x 100 to the reaction system also increased bpa degradation ivanec goranina kulys bachmatova marcinkeviciene and meskys 32 reported that the use of 3 phenoxazin 10 ylpropane 1 sulfonic acid as a mediator of lac increased the catalyzed initial oxidation rate of bpa up to 3 times compared to the rate without added mediator although various additives and mediators have been investigated to enhance enzyme stability enzyme activity and reaction kinetics during the removal of bpa these additions may introduce more water pollution more recently the hybrid process of water treatment has been shown to lead to more extensive degradation of the contaminants than achieved with the individual processes on its own which is attributed to the synergistic effect between individual techniques 33 ultrasound assisted lac ul lac not only improves ciprofloxacin hydrochloride degradation 43 increase but also declines processing time significantly 34 this hybrid process exhibits 5 3 folds higher chlortetracycline removal compared to individual lac treatment 35 ul cavitation can generate hydroxyl radical oh which plays a crucial role in enhancing lac activity and also improve the interaction between enzyme and substrate molecules micro nano bubbles mnb referring to bubbles with diameters ranging from tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers have attracted recent attention owing to the advantages including large specific surface area a negatively charged surface long residence time in water high mass transfer efficiency and the generation of highly reactive free radicals 36 37 based on these specific characteristics mnb has been widely used in the treatment of wastewater and even sludge phenol contaminated wastewater has been treated using the mnb technique resulting in 60 phenol decomposition in 2 h 38 it has been demonstrated that hydroxyl radical oh which is effective oxidant plays an important role in the degradation of phenol recently more attention has been paid to the development of hybrid processes involving mnb and other techniques for degrading pollutants in water the environmentally benign mnb ozone treatment has been found to be an effective way for the destruction of phenol in water 39 the hybrid process of mnb and microelectrolysis has been successfully employed to treat phenol containing water with high efficiency 40 the photocatalytic activity of anatase phase tio2 nanoparticles in an aqueous solution was significantly enhanced by the presence of mnb and the removal rate of methylene blue increased by 41 141 using the novelty process 41 tetracycline was removed effectively 92 43 by an mnb h2o2 hybrid system which was an improvement of 3 94 folds compared to h2o2 alone 42 however to the best of our knowledge no prior work has studied the feasibility of the combined process of mnb and lac for wastewater treatment the aim of this work is to construct mnb assisted lac mnb lac system for the degradation of bisphenols bpa was chosen as a model compound to assess the feasibility of mnb lac for removing contaminants in water by direct comparison to lac only mnb only ul only ul lac and ul mnb lac the influences of various operational parameters including the initial pollutant concentration temperature air intake ph outlet pipe length and lac concentration on bpa removal by the hybrid mnb lac system were systematically investigated in order to optimize the degradation conditions and to gain insight into the mechanism of the process furthermore the broader applicability of the hybrid process was evaluated using other bisphenols bpb and bpc as contaminants 2 experimental 2 1 materials trametes versicolor lac 120 u g 1 was obtained from shanghai yuanye biological co ltd bpa was collected from adamas reagent co ltd bpb and bpc

of mnb lac used for bpa degradation is depicted in fig 1 mnb were produced by a lf 1500 micro nano bubbles generator mnb generator from shanghai xing heng technology co ltd shanghai china the averaged particle size of bubbles for lf 1500 was 199 9 14 9 nm and the concentration of bubbles was 3 44 108 3 54 106 particles ml as shown in fig s1 the d10 d50 and d90 was 110 6 6 5 nm 165 0 6 0 nm and 319 0 41 5 nm respectively a similar observation with the same mnb generator was reported by wang liu lyu pan and li 43 the inlet pipe and outlet pipe with the same internal diameter 9 mm from the equipment were introduced into the glass container 1 l the length of the inlet pipe 1 5 m was fixed and the length of the outlet pipe was changed as required the test pressure of the generator was a fixed value 0 5 mpa a water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the container bpa solution and lac solution were put in the container before turning on the generator button the liquid turns milky and circulates under the action of mnb in the process of operation aliquots were withdrawn ethyl acetate was added containing 1 0 mm 1 octanol as internal reference and the samples were dried over mgso4 and analyzed by gc 2 4 comparison of bpa degradation by several strategies six different strategies including lac ul ul lac mnb mnb lac and ul mnb lac were carried out to compare bpa degradation efficiency the initial bpa concentration was 1 0 mm 500 ml ph 8 and lac concentration was 1 20 g l 1 temperature was fixed at 30 c the reaction was performed in a shaker 150 rpm when lac was used alone a kq3200de ul system from kun shan ultrasonic instruments co ltd kunshan china was employed the power input and frequency of ul was 60 w and 40 khz respectively the air intake of mnb generator was controlled at 30 ml min 1 samples were taken for determining the bpa concentration at different time intervals 2 5 influences of several factors on bpa degradation with mnb lac the effects of the initial bpa concentration temperature air intake ph outlet pipe length and lac concentration on bpa degradation with mnb lac were evaluated thoroughly initial bpa concentration 0 5 1 0 1 5 3 0 and 5 0 mm temperature of reaction system 20 30 40 50 and 60 c air intake of mnb 6 15 30 45 and 60 ml min 1 ph 3 5 7 8 9 10 11 outlet pipe length 1 5 4 0 and 8 6 m and lac concentration 0 18 0 30 0 60 and 1 20 g l 1 were investigated using 500 ml bpa solution for 180 min the residual bpa in the reactor was monitored alternately 2 6 active substances of bpa degradation with mnb lac the active substances of bpa degradation with mnb lac were studied by free radical quenching experiments tba and thu 2 ml was selected as quenching agents respectively different thu concentrations were also tested the other conditions for bpa degradation with mnb lac were performed according the results from section 2 5 during the reaction bpa concentration was detected by gc 2 7 products of bpa degradation with mnb lac degradation products of bpa by mnb lac under the optimum parameters were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms qp2020nx shimadzu japan with a sh rxi 5sil

4 min 20 c min to 300 c hold 5 min the injection volume is 1 μl ion source temperature is 220 c interface temperature is 250 c the analysis full scan range is 35 610 m z and solvent delay is 2 min 2 8 applications of mnb lac for the degradation of bisphenols comparative degradations with mnb lac for bpa bpb and bpc were performed separately the same initial concentration 1 0 mm for all contaminants was chosen under the optimum parameters bpb and bpc were detected using the same method as for bpa the retention time for bpb and bpc was 9 53 min and 8 78 min respectively degraded products of bpb and bpc were analyzed as described in section 2 7 in addition the degradation for the mixture of three substances was carried out under the same reaction conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 validity of mnb lac for bpa degradation mnb lac hybrid system constructed for bpa degradation is illustrated in fig 1 five different approaches of bpa removal were performed to compare with the mnb lac hybrid strategy as shown in fig 2a bpa degradation increased gradually over time and reached a maximum 19 2 1 8 after 90 min when lac was used alone the removal is significantly lower than previously reported results 44 45 due to the clear distinction of reaction conditions in particularly the ph value the bpa concentration using ul only treatment remained essentially unchanged all the time so there was no significant conversion an obvious improvement of bpa degradation with ul lac was observed as compared to ul only ul assistance for lac treatment caused a slight increase in the degradation after 60 min we attribute the improved efficiency to an increase in lac activity and a higher oxygen mass transfer rate between enzyme and substrate molecules due to ul 34 35 however the degradation with ul lac do not increase as much as reported by pulicharla das brar drogui and surampalli 35 which may be attributable to the difference in substrate structure although individual mnb achieved the highest initial bpa degradation in the first 5 min the degradation was lower than the degradation with the lac and ul lac after 90 min mnb lac showed an impressive bpa degradation of over 51 9 compared to individual lac 19 2 1 8 individual ul 0 ul lac 24 3 3 6 individual mnb 15 5 1 8 and ul mnb lac 41 7 1 0 under similar conditions 90 min mnb lac treatment also achieved higher bpa degradation in lower time 29 9 0 8 5 min than the other methods the bpa degradation reached 63 4 0 6 and 71 8 1 8 after 180 min and 360 min respectively the utilization of mnb for bpa degradation in the presence of lac has a significant synergistic effect on the degradation efficiency however ul induces gradually the oscillation and collapse of bubbles during the process of ul mnb lac which may result in the decline of oh and o2 concentration 46 therefore bpa removal using ul mnb lac was slightly lower than that using mnb lac the procedural switch between lac and mnb lac on bpa degradation was investigated to firmly establish the effectiveness of mnb lac as depicted in fig 2b bpa degradation stalled when the mnb lac process was switched to a lac only process after 90 min the opposite phenomenon was clearly observed when the lac only process was switched to mnb lac after 90 min this clearly demonstrates that the combined use of mnb and lac for bpa removal is feasible and effective 3 2 enhancement of bpa degradation with mnb lac by varying key factors 3 2 1 effects of initial bpa concentration and temperature a comprehensive characterization of the parameters influencing bpa degradation with mnb lac revealed that the innovative strategy is very well behaved as shown in fig 3 the relationship between bpa degradation and time at different initial bpa concentrations fig 3a showed that increasing the initial concentration from 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm resulted in a slight improvement on bpa removal an initial concentration exceeding 1 0 mm reduced markedly the removal efficiency of bpa the result is in accordance with previous reports of a decrease in relative bpa degradation by lac at higher pollutant loadings 30 44 this is related to the fact that the higher initial concentration provides a greater driving force and can overcome the mass transfer resistance however bpa degradation is no longer controlled by mass transfer when the initial concentration is high enough 15 47 48 conversely higher bpa loading contributes to the accumulation of more free radicals resulting in enzyme deactivation 49 in addition the increased bpa may also block active sites of the enzyme weakening the lac degradation ability it is well known that one of the most important factors that influences degradation processes of contaminants is temperature 50 a temperature range of 20 60 c was investigated as depicted in fig 3b it suggested that bpa conversion using mnb lac was highly dependent on temperature bpa degradation increased with the raising temperature 40 c while it decreased gradually at higher temperatures 40 c at any conversion time the curves with bell shaped trends showing the effect of temperature on the mnb lac process are similar to that of the individual enzyme operation nevertheless the optimal temperature 40 c of the mnb lac process is slightly lower than the previously found value 50 c 30 for treating bpa with trametes versicolor lac alone this is due to the fact that the effect of temperature on bubble generation is actually dramatic an increment in the temperature leads to increases in the vapor pressure and decrease in the viscosity surface tension and gas solubility furthermore all of these changed properties with the increasing temperature have been shown to result in a significant decrease in the bubble number 51 52 a higher bubble number at lower temperature contributed to the increased bpa degradation therefore the optimum bpa conversion using mnb lac at 40 c arises from the counteractive impact of temperature on bubble formation and lac activity 3 2 2 effects of air intake and ph the most efficient air intake rate was found to be 30 ml min 1 fig 3c quite interestingly bpa degradation increased gradually with air intake rate up to 30 ml min 1 and gradually decreased above 30 ml min 1 air intake the possible reason is that changes in air intake has effects on the concentration of dissolved oxygen and bubble formation oxygen is the substrate of lac and it is reduced directly to water by a four electron mediator less mechanism with concomitant one electron oxidation of an organic substrate like bpa 53 increases in air intake lead to higher oxygen dissolution until it reaches saturation 54 however the overflowing air into the system might not contribute to the dissolved oxygen concentration if the time for oxygen dissolved in the water is too short or the bubble size is too large additionally the bubble concentration increases with the increased air intake firstly and then rapidly declines as larger bubbles are formed 55 consequently these findings suggested that the optimal air intake for bpa degradation with mnb lac is a compromise between dissolved oxygen and bubble amount a strong ph dependence of lac has been reported previously and the ph optimum of the activity of trametes versicolor lac is at ph 4 0 5 5 to maintain its structural integrity 22 35 45 53 56 57 the ph dependence for bpa degradation with mnb lac was similar at all reaction times fig 3d interestingly high bpa degradation with mnb lac was obtained under alkaline conditions ph 8 10 and unsatisfactory degradation was observed at acidic ph values these results contradict the earlier investigations 45 56 57 which claimed that lac showed high removal ability of bpa under acidic conditions hydroxyl radical could be produced by the collapse of air mnb in absence of a dynamic stimulus 36 58 59 it has been verified that oh can enhance lac activity directly by serving as a much more efficient electron acceptor compared with o2 and indirectly by oxidizing substrates 60 moreover lac activity can be improved more effectively than oxidizing substrates by oh the value of ph has a significant influence on the quantity of oh produced by mnb it is well known that alkaline solution with hydroxide ions can promote the production of oh 36 38 in addition although the uncharged bpa is as readily hydrated as the ionized form the solubility of bpa increases slightly at high ph around the pk a value 9 56 61 63 the ionized bpa may be more susceptible to degradation compared with the uncharged form as a result the enhanced lac activity the increased oh production and ionized form of the substrate facilitate the decomposition of bpa under alkaline conditions 3 2 3 effects of outlet pipe length and lac concentration fig 3e shows the influences of outlet pipe length and enzyme concentration on bpa degradation with mnb lac surprisingly the efficiency of bpa degradation is directly proportional to the outlet pipe length of mnb generator fig 3e bpa degradation raised from 62 8 0 6 to 95 5 0 7 with the increased length from 1 5 m to 8 6 m at 180 min many factors including the length diameter and type of outlet pipe have essential impacts on the bubble size 36 64 the bubble size tends to decrease when the length of outlet pipe at the front of the valve increases as the bubbles become smaller the increased mass transfer efficiency leads to more effective bpa degradation 36 the effect of the lac concentration on bpa degradation efficiency was tested over a wide concentration range from 0 18 to 1 20 g l 1 fig 3e increasing lac concentration from 0 18 g l 1 to 0 60 g l 1 positively influenced the removal efficiency of bpa which may be resulted from increases in the total active sites of enzyme further increasing the enzyme concentration to above 0 60 g l 1 resulted in only a slight increase in bpa degradation this result was consistent with previous investigations on bpa degradation with lac 30 31 65 it was suggested that the reaction system is rate controlling above this lac concentration one way analysis of variance was performed to check the statistical significance of these parameters on bpa degradation using mnb lac table s1 a small p value indicates great significance of this factor and vice versa the factors p 0 01 including bpa concentration p 0 0013 ph p 0 0004 outlet pipe length p 0 0008 and lac concentration p 0 0046 are highly significant and very important on bpa removal the p value of 0 0484 for temperature is 0 05 which means the factor is significant and important air intake p 0 0891 0 05 p 0 2 has a weak significance and a faint influence on the experimental results additionally the highest bpa degradation obtained was 95 5 0 7 under the optimum operating conditions including 0 60 g l 1 lac 1 0 mm bpa ph 8 40 c 30 ml min 1 air intake and 8 6 m outlet pipe mnb lac treatment showed 5 0 3 9 6 2 and 2 3 folds higher extent of bpa degradation compared to lac ul lac mnb and ul mnb lac treatment respectively the obtained results highlighted the enhanced bpa degradation and efficiency during mnb lac treatment which can be further adapted to remove other phenols 3 3 mechanism of bpa degradation by mnb lac the generation of hydroxyl radical which has a strong oxidation effect with the continuous shrinkage and collapse of bubbles in water has been demonstrated previously 36 58 66 67 bpa can be effectively eliminated by mnb due to the oh production as illustrated in fig 2a zhao xiang huang liu and tan 60 pointed that oh generation causes the enhancement of lac activity by 7 7 20 4 inclusion of thu 68 and tba 42 69 as scavengers of oh reduced the degradation efficiency of bpa with mnb lac fig 4a moreover the inhibition in bpa degradation was thu concentration dependent fig 4b we therefore propose that oh plays a dominant role in promoting bpa degradation using mnb lac oxygen a second substrate can contribute to all reduction steps of the enzymatic reaction by lac 53 the most common application of mnb is greatly improves the solubility of gas in water particularly o2 36 64 70 the enhanced o2 amount in aqueous solution also accounts for the increased bpa removal therefore the introduction of mnb increases the lac activity with oh and improves the conversion of substrate with o2 contributing to the enhanced bpa removal by lac in addition as discussed earlier high mass transfer efficiency caused by mnb facilitates the degradation with mnb lac overall the proposed mechanism of bpa degradation by mnb lac is illustrated in fig 4c oh generation high o2 solubility and high mass transfer efficiency induced by mnb are the important drivers behind the accelerated bpa degradation using lac however more specific proof is required to fully understand the precise molecular mechanism of mnb lac 3 4 applicability of mnb lac for bisphenols removal encouraged by the results described above the applicability of mnb lac was further explored for other bisphenols including bpb and bpc under the optimal conditions identified for bpa mnb lac exhibited a degradation efficiency in the following order bpb 98 4 0 6 bpc 96 8 1 9 bpa 95 5 0 7 when these bisphenols were investigated separately fig 5a b and c however this isn t in agreement with the published results for lac conversion of the different bisphenols 44 71 previously bisphenols with a simpler structure and lower molecular weight were found to exhibit better removal efficiency by lac a plausible explanation is that three bisphenols are treated by mnb lac under alkaline condition instead of acidic conditions for the lac only results reported previously the degradation products of bpa bpb and bpc based on the analysis of gc ms are shown in fig 5e f and g respectively interestingly a small amount of bpa was detected during bpb degradation in fig 5b and it was confirmed by gc ms further as shown in fig 5f more different products were identified after using mnb lac than that using lac only particularly in case of bpa 72 73 a number of similar products were observed for different bisphenols due to similarities in the bisphenolic structure this maybe indicate that these bisphenols follow a similar degradation pathway to form these products however further study will clarify the degradation pathway of bisphenols using the mnb lac process in addition the conversion of an equimolar mixture of the three bisphenols by mnb lac was investigated fig 5d interestingly the removal efficiency of bpb and bpc were significantly higher than that of bpa the removal order in the mixture is bpc bpb bpa and this is different from the order in the individual conversion reactions of the different bisphenols we attribute this to the fact that bpa is one of the degradation products of bpb which may inhibit bpb degradation moreover bpa generated by bpb degradation leads to the low apparent bpa removal 4 conclusions the feasibility of the hybrid process combining mnb with lac was verified by removing bpa from contaminated water the process parameters including initial substrate concentration temperature ph outlet pipe length and lac concentration were found to have significant impact on bpa degradation by mnb lac especially the alkaline environment and extended length of outlet pipe contributed to a high degradation efficiency the most efficient bpa removal of 95 5 0 7 was achieved under the optimal conditions this was 5 0 3 9 6 2 and 2 3 folds higher bpa degradation compared to lac ul lac mnb and ul mnb lac treatment respectively the generation of oh high o2 solubility and high mass transfer efficiency induced by mnb contribute to a synergic effect enhancing bpa degradation by lac the removal efficiency of three different bisphenols individually was higher than that in an equimolar mixture of the three and the corresponding degradation products were identified this work represents a novel contribution towards the development of a hybrid process for treating phenolic contaminated water effectively under environment friendly conditions more research is needed to clarify the precise molecular mechanism of mnb

of mnb lac used for bpa degradation is depicted in fig 1 mnb were produced by a lf 1500 micro nano bubbles generator mnb generator from shanghai xing heng technology co ltd shanghai china the averaged particle size of bubbles for lf 1500 was 199 9 14 9 nm and the concentration of bubbles was 3 44 108 3 54 106 particles ml as shown in fig s1 the d10 d50 and d90 was 110 6 6 5 nm 165 0 6 0 nm and 319 0 41 5 nm respectively a similar observation with the same mnb generator was reported by wang liu lyu pan and li 43 the inlet pipe and outlet pipe with the same internal diameter 9 mm from the equipment were introduced into the glass container 1 l the length of the inlet pipe 1 5 m was fixed and the length of the outlet pipe was changed as required the test pressure of the generator was a fixed value 0 5 mpa a water bath was used to maintain the temperature of the container bpa solution and lac solution were put in the container before turning on the generator button the liquid turns milky and circulates under the action of mnb in the process of operation aliquots were withdrawn ethyl acetate was added containing 1 0 mm 1 octanol as internal reference and the samples were dried over mgso4 and analyzed by gc 2 4 comparison of bpa degradation by several strategies six different strategies including lac ul ul lac mnb mnb lac and ul mnb lac were carried out to compare bpa degradation efficiency the initial bpa concentration was 1 0 mm 500 ml ph 8 and lac concentration was 1 20 g l 1 temperature was fixed at 30 c the reaction was performed in a shaker 150 rpm when lac was used alone a kq3200de ul system from kun shan ultrasonic instruments co ltd kunshan china was employed the power input and frequency of ul was 60 w and 40 khz respectively the air intake of mnb generator was controlled at 30 ml min 1 samples were taken for determining the bpa concentration at different time intervals 2 5 influences of several factors on bpa degradation with mnb lac the effects of the initial bpa concentration temperature air intake ph outlet pipe length and lac concentration on bpa degradation with mnb lac were evaluated thoroughly initial bpa concentration 0 5 1 0 1 5 3 0 and 5 0 mm temperature of reaction system 20 30 40 50 and 60 c air intake of mnb 6 15 30 45 and 60 ml min 1 ph 3 5 7 8 9 10 11 outlet pipe length 1 5 4 0 and 8 6 m and lac concentration 0 18 0 30 0 60 and 1 20 g l 1 were investigated using 500 ml bpa solution for 180 min the residual bpa in the reactor was monitored alternately 2 6 active substances of bpa degradation with mnb lac the active substances of bpa degradation with mnb lac were studied by free radical quenching experiments tba and thu 2 ml was selected as quenching agents respectively different thu concentrations were also tested the other conditions for bpa degradation with mnb lac were performed according the results from section 2 5 during the reaction bpa concentration was detected by gc 2 7 products of bpa degradation with mnb lac degradation products of bpa by mnb lac under the optimum parameters were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms qp2020nx shimadzu japan with a sh rxi 5sil

4 min 20 c min to 300 c hold 5 min the injection volume is 1 μl ion source temperature is 220 c interface temperature is 250 c the analysis full scan range is 35 610 m z and solvent delay is 2 min 2 8 applications of mnb lac for the degradation of bisphenols comparative degradations with mnb lac for bpa bpb and bpc were performed separately the same initial concentration 1 0 mm for all contaminants was chosen under the optimum parameters bpb and bpc were detected using the same method as for bpa the retention time for bpb and bpc was 9 53 min and 8 78 min respectively degraded products of bpb and bpc were analyzed as described in section 2 7 in addition the degradation for the mixture of three substances was carried out under the same reaction conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 validity of mnb lac for bpa degradation mnb lac hybrid system constructed for bpa degradation is illustrated in fig 1 five different approaches of bpa removal were performed to compare with the mnb lac hybrid strategy as shown in fig 2a bpa degradation increased gradually over time and reached a maximum 19 2 1 8 after 90 min when lac was used alone the removal is significantly lower than previously reported results 44 45 due to the clear distinction of reaction conditions in particularly the ph value the bpa concentration using ul only treatment remained essentially unchanged all the time so there was no significant conversion an obvious improvement of bpa degradation with ul lac was observed as compared to ul only ul assistance for lac treatment caused a slight increase in the degradation after 60 min we attribute the improved efficiency to an increase in lac activity and a higher oxygen mass transfer rate between enzyme and substrate molecules due to ul 34 35 however the degradation with ul lac do not increase as much as reported by pulicharla das brar drogui and surampalli 35 which may be attributable to the difference in substrate structure although individual mnb achieved the highest initial bpa degradation in the first 5 min the degradation was lower than the degradation with the lac and ul lac after 90 min mnb lac showed an impressive bpa degradation of over 51 9 compared to individual lac 19 2 1 8 individual ul 0 ul lac 24 3 3 6 individual mnb 15 5 1 8 and ul mnb lac 41 7 1 0 under similar conditions 90 min mnb lac treatment also achieved higher bpa degradation in lower time 29 9 0 8 5 min than the other methods the bpa degradation reached 63 4 0 6 and 71 8 1 8 after 180 min and 360 min respectively the utilization of mnb for bpa degradation in the presence of lac has a significant synergistic effect on the degradation efficiency however ul induces gradually the oscillation and collapse of bubbles during the process of ul mnb lac which may result in the decline of oh and o2 concentration 46 therefore bpa removal using ul mnb lac was slightly lower than that using mnb lac the procedural switch between lac and mnb lac on bpa degradation was investigated to firmly establish the effectiveness of mnb lac as depicted in fig 2b bpa degradation stalled when the mnb lac process was switched to a lac only process after 90 min the opposite phenomenon was clearly observed when the lac only process was switched to mnb lac after 90 min this clearly demonstrates that the combined use of mnb and lac for bpa removal is feasible and effective 3 2 enhancement of bpa degradation with mnb lac by varying key factors 3 2 1 effects of initial bpa concentration and temperature a comprehensive characterization of the parameters influencing bpa degradation with mnb lac revealed that the innovative strategy is very well behaved as shown in fig 3 the relationship between bpa degradation and time at different initial bpa concentrations fig 3a showed that increasing the initial concentration from 0 5 mm to 1 0 mm resulted in a slight improvement on bpa removal an initial concentration exceeding 1 0 mm reduced markedly the removal efficiency of bpa the result is in accordance with previous reports of a decrease in relative bpa degradation by lac at higher pollutant loadings 30 44 this is related to the fact that the higher initial concentration provides a greater driving force and can overcome the mass transfer resistance however bpa degradation is no longer controlled by mass transfer when the initial concentration is high enough 15 47 48 conversely higher bpa loading contributes to the accumulation of more free radicals resulting in enzyme deactivation 49 in addition the increased bpa may also block active sites of the enzyme weakening the lac degradation ability it is well known that one of the most important factors that influences degradation processes of contaminants is temperature 50 a temperature range of 20 60 c was investigated as depicted in fig 3b it suggested that bpa conversion using mnb lac was highly dependent on temperature bpa degradation increased with the raising temperature 40 c while it decreased gradually at higher temperatures 40 c at any conversion time the curves with bell shaped trends showing the effect of temperature on the mnb lac process are similar to that of the individual enzyme operation nevertheless the optimal temperature 40 c of the mnb lac process is slightly lower than the previously found value 50 c 30 for treating bpa with trametes versicolor lac alone this is due to the fact that the effect of temperature on bubble generation is actually dramatic an increment in the temperature leads to increases in the vapor pressure and decrease in the viscosity surface tension and gas solubility furthermore all of these changed properties with the increasing temperature have been shown to result in a significant decrease in the bubble number 51 52 a higher bubble number at lower temperature contributed to the increased bpa degradation therefore the optimum bpa conversion using mnb lac at 40 c arises from the counteractive impact of temperature on bubble formation and lac activity 3 2 2 effects of air intake and ph the most efficient air intake rate was found to be 30 ml min 1 fig 3c quite interestingly bpa degradation increased gradually with air intake rate up to 30 ml min 1 and gradually decreased above 30 ml min 1 air intake the possible reason is that changes in air intake has effects on the concentration of dissolved oxygen and bubble formation oxygen is the substrate of lac and it is reduced directly to water by a four electron mediator less mechanism with concomitant one electron oxidation of an organic substrate like bpa 53 increases in air intake lead to higher oxygen dissolution until it reaches saturation 54 however the overflowing air into the system might not contribute to the dissolved oxygen concentration if the time for oxygen dissolved in the water is too short or the bubble size is too large additionally the bubble concentration increases with the increased air intake firstly and then rapidly declines as larger bubbles are formed 55 consequently these findings suggested that the optimal air intake for bpa degradation with mnb lac is a compromise between dissolved oxygen and bubble amount a strong ph dependence of lac has been reported previously and the ph optimum of the activity of trametes versicolor lac is at ph 4 0 5 5 to maintain its structural integrity 22 35 45 53 56 57 the ph dependence for bpa degradation with mnb lac was similar at all reaction times fig 3d interestingly high bpa degradation with mnb lac was obtained under alkaline conditions ph 8 10 and unsatisfactory degradation was observed at acidic ph values these results contradict the earlier investigations 45 56 57 which claimed that lac showed high removal ability of bpa under acidic conditions hydroxyl radical could be produced by the collapse of air mnb in absence of a dynamic stimulus 36 58 59 it has been verified that oh can enhance lac activity directly by serving as a much more efficient electron acceptor compared with o2 and indirectly by oxidizing substrates 60 moreover lac activity can be improved more effectively than oxidizing substrates by oh the value of ph has a significant influence on the quantity of oh produced by mnb it is well known that alkaline solution with hydroxide ions can promote the production of oh 36 38 in addition although the uncharged bpa is as readily hydrated as the ionized form the solubility of bpa increases slightly at high ph around the pk a value 9 56 61 63 the ionized bpa may be more susceptible to degradation compared with the uncharged form as a result the enhanced lac activity the increased oh production and ionized form of the substrate facilitate the decomposition of bpa under alkaline conditions 3 2 3 effects of outlet pipe length and lac concentration fig 3e shows the influences of outlet pipe length and enzyme concentration on bpa degradation with mnb lac surprisingly the efficiency of bpa degradation is directly proportional to the outlet pipe length of mnb generator fig 3e bpa degradation raised from 62 8 0 6 to 95 5 0 7 with the increased length from 1 5 m to 8 6 m at 180 min many factors including the length diameter and type of outlet pipe have essential impacts on the bubble size 36 64 the bubble size tends to decrease when the length of outlet pipe at the front of the valve increases as the bubbles become smaller the increased mass transfer efficiency leads to more effective bpa degradation 36 the effect of the lac concentration on bpa degradation efficiency was tested over a wide concentration range from 0 18 to 1 20 g l 1 fig 3e increasing lac concentration from 0 18 g l 1 to 0 60 g l 1 positively influenced the removal efficiency of bpa which may be resulted from increases in the total active sites of enzyme further increasing the enzyme concentration to above 0 60 g l 1 resulted in only a slight increase in bpa degradation this result was consistent with previous investigations on bpa degradation with lac 30 31 65 it was suggested that the reaction system is rate controlling above this lac concentration one way analysis of variance was performed to check the statistical significance of these parameters on bpa degradation using mnb lac table s1 a small p value indicates great significance of this factor and vice versa the factors p 0 01 including bpa concentration p 0 0013 ph p 0 0004 outlet pipe length p 0 0008 and lac concentration p 0 0046 are highly significant and very important on bpa removal the p value of 0 0484 for temperature is 0 05 which means the factor is significant and important air intake p 0 0891 0 05 p 0 2 has a weak significance and a faint influence on the experimental results additionally the highest bpa degradation obtained was 95 5 0 7 under the optimum operating conditions including 0 60 g l 1 lac 1 0 mm bpa ph 8 40 c 30 ml min 1 air intake and 8 6 m outlet pipe mnb lac treatment showed 5 0 3 9 6 2 and 2 3 folds higher extent of bpa degradation compared to lac ul lac mnb and ul mnb lac treatment respectively the obtained results highlighted the enhanced bpa degradation and efficiency during mnb lac treatment which can be further adapted to remove other phenols 3 3 mechanism of bpa degradation by mnb lac the generation of hydroxyl radical which has a strong oxidation effect with the continuous shrinkage and collapse of bubbles in water has been demonstrated previously 36 58 66 67 bpa can be effectively eliminated by mnb due to the oh production as illustrated in fig 2a zhao xiang huang liu and tan 60 pointed that oh generation causes the enhancement of lac activity by 7 7 20 4 inclusion of thu 68 and tba 42 69 as scavengers of oh reduced the degradation efficiency of bpa with mnb lac fig 4a moreover the inhibition in bpa degradation was thu concentration dependent fig 4b we therefore propose that oh plays a dominant role in promoting bpa degradation using mnb lac oxygen a second substrate can contribute to all reduction steps of the enzymatic reaction by lac 53 the most common application of mnb is greatly improves the solubility of gas in water particularly o2 36 64 70 the enhanced o2 amount in aqueous solution also accounts for the increased bpa removal therefore the introduction of mnb increases the lac activity with oh and improves the conversion of substrate with o2 contributing to the enhanced bpa removal by lac in addition as discussed earlier high mass transfer efficiency caused by mnb facilitates the degradation with mnb lac overall the proposed mechanism of bpa degradation by mnb lac is illustrated in fig 4c oh generation high o2 solubility and high mass transfer efficiency induced by mnb are the important drivers behind the accelerated bpa degradation using lac however more specific proof is required to fully understand the precise molecular mechanism of mnb lac 3 4 applicability of mnb lac for bisphenols removal encouraged by the results described above the applicability of mnb lac was further explored for other bisphenols including bpb and bpc under the optimal conditions identified for bpa mnb lac exhibited a degradation efficiency in the following order bpb 98 4 0 6 bpc 96 8 1 9 bpa 95 5 0 7 when these bisphenols were investigated separately fig 5a b and c however this isn t in agreement with the published results for lac conversion of the different bisphenols 44 71 previously bisphenols with a simpler structure and lower molecular weight were found to exhibit better removal efficiency by lac a plausible explanation is that three bisphenols are treated by mnb lac under alkaline condition instead of acidic conditions for the lac only results reported previously the degradation products of bpa bpb and bpc based on the analysis of gc ms are shown in fig 5e f and g respectively interestingly a small amount of bpa was detected during bpb degradation in fig 5b and it was confirmed by gc ms further as shown in fig 5f more different products were identified after using mnb lac than that using lac only particularly in case of bpa 72 73 a number of similar products were observed for different bisphenols due to similarities in the bisphenolic structure this maybe indicate that these bisphenols follow a similar degradation pathway to form these products however further study will clarify the degradation pathway of bisphenols using the mnb lac process in addition the conversion of an equimolar mixture of the three bisphenols by mnb lac was investigated fig 5d interestingly the removal efficiency of bpb and bpc were significantly higher than that of bpa the removal order in the mixture is bpc bpb bpa and this is different from the order in the individual conversion reactions of the different bisphenols we attribute this to the fact that bpa is one of the degradation products of bpb which may inhibit bpb degradation moreover bpa generated by bpb degradation leads to the low apparent bpa removal 4 conclusions the feasibility of the hybrid process combining mnb with lac was verified by removing bpa from contaminated water the process parameters including initial substrate concentration temperature ph outlet pipe length and lac concentration were found to have significant impact on bpa degradation by mnb lac especially the alkaline environment and extended length of outlet pipe contributed to a high degradation efficiency the most efficient bpa removal of 95 5 0 7 was achieved under the optimal conditions this was 5 0 3 9 6 2 and 2 3 folds higher bpa degradation compared to lac ul lac mnb and ul mnb lac treatment respectively the generation of oh high o2 solubility and high mass transfer efficiency induced by mnb contribute to a synergic effect enhancing bpa degradation by lac the removal efficiency of three different bisphenols individually was higher than that in an equimolar mixture of the three and the corresponding degradation products were identified this work represents a novel contribution towards the development of a hybrid process for treating phenolic contaminated water effectively under environment friendly conditions more research is needed to clarify the precise molecular mechanism of mnb

12911,the purpose of this research article is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the influence of ultrasound us power intensity on the stationary and moving microbubbles close to the membrane surface and its application on membrane fouling control compared to other imaging techniques synchrotron in line phase contrast imaging technique available at the biomedical imaging and therapy bmit beamlines at the canadian light source cls allowed for in situ quantitative analysis and real time imaging of microbubbles in water inside a membrane filtration unit an advanced non invasive synchrotron propagation based imaging pbi technique was employed to improve the contrast between the liquid and gas inside the bubble interface of liquid and gas which was crucial for the qualitative and quantitative analyses imagej software was employed for the quantitative analyses of cavitational bubbles dynamics and their characteristics at different us power intensities the bubble related parameters including the number size and fraction of total area occupied by bubbles were determined for all captured images at three different us power intensities bubble characteristics at different times of us exposure and distances from the us transducer were also studied then matlab software was used to generate the plots for the bubble size distribution and probability density for each image the effect of us power intensity on bubble velocity and its application in membrane fouling control was also investigated the generated bubbles were mostly located in the middle of the images close to the membrane surface where the us waves were detected it was also observed that the velocity of smaller bubbles was much larger than that of the larger bubbles and they tended to move toward the us transducer bubble growth was much faster at 100 w than at lower us power intensities the experimental results were in good agreement with the in situ observation of microbubbles the mass transfer across the membrane was improved as the us power increased from 25 w to 100 w this was likely due to more frequent bubble explosions and energy releases into the water medium causing turbulence flow and resulting in more membrane surface cleaning keywords bubble cavitation microbubble dynamics ultrasonic cleaning membrane fouling us power intensity 1 introduction membrane fouling is one of the serious challenges in membrane based separation processes fouling is a complex phenomenon that adds resistance to the system and negatively affects membrane selectivity and performance especially by reducing the permeate flux the deposition and accumulation of pollutants on the surface or within the interior pores of the membrane causes this phenomenon 1 therefore membrane cleaning and fouling control strategies play a crucial role in preserving the membrane capacity and filtration performance several membrane cleaning methods e g physical chemical or biological and fouling controlling techniques such as the feed pre treatment or membrane surface modification could be employed with filtration processes to remove the foulants and improve the flux 2 6 according to the previous studies ultrasound us has been considered an effective technique for cleaning various materials owing to the us cavitation and the physical chemical and thermal effects caused by acoustic waves 7 16 ultrasonic waves could be employed as an additional force for improving the filtration performance by discharging the foulants and dislodging it from the membrane surface the propagation of us wave through a liquid medium generates frequent rarefaction and compression cycles resulting in the creation of several physical phenomena us irradiation is able to create a convective current and cause a turbulence flow within the whole system the turbulence flow and shear force created near the membrane liquid boundary not only breaks the fouling layer but also hinders the foulant deposition and the concentration polarization cp development by taking the particles away from the membrane surface furthermore cavitational bubbles are formed under the alternating rarefaction and compression cycles during us irradiation cavitational bubbles can mitigate membrane fouling in the form of micro streamers by dislodging the attached particles from the membrane surface in addition microstreaming effect caused by bubble oscillation leads to an eddy current close to the membrane and deprives the particles of the membrane surface bubble explosion would also release a considerable amount of energy to the medium and cause a vigorous flow around the bubble 13 17 22 as is reported in previous studies operational parameters including frequency and power intensity of ultrasonic waves the position of the us transducer distance between the transducer and cavitational bubbles and the viscosity of the liquid medium may affect the bubble dynamics during the irradiation time 18 19 23 there has been increasing interest in using the us enhanced filtration processes however a more comprehensive understanding of bubble dynamics controlling the fouling formation is essential analyzing the bubble behaviour under the us irradiation would provide a detailed understanding of the properties of cavitational bubbles and their important effect on membrane surface cleaning the impact of the us operational parameters on membrane fouling control could be dependent on the changes in the number of bubbles formed bubble size and velocity and bubble oscillation pattern under different us conditions in depth knowledge of bubble behaviour and its characteristics at various operational parameters would answer key questions in applying us as an effective fouling control or remediation technique in recent decades several techniques have been employed for detection and detailed observation of cavitational bubbles including optical method acoustic detection of bubbles and scattering method however none of those techniques was able to offer in situ quantitative analysis and real time visualization of cavitational bubbles in an aqueous medium inside the filtration module in the optical method a microscope can be used to monitor the bubble dynamics along with a high speed camera with a frame rate of several million frames per second is able to capture all details of bubble formation growth and explosion therefore the effect of us irradiation on bubble dynamics can be characterized according to the detailed information obtained from the images 24 25 however this technique is incapable of capturing all bubbles in the system owing to the range of temporal and spatial scales a limited depth of field and an acoustic optic effect in the medium due to cavitation bubbles generated by sound waves 26 acoustic detection is another technique to obtain the cavitational bubbles behaviour based on the acoustic emission that emerges from the bubbles through their explosion or when the acoustic wave hits the bubbles and reflects the ultrasound amplitude and the size of the cavitational bubble influence the amplitude of acoustic emission therefore detailed information for characterization of acoustic intensity and dynamics of the bubble cavitation would be provided however the number and size of the bubbles cannot be determined by the acoustic detection technique since it does not image the liquid medium with cavitational bubbles 24 the scattering method includes laser scattering of single bubble and synchrotron x ray imaging technique although it is feasible to observe most of the temporal and spatial scales of bubble dynamics through laser scattering this method is only applicable to a single spherically shape bubble however the acoustic field causes numerous nuclei formation which could end up either in spherical or non spherical bubbles 27 in comparison to other imaging approaches synchrotron x ray imaging techniques is able to address the fundamental research questions related to real time visualization of cavitational bubbles this imaging technique is a noncorrosive laser scattering with high spatial resolution and good penetration affording direct visualization of us generated cavitational bubbles this imaging technique works based on detecting the beam transmitted through the liquid medium and acoustic field 24 28 gas inside the cavitational bubbles has a different refractive index with respect to the liquid medium that surrounds them this different refractive index causes a noticeable phase shift at the gas liquid interface resulting in a visible boundary between bubbles and liquid medium 29 it is also possible to visualize the interior structure and dynamics of cavitational bubbles through synchrotron x ray imaging even in thick and opaque materials 26 our research group has recently used synchrotron in line phase contrast imaging in line pci available at the biomedical imaging and therapy bmit beamlines at the canadian light source cls to investigate the microbubble characteristics and cavitation dynamics at different us frequencies 30 therefore the current study aims to conduct a comprehensive in situ investigation of the impact of us power intensity on the dynamics of cavitational bubbles as well as its application to membrane fouling control via real time imaging of microbubbles generated in water medium and close to the membrane in this regard the synchrotron based pbi techniques as a novel non invasive imaging method was employed to improve the contrast between the liquid and gas inside the bubble interface of liquid and gas facilitating the qualitative and quantitative analysis the effect of increases in the us power intensity on the dynamics of cavitational bubbles was investigated imagej software was employed to analyze the imaging frames from a high speed camera and find the most reliable images for determining the number and size of the bubbles at various time of imaging and their distance from the transducer the size distribution of bubbles and probability bubble size plots were also obtained by using the matlab software bubble velocity at different us power intensities and further observation on cavitation mechanisms were also provided the permeate flux was also recorded at different us power levels using flat sheet pvdf membranes and skimmed milk solution 2 experimental setup and in situ synchrotron imaging all experiments as part of this setup were conducted at the bmit 05b1 1 polychromatic beamline at the cls a 3rd generation synchrotron facility the following section outlines the specific procedures in addition to optimization details of all critical parameters that were used to improve the quality of images and the visualization of bubbles and specific to best image contrast air liquid 2 1 synchrotron beamline and phase contrast setup for in situ bubble visualization as one of phase contrast based imaging techniques the x ray in line phase contrast imaging was used in the experiments and an overview of differences in detector responses obtained using propagation phase contrast was presented in our previous publication on bubble imaging 30 bmit bm 05b1 1 beamline was implemented to conduct the experiments using white beam polychromatic beam mode to ensure fast data acquisition as high photon flux was made available at the spectrum beam these in turn helped capture the bubbles and their dynamics with minimal motion artifacts during each of the scans the advanced non invasive imaging synchrotron pbi technique was applied in order to improve the image contrast for the liquid gas interface this contrast is quite beneficial for the qualitative as well as the quantitative analysis two thousand projections were captured by the detector in one second 1 s during each of the scans with high flux a typical high speed was achieved while each projection was captured in 0 5 ms the high resolution detector had a pixel size of 5 5 μm which was sufficient for visualizing the generated targeted bubbles with the diameter of 5 5 μm or larger that have a potential influence on membrane fouling remediation all of the experimental trials were performed at 35 relative humidity and room temperature of 22 c section 3 2 further provides context on specific parameters for the phase contrast and how these parameters were optimized 2 2 optimization of photon flux for an improved phase gas liquid contrast 2 2 1 optimum energy used the synchrotron bmit bm 05b1 1 white beam polychromatic beam has a spectral energy of 20 50 kev as described in details in our previous publication 30 in this research study the beam was cut to a very small fov size of 40 5 mm so as to avoid x ray white beam scattering a photon flux of 1013 photons mm2 s of white beam at full width half maximum fwhm was implemented and can be seen in fig s 1 2 2 2 optimization of filtration unit material and design one of the critical factors in the in situ experiments of bubble imaging is the design of the filtration unit in this study during the initial stage a 4 5 mm thick polycarbonate pc was chosen to create the feed compartment of the filtration unit connected to the ultrasonic transducer the details of optimum unit material and its specifications were reported in our previous work 30 furthermore the water body thickness inside the feed compartment of the filtration unit that is the thickness of the filtration unit itself is an additional vital parameter ultrasound filtration unit design optimization and dimension was presented in our previous publication 30 when the membrane width and the water channel were large 2 cm the water body in the chamber was too thick and absorbed blocked 80 of photons effectually preventing bubble visualization that can be viewed in fig 1 compartment thickness values or width values of 80 40 and 20 mm were tested with the aim of obtaining the quality of images that would satisfy the required contrast and allow us to visualize the bubbles it is important to note that the filtration unit design needs to be considered in conjunction with the optimum photon flux generated by the spectral energy of the beam in order to obtain enhanced quality of the raw image as shown in fig 1 b the appropriate material selection and water body thickness value were key parameters in this study and have to be carefully optimized in order to avoid numerous potential issues such as cracking of materials this optimization is likewise vital to obtaining clear images of the bubble dynamics and achieving high phase contrast of gas liquid of the bubbles for this study the depth of the imaged water body was 4 mm 2 3 optimization of bubble dynamics image quality during in situ visualization using sdd as shown in fig 2 raw images 1 and 4 distances of less than 30 cm had poor phase contrast alternatively distances greater than 50 cm had improved phase contrast but appeared blurry due to reduced resolution shown in fig 2 raw images 2 and 5 image 3 and image 6 at sample to detector distance sdd of 50 cm had better phase contrast allowing visualization of all the bubbles an optimal sdd of 50 cm was eventually selected for the pbi technique so as to obtain the desired resolution and image contrast 2 4 ultrasound assisted ultrafiltration unit sonication was performed with the aid of an ultrasonic device ultrasound transducer qxct 28100 50 60 t 66hsp8 quanxin china the device specifications were as follows 110 vac 28 khz and various power intensities 50 60 100 w meeting the standards of the cls inspection department the ultrasound processor was fixed on the specimen stage at the experimental end station of the beamline at the cls the pulse mode was adjusted for continuous acoustic irradiation while the power output of the processor was set to 100 of the maximum output in order to obtain as much information as possible the ideal spatial orientation and mounting position of the ultrasound processor and sample holder were identified with respect to the incident beam horizontally the x ray beam covered the complete width of the sample holder for imaging purposes the ultrasound unit was restrained on the rotation stage using a heavy duty magnetic mount the stage was carefully controlled to return to the exact same position in order to obtain consistent images at varying time points in the ultrafiltration process pvdf membranes with a mean pore size of 30 nm were utilized for ultrafiltration of the skimmed milk solution 0 1 wt skimmed milk powder fat free 9 g of protein in each 25 g of skimmed milk powder was used for the synthetic skimmed milk solution the flat sheet pvdf membranes trisep ub70 were purchased from sterlitech corp kent wa usa for each run pvdf membrane was cut to a size of 11 cm 18 cm with an effective membrane surface area of 10 cm 16 8 cm 2 5 calibration and processing of raw images as presented in fig 3 the phase densities were identified in the segmented images by adjusting the threshold on the greyscale frames when selecting the threshold outlier removal was also applied which was calibrated without adversely affecting the image quality the post image processing such as image filtering and normalization is shown in fig 3 b image j was used for image analysis of the 4000 frames projected over 2 s at each ultrasonic power intensity during the imaging analysis process random bright pixels were observed in frames generated those bright pixels are the results of high intensity high energy x ray beam which directly stroked the sensor of the camera and cannot be excluded even by covering the camera therefore those bright pixels or noises were removed by using the remove outliner function the bandpass filter was used to eliminate the edge artifacts and improve the image quality to determine the bubbles number and size this filter acts based on surpassing a particular range of bright or dark patches at the background of the frames thus the sharpen function was employed to accentuate the details by increasing the contrast as shown in fig 3 c after subtracting the background noises changing the threshold and increasing the brightness identifying sphericity the ultrasound waves and bubble could be well recognized in filtered images the us transducer was located at the top of the frames as presented in fig 5 and the area of interest was selected directly below the us transducer with the size of 11 000 μm 4050 μm the initial frame size was 11 000 μm 4411 μm 2 6 bubble analyzing approach to investigate the influence of us power intensity on the bubble dynamics the averaged values of the number and size of the bubbles and the fraction of the total area occupied by bubbles factors relating to bubble characteristics were calculated at us power of 50 w 60 w and 100 w the full stack analysis was employed to measure all those bubble related factors a total of 4000 frames at each us power intensity were imported into the software then the number size and fraction of area was calculated for every single frame and finally the average value of all bubble related parameters were calculated to observe the bubble behaviour at various stage of imaging procedure all 4000 frames were divided into 8 piles 0 25 s of imaging and the full stack analysis was employed to summarize the bubbles number and size in each individual pile for each pile 500 frames the averaged values of the bubble associated parameters were determined therefore changes in all bubble related factors were recorded over the imaging time aside from the effect of us power on the bubble formation and its size the bubble behaviour at different distances from the us transducer was also investigated in this regard all images were divided vertically into three slices identical size 1 338 mm 11 mm the full stack analysis for each slice was then used to reach the averaged bubble number and size at a particular distance from the us transducer the distance between the first second and third slices from the transducer is about 0 396 mm 1 734 mm and 3 072 mm respectively a summary of image analyzing approach was also presented in our previous work fig 6 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of us power intensity on microbubbles over the duration of imaging the number and size of bubbles play a crucial role in membrane surface cleaning and fouling control the heterogeneous cavitation may assist in dislodgement of foulants from the surface 31 36 microbubbles could discharge a significant quantity of energy into the system after the explosion leading to particle detachment by causing eddy currents and shear forces near the surface of the membrane table 1 presents the averaged values for all the bubble related parameters over the duration of imaging 2 s at different power intensities the number of bubbles created at 50 w was about 746 and it increased to 793 and 880 once the us power changed to 60 w and 100 w respectively similar to the bubble s number bubble s diameter also increased from 36 7 μm to 39 5 μm and 48 4 μm as the power was increased as a result of the increasing number of bubbles and their larger size the area occupied by bubbles also increased clearly increased us power intensity led the formation of more bubbles with a larger size and a greater value of the area occupied by the bubbles the decrease of bubbles number with the us irradiation time might be due to the bubble coalescence or bubble explosion and creation of small bubbles 5 5 μm leading to a slight increase in the bubble size and a smaller number of bubbles the full stack analysis showed that the fraction changed from 1 79 to 2 2 as the power increased from 50 w to 60 w 23 increase the further increase from 60 w to 100 w resulted in a 69 increase in the fraction of the total area occupied by bubbles from 2 2 to 3 67 according to the full stack analysis the fraction of the area occupied by bubbles increased from 1 79 to 2 2 and 3 67 as the us power changed from 50 w to 60 w and 100 w it is more likely that bubbles at higher us power explode more rapidly and turned into a number of small bubbles 5 5 μm that cannot be detected through our imaging technique nevertheless even the explosion of a portion of large bubbles and formation of small bubbles would not have any negative impact on fouling removal since the number and size of bubbles observed at 100 w were still significantly larger than those observed at lower power intensities hence it is expected to have higher cleaning efficiency at the us power of 100 w compared to lower us power intensities since a higher number of microbubbles with a larger diameter were created under that condition the increases in the bubbles number and size are ascribed to the variation of acoustic pressure amplitude of the us wave the us power intensity is directly proportional to the pressure amplitude of ultrasound wave according to the following equation 37 1 i p a 2 2 ρ c w where i is the us power p a the pressure amplitude of the us wave and c w the speed of the us wave therefore increasing the us power intensity results in a higher acoustic pressure amplitude and a larger cavitation zone in the water medium 37 40 fig 4 shows the permeate flux of deionized di water with and without ultrasonic cleaning at various power intensities fig 5 shows the permeate flux in ultrafiltration of skimmed milk protein solution 0 1 wt with and without ultrasonic cleaning at various power intensities the membrane s permeate flux was improved by 10 when the ultrasonic cleaning at 25 w was used and that value increased by about 42 as the us power changed to 100 w additionally the permeate flux decay was reduced by more than 50 when ultrasonic cleaning was performed at a power intensity of 100 w from 35 48 to 17 07 the initial membrane flux was about 17 67 kg m 2 h 1 and filtration performance improved as the us was added to the system and as the power increased from 25 w to 100 w from 19 71 kg m 2 h 1 to 25 42 kg m 2 h 1 the mass of particles retained on the membrane was also measured before and after the ultrasound implantation with 0 1 wt of milk proteins in the feed and a flow rate of 1 l min the mass of retained particles on the membrane was about 26 1 mg this value decreased to 21 8 mg after using ultrasound at 28 khz and 25 w indicating less particle accumulation on the membrane surface the reduction continued as the us power increased to 50 w and 100 w such that mass of retained particles reached 18 7 mg and 16 1 mg respectively fig 6 showed the influence of ultrasound power on the generated bubbles and mass transfer coefficient of water across the membrane based on transport resistance model at higher us power a greater number of bubbles with larger sizes are created the oscillations and explosions of those microbubbles resulted in a local turbulent regime close to the fouled membrane and in turn more foulant removal moreover the higher the us power the greater the acoustic streaming microjet and shockwave effects 4 37 39 therefore increasing the ultrasound power resulted in a significant increase in the mass transfer across the membrane with a confidence of 95 results showed an increase of mass transfer across the membrane in uf of the synthetic skimmed milk solution by 40 when the us power increased from 25 w to 100 w therefore the mass transfer improvement represents a reduction in membrane fouling and the cake resistance over the ultrafiltration process in addition it worth noting that the mass transfer across the membrane in water media was increased by 26 when the us power increased from 25 w to 100 w 3 1 1 in situ visualization and real time influence of power intensity on bubbles dynamics bubble behaviour under the us irradiation could change over time several cavitational bubbles could be created or exploded after a while and their size may also vary with the duration of us exposure in fact changes in the bubbles number and size may result in a variation of membrane cleaning fouling removal efficiency owing to the energy released to the liquid medium in order to obtain all those information the averaged values of all aforementioned factors were determined at a 0 25 s s interval for all three different power intensities no significant changes in the bubbles number and size were observed and all those parameters seemed to be steady over 2 s of us exposure it is necessary to note that the high resolution detector camera at cls had a pixel size of 5 5 μm and bubbles equal or larger than 5 5 μm were detected fig 7 shows the consistent data of microbubbles obtained throughout the imaging period 0 25 s interval in addition to the full stack analysis as observed in fig 7 all the bubble related parameters did not change significantly with an increase in the us power from 50 w to 60 w the trends of all those parameters with time were relatively constant with only a slightly change for 60 w and 100 w nevertheless more fluctuation was observed for the averaged number of bubbles at 50 w the fluctuation is likely due to the bubble size alteration over the bubble cavitation since oscillating pressure waves of the acoustic field might cause the bubble volume oscillation bubbles become larger or smaller 41 there is also a possibility that the collapse of a bubble leads to smaller bubbles that grow at different rates depending on the localized conditions in this study us irradiation at 50 w would create the highest number of bubbles with the small diameter of 5 5 μm 1 pixel at the threshold of the camera resolution accordingly it was more probable for oscillating bubbles to reach the bubble size lower than the camera resolution during the pressure cycle of the us irradiation as the bubble size reduces to any value under the camera resolution the bubbles couldn t be detected by the camera and hence the number of bubbles captured by the camera and counted by imagej would decrease accordingly bubbles can be counted as they get larger and reach the minimum diameter of 5 5 μm thus the trend of the bubbles number with the us exposure time seemed to fluctuate for the us irradiation at 50 w from the whole stack of images acquired at various power intensities the frames with the lowest averaged and highest number of bubbles were also selected and analyzed it provides detailed information of the possible minimum or maximum bubbles generated at each us power intensity which is crucial for membrane fouling control less bubbles or smaller bubbles may release less energy and hence reduce the probability of turbulence flow and surface cleaning figs 8 10 depicts the images generated from imagej at three levels of power intensities the bubble size distribution and the probability density of size distribution are also presented in these figures it should be noted that all those three images for three power intensities were not selected at the same us exposure time the number of bubbles the bubble size and the area occupied by bubbles were obtained by imagej software matlab was also employed to determine the bubble size distribution and probability density of imagej images the maximum probability density represents the dominant bubble size in each image 42 the dominant bubble sizes bubble diameter for images with the maximum number of bubbles at 50 w 60 w and 100 w of us power are 36 5 39 8 μm and 48 2 μm respectively clearly the dominant bubble size increased with the us power intensity table 2 presents the summary of the minimum maximum and the averaged number of bubbles at 50 w 60 w and 100 w it indicates that higher us power resulted in more bubble formation with a larger area and accordingly larger value for the area occupied for example the averaged number in frames with lowest bubbles at 50 w 60 w and 100 w is 374 495 and 543 respectively which shows an increasing trend of the number of bubbles with the power intensity also for images with the minimum number of bubbles an unexpected observation was noticed where the averaged bubble size at 50 w was larger than that at us power of 60 w this may be attributed to the presence of a very large bubble in that particular frame the large bubble left the area of interest after a couple of milliseconds 3 1 2 in situ visualization of bubbles dynamics at different distances from us transducer the goal of using us is to generate cavitational bubbles close to the cp and cake layer formed on the membrane in the filtration unit there is a 2 mm gap between the membrane and the top plate of the module where the us transducer would be placed it means the membrane will likely be placed on the middle slice of the frames and all bubbles observed in that area will be close to the cp and cake layer helping in removing deposited particles from the surface therefore the bubble formation the bubble size and the bubble behaviour were also examined at varying distances from the top of the frame where the us transducer was located in this regard images at different power intensities were vertically divided into three slices full stack analysis was also employed to evaluate the bubble characteristics of individual slices at varied us power intensities the mean size of the bubbles in the middle slice was found to be remarkably higher than those of the others the highest number of bubbles was also found in the middle slice for all three power intensities such that at us power of 100 w the averaged number of bubbles captured at the middle slice was about six times and sixteen times that of the top and bottom slice respectively a greater number of bubbles with larger sizes were formed at us power of 100 w consequently the area occupied by bubbles in the middle slice was much higher at this condition about 4 5 times that at 50 w and 60 w table 3 presents the bubble related parameters at different power intensities and distances from the us transducer as can be seen in table 3 the fraction of area at the top and bottom slices increased at about 7 and 46 as the us power was altered from 50 w to 60 w however once the us power was increased to 100 w it dropped significantly by around 68 for both slices aside from the us frequency applied to the system oscillating bubbles have a natural frequency resonant frequency determined by the physical parameters of the bubbles and the liquid medium eq 2 shows the relationship between the resonant frequency and those physical properties 43 2 f r 1 2 π 1 r 0 3 γ ρ air ρ water where f r is the resonant frequency r 0 the equilibrium radius of the bubble ρ air density of air ρ water density of water and γ the specific heat ratio polytropic coefficient according to eq 2 at a resonant frequency equal to the acoustic driving frequency 28 khz the bubble s equilibrium radius is about 110 μm d 220 μm a 3 8 104 μm 2 thus bubbles smaller than this size would have higher resonance frequencies above the acoustic driving frequency and they travel toward the pressure antinodes and accumulate there likewise larger bubbles with lower resonant frequency move down to the pressure nodes 44 during the image processing it was observed that large bubbles d 220 μm moved away from the us transducers however most of the small bubbles d 220 μm traveled upward and this could be the reason for having a lower number of bubbles at the bottom slice fig s 2 shows the small bubbles moved toward the us transducer large bubbles seemed to move slower than the small bubbles and they spent more time at lower slices thus it was more probable to capture large bubbles in the middle or at the bottom of the frames resulting in a higher value for bubble mean size determined by imagej fig s 3 shows large bubbles moving at the bottom and middle slides thus if there are sufficient bubbles to help remove the foulant from the membrane surface then the high number of bubbles in the top region as shown in table 3 could further help in forming agglomerates of solid particles in the bulk solution the agglomerates can be carried away with the cross flow of the fluid without reaching the membrane surface consequently this would help reduce the amount of solid deposited on the membrane surface less fouling 3 1 3 microbubbles velocity analysis the influence of ultrasound us power intensity on microbubble velocity was also analyzed bubble velocities at different us power intensities were estimated by using consecutive frames and tracking the changes in the bubble s position in many images bubbles disappeared in 0 5 ms one frame as shown in fig 11 to estimate the velocity the distance between the centers of an individual bubble in sequence images was measured and divided by the interframe time of successive images it should be pointed out that the bubble behaviour and the distance they could travel in a consecutive frame seemed to be dependent on the size of the bubbles the bubble velocity was higher for a smaller bubble as expected since the drag force applied on the smaller bubble moving in a fluid would be lower as compared to that for a larger bubble fig 12 a shows a part of an image with the small bubbles and their velocities at the us power intensities of 50 w 60 w and 100 w a higher bubble velocity was obtained as the us power was changes from 50 w to 100 w the size and velocity of the large bubble are depicted in fig 12 b large bubbles seemed to be oscillating and staying at the bottom of the frame close to the membrane surface or moving slowly surface cleaning may take place due to the turbulence flow created as a result of the explosion of those large bubbles in the vicinity of the membrane surface furthermore bubbles got larger by increasing the us power intensity thus higher cleaning efficiency is expected under the us power of 100 w 3 2 in situ observations and mechanisms of bubble cavitation the influence of the us power intensity on the stationary and moving microbubbles was also studied based on selected microbubbles within the capacity of the imaging technique used 5 5 μm although some bubbles were observed to be stationary or they only oscillated in their position constant coordinate with no change in their size over time most bubbles traveled in the liquid medium the size of those moving microbubbles increased over time unless they had experienced bubble explosion under which small bubbles were created smaller than camera detector resolution or bubble collapse that create shockwave or microjets 45 48 the growth of bubbles at different power intensities is shown in fig 13 in all those images the bubble radius increased until it reached an equilibrium stable size the duration of the bubble growth varied with the us power intensity due to different growth ratios growth ratio bubble size at time t the initial size of the bubble and the bubbles initial sizes it was reported by kanthale et al 49 that the bubble growth ratio increased by changing the us power from 7 5 w to 20 w for bubbles in fig 13 it was observed that the growth ratio at the us power intensities of 50 60 and 100 w was 2 66 2 91 and 1 54 respectively the first two data are in agreement with the observations presented by kanthale et al 49 the bubble growth ratio increased as the us power was altered from 50 w to 60 w a lower growth ratio at 100 w could be due to the higher growth rate from nuclei to its initial size captured by the camera therefore as it is evident in fig 13 the bubble had a larger initial size at 100 w as compared to that at lower us power intensities which consequently resulted in a lower growth ratio thus the growth duration was measured and used to calculate the growth velocity growth ratio growth duration of bubbles at different power intensities the growth velocity for bubbles at us power of 50 60 and 100 w was 0 05 s 1 0 07 s 1 and 0 09 s 1 respectively therefore the bubble growth was proved to be much faster at 100 w than at lower us power intensities in addition at 100 w bubbles may explode much more frequently releasing more energy into the liquid medium which causes a turbulence flow and results in higher membrane surface cleaning 4 conclusions synchrotron bmit bm 05b1 1 white beam polychromatic beam with spectral energy was able to detect cavitational bubbles and reveal the details of bubble dynamics in the water medium under us influence high phase contrast was achieved for the liquid and gas inside the bubbles interface between liquid and gas using the pbi technique the pbi along with the optimum synchrotron x ray imaging technique facilitated in situ visualization of cavitational bubbles in water medium inside the filtration unit high quality images and image contrast of air liquid phases were achieved by optimizing the key parameters including selected beam energy and detector settings sdd for the in line phase contrast imaging camera speed mode of imaging and filtration unit material and design both the appropriate material for the filtration unit and the water body thickness were the important elements in this research and they must be optimized to prevent the material cracking capture clear images of the bubbles and attain a high phase contrast between the liquid and gas inside the bubbles interface of liquid and gas bubbles were created at a driving frequency of 28 khz and the us power of 50 60 and 100 w the majority of bubbles resided in the middle slice where the us field us wave was also observed the number and the averaged size of the bubbles increased by increasing the us power intensities resulting in higher energy discharge into the water medium and consequently higher cleaning efficiency compared to the resonance size bubbles with smaller sizes moved upward and their velocity increased as us power changed from 50 w to 100 w bubble velocity appeared to be dependent on the bubble size as large bubbles moved slower than the smaller bubbles and they tended to stay at the bottom of the frame close to the membrane surface this observation shows a significant reduction in membrane fouling and cake layer resistance in the presence of large bubbles since most of them tend to oscillate close to the membrane surface and they may cause the formation of turbulence flow by bubble explosion it was also observed that us power intensity influenced the bubble growth ratio the improved permeate flux and mass transfer across the membrane in the us assisted ultrafiltration process supports the findings from real time imaging of microbubbles and the influence of us power intensity on bubble dynamics and their application to fouling remediation declaration of competing interest there are no potential conflicts of interest for the authors to declare

12911,the purpose of this research article is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the influence of ultrasound us power intensity on the stationary and moving microbubbles close to the membrane surface and its application on membrane fouling control compared to other imaging techniques synchrotron in line phase contrast imaging technique available at the biomedical imaging and therapy bmit beamlines at the canadian light source cls allowed for in situ quantitative analysis and real time imaging of microbubbles in water inside a membrane filtration unit an advanced non invasive synchrotron propagation based imaging pbi technique was employed to improve the contrast between the liquid and gas inside the bubble interface of liquid and gas which was crucial for the qualitative and quantitative analyses imagej software was employed for the quantitative analyses of cavitational bubbles dynamics and their characteristics at different us power intensities the bubble related parameters including the number size and fraction of total area occupied by bubbles were determined for all captured images at three different us power intensities bubble characteristics at different times of us exposure and distances from the us transducer were also studied then matlab software was used to generate the plots for the bubble size distribution and probability density for each image the effect of us power intensity on bubble velocity and its application in membrane fouling control was also investigated the generated bubbles were mostly located in the middle of the images close to the membrane surface where the us waves were detected it was also observed that the velocity of smaller bubbles was much larger than that of the larger bubbles and they tended to move toward the us transducer bubble growth was much faster at 100 w than at lower us power intensities the experimental results were in good agreement with the in situ observation of microbubbles the mass transfer across the membrane was improved as the us power increased from 25 w to 100 w this was likely due to more frequent bubble explosions and energy releases into the water medium causing turbulence flow and resulting in more membrane surface cleaning keywords bubble cavitation microbubble dynamics ultrasonic cleaning membrane fouling us power intensity 1 introduction membrane fouling is one of the serious challenges in membrane based separation processes fouling is a complex phenomenon that adds resistance to the system and negatively affects membrane selectivity and performance especially by reducing the permeate flux the deposition and accumulation of pollutants on the surface or within the interior pores of the membrane causes this phenomenon 1 therefore membrane cleaning and fouling control strategies play a crucial role in preserving the membrane capacity and filtration performance several membrane cleaning methods e g physical chemical or biological and fouling controlling techniques such as the feed pre treatment or membrane surface modification could be employed with filtration processes to remove the foulants and improve the flux 2 6 according to the previous studies ultrasound us has been considered an effective technique for cleaning various materials owing to the us cavitation and the physical chemical and thermal effects caused by acoustic waves 7 16 ultrasonic waves could be employed as an additional force for improving the filtration performance by discharging the foulants and dislodging it from the membrane surface the propagation of us wave through a liquid medium generates frequent rarefaction and compression cycles resulting in the creation of several physical phenomena us irradiation is able to create a convective current and cause a turbulence flow within the whole system the turbulence flow and shear force created near the membrane liquid boundary not only breaks the fouling layer but also hinders the foulant deposition and the concentration polarization cp development by taking the particles away from the membrane surface furthermore cavitational bubbles are formed under the alternating rarefaction and compression cycles during us irradiation cavitational bubbles can mitigate membrane fouling in the form of micro streamers by dislodging the attached particles from the membrane surface in addition microstreaming effect caused by bubble oscillation leads to an eddy current close to the membrane and deprives the particles of the membrane surface bubble explosion would also release a considerable amount of energy to the medium and cause a vigorous flow around the bubble 13 17 22 as is reported in previous studies operational parameters including frequency and power intensity of ultrasonic waves the position of the us transducer distance between the transducer and cavitational bubbles and the viscosity of the liquid medium may affect the bubble dynamics during the irradiation time 18 19 23 there has been increasing interest in using the us enhanced filtration processes however a more comprehensive understanding of bubble dynamics controlling the fouling formation is essential analyzing the bubble behaviour under the us irradiation would provide a detailed understanding of the properties of cavitational bubbles and their important effect on membrane surface cleaning the impact of the us operational parameters on membrane fouling control could be dependent on the changes in the number of bubbles formed bubble size and velocity and bubble oscillation pattern under different us conditions in depth knowledge of bubble behaviour and its characteristics at various operational parameters would answer key questions in applying us as an effective fouling control or remediation technique in recent decades several techniques have been employed for detection and detailed observation of cavitational bubbles including optical method acoustic detection of bubbles and scattering method however none of those techniques was able to offer in situ quantitative analysis and real time visualization of cavitational bubbles in an aqueous medium inside the filtration module in the optical method a microscope can be used to monitor the bubble dynamics along with a high speed camera with a frame rate of several million frames per second is able to capture all details of bubble formation growth and explosion therefore the effect of us irradiation on bubble dynamics can be characterized according to the detailed information obtained from the images 24 25 however this technique is incapable of capturing all bubbles in the system owing to the range of temporal and spatial scales a limited depth of field and an acoustic optic effect in the medium due to cavitation bubbles generated by sound waves 26 acoustic detection is another technique to obtain the cavitational bubbles behaviour based on the acoustic emission that emerges from the bubbles through their explosion or when the acoustic wave hits the bubbles and reflects the ultrasound amplitude and the size of the cavitational bubble influence the amplitude of acoustic emission therefore detailed information for characterization of acoustic intensity and dynamics of the bubble cavitation would be provided however the number and size of the bubbles cannot be determined by the acoustic detection technique since it does not image the liquid medium with cavitational bubbles 24 the scattering method includes laser scattering of single bubble and synchrotron x ray imaging technique although it is feasible to observe most of the temporal and spatial scales of bubble dynamics through laser scattering this method is only applicable to a single spherically shape bubble however the acoustic field causes numerous nuclei formation which could end up either in spherical or non spherical bubbles 27 in comparison to other imaging approaches synchrotron x ray imaging techniques is able to address the fundamental research questions related to real time visualization of cavitational bubbles this imaging technique is a noncorrosive laser scattering with high spatial resolution and good penetration affording direct visualization of us generated cavitational bubbles this imaging technique works based on detecting the beam transmitted through the liquid medium and acoustic field 24 28 gas inside the cavitational bubbles has a different refractive index with respect to the liquid medium that surrounds them this different refractive index causes a noticeable phase shift at the gas liquid interface resulting in a visible boundary between bubbles and liquid medium 29 it is also possible to visualize the interior structure and dynamics of cavitational bubbles through synchrotron x ray imaging even in thick and opaque materials 26 our research group has recently used synchrotron in line phase contrast imaging in line pci available at the biomedical imaging and therapy bmit beamlines at the canadian light source cls to investigate the microbubble characteristics and cavitation dynamics at different us frequencies 30 therefore the current study aims to conduct a comprehensive in situ investigation of the impact of us power intensity on the dynamics of cavitational bubbles as well as its application to membrane fouling control via real time imaging of microbubbles generated in water medium and close to the membrane in this regard the synchrotron based pbi techniques as a novel non invasive imaging method was employed to improve the contrast between the liquid and gas inside the bubble interface of liquid and gas facilitating the qualitative and quantitative analysis the effect of increases in the us power intensity on the dynamics of cavitational bubbles was investigated imagej software was employed to analyze the imaging frames from a high speed camera and find the most reliable images for determining the number and size of the bubbles at various time of imaging and their distance from the transducer the size distribution of bubbles and probability bubble size plots were also obtained by using the matlab software bubble velocity at different us power intensities and further observation on cavitation mechanisms were also provided the permeate flux was also recorded at different us power levels using flat sheet pvdf membranes and skimmed milk solution 2 experimental setup and in situ synchrotron imaging all experiments as part of this setup were conducted at the bmit 05b1 1 polychromatic beamline at the cls a 3rd generation synchrotron facility the following section outlines the specific procedures in addition to optimization details of all critical parameters that were used to improve the quality of images and the visualization of bubbles and specific to best image contrast air liquid 2 1 synchrotron beamline and phase contrast setup for in situ bubble visualization as one of phase contrast based imaging techniques the x ray in line phase contrast imaging was used in the experiments and an overview of differences in detector responses obtained using propagation phase contrast was presented in our previous publication on bubble imaging 30 bmit bm 05b1 1 beamline was implemented to conduct the experiments using white beam polychromatic beam mode to ensure fast data acquisition as high photon flux was made available at the spectrum beam these in turn helped capture the bubbles and their dynamics with minimal motion artifacts during each of the scans the advanced non invasive imaging synchrotron pbi technique was applied in order to improve the image contrast for the liquid gas interface this contrast is quite beneficial for the qualitative as well as the quantitative analysis two thousand projections were captured by the detector in one second 1 s during each of the scans with high flux a typical high speed was achieved while each projection was captured in 0 5 ms the high resolution detector had a pixel size of 5 5 μm which was sufficient for visualizing the generated targeted bubbles with the diameter of 5 5 μm or larger that have a potential influence on membrane fouling remediation all of the experimental trials were performed at 35 relative humidity and room temperature of 22 c section 3 2 further provides context on specific parameters for the phase contrast and how these parameters were optimized 2 2 optimization of photon flux for an improved phase gas liquid contrast 2 2 1 optimum energy used the synchrotron bmit bm 05b1 1 white beam polychromatic beam has a spectral energy of 20 50 kev as described in details in our previous publication 30 in this research study the beam was cut to a very small fov size of 40 5 mm so as to avoid x ray white beam scattering a photon flux of 1013 photons mm2 s of white beam at full width half maximum fwhm was implemented and can be seen in fig s 1 2 2 2 optimization of filtration unit material and design one of the critical factors in the in situ experiments of bubble imaging is the design of the filtration unit in this study during the initial stage a 4 5 mm thick polycarbonate pc was chosen to create the feed compartment of the filtration unit connected to the ultrasonic transducer the details of optimum unit material and its specifications were reported in our previous work 30 furthermore the water body thickness inside the feed compartment of the filtration unit that is the thickness of the filtration unit itself is an additional vital parameter ultrasound filtration unit design optimization and dimension was presented in our previous publication 30 when the membrane width and the water channel were large 2 cm the water body in the chamber was too thick and absorbed blocked 80 of photons effectually preventing bubble visualization that can be viewed in fig 1 compartment thickness values or width values of 80 40 and 20 mm were tested with the aim of obtaining the quality of images that would satisfy the required contrast and allow us to visualize the bubbles it is important to note that the filtration unit design needs to be considered in conjunction with the optimum photon flux generated by the spectral energy of the beam in order to obtain enhanced quality of the raw image as shown in fig 1 b the appropriate material selection and water body thickness value were key parameters in this study and have to be carefully optimized in order to avoid numerous potential issues such as cracking of materials this optimization is likewise vital to obtaining clear images of the bubble dynamics and achieving high phase contrast of gas liquid of the bubbles for this study the depth of the imaged water body was 4 mm 2 3 optimization of bubble dynamics image quality during in situ visualization using sdd as shown in fig 2 raw images 1 and 4 distances of less than 30 cm had poor phase contrast alternatively distances greater than 50 cm had improved phase contrast but appeared blurry due to reduced resolution shown in fig 2 raw images 2 and 5 image 3 and image 6 at sample to detector distance sdd of 50 cm had better phase contrast allowing visualization of all the bubbles an optimal sdd of 50 cm was eventually selected for the pbi technique so as to obtain the desired resolution and image contrast 2 4 ultrasound assisted ultrafiltration unit sonication was performed with the aid of an ultrasonic device ultrasound transducer qxct 28100 50 60 t 66hsp8 quanxin china the device specifications were as follows 110 vac 28 khz and various power intensities 50 60 100 w meeting the standards of the cls inspection department the ultrasound processor was fixed on the specimen stage at the experimental end station of the beamline at the cls the pulse mode was adjusted for continuous acoustic irradiation while the power output of the processor was set to 100 of the maximum output in order to obtain as much information as possible the ideal spatial orientation and mounting position of the ultrasound processor and sample holder were identified with respect to the incident beam horizontally the x ray beam covered the complete width of the sample holder for imaging purposes the ultrasound unit was restrained on the rotation stage using a heavy duty magnetic mount the stage was carefully controlled to return to the exact same position in order to obtain consistent images at varying time points in the ultrafiltration process pvdf membranes with a mean pore size of 30 nm were utilized for ultrafiltration of the skimmed milk solution 0 1 wt skimmed milk powder fat free 9 g of protein in each 25 g of skimmed milk powder was used for the synthetic skimmed milk solution the flat sheet pvdf membranes trisep ub70 were purchased from sterlitech corp kent wa usa for each run pvdf membrane was cut to a size of 11 cm 18 cm with an effective membrane surface area of 10 cm 16 8 cm 2 5 calibration and processing of raw images as presented in fig 3 the phase densities were identified in the segmented images by adjusting the threshold on the greyscale frames when selecting the threshold outlier removal was also applied which was calibrated without adversely affecting the image quality the post image processing such as image filtering and normalization is shown in fig 3 b image j was used for image analysis of the 4000 frames projected over 2 s at each ultrasonic power intensity during the imaging analysis process random bright pixels were observed in frames generated those bright pixels are the results of high intensity high energy x ray beam which directly stroked the sensor of the camera and cannot be excluded even by covering the camera therefore those bright pixels or noises were removed by using the remove outliner function the bandpass filter was used to eliminate the edge artifacts and improve the image quality to determine the bubbles number and size this filter acts based on surpassing a particular range of bright or dark patches at the background of the frames thus the sharpen function was employed to accentuate the details by increasing the contrast as shown in fig 3 c after subtracting the background noises changing the threshold and increasing the brightness identifying sphericity the ultrasound waves and bubble could be well recognized in filtered images the us transducer was located at the top of the frames as presented in fig 5 and the area of interest was selected directly below the us transducer with the size of 11 000 μm 4050 μm the initial frame size was 11 000 μm 4411 μm 2 6 bubble analyzing approach to investigate the influence of us power intensity on the bubble dynamics the averaged values of the number and size of the bubbles and the fraction of the total area occupied by bubbles factors relating to bubble characteristics were calculated at us power of 50 w 60 w and 100 w the full stack analysis was employed to measure all those bubble related factors a total of 4000 frames at each us power intensity were imported into the software then the number size and fraction of area was calculated for every single frame and finally the average value of all bubble related parameters were calculated to observe the bubble behaviour at various stage of imaging procedure all 4000 frames were divided into 8 piles 0 25 s of imaging and the full stack analysis was employed to summarize the bubbles number and size in each individual pile for each pile 500 frames the averaged values of the bubble associated parameters were determined therefore changes in all bubble related factors were recorded over the imaging time aside from the effect of us power on the bubble formation and its size the bubble behaviour at different distances from the us transducer was also investigated in this regard all images were divided vertically into three slices identical size 1 338 mm 11 mm the full stack analysis for each slice was then used to reach the averaged bubble number and size at a particular distance from the us transducer the distance between the first second and third slices from the transducer is about 0 396 mm 1 734 mm and 3 072 mm respectively a summary of image analyzing approach was also presented in our previous work fig 6 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of us power intensity on microbubbles over the duration of imaging the number and size of bubbles play a crucial role in membrane surface cleaning and fouling control the heterogeneous cavitation may assist in dislodgement of foulants from the surface 31 36 microbubbles could discharge a significant quantity of energy into the system after the explosion leading to particle detachment by causing eddy currents and shear forces near the surface of the membrane table 1 presents the averaged values for all the bubble related parameters over the duration of imaging 2 s at different power intensities the number of bubbles created at 50 w was about 746 and it increased to 793 and 880 once the us power changed to 60 w and 100 w respectively similar to the bubble s number bubble s diameter also increased from 36 7 μm to 39 5 μm and 48 4 μm as the power was increased as a result of the increasing number of bubbles and their larger size the area occupied by bubbles also increased clearly increased us power intensity led the formation of more bubbles with a larger size and a greater value of the area occupied by the bubbles the decrease of bubbles number with the us irradiation time might be due to the bubble coalescence or bubble explosion and creation of small bubbles 5 5 μm leading to a slight increase in the bubble size and a smaller number of bubbles the full stack analysis showed that the fraction changed from 1 79 to 2 2 as the power increased from 50 w to 60 w 23 increase the further increase from 60 w to 100 w resulted in a 69 increase in the fraction of the total area occupied by bubbles from 2 2 to 3 67 according to the full stack analysis the fraction of the area occupied by bubbles increased from 1 79 to 2 2 and 3 67 as the us power changed from 50 w to 60 w and 100 w it is more likely that bubbles at higher us power explode more rapidly and turned into a number of small bubbles 5 5 μm that cannot be detected through our imaging technique nevertheless even the explosion of a portion of large bubbles and formation of small bubbles would not have any negative impact on fouling removal since the number and size of bubbles observed at 100 w were still significantly larger than those observed at lower power intensities hence it is expected to have higher cleaning efficiency at the us power of 100 w compared to lower us power intensities since a higher number of microbubbles with a larger diameter were created under that condition the increases in the bubbles number and size are ascribed to the variation of acoustic pressure amplitude of the us wave the us power intensity is directly proportional to the pressure amplitude of ultrasound wave according to the following equation 37 1 i p a 2 2 ρ c w where i is the us power p a the pressure amplitude of the us wave and c w the speed of the us wave therefore increasing the us power intensity results in a higher acoustic pressure amplitude and a larger cavitation zone in the water medium 37 40 fig 4 shows the permeate flux of deionized di water with and without ultrasonic cleaning at various power intensities fig 5 shows the permeate flux in ultrafiltration of skimmed milk protein solution 0 1 wt with and without ultrasonic cleaning at various power intensities the membrane s permeate flux was improved by 10 when the ultrasonic cleaning at 25 w was used and that value increased by about 42 as the us power changed to 100 w additionally the permeate flux decay was reduced by more than 50 when ultrasonic cleaning was performed at a power intensity of 100 w from 35 48 to 17 07 the initial membrane flux was about 17 67 kg m 2 h 1 and filtration performance improved as the us was added to the system and as the power increased from 25 w to 100 w from 19 71 kg m 2 h 1 to 25 42 kg m 2 h 1 the mass of particles retained on the membrane was also measured before and after the ultrasound implantation with 0 1 wt of milk proteins in the feed and a flow rate of 1 l min the mass of retained particles on the membrane was about 26 1 mg this value decreased to 21 8 mg after using ultrasound at 28 khz and 25 w indicating less particle accumulation on the membrane surface the reduction continued as the us power increased to 50 w and 100 w such that mass of retained particles reached 18 7 mg and 16 1 mg respectively fig 6 showed the influence of ultrasound power on the generated bubbles and mass transfer coefficient of water across the membrane based on transport resistance model at higher us power a greater number of bubbles with larger sizes are created the oscillations and explosions of those microbubbles resulted in a local turbulent regime close to the fouled membrane and in turn more foulant removal moreover the higher the us power the greater the acoustic streaming microjet and shockwave effects 4 37 39 therefore increasing the ultrasound power resulted in a significant increase in the mass transfer across the membrane with a confidence of 95 results showed an increase of mass transfer across the membrane in uf of the synthetic skimmed milk solution by 40 when the us power increased from 25 w to 100 w therefore the mass transfer improvement represents a reduction in membrane fouling and the cake resistance over the ultrafiltration process in addition it worth noting that the mass transfer across the membrane in water media was increased by 26 when the us power increased from 25 w to 100 w 3 1 1 in situ visualization and real time influence of power intensity on bubbles dynamics bubble behaviour under the us irradiation could change over time several cavitational bubbles could be created or exploded after a while and their size may also vary with the duration of us exposure in fact changes in the bubbles number and size may result in a variation of membrane cleaning fouling removal efficiency owing to the energy released to the liquid medium in order to obtain all those information the averaged values of all aforementioned factors were determined at a 0 25 s s interval for all three different power intensities no significant changes in the bubbles number and size were observed and all those parameters seemed to be steady over 2 s of us exposure it is necessary to note that the high resolution detector camera at cls had a pixel size of 5 5 μm and bubbles equal or larger than 5 5 μm were detected fig 7 shows the consistent data of microbubbles obtained throughout the imaging period 0 25 s interval in addition to the full stack analysis as observed in fig 7 all the bubble related parameters did not change significantly with an increase in the us power from 50 w to 60 w the trends of all those parameters with time were relatively constant with only a slightly change for 60 w and 100 w nevertheless more fluctuation was observed for the averaged number of bubbles at 50 w the fluctuation is likely due to the bubble size alteration over the bubble cavitation since oscillating pressure waves of the acoustic field might cause the bubble volume oscillation bubbles become larger or smaller 41 there is also a possibility that the collapse of a bubble leads to smaller bubbles that grow at different rates depending on the localized conditions in this study us irradiation at 50 w would create the highest number of bubbles with the small diameter of 5 5 μm 1 pixel at the threshold of the camera resolution accordingly it was more probable for oscillating bubbles to reach the bubble size lower than the camera resolution during the pressure cycle of the us irradiation as the bubble size reduces to any value under the camera resolution the bubbles couldn t be detected by the camera and hence the number of bubbles captured by the camera and counted by imagej would decrease accordingly bubbles can be counted as they get larger and reach the minimum diameter of 5 5 μm thus the trend of the bubbles number with the us exposure time seemed to fluctuate for the us irradiation at 50 w from the whole stack of images acquired at various power intensities the frames with the lowest averaged and highest number of bubbles were also selected and analyzed it provides detailed information of the possible minimum or maximum bubbles generated at each us power intensity which is crucial for membrane fouling control less bubbles or smaller bubbles may release less energy and hence reduce the probability of turbulence flow and surface cleaning figs 8 10 depicts the images generated from imagej at three levels of power intensities the bubble size distribution and the probability density of size distribution are also presented in these figures it should be noted that all those three images for three power intensities were not selected at the same us exposure time the number of bubbles the bubble size and the area occupied by bubbles were obtained by imagej software matlab was also employed to determine the bubble size distribution and probability density of imagej images the maximum probability density represents the dominant bubble size in each image 42 the dominant bubble sizes bubble diameter for images with the maximum number of bubbles at 50 w 60 w and 100 w of us power are 36 5 39 8 μm and 48 2 μm respectively clearly the dominant bubble size increased with the us power intensity table 2 presents the summary of the minimum maximum and the averaged number of bubbles at 50 w 60 w and 100 w it indicates that higher us power resulted in more bubble formation with a larger area and accordingly larger value for the area occupied for example the averaged number in frames with lowest bubbles at 50 w 60 w and 100 w is 374 495 and 543 respectively which shows an increasing trend of the number of bubbles with the power intensity also for images with the minimum number of bubbles an unexpected observation was noticed where the averaged bubble size at 50 w was larger than that at us power of 60 w this may be attributed to the presence of a very large bubble in that particular frame the large bubble left the area of interest after a couple of milliseconds 3 1 2 in situ visualization of bubbles dynamics at different distances from us transducer the goal of using us is to generate cavitational bubbles close to the cp and cake layer formed on the membrane in the filtration unit there is a 2 mm gap between the membrane and the top plate of the module where the us transducer would be placed it means the membrane will likely be placed on the middle slice of the frames and all bubbles observed in that area will be close to the cp and cake layer helping in removing deposited particles from the surface therefore the bubble formation the bubble size and the bubble behaviour were also examined at varying distances from the top of the frame where the us transducer was located in this regard images at different power intensities were vertically divided into three slices full stack analysis was also employed to evaluate the bubble characteristics of individual slices at varied us power intensities the mean size of the bubbles in the middle slice was found to be remarkably higher than those of the others the highest number of bubbles was also found in the middle slice for all three power intensities such that at us power of 100 w the averaged number of bubbles captured at the middle slice was about six times and sixteen times that of the top and bottom slice respectively a greater number of bubbles with larger sizes were formed at us power of 100 w consequently the area occupied by bubbles in the middle slice was much higher at this condition about 4 5 times that at 50 w and 60 w table 3 presents the bubble related parameters at different power intensities and distances from the us transducer as can be seen in table 3 the fraction of area at the top and bottom slices increased at about 7 and 46 as the us power was altered from 50 w to 60 w however once the us power was increased to 100 w it dropped significantly by around 68 for both slices aside from the us frequency applied to the system oscillating bubbles have a natural frequency resonant frequency determined by the physical parameters of the bubbles and the liquid medium eq 2 shows the relationship between the resonant frequency and those physical properties 43 2 f r 1 2 π 1 r 0 3 γ ρ air ρ water where f r is the resonant frequency r 0 the equilibrium radius of the bubble ρ air density of air ρ water density of water and γ the specific heat ratio polytropic coefficient according to eq 2 at a resonant frequency equal to the acoustic driving frequency 28 khz the bubble s equilibrium radius is about 110 μm d 220 μm a 3 8 104 μm 2 thus bubbles smaller than this size would have higher resonance frequencies above the acoustic driving frequency and they travel toward the pressure antinodes and accumulate there likewise larger bubbles with lower resonant frequency move down to the pressure nodes 44 during the image processing it was observed that large bubbles d 220 μm moved away from the us transducers however most of the small bubbles d 220 μm traveled upward and this could be the reason for having a lower number of bubbles at the bottom slice fig s 2 shows the small bubbles moved toward the us transducer large bubbles seemed to move slower than the small bubbles and they spent more time at lower slices thus it was more probable to capture large bubbles in the middle or at the bottom of the frames resulting in a higher value for bubble mean size determined by imagej fig s 3 shows large bubbles moving at the bottom and middle slides thus if there are sufficient bubbles to help remove the foulant from the membrane surface then the high number of bubbles in the top region as shown in table 3 could further help in forming agglomerates of solid particles in the bulk solution the agglomerates can be carried away with the cross flow of the fluid without reaching the membrane surface consequently this would help reduce the amount of solid deposited on the membrane surface less fouling 3 1 3 microbubbles velocity analysis the influence of ultrasound us power intensity on microbubble velocity was also analyzed bubble velocities at different us power intensities were estimated by using consecutive frames and tracking the changes in the bubble s position in many images bubbles disappeared in 0 5 ms one frame as shown in fig 11 to estimate the velocity the distance between the centers of an individual bubble in sequence images was measured and divided by the interframe time of successive images it should be pointed out that the bubble behaviour and the distance they could travel in a consecutive frame seemed to be dependent on the size of the bubbles the bubble velocity was higher for a smaller bubble as expected since the drag force applied on the smaller bubble moving in a fluid would be lower as compared to that for a larger bubble fig 12 a shows a part of an image with the small bubbles and their velocities at the us power intensities of 50 w 60 w and 100 w a higher bubble velocity was obtained as the us power was changes from 50 w to 100 w the size and velocity of the large bubble are depicted in fig 12 b large bubbles seemed to be oscillating and staying at the bottom of the frame close to the membrane surface or moving slowly surface cleaning may take place due to the turbulence flow created as a result of the explosion of those large bubbles in the vicinity of the membrane surface furthermore bubbles got larger by increasing the us power intensity thus higher cleaning efficiency is expected under the us power of 100 w 3 2 in situ observations and mechanisms of bubble cavitation the influence of the us power intensity on the stationary and moving microbubbles was also studied based on selected microbubbles within the capacity of the imaging technique used 5 5 μm although some bubbles were observed to be stationary or they only oscillated in their position constant coordinate with no change in their size over time most bubbles traveled in the liquid medium the size of those moving microbubbles increased over time unless they had experienced bubble explosion under which small bubbles were created smaller than camera detector resolution or bubble collapse that create shockwave or microjets 45 48 the growth of bubbles at different power intensities is shown in fig 13 in all those images the bubble radius increased until it reached an equilibrium stable size the duration of the bubble growth varied with the us power intensity due to different growth ratios growth ratio bubble size at time t the initial size of the bubble and the bubbles initial sizes it was reported by kanthale et al 49 that the bubble growth ratio increased by changing the us power from 7 5 w to 20 w for bubbles in fig 13 it was observed that the growth ratio at the us power intensities of 50 60 and 100 w was 2 66 2 91 and 1 54 respectively the first two data are in agreement with the observations presented by kanthale et al 49 the bubble growth ratio increased as the us power was altered from 50 w to 60 w a lower growth ratio at 100 w could be due to the higher growth rate from nuclei to its initial size captured by the camera therefore as it is evident in fig 13 the bubble had a larger initial size at 100 w as compared to that at lower us power intensities which consequently resulted in a lower growth ratio thus the growth duration was measured and used to calculate the growth velocity growth ratio growth duration of bubbles at different power intensities the growth velocity for bubbles at us power of 50 60 and 100 w was 0 05 s 1 0 07 s 1 and 0 09 s 1 respectively therefore the bubble growth was proved to be much faster at 100 w than at lower us power intensities in addition at 100 w bubbles may explode much more frequently releasing more energy into the liquid medium which causes a turbulence flow and results in higher membrane surface cleaning 4 conclusions synchrotron bmit bm 05b1 1 white beam polychromatic beam with spectral energy was able to detect cavitational bubbles and reveal the details of bubble dynamics in the water medium under us influence high phase contrast was achieved for the liquid and gas inside the bubbles interface between liquid and gas using the pbi technique the pbi along with the optimum synchrotron x ray imaging technique facilitated in situ visualization of cavitational bubbles in water medium inside the filtration unit high quality images and image contrast of air liquid phases were achieved by optimizing the key parameters including selected beam energy and detector settings sdd for the in line phase contrast imaging camera speed mode of imaging and filtration unit material and design both the appropriate material for the filtration unit and the water body thickness were the important elements in this research and they must be optimized to prevent the material cracking capture clear images of the bubbles and attain a high phase contrast between the liquid and gas inside the bubbles interface of liquid and gas bubbles were created at a driving frequency of 28 khz and the us power of 50 60 and 100 w the majority of bubbles resided in the middle slice where the us field us wave was also observed the number and the averaged size of the bubbles increased by increasing the us power intensities resulting in higher energy discharge into the water medium and consequently higher cleaning efficiency compared to the resonance size bubbles with smaller sizes moved upward and their velocity increased as us power changed from 50 w to 100 w bubble velocity appeared to be dependent on the bubble size as large bubbles moved slower than the smaller bubbles and they tended to stay at the bottom of the frame close to the membrane surface this observation shows a significant reduction in membrane fouling and cake layer resistance in the presence of large bubbles since most of them tend to oscillate close to the membrane surface and they may cause the formation of turbulence flow by bubble explosion it was also observed that us power intensity influenced the bubble growth ratio the improved permeate flux and mass transfer across the membrane in the us assisted ultrafiltration process supports the findings from real time imaging of microbubbles and the influence of us power intensity on bubble dynamics and their application to fouling remediation declaration of competing interest there are no potential conflicts of interest for the authors to declare

hydride keywords bacterial remediation bioadsorption bioaccumulation bioprecipitation bioleaching 1 introduction heavy metals are elements with specific density of more than 5 g cm 3 1 and some of which are quintessential at low concentrations for the normal physiological functions of living organisms 2 specific amounts of calcium ca sodium na magnesium mg potassium k copper cu iron fe zinc zn and chromium cr are required for the survival of organisms while their high concentrations cause toxicity 3 several metals like cadmium cd mercury hg nickel ni arsenic as and lead pb are toxic at any quantity causing deleterious effect on the wellbeing and survival of living organisms 4 and it causes ecological nutritional genetic and evolutionary impacts heavy metals reach the environment by natural and anthropogenic activities 5 as the heavy metals are non degrading and bio accumulating with well delineated toxic effects government agencies has imposed rules and legislations to limit the use and discharge of toxic metals to environment world health organization 6 has defined the permissible heavy metal concentration in safe drinking water whereas food and agriculture organization has stipulated the maximum permissible limit of toxic heavy metals in irrigation water 7 to comply with the regulations and standards many strategies and techniques have been investigated and implemented to alleviate heavy metals from water the generally employed techniques are coagulation ion exchange membrane filtration chemical precipitation adsorption electrochemical treatment flocculation and bioremediation 8 bioremediation is gaining tremendous attention since a few decades due to its less or no requirement of chemicals cost effectiveness absence of solid sludge by products and eco friendly operating techniques 9 bioremediation can be defined as the process that utilizes and depends on biological mechanisms to transform degrade detoxify pollutants to innoxious state and ultimately mineralize to carbon dioxide nitrogen and water etc using live or dead biomass 10 plants fungi bacteria algae and cyanobacteria are widely researched and employed for heavy metal bioremediation microorganisms are most suitable for the purpose as they are easier to handle culture and implement in recent years microorganisms especially bacteria reckoned recognition with their ability to adsorb solubilize and precipitate heavy metals by bioadsorption biosorption bioaccumulation bioleaching and bioprecipitation omni presence abundance diversity small size and unique capacity to grow and propagate under controlled and uncontrolled conditions with environmental resilience make bacteria the best candidate for bioremediation 11 bacterial bioremediation of heavy metals in solution mostly occur by means of adsorption on bacterial cell surface it is the first line defence of bacteria to resist metal toxicity wherein negatively charged carboxyl amino phosphoryl and sulfo groups on bacterial cell wall acts as potential ion exchange sites and metal sinks thus adsorption occurs on cell wall by redox process ion exchange complexation electrostatic attraction and precipitation bioadsorption or biosorption is an inactive process where heavy metals are adsorbed on to the cell surface devoid of energy expenditure metabolism independent until equilibrium is achieved while bioaccumulation is predominantly metabolism dependent or active uptake of heavy metals by living biomass cells 10 bacteria bind heavy metal ions by means of exopolymers polysaccharides to their cell surface further circumscribe or internalise these metal species into the cell for various metabolic functions besides chelate the metals by producing several metabolic ligands 12 bioleaching is the bio recovery of metals by releasing excreting ligands like organic acids cyanide thiosulphate and phenol derivatives these ligands interact react with metals in its vicinity bind and form mostly soluble complexes directly or indirectly bioprecipitation of metals is a metal sequestering process exhibited by metabolically active cells where metabolites produced react with metals present in water and form metal precipitates microorganisms particularly anaerobic bacteria convert the metals present or dissolved in aqueous solution into solid precipitates via sulphate carbonate phosphate or hydroxide precipitation 13 1 1 significance of the study to explore and understand the underlying mechanisms by which bacteria remediate heavy metals is vital for the development of feasible technologies and treatment strategies using bacteria for heavy metal removal from polluted environments better knowledge on cellular process leading to hazardous heavy metal removal is

fungi algae and nanomaterials remediation procedures were excluded even bacterial remediation in solid substrates like soil was also not considered publications from the year 2000 to 2022 were scrutinized and the bacterial remediation mechanism elucidated in each research paper were probed and discerned as most of the literature available were confined to bioadsorption and bioaccumulation

heavy metals these include uptake of heavy metals on to the cell surface by biosorption intracellular sequestration by accumulation extracellular sequestration as insoluble compounds by precipitation and production of metabolites that solubilize and chelate metal compounds that leads to leaching the different mechanisms and its several modes exhibited by bacteria to remove and annihilate heavy metals is depicted in fig 1 and discussed in following section 2 1 bioadsorption biosorption biosorption bio adsorption is the non directed active or passive physiochemical interaction between inorganic and organic metal minerals with cellular substances 17 18 the major processes involved in biosorption mechanism are surface adsorption physisorption chemisorption ion exchange and surface complexation surface adsorption involves electrical attraction between negatively charged ligands present on cell wall and the positively charged metal ions in medium and is often an exchange reaction 19 physical adsorption majorly comprises van der waals forces whereas in chemical or activated adsorption attraction occurs between the adsorbent and adsorbate an assemblage of all these mechanisms either functioning together or independently leads to the overall metal adsorption on microbial cell surface 20 heavy metal binding possibly a two stage task comprises interaction between reactive groups on bacterial cell surface and the metal ions followed by deposition of metal 19 spectroscopic and chemical modification studies have depicted that the cellular radicals like hydroxyl carboxyl sulfate sulfhydryl thiol thioether phosphate phosphonate phosphodiester amino imine amide imidazole and carbonyl ketone possess high metal binding potential 21 table 1 elucidates the chemical

positive bacterial cell wall contains glycoproteins on its outer side dispensing more accessible binding sites than lps and phospholipids 19 2 1 1 physical adsorption physisorption it is the phenomenon of transferring ions from one phase to another namely liquid phase to solid phase involving i bulk transfer to peripheral layer ii inward diffusion or massive transmission through pores and or random motion of atoms by solid diffusion and iii adhesion or adsorption to the exterior surface of bacterial cells physical adsorption is due to non specific rapid and reversible attraction forces like van der waals forces or it occurs by electrostatic adsorption on account of coulombic attractive forces arising between charged solute particles and bacterial cell surface 18 ahalya et al 22 reported that copper biosorption on zoogloea ramigera bacterium occurred through electrostatic interaction physicochemical interactions between the cellular radicals on the bacterial cell wall and membrane and the metal species in solute are the prime factors responsible for rapid and reversible metabolism independent biosorption in dead cell biomasses ftir studies by hasan et al 23 elucidated that amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups existing on the cell surface dead dried biomass of aeromonas hydrophila was the fundamental cause of pb ii sorption besides the passage through pores anionic groups c o coo nh oh and c o present on dead streptomyces rimosus bacterial cell walls exhibited fairly high adsorption towards pb2 ions 24 2 1 2 ion exchange in ion exchange mechanism metal cations bind to a vacant site previously occupied by another cation divalent ions of metals are adsorbed by exchange with polysaccharide counter ions present on the cell wall and outer membrane of bacteria 25 this process relies on several factors like the different kinds and number of sites present on the cell surface and their ionization pattern which is eventually determined by the ph and pka value of respective groups protonated amine groups are positive in charge and turns neutral while deprotonated addition of protons convert phosphate carboxyl and sulfate groups into neutral and in deprotonated condition turns negatively charged 26 nickel biosorption by ion exchange was reported in pseudomonas fluorescens 4f39 27 pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and micrococcus luteus adsorbed significant quantities of lead and copper which further increased with ph from 2 to 6 28 hasan et al 23 has inferred that pb ii ions compete with h at low ph and get adsorbed to aeromonas hydrophila by ion exchange 2 1 3 complexation remediation of metals could also occur by formation of complexes over cell periphery by the interaction of reactive radicals on cell wall and metal ions in solution amino carboxyl hydroxy thiol phosphate and hydroxyl carboxyl groups interact in coordination with heavy metal ions 29 complex or co ordination compound is a poly atomic molecule with neutral or negative or positive charge and it consists of single or numerous central atoms generally metal cations bounded and joined to ligands other negative or neutrally charged atoms or groups if a ligand is connected through two or more coordinating atoms to central atom then the complex is termed as chelate 26 magnesium calcium cadmium copper zinc and mercury complexation were found to occur in pseudomonas syringae complexation is the major biosorption process involved during alkaline ph mercury and uranium complexation has been reported at ph above 7 in pseudomonas fluorescens 4f39 by lópez et al 28 hydroxyl phosphoryl carboxyl and amino groups of proteins and polysaccharides on the extracellular matrix of shewanella putrefaciens was found to complex with cr vi 30 recent research outcomes on bacterial biosorption of heavy metals are tabulated table 2 environmental factors like temperature ph and composition of wastewater concentration and oxidation state of heavy metals organic and inorganic entities present colloids and emulsions may influence biosorption along with the type of bacterial strain and mechanism of metal removal use of dead cells is more propounded as dead biomass is hardly susceptible to heavy metal toxicity and nutrients are not required for the growth of bacterial cells 19 31 lowering operational cost the biomass waste from fermentation industries could be used for the purpose metal loading on biomass is very rapid as the non living biomass is an efficient ion exchanger sterilization is not mandatory with storage options and pretreatment of bacterial biomass may further improve the biosorptive capacity moreover operating conditions like ph temperature time etc could be controlled with possibility for metal recovery however the improvement of biosorption potential by genetic engineering or biological altering of metal valency state is limited in dead biomass 19 bioadsorption is a simple and fast process that could utilize alive or dead bacterial cells or exopolymers alone to retrieve heavy metals from aqueous solution though physical and chemical parameters of media and oxidation state of metal ions determine the efficiency of the process metals are adsorbed within few hours rather resorption is easy and biomass could be reused this is the most common heavy metal defence mechanism exhibited by mesophilic bacterial strains 2 2 bioaccumulation bioaccumulation is the influx and accretion of metals within bacterial cells by the uptake of non metabolic metals through the same carrier pathway involved for metabolically essential metals the mechanism constitutes binding of metal ions to the reactive radicals at the outer surface of bacterial cell wall likewise and furthermore to its internal region through energy independent mechanism subsequently metals diffuse into the cell cytoplasm by means of energy dependent independent process the pathway for the transport of metabolically pivotal ions like sodium na potassium k magnesium etc would be relied for the transport of heavy metals through microbial cell membranes for intracellular accumulation the cation transport systems will bind with heavy metal ions of identical ionic radius and charge as of essential metal ions 29 2 2 1 intracellular transport heavy metals are imported to the bacterial cell by means of channels secondary carrier proteins and primary active transporters present on bacterial cell membrane channels are α helical proteins that serve for the passive diffusion of heavy metals across the membrane according to concentration gradient these channel proteins belong to major intrinsic proteins super family and are found to transport arsenic and mercury in a series of bacterial species like e coli cornebacterium streptomyces coelicolor serratia and pseudomonas 44 β barrel proteins and porins present in gram negative bacteria have also been found to translocate heavy metals uniporters symporters and antiporters are the secondary carrier proteins involved in heavy metal accumulation transporter opsin g protein coupled receptor super family and major facilitator super family proteins form the chief carrier proteins behind this function these proteins rely on proton motive force for metal shifts into the bacterial cell likewise uptake of ni co and as has been reported in helicobacter pylori 45 rhodopseudomonas palustris 46 novosphingobium aromaticivorans and staphylococcus aurens 47 primary active transporter proteins are multi domain tertiary proteins embedded in the plasma membrane of bacterial cells which comprises a transmembrane portion and cytosolic atpase coupling component periplasmic solute binding domain is also sometimes present p type atpase proteins and abc transporter proteins are the major protein super families that constitute primary active transporters 44 these transporters transit heavy metals against concentration gradient using energy derived from the hydrolysis of atp or gtp reserves in cell lactobacillus plantarum 48 thlaspi caerulescens 49 and enterobacter hirae 50 bioaccumulated cd into the cell through primary transporters apart from the membrane carrier proteins interaction of metals with bacterial surface ligands subsequently leads to its slow transport into the cell bacteria including cyanobacteria release high affinity low molecular weight 200 2000 da coordination molecules termed as siderophores that bind iron atoms the synthesis of siderophores in bacteria is a stimulatory response towards iron scarcity in environment in addition to iron radicals siderophores are able to join and bind with other metals also e g thorium th uranium u ni gallium ga and cu 51 bacterial siderophores constitute catecholates e g enterobactin carboxylates e g rhizobactin and hydroxamates e g ferrioxamine b 52 bacteria use different siderophore mediated iron fe transport systems and it varies in gram positive and negative bacteria gram negative bacteria like escherichia strains possess outer membrane tonb dependent receptors which recognize fe iii siderophore complexes accessible at the cell surface and bind them thenceforth fe iii siderophore bound to the tonb dependent outer membrane receptors crosses the outer membrane to periplasmic space via high affinity periplasmic binding protein which accompanies the fe iii siderophore complex up to cytoplasmic membrane and is relieved back to periplasmic space to resume its carrier function fe iii siderophore complexes are shuttled across the cytoplasmic membrane to cytoplasm by atp binding cassette abc transport system finally fe iii is dissociated from the siderophore complex via reduction of fe iii to fe ii subsequently siderophores are either degraded or recycled through a shuttle mechanism using specific efflux pump 53 fig 2 whereas in gram positive bacteria like bacillus no outer membrane receptors are present due to the lack of outer membrane therefore the fe iii siderophore complexes directly attach to the periplasmic siderophore binding proteins embedded on cytoplasmic membrane after which the fe iii siderophore complexes are transported to the cytoplasm as like in gram negative bacteria by the atp dependent abc transport system 54 2 2 2 intracellular fate of bioaccumulated heavy metals growing bacterial cells are capable of eliminating metals perpetually by internal detoxification methods biotransformation and reduction of metals using enzymes methylation sequestration by metal organic complexion and production of metal chelators metallothioneins are the different mechanisms exhibited by bacteria to defend metal toxicity 55 2 2 2 1 intracellular sequestration intracellular sequestration is the process of formation of composites of metal ions with various cellular cytoplasmic compounds upon entry to the cells heavy metal ions are translocated attached or imbedded in cellular organelles depending on the element concerned and the bacterial strain chelation is the process of binding of metals to ligands or compounds cytoplasmic metal chelation is mostly aided by metallothineins peptides rich in cysteine γ glutamylcysteine a glutathione analogue present in haloarchaea and by polyphosphate the chelating molecule produced in most halophilic bacteria and archaea species iron storage protein ferritin copper and zinc storing metallothioneins are the common metal sequestering proteins found in bacterial cells 56 metal stress induces high expression of metallothionein genes and its overproduction in bacteria resulting in augmented metal binding and sequestration 57 this metal accumulation potential of specific bacterial strains has been manipulated mainly for effluent treatment rhizobium leguminosarum with the aid of glutathione manifested considerable quantity of intracellular cadmium ion sequestration 58 jroundi et al 59 reported intracellular accumulation of lead in polyphosphate grains within the cells of bacillus species isolated from mediterranean sea cyanobacteria anabaena cylindrica and plectonema boryanum accumulated cadmium and aluminium in polyphosphate bodies 19 2 2 2 2 reduction of heavy metal ions bacteria make use of metals and metalloids as electron donors or acceptors for energy generation bacterial cells can transform the oxidation state of metal ions thus reducing its toxicity oxidized metals act as terminal electron acceptors in bacteria during anaerobic respiration many anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial species use oxidized metallic elements like fe iii mn iv or cr vi as terminal electron acceptors 60 reduction of selenium and arsenic coupled to organic substrates lactic acid acetic acid and aromatics is observed in certain bacterial species oxyanions of selenium and arsenic are also used as terminal electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration by bacterial strains that provide energy for metabolism and growth 61 enzymatic reduction results in the generation of less toxic forms of mercury and chromium mercury detoxification is accomplished in bacterial strains by organomercurial lyase merb and mercuric reductase mera enzymes enzymatic chromate reduction that involves copper dependent reductase was observed in haloalkaliphilic amphibacillus sp 62 membrane associated nadh dependent chromate reductases catalysed chromate reduction is prevalent in halophilic halomonas strains 63 nadh dependent nitrate reductase catalyses ionic silver ag reduction to inactive metallic colloidal silver nanoparticles in bacillus licheniformis 64 arsenate reduction in prokaryotes is carried out by soluble arsenate reductases arsc 65 several bacterial strains of bacillus pseudomonas putida and pedomicrobium reduces manganese mn iii and iv to mn ii and further oxidize it to be used as terminal electron acceptor in electron transport chain 66 2 2 2 3 methylation of metals certain bacterial strains are proficient in methylating various metal metalloid and organometallic compounds to methyl derivatives which is often volatile and evaporates 19 methylation is one of the fundamental biochemical pathways of bacterial cell intracellular metal and metalloid methylation occur by any of the three pathways namely involving s adenosylmethionine methylcobalamin and n methyltetrahydrofolate sulphate or iron reducing bacteria utilize methylcobalamin to methylate mercury hg whereas methylation of arsenic as occurs via s adenosylmethionine 67 metal compounds when methylated turns to be explosive mostly for instance escherichia sp bacillus sp pseudomonas sp and clostridium sp biomethylate hg ii to gaseous methyl mercury bio methylation of as to gaseous arsines selenium se to volatile dimethyl selenide and lead pb to decomposable dimethyl lead has been observed in solutions stagnant on polluted top soil containing bacteria 55 each methylation pathway is distinct and the pathways involved vary among bacterial species and oxidation state of metals in aqueous solution 67 schematic representation of intracellular transport of heavy metals and its cellular accumulation process is depicted in fig 3 table 3 outlines the recent research findings on heavy metal accumulation by bacterial species bioaccumulation is a toxicokinetic process influenced by the sensitivity of living cells to heavy metals it depends on the type of bacteria concentration and metals involved and could be inhibited by metabolic inhibitors like low temperatures and nutrient deficiency moreover metal ion uptake is dependent on cell age ph of metal solution and composition of media initial metal concentration contact time and finally the concentration of bacterial cells in aqueous solution kinetics of bioaccumulation of metal ions is biphasic with an initial rapid phase rendering 90 of metal uptake which last for about 10 to 30 min and a gradual second phase of approximately 4 h 68 bioaccumulation is a heavy metal bioextration process with numerous application prospects the essential metal ions are accumulated rapidly than the non essential ones and this process could only be realized with live bacterial cells genetic engineering works are more focused in this aspect of bacterial process by redesigning the transporter proteins for enhanced passage of preferred metals proteomics and its manipulation of metal sequestering proteins are also underway evolving research could brighten up the possibilities of bacterial bioaccumulation in heavy metal extraction and recovery 2 3 bioprecipitation removal of metals from solution by means of precipitation is often coupled with the defence mechanism of bacteria cellular metabolism independent precipitation is due to the chemical interaction of bacterial cell surface and metal ions 22 precipitation occurs by reduction sulfide formation and as phosphates depending on the bacterial species and environment 2 3 1 reduction reduction process occurs in bacterial species as mentioned earlier numerous bacterial strains catalyse the reduction of hazardous selenite se iv and selenate se vi ionic forms to elemental selenium which gets deposited as red precipitate over bacterial colonies biofilm of desulfomicrobium norvegicum was shown to precipitate elemental selenium with sulfur 72 a strain of alteromonas shewanella putrefaciens that normally reduce mn iv and fe iii was also found to reduce u vi producing black precipitate of u iv carbonate 73 shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and two geobacter species reduced hg ii to hg 0 in the presence of electron acceptors 74 the bacterial species involved in uranium reduction and the mechanisms involved has been thoroughly reviewed by you et al 75 2 3 2 metal precipitation as sulphides sulphate reducing bacteria are heterotrophic obligate anaerobes which oxidizes organic compounds or hydrogen for energy metabolism using sulphate as terminal electron acceptor it reduces sulphate to sulfide which further combines with available metals in the cell and environment leading to the formation of metal sulphides fig 4 metal sulphides except alkali and alkaline earth metals are insoluble and the resultant precipitation of sulphides protect sulphate reducing bacteria from metal toxicity and metals protect the organisms from sulfide toxicity vice versa 19 sulphate reducing bacteria also generate an extremely reducing condition which could bio chemically reduce metals like u vi and cr vi 76 enzymatic sulfide formation with the aid of thiosulfate reductase has been reported in salmonella typhimurium when thiosulfate reductase gene phsabc of s typhimurium cloned and highly expressed in e coli metal sulfide precipitation happened due to sulfide production from inorganic thiosulfate compounds 77 klebsiella planticola cd resistant strains cultured in thiosulfate supplemented media precipitated substantial quantities of cadmium sulfide cds 78 2 3 3 metal precipitation as phosphates in this precipitation method the enzyme phosphatase liberates inorganic phosphate pi from cellular organic phosphate like glycerol 2 phosphate and pi in turn precipitates metals radionuclides as phosphates on the cell fig 4 immobilized cells of citrobacter sp precipitated cu cd pb and u from glycerol 2 phosphate enriched solutions here phosphatase catalysed glycerol 2 phosphate cleavage released hydrogen phosphates which precipitated metals extracellularly as insoluble metal phosphates 17 a mixture of hydrated zirconia zro2 and zr hpo4 2 was obtained upon mineralization of zirconium by citrobacter sp 19 precipitation can be either metabolically dependent or independent in metabolically active precipitation reaction between the molecular compound s produced by the bacterial defence system and target metal s in medium results in crystallisation of metals on the other hand metabolism independent precipitation is due to chemical interaction between the dissolved heavy metal ions and the reactive radicals on bacterial cell surface fig 4 metal crystallisation occurs in media wastewater effluent and on the peripheral region of bacterial cells during bioprecipitation and is dependent on cell metabolism and metal concentration 22 recent reports on bioprecipitation of heavy metals by bacteria is comprehensively presented in table 4 alive and dead bacterial cells do exhibit heavy metal precipitation but dead biomass is less efficient in the process as only passive interaction of bacterial surface ions and the metal ions in medium is the sole cause of precipitation in latter the metal recovery is comparatively easy in case of precipitated metals and is suitable to treat mine effluents and electroplating industry sewage 2 4 bioleaching bioleaching is the solubilization of metals from its natural parent materials such as ore substrates or its crystals suspended or present in contact with the bacterial medium it occurs directly as a part of bacterial metabolism or indirectly by bacterial metabolic by products bioleaching is more often a bio hydrometallurgical method used to recover metals like gold copper zinc arsenic antimony cobalt uranium bismuth nickel molybdenum lead and vanadium mostly chemolithotrophic mesophilic bacteria which require metabolic energy sources like ferrous sulphate pyrite and sulfur are involved in metal leaching predominantly iron oxidizing acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and sulfur oxidizing bacteria acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are used in bioleaching besides acidophilium nirospira leptospirilum ferrooxidans ferroplasma sulfur oxidizing bacteria acidithiobacillus albertis and acidithiobacillus caldus are also used in mine sludge bioleaching thermophilic bacteria sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans are used for faster bioleaching rate at higher temperatures several heterotrophic bacterial species like acidophilum arthrobactor acetobacter trichoderma and pseudomonas are capable of producing organic acids like citric acid malic acid and oxalic acid these acid moieties when released to the medium join with metals by supplying both protons and metal complexing anions thus leading to metal leaching 91 2 4 1 sulfide bioleaching direct and indirect mechanisms are involved in sulfur based leaching process by bacteria leading to the formation of metal sulfides and its dissolution fig 4 in direct leaching process bacteria directly contact and react with metal sulfide and oxidize it to soluble metal sulfates like nis zns cus etc on the contrary in indirect bacterial leaching the sulfur oxidizing bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur compounds and elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid thus reducing the ph of the persisting medium consequently augmenting the solubility of metals in solution 91 sulfate reducing bacteria sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans sulfolobus sp s acidophilus thiobacillus denitrificans and t thioparus were successfully applied in the remediation of mine seepage water 92 successful removal of fe cu zn as and ni sulphates from mine drainage using desulfovibrio desulfuricans and desulfomicrobium baculatum strains has been reported by sahinkaya et al 93 2 4 2 pyrite leaching in iron based bioleaching mechanism reduced sulfur and iron compounds are oxidized through direct or indirect process non iron metal sulphides are oxidized directly by iron oxidizing bacteria like acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans into soluble metal sulfate fig 4 in direct leaching bacterial cells adhere selectively to the surface structure of minerals by chemotactic behavior on the other hand in indirect pathway the bacteria oxidize fe2 to fe3 and the fe3 in turn react with metals and leaches through chemical reaction the bacterial cells are not in need of direct contact with minerals during this process the production of sulfuric acid as a by product of this mechanism further enhances the solubilization process 91 gallionella ferruginea has been reported to oxidize iron in mine water drainage 94 bacteria such as acidithiobacillus thiooxidans at ferrooxidans at cryptum acidiphilium caldus acidianus brierleyi ochrobactrum anthropic citrobacter cronobacter clostridium ferroplasma acidiphilum ferribacterium limneticum leptospirillum ferrooxidans l ferriphilum have demonstrated excellent ability in leaching metals from their corresponding ore waste exudates 95 latorre et al 96 has found that l ferriphilum and at thiooxidans leach ores of copper sulfide and metals like copper and arsenic with better efficiency by oxidizing iron and thereby reducing inorganic sulfur compounds 2 4 3 heterotrophic bacterial leaching heterotrophic bacteria namely pseudomonas sp have the potential to produce acidic metabolites that are capable to extract and solubilize metals from non sulfidic minerals present in sewage sludge via acidolysis the formation of organic or inorganic acids complexation excretion of complexing agents and reduction oxidation and reduction reactions currently heterotrophic bioleaching is mostly applied in metal recovery of gold silver titanium aluminium nickel copper manganese chromium and uranium from sewage 97 heterotrophic bacteria release organic acids like lactic acid citric acid oxalic acid gluconic acid and phenolic derivatives that have at least two hydrophilic reactive groups capable of dissolving heavy metals by displacing metal ions with hydrogen ions this process is supplemented by the production of soluble metal chelates and complexes fig 4 role and interactions of heterotrophic bacterial strains of staphylococcus rhodococcus pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and cupriavidus metallidurans with autotrophic bacteria during bioleaching of copper has been delineated by jeremic et al 98 heterotrophic bacteria bacillus ns 1 has been found to increase metal leaching efficiency in electroplating sewage treatment 99 the solubilised metals could be recovered or removed from solution by using ligands electro winning biosorption or solvent extraction different factors like temperature ph contact time composition of medium tolerance towards the metal biomass concentration types and quantity of metabolites produced and released by bacterial strains into the medium affect the bacterial leaching mechanism 100 recent research reports on heavy metals leached by bacterial species are tabulated table 5 bioleaching is a bio extraction technique to retract metals from its ores the metals could be biologically dissolved and abstracted though the process is gradual it is eco friendly sustainable technique with potential to retrieve precious metals bacteria has turned to be a potent bioremediating agent of heavy metal contaminants from effluents bacterial biosorption accumulation precipitation and leaching of heavy metals are inexpensive methods to remediate or stabilize heavy metal pollutants from contaminated water the boon and bane of each mechanism is enlisted in table 6 the whole process of bioremediation mechanisms is collectively represented in fig 4 appropriate understanding of cellular mechanism is essential for the accurate selection of strains for urban and industrial wastewater treatment which is the most challenging task of degradation and retrieval of heavy metals from e waste processing by product exudates bacterial heavy metal remediation mechanisms are easy to understand when it refers to a single metal through single pathway or process but it becomes complicated in the presence of multiple ions generally encountered in effluents standardization of physicochemical parameters that imparts maximum remediation is highly essential for better results furthermore molecular level studies are required to discover the exact and apparent cellular mechanisms exhibited by bacteria to eliminate toxic heavy metals at different conditions and environments researchers are exploring novel bacterial species with great heavy metal removal potential and subsequent genetic engineering works are also in progress at the same time various bioremediation strategies and protocols has been designed and devised relying on the inimitable decontamination prospects of bacteria these techniques have proved application potential in almost all industrial sectors like tannery textile electroplating printing and municipal sewage where wastewater treatment is pivotal 3 applications of bacterial bioremediation in wastewater treatment several bacterial based processes have been developed implemented and practised for heavy metal remediation in wastewater treatment which includes both ex situ and in situ approaches the ex situ techniques crafted and materialized are microbial bioreactors microbial fuel cell or microbial electrolysis cell and microbial desalination units table 7 while constructed floating wetlands and bioaugmentation are the in situ bacterial based heavy metal remediation systems table 8 research have evolved from proof of concept study to pilot and full scale approaches and these remediation protocols and practises have recognized immense application in domestic sewage landfill leachate industrial effluent treatment and polluted natural water resource lakes ground water reservoir etc decontamination bioreactors are specially engineered devices that provide optimum conditions to foster the growth and biochemical activity of specific bacterial species for desired remediation purpose polluted water samples are fed to the reactor for the removal and retrieval of contaminants the reactor design and bacterial strain selection depends on the purpose and polluted source which can be slurry phase packed bed fluidised partitioned suspended carrier airlift up flow anaerobic stage reactor continuous flow sequence batch stirred tank biofilter based and membrane bioreactors 111 113 this can be installed at industrial and open leachate sites and its operational procedures and treatment duration varies with the input wastewater parameters and the desired product quality 111 microbial fuel cells employ microbes especially bacteria to generate electrons from metabolic reactions these electrons generated are used for the concomitant reduction oxidation of heavy metal contaminants thereby its precipitation at anode chamber and or for electron transport to cathode the electrons reaching cathode combines with the available oxygen and protons are released and transferred back a continuous flow of these entities produce energy that could be used for varied purposes 128 microbial desalination cell is the integrated process of electrodialysis using microbial fuel cell for the effective treatment of wastewater with simultaneous desalination electricity generation and metal recovery mixed or pure culture of exoelectrogenic bacteria is used for this procedure shewanella putrefaciens proteobacteria actinobacteria pseudomonas bacillus subtilis are the major bacterial strains used in microbial desalination cells 132 ship spillage was found to be effectively treated using this technique the ex situ bacterial bioremediation techniques and its heavy metal removal efficiency are tabulated in table 7 constructed wetland or floating treatment wetland is a novel phyto microbial technique for the treatment of water bodies to mitigate pollution these artificial wetlands consist of floating mat over which vegetative plants are grown and its roots hang in the water column bacterial biofilms are attached to these hanging roots and desired endophytic bacteria are also inoculated to the plants 134 135 these bacterial colonies aid heavy metal adsorption and water decontamination this procedure is implemented in several regions and sites and fruitful results were achieved bioaugmentation in wastewater decontamination is the addition of selective bacteria single strain or consortia to the polluted water bodies this is done according to the prevailing physiochemical conditions of polluted source and the heavy metal to be removed the bacterial strains used and the removal efficiency of in situ remediation methods is compiled in table 8 4 challenges to meet selection of most suitable bacterial strain according to its remediation potential and process relied is instrumental for the design development and implementation of bioremediation techniques 150 151 genetic engineering has enhanced the efficiency of the technology but treatment of huge volumes of wastewater is still a challenge though genetic engineering efforts have been practiced for over two decades its industrial translation faces several impediments 152 the genetic stability of recombined species is always in speculation and the incorporation of unnatural amino acids in designed proteins seldom confer unexpected functions turning the venture risky in distant future 153 the competency of genetically modified bacteria to thrive in real wastewater effluents and to remediate metals like that of native wild species is yet to be demonstrated the capacity of genetically modified species to resist competitive exclusion has to be revealed substantial bacterial load of treated water is another challenge to be addressed thus inception to abate the same is a perpetual need to scale up the technology to successfully meet the technoeconomic environmental risks and assessments these are the unexplored avenues of research to advance and promote bacterial based heavy metal remediation techniques bioprocess level development is recommended protocooperation of bacteria with algae has demonstrated better heavy metal remediation in waste water 154 and more reliable research is essential in this sphere research could be routed towards metal recovery as major destination with remediation as the direction to attain the same a strong understanding of the mechanism inevitably aids to modulate the research in right path implementing faster operation procedure and metagenomic manipulation of bacterial remediation process would facilitate to achieve more recognition and popularity to these eco friendly techniques 5 future prospects despite several proven research works bacterial heavy metal remediation technique is mostly confined to laboratory the major challenge and pitfall of this technology is the lack of large scale production and commercialization development of integrated technologies is imperative to scale up the efficiency and meet the sustainable development goals progressive and exploratory research in this regard is essential with in depth investigations on molecular level remediating mechanisms modelling of site specific and adaptive bacterial strains with regeneration capacity more research works are to be directed towards customising bacterial remediation for bulk quantities of water with faster rate of action by suitably manipulating the inherent capacity of bacterial strains to remediate heavy metals economic feasibility of the bacterial based bioremediation techniques has to be addressed in future research the multiple benefits of bacterial aided heavy metal remediation have to be popularized at the same time bacterial kits are to be commercialized as better availability will obviously promote the prevalence of usage 6 conclusions bacterium is one of the most versatile microbes with immense bioremediation potential that has to be widely explored and implemented bacteria rely on any one of the aforementioned mechanisms or a combination of different mechanisms based on the heavy metals present prevailing physiochemical factors and the strains involved bioremediation of heavy metals by bacteria is an eco friendly economically feasible and sustainable process and could also act as a treatment process that enhances the efficacy of industrial wastewater treatment selection and utilization of proper bacterial strains that exhibit tolerance to heavy metals with exceptional remediation properties and adaption skills to the environment are critical for successful bioremediation research should be further channelled to increase the remediation rate thus to decrease the treatment time concurrently achieving high efficiency technical interventions are necessary to elevate the bacterial remediation platform with engineering support the threats of biofouling and competitive exclusion by the nascent bacteria and microbes in the effluents are to be resolved procedures to recover metals from bacteria has to be standardised simplified and effectuated as non destructive for the possible reuse of cells bacterial strains or consortiums proficient to remediate each metal and its different ions are to be well differentiated at the same time strains that could act in multi metal environment have to be recognized and commercialized scientific outputs have to be channelled to industrial sector and have to be publicized as this technology has proven potential to decontaminate polluted natural water bodies expansion and implementation of both ex situ and in situ techniques is imperative in different sectors at the same time research has to be undertaken to establish its potential in more arenas declaration of

12912,heavy metals a treasure of nature turns to be toxic at high concentrations in water among several methods adopted to alleviate heavy metal pollution bioremediation is considered to be a sustainable cost effective technology bioremediation largely relies on bacteria apart from other microbes and plants the inherent and adaptive mechanisms evolved in bacteria to defend the metal

hydride keywords bacterial remediation bioadsorption bioaccumulation bioprecipitation bioleaching 1 introduction heavy metals are elements with specific density of more than 5 g cm 3 1 and some of which are quintessential at low concentrations for the normal physiological functions of living organisms 2 specific amounts of calcium ca sodium na magnesium mg potassium k copper cu iron fe zinc zn and chromium cr are required for the survival of organisms while their high concentrations cause toxicity 3 several metals like cadmium cd mercury hg nickel ni arsenic as and lead pb are toxic at any quantity causing deleterious effect on the wellbeing and survival of living organisms 4 and it causes ecological nutritional genetic and evolutionary impacts heavy metals reach the environment by natural and anthropogenic activities 5 as the heavy metals are non degrading and bio accumulating with well delineated toxic effects government agencies has imposed rules and legislations to limit the use and discharge of toxic metals to environment world health organization 6 has defined the permissible heavy metal concentration in safe drinking water whereas food and agriculture organization has stipulated the maximum permissible limit of toxic heavy metals in irrigation water 7 to comply with the regulations and standards many strategies and techniques have been investigated and implemented to alleviate heavy metals from water the generally employed techniques are coagulation ion exchange membrane filtration chemical precipitation adsorption electrochemical treatment flocculation and bioremediation 8 bioremediation is gaining tremendous attention since a few decades due to its less or no requirement of chemicals cost effectiveness absence of solid sludge by products and eco friendly operating techniques 9 bioremediation can be defined as the process that utilizes and depends on biological mechanisms to transform degrade detoxify pollutants to innoxious state and ultimately mineralize to carbon dioxide nitrogen and water etc using live or dead biomass 10 plants fungi bacteria algae and cyanobacteria are widely researched and employed for heavy metal bioremediation microorganisms are most suitable for the purpose as they are easier to handle culture and implement in recent years microorganisms especially bacteria reckoned recognition with their ability to adsorb solubilize and precipitate heavy metals by bioadsorption biosorption bioaccumulation bioleaching and bioprecipitation omni presence abundance diversity small size and unique capacity to grow and propagate under controlled and uncontrolled conditions with environmental resilience make bacteria the best candidate for bioremediation 11 bacterial bioremediation of heavy metals in solution mostly occur by means of adsorption on bacterial cell surface it is the first line defence of bacteria to resist metal toxicity wherein negatively charged carboxyl amino phosphoryl and sulfo groups on bacterial cell wall acts as potential ion exchange sites and metal sinks thus adsorption occurs on cell wall by redox process ion exchange complexation electrostatic attraction and precipitation bioadsorption or biosorption is an inactive process where heavy metals are adsorbed on to the cell surface devoid of energy expenditure metabolism independent until equilibrium is achieved while bioaccumulation is predominantly metabolism dependent or active uptake of heavy metals by living biomass cells 10 bacteria bind heavy metal ions by means of exopolymers polysaccharides to their cell surface further circumscribe or internalise these metal species into the cell for various metabolic functions besides chelate the metals by producing several metabolic ligands 12 bioleaching is the bio recovery of metals by releasing excreting ligands like organic acids cyanide thiosulphate and phenol derivatives these ligands interact react with metals in its vicinity bind and form mostly soluble complexes directly or indirectly bioprecipitation of metals is a metal sequestering process exhibited by metabolically active cells where metabolites produced react with metals present in water and form metal precipitates microorganisms particularly anaerobic bacteria convert the metals present or dissolved in aqueous solution into solid precipitates via sulphate carbonate phosphate or hydroxide precipitation 13 1 1 significance of the study to explore and understand the underlying mechanisms by which bacteria remediate heavy metals is vital for the development of feasible technologies and treatment strategies using bacteria for heavy metal removal from polluted environments better knowledge on cellular process leading to hazardous heavy metal removal is

like constructed wetlands 14 particularly floating treatment wetland and combined ecological floating beds the efficiency of the process is inevitably related to the microbial community attached to the floating mats and rhizomes expand the knowledge spheres to omics genomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics and suitably manipulate the process by gene editing and engineering for enhanced expression of heavy metal transporter proteins sequestering proteins and enzymes of relevant metabolic pathways 15 capacitate fruitful interventions in microbial nanotechnology especially bacterial synthesis of metal nanoparticles 16 therefore the present review delineates the remediation mechanisms and its underneath cellular processes exhibited by bacteria that aid in the removal of heavy metals in aqueous media relevant reports of previous researchers are discussed additionally very recent research findings are briefly summarised and tabulated diagrammatic representations are provided to support the descriptions the keywords used for data retrieval from scientific sources scopus web of science pubmed were bioremediation of heavy metals using bacteria biosorption bioadsorption bioaccumulation bioprecipitation and bioleaching the publications that deal with heavy metal remediation from aqueous medium using bacteria were included for the study other microbial fungi algae and nanomaterials remediation procedures were excluded even bacterial remediation in solid substrates like soil was also not considered publications from the year 2000 to 2022 were scrutinized and the bacterial remediation mechanism elucidated in each research paper were probed and discerned as most of the literature available were confined to bioadsorption and bioaccumulation and both seldom differentiated emphasis was given to discrete and delineate each mechanism precisely the papers published from 2018 to 2022 on bioremediation of heavy metals from water with specified bacterial strains and mechanism were compiled and tabulated the practical applications of bacteria mediated heavy metal bioremediation is provided mentioning the bacterial species involved and its removal efficiency 2 mechanism of bioremediation several bacterial strains have evolved diverse discrete mechanisms to adapt interact acclimate and thrive in environment rich in minerals especially heavy metals these include uptake of heavy metals on to the cell surface by biosorption intracellular sequestration by accumulation extracellular sequestration as insoluble compounds by precipitation and production of metabolites that solubilize and chelate metal compounds that leads to leaching the different mechanisms and its several modes exhibited by bacteria to remove and annihilate heavy metals is depicted in fig 1 and discussed in following section 2 1 bioadsorption biosorption biosorption bio adsorption is the non directed active or passive physiochemical interaction between inorganic and organic metal minerals with cellular substances 17 18 the major processes involved in biosorption mechanism are surface adsorption physisorption chemisorption ion exchange and surface complexation surface adsorption involves electrical attraction between negatively charged ligands present on cell wall and the positively charged metal ions in medium and is often an exchange reaction 19 physical adsorption majorly comprises van der waals forces whereas in chemical or activated adsorption attraction occurs between the adsorbent and adsorbate an assemblage of all these mechanisms either functioning together or independently leads to the overall metal adsorption on microbial cell surface 20 heavy metal binding possibly a two stage task comprises interaction between reactive groups on bacterial cell surface and the metal ions followed by deposition of metal 19 spectroscopic and chemical modification studies have depicted that the cellular radicals like hydroxyl carboxyl sulfate sulfhydryl thiol thioether phosphate phosphonate phosphodiester amino imine amide imidazole and carbonyl ketone possess high metal binding potential 21 table 1 elucidates the chemical structure occurrence and position of these active radicals in bacterial cell structure most of these groups are present on bacterial cell wall ionization of these functional groups turns the bacterial cell surface negatively charged viable for cationic metal attachment 20 cell walls of bacteria are primarily formed of peptidoglycans which constitute linear chains of sugar the disaccharide n acetylglucosamine β1 4 n acetylmuramic acid interconnected with peptide chains the peptide chains are tetramers composed of l alanine d glutamic acid d amino pimelic acid or l lysine and another l alanine apart from that a glycopolymer teichoic acid is embedded in gram positive bacterial cell walls increasing its gross negative charge cell walls of gram negative bacteria are not profusely cross linked and composed of thinner peptidoglycan layer than gram positive bacteria gram negative bacteria harness an outer membrane formed of lipopolysaccharides lps lipoproteins and phospholipids gram positive bacterial cell wall contains glycoproteins on its outer side dispensing more accessible binding sites than lps and phospholipids 19 2 1 1 physical adsorption physisorption it is the phenomenon of transferring ions from one phase to another namely liquid phase to solid phase involving i bulk transfer to peripheral layer ii inward diffusion or massive transmission through pores and or random motion of atoms by solid diffusion and iii adhesion or adsorption to the exterior surface of bacterial cells physical adsorption is due to non specific rapid and reversible attraction forces like van der waals forces or it occurs by electrostatic adsorption on account of coulombic attractive forces arising between charged solute particles and bacterial cell surface 18 ahalya et al 22 reported that copper biosorption on zoogloea ramigera bacterium occurred through electrostatic interaction physicochemical interactions between the cellular radicals on the bacterial cell wall and membrane and the metal species in solute are the prime factors responsible for rapid and reversible metabolism independent biosorption in dead cell biomasses ftir studies by hasan et al 23 elucidated that amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups existing on the cell surface dead dried biomass of aeromonas hydrophila was the fundamental cause of pb ii sorption besides the passage through pores anionic groups c o coo nh oh and c o present on dead streptomyces rimosus bacterial cell walls exhibited fairly high adsorption towards pb2 ions 24 2 1 2 ion exchange in ion exchange mechanism metal cations bind to a vacant site previously occupied by another cation divalent ions of metals are adsorbed by exchange with polysaccharide counter ions present on the cell wall and outer membrane of bacteria 25 this process relies on several factors like the different kinds and number of sites present on the cell surface and their ionization pattern which is eventually determined by the ph and pka value of respective groups protonated amine groups are positive in charge and turns neutral while deprotonated addition of protons convert phosphate carboxyl and sulfate groups into neutral and in deprotonated condition turns negatively charged 26 nickel biosorption by ion exchange was reported in pseudomonas fluorescens 4f39 27 pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and micrococcus luteus adsorbed significant quantities of lead and copper which further increased with ph from 2 to 6 28 hasan et al 23 has inferred that pb ii ions compete with h at low ph and get adsorbed to aeromonas hydrophila by ion exchange 2 1 3 complexation remediation of metals could also occur by formation of complexes over cell periphery by the interaction of reactive radicals on cell wall and metal ions in solution amino carboxyl hydroxy thiol phosphate and hydroxyl carboxyl groups interact in coordination with heavy metal ions 29 complex or co ordination compound is a poly atomic molecule with neutral or negative or positive charge and it consists of single or numerous central atoms generally metal cations bounded and joined to ligands other negative or neutrally charged atoms or groups if a ligand is connected through two or more coordinating atoms to central atom then the complex is termed as chelate 26 magnesium calcium cadmium copper zinc and mercury complexation were found to occur in pseudomonas syringae complexation is the major biosorption process involved during alkaline ph mercury and uranium complexation has been reported at ph above 7 in pseudomonas fluorescens 4f39 by lópez et al 28 hydroxyl phosphoryl carboxyl and amino groups of proteins and polysaccharides on the extracellular matrix of shewanella putrefaciens was found to complex with cr vi 30 recent research outcomes on bacterial biosorption of heavy metals are tabulated table 2 environmental factors like temperature ph and composition of wastewater concentration and oxidation state of heavy metals organic and inorganic entities present colloids and emulsions may influence biosorption along with the type of bacterial strain and mechanism of metal removal use of dead cells is more propounded as dead biomass is hardly susceptible to heavy metal toxicity and nutrients are not required for the growth of bacterial cells 19 31 lowering operational cost the biomass waste from fermentation industries could be used for the purpose metal loading on biomass is very rapid as the non living biomass is an efficient ion exchanger sterilization is not mandatory with storage options and pretreatment of bacterial biomass may further improve the biosorptive capacity moreover operating conditions like ph temperature time etc could be controlled with possibility for metal recovery however the improvement of biosorption potential by genetic engineering or biological altering of metal valency state is limited in dead biomass 19 bioadsorption is a simple and fast process that could utilize alive or dead bacterial cells or exopolymers alone to retrieve heavy metals from aqueous solution though physical and chemical parameters of media and oxidation state of metal ions determine the efficiency of the process metals are adsorbed within few hours rather resorption is easy and biomass could be reused this is the most common heavy metal defence mechanism exhibited by mesophilic bacterial strains 2 2 bioaccumulation bioaccumulation is the influx and accretion of metals within bacterial cells by the uptake of non metabolic metals through the same carrier pathway involved for metabolically essential metals the mechanism constitutes binding of metal ions to the reactive radicals at the outer surface of bacterial cell wall likewise and furthermore to its internal region through energy independent mechanism subsequently metals diffuse into the cell cytoplasm by means of energy dependent independent process the pathway for the transport of metabolically pivotal ions like sodium na potassium k magnesium etc would be relied for the transport of heavy metals through microbial cell membranes for intracellular accumulation the cation transport systems will bind with heavy metal ions of identical ionic radius and charge as of essential metal ions 29 2 2 1 intracellular transport heavy metals are imported to the bacterial cell by means of channels secondary carrier proteins and primary active transporters present on bacterial cell membrane channels are α helical proteins that serve for the passive diffusion of heavy metals across the membrane according to concentration gradient these channel proteins belong to major intrinsic proteins super family and are found to transport arsenic and mercury in a series of bacterial species like e coli cornebacterium streptomyces coelicolor serratia and pseudomonas 44 β barrel proteins and porins present in gram negative bacteria have also been found to translocate heavy metals uniporters symporters and antiporters are the secondary carrier proteins involved in heavy metal accumulation transporter opsin g protein coupled receptor super family and major facilitator super family proteins form the chief carrier proteins behind this function these proteins rely on proton motive force for metal shifts into the bacterial cell likewise uptake of ni co and as has been reported in helicobacter pylori 45 rhodopseudomonas palustris 46 novosphingobium aromaticivorans and staphylococcus aurens 47 primary active transporter proteins are multi domain tertiary proteins embedded in the plasma membrane of bacterial cells which comprises a transmembrane portion and cytosolic atpase coupling component periplasmic solute binding domain is also sometimes present p type atpase proteins and abc transporter proteins are the major protein super families that constitute primary active transporters 44 these transporters transit heavy metals against concentration gradient using energy derived from the hydrolysis of atp or gtp reserves in cell lactobacillus plantarum 48 thlaspi caerulescens 49 and enterobacter hirae 50 bioaccumulated cd into the cell through primary transporters apart from the membrane carrier proteins interaction of metals with bacterial surface ligands subsequently leads to its slow transport into the cell bacteria including cyanobacteria release high affinity low molecular weight 200 2000 da coordination molecules termed as siderophores that bind iron atoms the synthesis of siderophores in bacteria is a stimulatory response towards iron scarcity in environment in addition to iron radicals siderophores are able to join and bind with other metals also e g thorium th uranium u ni gallium ga and cu 51 bacterial siderophores constitute catecholates e g enterobactin carboxylates e g rhizobactin and hydroxamates e g ferrioxamine b 52 bacteria use different siderophore mediated iron fe transport systems and it varies in gram positive and negative bacteria gram negative bacteria like escherichia strains possess outer membrane tonb dependent receptors which recognize fe iii siderophore complexes accessible at the cell surface and bind them thenceforth fe iii siderophore bound to the tonb dependent outer membrane receptors crosses the outer membrane to periplasmic space via high affinity periplasmic binding protein which accompanies the fe iii siderophore complex up to cytoplasmic membrane and is relieved back to periplasmic space to resume its carrier function fe iii siderophore complexes are shuttled across the cytoplasmic membrane to cytoplasm by atp binding cassette abc transport system finally fe iii is dissociated from the siderophore complex via reduction of fe iii to fe ii subsequently siderophores are either degraded or recycled through a shuttle mechanism using specific efflux pump 53 fig 2 whereas in gram positive bacteria like bacillus no outer membrane receptors are present due to the lack of outer membrane therefore the fe iii siderophore complexes directly attach to the periplasmic siderophore binding proteins embedded on cytoplasmic membrane after which the fe iii siderophore complexes are transported to the cytoplasm as like in gram negative bacteria by the atp dependent abc transport system 54 2 2 2 intracellular fate of bioaccumulated heavy metals growing bacterial cells are capable of eliminating metals perpetually by internal detoxification methods biotransformation and reduction of metals using enzymes methylation sequestration by metal organic complexion and production of metal chelators metallothioneins are the different mechanisms exhibited by bacteria to defend metal toxicity 55 2 2 2 1 intracellular sequestration intracellular sequestration is the process of formation of composites of metal ions with various cellular cytoplasmic compounds upon entry to the cells heavy metal ions are translocated attached or imbedded in cellular organelles depending on the element concerned and the bacterial strain chelation is the process of binding of metals to ligands or compounds cytoplasmic metal chelation is mostly aided by metallothineins peptides rich in cysteine γ glutamylcysteine a glutathione analogue present in haloarchaea and by polyphosphate the chelating molecule produced in most halophilic bacteria and archaea species iron storage protein ferritin copper and zinc storing metallothioneins are the common metal sequestering proteins found in bacterial cells 56 metal stress induces high expression of metallothionein genes and its overproduction in bacteria resulting in augmented metal binding and sequestration 57 this metal accumulation potential of specific bacterial strains has been manipulated mainly for effluent treatment rhizobium leguminosarum with the aid of glutathione manifested considerable quantity of intracellular cadmium ion sequestration 58 jroundi et al 59 reported intracellular accumulation of lead in polyphosphate grains within the cells of bacillus species isolated from mediterranean sea cyanobacteria anabaena cylindrica and plectonema boryanum accumulated cadmium and aluminium in polyphosphate bodies 19 2 2 2 2 reduction of heavy metal ions bacteria make use of metals and metalloids as electron donors or acceptors for energy generation bacterial cells can transform the oxidation state of metal ions thus reducing its toxicity oxidized metals act as terminal electron acceptors in bacteria during anaerobic respiration many anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial species use oxidized metallic elements like fe iii mn iv or cr vi as terminal electron acceptors 60 reduction of selenium and arsenic coupled to organic substrates lactic acid acetic acid and aromatics is observed in certain bacterial species oxyanions of selenium and arsenic are also used as terminal electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration by bacterial strains that provide energy for metabolism and growth 61 enzymatic reduction results in the generation of less toxic forms of mercury and chromium mercury detoxification is accomplished in bacterial strains by organomercurial lyase merb and mercuric reductase mera enzymes enzymatic chromate reduction that involves copper dependent reductase was observed in haloalkaliphilic amphibacillus sp 62 membrane associated nadh dependent chromate reductases catalysed chromate reduction is prevalent in halophilic halomonas strains 63 nadh dependent nitrate reductase catalyses ionic silver ag reduction to inactive metallic colloidal silver nanoparticles in bacillus licheniformis 64 arsenate reduction in prokaryotes is carried out by soluble arsenate reductases arsc 65 several bacterial strains of bacillus pseudomonas putida and pedomicrobium reduces manganese mn iii and iv to mn ii and further oxidize it to be used as terminal electron acceptor in electron transport chain 66 2 2 2 3 methylation of metals certain bacterial strains are proficient in methylating various metal metalloid and organometallic compounds to methyl derivatives which is often volatile and evaporates 19 methylation is one of the fundamental biochemical pathways of bacterial cell intracellular metal and metalloid methylation occur by any of the three pathways namely involving s adenosylmethionine methylcobalamin and n methyltetrahydrofolate sulphate or iron reducing bacteria utilize methylcobalamin to methylate mercury hg whereas methylation of arsenic as occurs via s adenosylmethionine 67 metal compounds when methylated turns to be explosive mostly for instance escherichia sp bacillus sp pseudomonas sp and clostridium sp biomethylate hg ii to gaseous methyl mercury bio methylation of as to gaseous arsines selenium se to volatile dimethyl selenide and lead pb to decomposable dimethyl lead has been observed in solutions stagnant on polluted top soil containing bacteria 55 each methylation pathway is distinct and the pathways involved vary among bacterial species and oxidation state of metals in aqueous solution 67 schematic representation of intracellular transport of heavy metals and its cellular accumulation process is depicted in fig 3 table 3 outlines the recent research findings on heavy metal accumulation by bacterial species bioaccumulation is a toxicokinetic process influenced by the sensitivity of living cells to heavy metals it depends on the type of bacteria concentration and metals involved and could be inhibited by metabolic inhibitors like low temperatures and nutrient deficiency moreover metal ion uptake is dependent on cell age ph of metal solution and composition of media initial metal concentration contact time and finally the concentration of bacterial cells in aqueous solution kinetics of bioaccumulation of metal ions is biphasic with an initial rapid phase rendering 90 of metal uptake which last for about 10 to 30 min and a gradual second phase of approximately 4 h 68 bioaccumulation is a heavy metal bioextration process with numerous application prospects the essential metal ions are accumulated rapidly than the non essential ones and this process could only be realized with live bacterial cells genetic engineering works are more focused in this aspect of bacterial process by redesigning the transporter proteins for enhanced passage of preferred metals proteomics and its manipulation of metal sequestering proteins are also underway evolving research could brighten up the possibilities of bacterial bioaccumulation in heavy metal extraction and recovery 2 3 bioprecipitation removal of metals from solution by means of precipitation is often coupled with the defence mechanism of bacteria cellular metabolism independent precipitation is due to the chemical interaction of bacterial cell surface and metal ions 22 precipitation occurs by reduction sulfide formation and as phosphates depending on the bacterial species and environment 2 3 1 reduction reduction process occurs in bacterial species as mentioned earlier numerous bacterial strains catalyse the reduction of hazardous selenite se iv and selenate se vi ionic forms to elemental selenium which gets deposited as red precipitate over bacterial colonies biofilm of desulfomicrobium norvegicum was shown to precipitate elemental selenium with sulfur 72 a strain of alteromonas shewanella putrefaciens that normally reduce mn iv and fe iii was also found to reduce u vi producing black precipitate of u iv carbonate 73 shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and two geobacter species reduced hg ii to hg 0 in the presence of electron acceptors 74 the bacterial species involved in uranium reduction and the mechanisms involved has been thoroughly reviewed by you et al 75 2 3 2 metal precipitation as sulphides sulphate reducing bacteria are heterotrophic obligate anaerobes which oxidizes organic compounds or hydrogen for energy metabolism using sulphate as terminal electron acceptor it reduces sulphate to sulfide which further combines with available metals in the cell and environment leading to the formation of metal sulphides fig 4 metal sulphides except alkali and alkaline earth metals are insoluble and the resultant precipitation of sulphides protect sulphate reducing bacteria from metal toxicity and metals protect the organisms from sulfide toxicity vice versa 19 sulphate reducing bacteria also generate an extremely reducing condition which could bio chemically reduce metals like u vi and cr vi 76 enzymatic sulfide formation with the aid of thiosulfate reductase has been reported in salmonella typhimurium when thiosulfate reductase gene phsabc of s typhimurium cloned and highly expressed in e coli metal sulfide precipitation happened due to sulfide production from inorganic thiosulfate compounds 77 klebsiella planticola cd resistant strains cultured in thiosulfate supplemented media precipitated substantial quantities of cadmium sulfide cds 78 2 3 3 metal precipitation as phosphates in this precipitation method the enzyme phosphatase liberates inorganic phosphate pi from cellular organic phosphate like glycerol 2 phosphate and pi in turn precipitates metals radionuclides as phosphates on the cell fig 4 immobilized cells of citrobacter sp precipitated cu cd pb and u from glycerol 2 phosphate enriched solutions here phosphatase catalysed glycerol 2 phosphate cleavage released hydrogen phosphates which precipitated metals extracellularly as insoluble metal phosphates 17 a mixture of hydrated zirconia zro2 and zr hpo4 2 was obtained upon mineralization of zirconium by citrobacter sp 19 precipitation can be either metabolically dependent or independent in metabolically active precipitation reaction between the molecular compound s produced by the bacterial defence system and target metal s in medium results in crystallisation of metals on the other hand metabolism independent precipitation is due to chemical interaction between the dissolved heavy metal ions and the reactive radicals on bacterial cell surface fig 4 metal crystallisation occurs in media wastewater effluent and on the peripheral region of bacterial cells during bioprecipitation and is dependent on cell metabolism and metal concentration 22 recent reports on bioprecipitation of heavy metals by bacteria is comprehensively presented in table 4 alive and dead bacterial cells do exhibit heavy metal precipitation but dead biomass is less efficient in the process as only passive interaction of bacterial surface ions and the metal ions in medium is the sole cause of precipitation in latter the metal recovery is comparatively easy in case of precipitated metals and is suitable to treat mine effluents and electroplating industry sewage 2 4 bioleaching bioleaching is the solubilization of metals from its natural parent materials such as ore substrates or its crystals suspended or present in contact with the bacterial medium it occurs directly as a part of bacterial metabolism or indirectly by bacterial metabolic by products bioleaching is more often a bio hydrometallurgical method used to recover metals like gold copper zinc arsenic antimony cobalt uranium bismuth nickel molybdenum lead and vanadium mostly chemolithotrophic mesophilic bacteria which require metabolic energy sources like ferrous sulphate pyrite and sulfur are involved in metal leaching predominantly iron oxidizing acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and sulfur oxidizing bacteria acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are used in bioleaching besides acidophilium nirospira leptospirilum ferrooxidans ferroplasma sulfur oxidizing bacteria acidithiobacillus albertis and acidithiobacillus caldus are also used in mine sludge bioleaching thermophilic bacteria sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans are used for faster bioleaching rate at higher temperatures several heterotrophic bacterial species like acidophilum arthrobactor acetobacter trichoderma and pseudomonas are capable of producing organic acids like citric acid malic acid and oxalic acid these acid moieties when released to the medium join with metals by supplying both protons and metal complexing anions thus leading to metal leaching 91 2 4 1 sulfide bioleaching direct and indirect mechanisms are involved in sulfur based leaching process by bacteria leading to the formation of metal sulfides and its dissolution fig 4 in direct leaching process bacteria directly contact and react with metal sulfide and oxidize it to soluble metal sulfates like nis zns cus etc on the contrary in indirect bacterial leaching the sulfur oxidizing bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur compounds and elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid thus reducing the ph of the persisting medium consequently augmenting the solubility of metals in solution 91 sulfate reducing bacteria sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans sulfolobus sp s acidophilus thiobacillus denitrificans and t thioparus were successfully applied in the remediation of mine seepage water 92 successful removal of fe cu zn as and ni sulphates from mine drainage using desulfovibrio desulfuricans and desulfomicrobium baculatum strains has been reported by sahinkaya et al 93 2 4 2 pyrite leaching in iron based bioleaching mechanism reduced sulfur and iron compounds are oxidized through direct or indirect process non iron metal sulphides are oxidized directly by iron oxidizing bacteria like acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans into soluble metal sulfate fig 4 in direct leaching bacterial cells adhere selectively to the surface structure of minerals by chemotactic behavior on the other hand in indirect pathway the bacteria oxidize fe2 to fe3 and the fe3 in turn react with metals and leaches through chemical reaction the bacterial cells are not in need of direct contact with minerals during this process the production of sulfuric acid as a by product of this mechanism further enhances the solubilization process 91 gallionella ferruginea has been reported to oxidize iron in mine water drainage 94 bacteria such as acidithiobacillus thiooxidans at ferrooxidans at cryptum acidiphilium caldus acidianus brierleyi ochrobactrum anthropic citrobacter cronobacter clostridium ferroplasma acidiphilum ferribacterium limneticum leptospirillum ferrooxidans l ferriphilum have demonstrated excellent ability in leaching metals from their corresponding ore waste exudates 95 latorre et al 96 has found that l ferriphilum and at thiooxidans leach ores of copper sulfide and metals like copper and arsenic with better efficiency by oxidizing iron and thereby reducing inorganic sulfur compounds 2 4 3 heterotrophic bacterial leaching heterotrophic bacteria namely pseudomonas sp have the potential to produce acidic metabolites that are capable to extract and solubilize metals from non sulfidic minerals present in sewage sludge via acidolysis the formation of organic or inorganic acids complexation excretion of complexing agents and reduction oxidation and reduction reactions currently heterotrophic bioleaching is mostly applied in metal recovery of gold silver titanium aluminium nickel copper manganese chromium and uranium from sewage 97 heterotrophic bacteria release organic acids like lactic acid citric acid oxalic acid gluconic acid and phenolic derivatives that have at least two hydrophilic reactive groups capable of dissolving heavy metals by displacing metal ions with hydrogen ions this process is supplemented by the production of soluble metal chelates and complexes fig 4 role and interactions of heterotrophic bacterial strains of staphylococcus rhodococcus pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and cupriavidus metallidurans with autotrophic bacteria during bioleaching of copper has been delineated by jeremic et al 98 heterotrophic bacteria bacillus ns 1 has been found to increase metal leaching efficiency in electroplating sewage treatment 99 the solubilised metals could be recovered or removed from solution by using ligands electro winning biosorption or solvent extraction different factors like temperature ph contact time composition of medium tolerance towards the metal biomass concentration types and quantity of metabolites produced and released by bacterial strains into the medium affect the bacterial leaching mechanism 100 recent research reports on heavy metals leached by bacterial species are tabulated table 5 bioleaching is a bio extraction technique to retract metals from its ores the metals could be biologically dissolved and abstracted though the process is gradual it is eco friendly sustainable technique with potential to retrieve precious metals bacteria has turned to be a potent bioremediating agent of heavy metal contaminants from effluents bacterial biosorption accumulation precipitation and leaching of heavy metals are inexpensive methods to remediate or stabilize heavy metal pollutants from contaminated water the boon and bane of each mechanism is enlisted in table 6 the whole process of bioremediation mechanisms is collectively represented in fig 4 appropriate understanding of cellular mechanism is essential for the accurate selection of strains for urban and industrial wastewater treatment which is the most challenging task of degradation and retrieval of heavy metals from e waste processing by product exudates bacterial heavy metal remediation mechanisms are easy to understand when it refers to a single metal through single pathway or process but it becomes complicated in the presence of multiple ions generally encountered in effluents standardization of physicochemical parameters that imparts maximum remediation is highly essential for better results furthermore molecular level studies are required to discover the exact and apparent cellular mechanisms exhibited by bacteria to eliminate toxic heavy metals at different conditions and environments researchers are exploring novel bacterial species with great heavy metal removal potential and subsequent genetic engineering works are also in progress at the same time various bioremediation strategies and protocols has been designed and devised relying on the inimitable decontamination prospects of bacteria these techniques have proved application potential in almost all industrial sectors like tannery textile electroplating printing and municipal sewage where wastewater treatment is pivotal 3 applications of bacterial bioremediation in wastewater treatment several bacterial based processes have been developed implemented and practised for heavy metal remediation in wastewater treatment which includes both ex situ and in situ approaches the ex situ techniques crafted and materialized are microbial bioreactors microbial fuel cell or microbial electrolysis cell and microbial desalination units table 7 while constructed floating wetlands and bioaugmentation are the in situ bacterial based heavy metal remediation systems table 8 research have evolved from proof of concept study to pilot and full scale approaches and these remediation protocols and practises have recognized immense application in domestic sewage landfill leachate industrial effluent treatment and polluted natural water resource lakes ground water reservoir etc decontamination bioreactors are specially engineered devices that provide optimum conditions to foster the growth and biochemical activity of specific bacterial species for desired remediation purpose polluted water samples are fed to the reactor for the removal and retrieval of contaminants the reactor design and bacterial strain selection depends on the purpose and polluted source which can be slurry phase packed bed fluidised partitioned suspended carrier airlift up flow anaerobic stage reactor continuous flow sequence batch stirred tank biofilter based and membrane bioreactors 111 113 this can be installed at industrial and open leachate sites and its operational procedures and treatment duration varies with the input wastewater parameters and the desired product quality 111 microbial fuel cells employ microbes especially bacteria to generate electrons from metabolic reactions these electrons generated are used for the concomitant reduction oxidation of heavy metal contaminants thereby its precipitation at anode chamber and or for electron transport to cathode the electrons reaching cathode combines with the available oxygen and protons are released and transferred back a continuous flow of these entities produce energy that could be used for varied purposes 128 microbial desalination cell is the integrated process of electrodialysis using microbial fuel cell for the effective treatment of wastewater with simultaneous desalination electricity generation and metal recovery mixed or pure culture of exoelectrogenic bacteria is used for this procedure shewanella putrefaciens proteobacteria actinobacteria pseudomonas bacillus subtilis are the major bacterial strains used in microbial desalination cells 132 ship spillage was found to be effectively treated using this technique the ex situ bacterial bioremediation techniques and its heavy metal removal efficiency are tabulated in table 7 constructed wetland or floating treatment wetland is a novel phyto microbial technique for the treatment of water bodies to mitigate pollution these artificial wetlands consist of floating mat over which vegetative plants are grown and its roots hang in the water column bacterial biofilms are attached to these hanging roots and desired endophytic bacteria are also inoculated to the plants 134 135 these bacterial colonies aid heavy metal adsorption and water decontamination this procedure is implemented in several regions and sites and fruitful results were achieved bioaugmentation in wastewater decontamination is the addition of selective bacteria single strain or consortia to the polluted water bodies this is done according to the prevailing physiochemical conditions of polluted source and the heavy metal to be removed the bacterial strains used and the removal efficiency of in situ remediation methods is compiled in table 8 4 challenges to meet selection of most suitable bacterial strain according to its remediation potential and process relied is instrumental for the design development and implementation of bioremediation techniques 150 151 genetic engineering has enhanced the efficiency of the technology but treatment of huge volumes of wastewater is still a challenge though genetic engineering efforts have been practiced for over two decades its industrial translation faces several impediments 152 the genetic stability of recombined species is always in speculation and the incorporation of unnatural amino acids in designed proteins seldom confer unexpected functions turning the venture risky in distant future 153 the competency of genetically modified bacteria to thrive in real wastewater effluents and to remediate metals like that of native wild species is yet to be demonstrated the capacity of genetically modified species to resist competitive exclusion has to be revealed substantial bacterial load of treated water is another challenge to be addressed thus inception to abate the same is a perpetual need to scale up the technology to successfully meet the technoeconomic environmental risks and assessments these are the unexplored avenues of research to advance and promote bacterial based heavy metal remediation techniques bioprocess level development is recommended protocooperation of bacteria with algae has demonstrated better heavy metal remediation in waste water 154 and more reliable research is essential in this sphere research could be routed towards metal recovery as major destination with remediation as the direction to attain the same a strong understanding of the mechanism inevitably aids to modulate the research in right path implementing faster operation procedure and metagenomic manipulation of bacterial remediation process would facilitate to achieve more recognition and popularity to these eco friendly techniques 5 future prospects despite several proven research works bacterial heavy metal remediation technique is mostly confined to laboratory the major challenge and pitfall of this technology is the lack of large scale production and commercialization development of integrated technologies is imperative to scale up the efficiency and meet the sustainable development goals progressive and exploratory research in this regard is essential with in depth investigations on molecular level remediating mechanisms modelling of site specific and adaptive bacterial strains with regeneration capacity more research works are to be directed towards customising bacterial remediation for bulk quantities of water with faster rate of action by suitably manipulating the inherent capacity of bacterial strains to remediate heavy metals economic feasibility of the bacterial based bioremediation techniques has to be addressed in future research the multiple benefits of bacterial aided heavy metal remediation have to be popularized at the same time bacterial kits are to be commercialized as better availability will obviously promote the prevalence of usage 6 conclusions bacterium is one of the most versatile microbes with immense bioremediation potential that has to be widely explored and implemented bacteria rely on any one of the aforementioned mechanisms or a combination of different mechanisms based on the heavy metals present prevailing physiochemical factors and the strains involved bioremediation of heavy metals by bacteria is an eco friendly economically feasible and sustainable process and could also act as a treatment process that enhances the efficacy of industrial wastewater treatment selection and utilization of proper bacterial strains that exhibit tolerance to heavy metals with exceptional remediation properties and adaption skills to the environment are critical for successful bioremediation research should be further channelled to increase the remediation rate thus to decrease the treatment time concurrently achieving high efficiency technical interventions are necessary to elevate the bacterial remediation platform with engineering support the threats of biofouling and competitive exclusion by the nascent bacteria and microbes in the effluents are to be resolved procedures to recover metals from bacteria has to be standardised simplified and effectuated as non destructive for the possible reuse of cells bacterial strains or consortiums proficient to remediate each metal and its different ions are to be well differentiated at the same time strains that could act in multi metal environment have to be recognized and commercialized scientific outputs have to be channelled to industrial sector and have to be publicized as this technology has proven potential to decontaminate polluted natural water bodies expansion and implementation of both ex situ and in situ techniques is imperative in different sectors at the same time research has to be undertaken to establish its potential in more arenas declaration of

12913,nitrogen is important for all living matter however extreme release of nitrogen into water bodies can lead to the acceleration of eutrophication in natural aquatic environments therefore removal of nitrogen is very important this article focuses on reviewing the different methods used for nitrogen removal from wastewater including physicochemical chemical bio electrochemical and biological techniques the review paper examines the differences among the removal methods in terms of duration and overall efficiencies the combination of different methods is recommended based on the advantages of each method for treating wastewater effectively and economically keywords wastewater treatment nitrogen removal ammonium nitrate 1 introduction nitrogen is crucial for all living matter as it is the main component in proteins nucleic acids and other nitrogenous substances of living creatures 1 however excessive discharge of organic and inorganic nitrogen can have harmful consequences on receiving water environments the most predominant forms of nitrogen in wastewaters are organic ammonium and nitrate nitrogen and they need to be properly treated to the minimum required concentrations due to the fact that they have a negative environmental impact 2 high release of these nitrogen containing wastes into waterways and lakes causes environmental problems such as eutrophication of amphibian biological systems depletion of oxygen in waterways environments killing off aquatic life and contamination of groundwater by nitrate and its impact on the general wellbeing of infants as free ammonia nitrogen can be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms due to the fact that ammonia deplete dissolved oxygen required by those living organisms 3 leaching of nitrate from the soil leads to groundwater contamination which when used as drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia also known as a blue baby syndrome which affects infants less than three months 4 in all forms nitrogen also causes eutrophication in waterways since it is a nutrient for aquatic plants eutrophication emerges from the excess supply of nutrients into the waterways which stimulates a large number of plants and algae growth after such aquatic plants die the bacterial decomposition of their biomass consumes the most oxygen in the water leading to hypoxia 5 an increase in water usage has increased the amount of nitrogen discharged into natural water bodies which causes serious environmental problems untreated wastewaters could deteriorate water quality stimulate eutrophication and alter the aquatic biodiversity in water resources 6 nitrogen removal from wastewaters is extremely important to protect water resources nitrogen can be present in many forms in wastewater due to the high number of oxidation states it can accept which makes the process of its removal from water complex and challenging 7 table 1 presents the nitrogenous compounds exist in different stages of wastewater treatment and their oxidation states several review articles have focused on various technologies for biological removal and recovery and energy cost 6 on microbiology characteristics and efficiency of either conventional process control strategies critical operation parameters and bioreactor design 8 12 biochemical removal 13 the present study provides a comprehensive review of the different nitrogen removal processes used for wastewater treatment including the factors affecting each process advantages and disadvantages of each method for treating wastewater effectively and economically over the past years several processes such as physicochemical chemical bio electrochemical and biological techniques have been applied in response to address complications caused by the discharge of high nitrogen wastewater into the environment 2 technologies review 2 1 biological nutrients removal bnr one of the notable procedures for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater is biological nutrient removal bnr nitrogen removal by autotrophic microorganisms would be preferable since it leaves the organic matter for methanogenic bacteria during wastewater treatment autotrophic denitrification 14 photoautotrophic systems 15 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox processes 16 17 are the autotrophic nitrogen removal approaches among them anammox process in wastewater systems has resulted in higher rates of nitrogen removal and lower energy requirements than those for conventional nitrogen removal 18 new biological nitrogen removal technologies based on the principle of anammox process have been developed partial nitrification anammox with a cost efficiency and environmentally friendly 19 the removal of nitrogen from wastewater using the bnr process consists also of nitrification and denitrification 20 21 the nitrification interaction comprises of two step autotrophic reactions by which ammonium is converted over to nitrite and afterward nitrite is oxidized further to nitrate within the sight of oxygen during first step oxidation of ammonia ammonium to nitrite is carried by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob such as nitrosomonas nitrosococcus and nitrosospira whereby the following reactions take place 1 2 nh 4 3 o 2 bacteria 2 no 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 2 nh 3 o 2 bacteria no 2 3 h 2 e these aob s utilize carbon dioxide or inorganic carbon as their carbon source for the synthesis of cellular material hypothetically roughly 30 molecules of ammonium ions or 100 molecules of nitrite ions must be oxidized for every single molecule of carbon dioxide adapted into cellular material by aob 18 in the subsequent advance oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is conveyed by nitrite oxidizing microorganisms nob in particular nitrobacter nitrospira and nitrococcus by which the accompanying reaction 3 takes place 3 no 2 h 2 o ba c teria no 3 2 h 2 e the development and procreation of the nitrifying microscopic organisms are influenced by several factors such as dissolved oxygen alkalinity and ph temperature inhibition toxicity and mode of operation for instance when the temperature increases the growth of the nitrifying bacteria also increases hence nitrification takes place easily when the temperature decreases nitrifying bacteria grow very slow and nitrification takes place at a lower rate consequently during cold temperatures an increase of nitrite ions may occur as nob oxidizes nitrite ions more slowly than aob oxidizes ammonium ions table 2 presents numerous genera of nitrifying bacteria responsible for the nitrification process 18 denitrification is the microbial course of diminishing nitrate no 3 to gaseous forms of nitrogen mostly nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen n2 22 the microorganisms accountable for the denitrification interaction are denitrifiers specifically thiobacillus micrococcus serratia pseudomonas and achromobacter during that process the following reaction takes place 4 2 no 3 10 e 12 h bacteria n 2 6 h 2 o the bnr process is considered to have numerous advantages regarding the removal of nitrogen from wastewater due to the fact that it utilizes naturally occurring microorganisms over costly chemicals that eventually appear in digested sludge and treatment plants effluents it additionally delivers less abundance sludge that requires slight handling and simple removal which has a lot of lower metal substance and can be applied to agrarian land 23 24 2 1 1 factors affecting the bnr process numerous factors are affecting the bnr process such as ph temperature sludge retention time srt carbon to nitrogen ratio c n hydraulic retention time hrt dissolved oxygen do and food to microorganism ratio f m sewage wastewater is normally alkaline due to the presence of potable water supply infiltration of groundwater and chemical compounds discharged to the sewer system however ph is lowered by the production of hydrogen ions h and nitrite ions no2 during nitrification according to reactions 1 3 25 nitrification starts at a ph of 5 0 begins to accelerate at a ph of 6 7 and the optimum ph range for nitrification is 7 2 to 8 0 26 gerardi 21 stated that above 10 c nitrification is almost directly proportional to temperature however below 10 c nitrification gradually decreases randall et al 27 studied nitrification kinetics in single sludge biological nutrient removal activated sludge system and found that maximum nitrification was achieved at 20 c with an srt of 2 7 days the study also showed that at a lower temperature of 10 c the effect of nitrification was lower than 65 shahzad et al 28 reported that the temperature increases of 1 c reduced srt needed for nitrification by 10 the denitrification process is highly dependent on c n in the biological the c n ratio must be high to denitrify all nitrate formed by the nitrification process 27 previous studies recommended a c n ratio of 3 4 for the microorganisms are to function at maximum efficiency 25 however komorowska kaufman et al 29 recommended a higher c n ratio of greater than 13 due to rapid initial cod removal by adsorption another important factor affecting the bnr process is do concentration nitrification starts to occur at a do concentration of less than 0 5 mg l however the optimum rate of nitrification can be accomplished by do concentration of 2 4 mg l and it should be maintained in the aeration basin to ensure the wastewater treatment facility complies with acceptable mixed liquor effluent concentrations for nh3 nh4 no2 and no3 18 yuan and gao 30 studied the impact of do on nitrogen removal and found that the decrease in do from 4 to 1 mg l the time to achieve nitrification was increased from 125 min to 240 min while the rate of nitrification reduced from 0 0595 0 0251 mgnh4 n g mlss min consequently it was concluded in the study that high do concentration enhances nitrification rate and reduces the reaction duration 28 however if do concentration is too high it can lead to shearing of floc particles enrich foam production and increase operational costs 18 2 1 2 drawbacks of bnr process the bnr has several drawbacks due to the fact that the processes involved are vulnerable to organic frothing and muck building especially during cold winter 28 the process also requires more elevated levels of operators abilities and consideration more broad research facility work and a more serious level of cycle checking and change 24 other disadvantages with the bnr process are complications of sludge settle ability and the need for large reactors settling tanks biomass recycling slow reaction rate decreasing nitrification activity by ammonium and organic matter overload the need to control oxygen and the demand for two reactors 29 huge reactor size or long hydraulic hrt are needed for maximum nh4 n removal due to low nitrification rate resulting in high operating costs 2 2 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd are the mechanism by which nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously under indistinguishable working circumstances in a single reactor when using snd in wastewater treatment both aob and nob perform both nitrification and denitrification in one reactor additionally snd consumes only 20 40 fewer carbon sources reducing sludge yield by 30 when contrasted with the traditional bnr framework 30 the operational costs are also low due to the fact that sludge recycling is not necessary 31 aob and nob coexist at low levels of dissolved oxygen the process also eliminates the consecutive activity of two isolated tanks and therefore requires easier operational procedures 32 hence the reactor size treatment time and energy required for separate aerobic and anoxic anaerobic treatment are also reduced 33 2 2 1 factors affecting snd processes dissolved oxygen do present in the system is an important factor affecting the snd process theoretically denitrification can be best achieved with zero dissolved oxygen concentration the efficiency of the denitrification process declines when oxygen concentrations are above 0 2 mg o2 l 34 then again do concentration for nitrification ought to be higher than 2 mg o2 l additionally a value of 0 2 mg o2 l is considered as a basic worth at which nitrification does not happen anymore 35 münch et al 35 studied simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in bench scale sequencing group reactors and decided a do centralization of 0 5 mg l at which the nitrification rate would approach the denitrification rate which would prompt total snd organic carbon is likewise perhaps the most pivotal variable in accomplishing snd since it is expected as a carbon and energy hotspot for the microbes it was found that total denitrification can be accomplished at tcod tkn ratio of 7 36 goronszy 37 found that a minimum tcod tkn ratio of 9 is required for achieving nitrogen removal isaacs and henze 38 suggested that a tcod tkn ratio of 3 5 4 5 is required for denitrification to occur 2 2 2 drawbacks of snd processes different authors have shown many benefits of the snd process however the process is having several shortcomings that hold back sufficient operational conditions bernet et al 39 studied nitrification at low oxygen concentration in a biofilm reactor and found that the growth rate of microorganisms involved was low the study also reported the high sensitivity to moderate concentrations of sulphur compounds nitrates and nitrites the process is also associated with high energy expenses and high accessibility of organic matter 32 2 3 ion exchange ion exchange is a process wherein ions on the outer layer of the solid are exchanged for ions of a comparative accuse in a solution of which the solid is in touch 40 ion exchange can be utilized to eliminate nitrogen pollutants from wastewater cations are exchanged for hydrogen or sodium and anions for hydroxide or chloride ions the removal of ammonium ions with the cation exchange on a hydrogen cycle can be expressed by the following reaction 5 h 2 r 2 n h 4 nh 4 2 r 2 h where r represents the resin the nitrate removal can be expressed by the following equation 6 no 3 r oh 2 no 3 2 r 2 oh after all the exchange spots have been replaced with ammonium or nitrate ions the resin must be revived the cation exchanger can be recovered by passing a concentrated sodium chloride solution over the bed while the anion exchanger which for this situation is of hydroxide structure should be treated by sodium hydroxide 41 recently natural and synthetic zeolites are used to remove nitrogen ions from wastewater by using ion exchange process due to the fact that they have high sorption and ion exchange limit ion exchange selectivity catalytic movement and primary temperature strength up to 700 750 c 42 rozic et al 43 explored the removal of ammonium ions from fluid arrangements utilizing a blend of natural clay and zeolite and observed that zeolite eliminates more than 50 wt of ammonia nitrogen while clay should be included a fluid colloidal state to increase the specific surface area and to acquire most extreme productivity rahmani et al 44 concentrated on the removal of ammonia from manufactured solutions utilizing semnan clinoptilolite and observed that the complete exchange capacity of such zeolite for three different lattice sizes was between 17 31 and 18 98 mgnh4 g dry weight in any case the ion exchange process has a downside because of the exchange of pollutants from the emanating stream to sludge that should be discarded in view of added recovery synthetic compounds 45 2 3 1 factors affecting the ion exchange process there are numerous factors affecting the removal of ammonium and nitrate ions from wastewater such as ph temperature particle size initial ammonium concentration contact time and adsorbent dosage at the ph of greater than 7 the removal of nh4 n decreases due to the fact that the reaction favors the formation of nh3 which does not have the ability to be exchanged onto the adsorbent also at ph less than 5 the existing h ions compete with nh4 lowering the removal of nh4 the reaction taking place is exothermic hence an increase in temperature increases the removal of nh4 however the removal of nh4 consequently decreases after the reaction reaches equilibrium while the adsorption rate can be increased by increasing the temperature before the reaction reaches equilibrium 46 another important factor affecting the adsorption of nh4 n by adsorbents and exchangers is particle size the smaller the particle size the more nh4 due to the large surface area of the small particles widiastuti et al 47 studied the removal of ammonium from greywater using natural zeolite at ph of 5 the temperature of 25 c contact time of 8 h initial ammonium concentration of 50 mg l and zeolite loading of 1 g 100 ml the ammonium removal was found to be 97 sarioglu 48 found that increasing initial ammonium nitrogen concentration from 5 0 to 12 0 mg l using natural turkish dogantepe zeolite increased the exchange capacity from 0 70 to 1 08 mg nh4 n however the highest adsorption capacity was achieved at a ph of 4 48 2 3 2 drawbacks of ion exchange method although the ion exchange method has many advantages such as low costs good stability and the ability to reduce also organic matter and heavy metals from wastewater there are some drawbacks associated with this technique ion exchangers and adsorbents have a very limited life span and they need to be changed continuously which generates more wastes that involve additional treatment and disposal 46 the low ammonia removal efficiency of this method was proven by rozic et al 43 through the study of ammoniacal nitrogen removal from water it was found that zeolites only removed 50 of ammonia nitrogen maximum removal efficiency increased when clay was added but an additional process is required to treat the effluent due to the introduction of colloidal clay 2 4 air stripping air stripping is a method by which wastewater is introduced into the air to release volatiles of substances existing in wastewater and carried away in gaseous form by air 49 the process creates a state in which a huge surface area of wastewater is presented to air and advances the exchange of the pollutant from the fluid stage to the vaporous stage the counter current flow takes place through a packing material inside a packed tower consisting of a cylindrical drum fitted with air inlet and distributing space at the bottom wastewater inlet at the top and air and wastewater outlets at the top and bottom respectively the process comprises of a counter current streams of water and air through a packing material the packed tower comprises of a round and hollow drum furnished with a gas inlet and circulating space at the bottom a liquid inlet and distributor at the top gas and liquid outlets at top and bottom respectively wastewater is acquainted to the top of the tower and streams down over the inert packing then again the air is siphoned counter currently from the lower part of the tower nitrogen impurities for example ammonia and nitrates are then stripped out of the water into the air stream 2 4 1 factors affecting the efficiency of stripping there are numerous factors affecting the efficiency of stripping such as temperature ph stripping time and the ratio of air to liquid volume 50 for the removal of nh4 n and nh3 ph is the leading influencing factor due to the fact that it affects the form of nh4 present in the wastewater when the ph is high the nh3 fraction will also be high 21 therefore increasing the ph level of the wastewater before ammonia stripping is vital for the formation of molecular ammonia nitrogen for stripping however an extreme increase in ph results in the extra cost of lime that is used to raise the ph level therefore an optimal ph is required to stabilize process efficiency and economic cost hidalgo et al 51 studied ammonia stripping found that when the ph was more than 10 5 the removal efficiency was irrelevant because ph no longer affected the balance between nh3 and nh4 but the associated cost increased considerably due to the additional lime consumption required to increase the ph levels 51 also an enormous quantity of acid is needed to neutralize the extreme alkali caused by an extremely ph increasing the cost and salinity of the treatment process 52 the use of other different types of alkali such as koh naoh and ca oh 2 were also studied and it was found that calcium hydroxide showed best results due to additional reduction of solids heavy metals and wastewater color 53 temperature is another important factor affecting the stripping efficiency by affecting the reaction rate constant for the removal of nh4 n and nh3 the following exothermic reaction takes place 7 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o from the above reaction decreasing the temperature causes the reaction to move to the right thereby producing more nh3 hence higher nh3 removal can be achieved at higher temperatures from previous studies it was found that high ammonia stripping was achieved at a temperature of 80 c at 40 c ammonia removal was less with about 50 compared with stripping at 80 c however the increasing temperature may also increase the costs of preheating 54 another significant boundary impacting the removal rate of ammonia in wastewater is the fluctuation between ammonia concentration level in liquid structure and air phase is impacted by mass exchange of ammonia into the air 49 li et al 52 studied the pretreatment of anaerobic digestion discharge with ammonia stripping and biogas refinement it was observed that the ammonia stripping effectiveness of anaerobic digestion effluent was impacted by air wastewater proportions it was additionally observed that a higher ammonia removal rate was accomplished after 12 h at a higher air stream flowrate of 10 l min contrasted with lower air stream flowrate of 3 l min and 5 l min 52 likewise it was additionally tracked down that the impact of air to water proportion on ammonia stripping removal at higher temperatures didn t have a significant impact as it brought about ammonia removal more prominent than 91 at 60 c with air flowrate between 73 l h and 120 l h 55 2 4 2 drawbacks of air stripping method the method has been applied for various kinds of high ammonia wastewater however it is having numerous drawbacks firstly the issue of fouling due to the creation of calcium carbonate caco3 scale on the surface of the packing equipment results in poor stripping performance 54 the study was done by viotti and gavasci 56 found that fouling formed on the surface of the packing equipment lowered the efficiency of stripping 18 after 6 months of operation it was concluded that the caco3 scale is formed by the reaction of carbon dioxide co2 available in the air stream with limewater used to increase the ph of the wastewater 54 secondly the air stripping process is associated with high sludge production and alkalinity effluent which increases costs due to the need for additional treatment nevertheless the caco3 can be recovered by using the flotation method and make up for the loss of associated costs 57 further feasibility and performance enhancement studies were assessed for the treatment of alkaline stripped effluent in aerated constructed wetlands which were quite simple and economically friendly due to the fact that they can tolerate high ph wastewater 58 furthermore the release of ammonia gas from the stripping process to the atmosphere results in environmental pollution however ammonia gas release can be prevented by adsorption techniques using hcl or h2so4 subsequently increasing the functional expense of wastewater treatment due to the use of chemicals in another study sulphuric acid was utilized as an acidic substance permeable to recuperate ammonia from landfill leachate from that review 87 of the stripped ammonia was adsorbed 59 zhu et al 60 likewise studied the adsorption of ammonia by sulphuric acid and observed that under the ideal state of ph 12 air flowrate of 0 50 m3 h the temperature of 60 c and stripping time of 120 min 93 of the ammonia stripped can be adsorbed per volume of the acetylene decontamination wastewater 2 5 reverse osmosis reverse osmosis ro is a method applied to separate dissolved solids from wastewater using a selectively permeable membrane the water molecules are forced by a high pressure pump through a permeable membrane separating wastewater streams into permeate and concentrate streams which are continuously discharged 61 ro can be utilized to either refine water or to concentrate and recuperate dissolved solids in the feed water and the technique is applied in various processes like desalination of seawater brackish water generation of ultrapure water for the microelectronics industry generation of high purity water for pharmaceutical industry generation of interaction water for beverages handling of dairy items concentration of corn sweeteners wastewater treatment for the recuperation of interaction materials and water recovery of domestic and industrial wastewaters 62 one of the advantages of the ro process is that the essential equipment used is easy to operate small and not difficult to keep under control furthermore the equipment is flexible and can consequently be scaled up or operated at a limited space 62 also the process is more economically viable compared to other membrane separation processes due to the fact that it does not require the application of heat and it includes no phase change nor the addition of chemicals 61 the process has been proven to remove more than 99 of the organic macromolecules up to 99 of the inorganic ions and all micro organisms from wastewater under definite operating conditions 63 walrand görller 64 studied industrial wastewater treatment by reverse osmosis and found that 80 of the permeate was recovered at 50 60 bars however high recovery resulted from recycling the concentrate into the feed stream the study also proved that fouling of the membranes occurred during the tests in another study treatment of olive mill wastewaters by membrane techniques was investigated and the removal efficiency was more than 96 at 25 bars however it was reported that pre treatment is required to improve the treatment process 65 2 5 1 factors affecting the performance of the ro system temperature is one of the key influences affecting the performance of the reverse osmosis system theoretically when increasing the temperature of the feed the diffusion coefficient increases whereas viscosity decreases resulting in schmidt number to reduce conforming to darcy s law increasing the temperature increases permeate flux due to the decrease in viscosity 66 however temperature increase enhances concentration polarization and fouling which is a build up of dirt layers on the surface of the membrane thus reducing membrane efficiency and inside the pore of the ro membrane if the particles involved are smaller than the pores of the membrane this might cause internal pore fouling and reduction of the pore size which is very difficult to clean thus tightening the pore flow previous studies showed that high temperature increased both permeability and fouling 67 68 removal of ammonia from wastewater also by reverse osmosis also depends on the ph of the feed water when the ph is low ammonia exists in the form of nh 4 and in basic solutions it exists as nh3 69 the separation of nh 4 by membranes is more effective than the separation of free ammonia winfield 69 studied the variables influencing the rate of fouling of ro membranes treating auxiliary sewage effluents and observed that the system delivered an initial rate of decline when the ph of the water feed was 5 and 7 compared with the operation at ph 6 in another review hydrodynamic variables influencing flux and fouling during ro of seawater were examined and the outcomes showed that the minimum values of permeable flux were found at a ph of 6 because of the way that the net electrostatic forces among solutes and among solutes and membrane surface are attractive at that ph value in this manner it was recommended to change the feed ph to a value either lower than 5 or greater than 7 67 2 5 2 drawbacks of reverse osmosis method nitrogen removal by ro membrane separation yields a quite huge volume of concentrate which requires further treatment ro membranes cannot operate proficiently when the feed water to be processed is having suspended solids hence the pre treatment separation processes must anyhow prevent solids carryover to the membrane system 70 one more downside of treating wastewater with ro is membrane fouling which lessens the treatment effectiveness and concentrate production which is hard to make due 71 2 6 chemical precipitation chemical precipitation in wastewater treatment is the change in the form of materials dissolved in water into solid particles 72 this method has been utilized for the treatment of various kinds of wastewaters for example municipal wastewater digesters supernatant industrial wastewater piggery wastewater landfill leachate and coal acid drainage wastewater 72 73 the method is used to generate low solubility salt for example magnesium ammonium phosphate by adding synthetic compounds like mgcl2 h3po4 or phosphate to wastewater containing high nh4 n accordingly eliminating nh4 n from the wastewater 74 the fundamental synthetic response of struvite arrangement is expressed as follows 8 mg 2 nh 4 po 4 3 6 h 2 o mgn h 4 po 4 6 h 2 o with pks 12 6 at 25 c struvite is having an extremely low solubility of 0 169 g l of h2o at 25 c because of its low solubility it very well may be effectively isolated from the water phase 62 hypothetically 17 5 g mgnh4po4 6h2o should be formed as precipitated sludge to eliminate 1 g of nh4 n the limiting reactant in the reaction is magnesium since its concentration is normally lower when contrasted with the ammonium and phosphate ions therefore a magnesium source mgcl2 or mgo must be added to the system 74 the method is enjoying a few benefits contrasted with other methods because of the way that it is monetarily well disposed and simple to work 46 one more benefit is that struvite has the ability to be utilized in horticulture to settle manure garden soil or dried sewage sludge because of the way that has a comparable composition of mg p and n to that of commercial fertilizers 72 notwithstanding whenever utilized in horticulture with ordinary equipment struvite should be dried first for simpler taking care of because of the high crystal water content it contains thus the utilization of struvite is currently not financially reasonable because of the significant expenses of drying 75 2 6 1 factors affecting chemical precipitation process several variables influencing the productivity of the substance precipitation process in wastewater treatment include ph ammonia concentration and the mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportions 73 the method is profoundly proficient in basic solutions because of the way that struvite is soluble in acidic solutions a few investigations revealed that struvite is formed at a ph range of 7 to 11 with crystallization beginning to happen at 8 to 9 ph levels 73 salutsky et al 74 investigated the removal of ammonia from wastewater using this method and observed that removal effectiveness expanded from 41 at ph 8 5 to 93 at ph 10 khai and trang 75 studied chemical precipitation of ammonia from landfill leachate and reported that as 80 6 of nh4 n removal was accomplished at a ph of 9 5 and the mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportion of 1 15 1 1 ammonia removal from excess sludge solution was likewise studied and results showed that more than 90 nh3 n removal productivity was accomplished at ph 11 and mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportion of 1 0 1 0 1 0 76 zhang et al 72 explored ideal ph molar proportion and various types of chemicals combinations for magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation on the pre treatment of ammonium removal from landfill leachate and observed that the most extreme removal of ammonia was accomplished at ph of 9 5 and mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportion of 1 15 1 1 the outcomes from the study showed that when the ph was lower than 9 5 hydrogen ions in the reaction solution would restrain struvite development and reduce ammonium removal likewise when the ph was higher than 9 5 mg3 po4 2 was formed rather than struvite along then limiting the ammonium removal it was likewise revealed that the formed precipitate will have a strong smell of free ammonia assuming the solution ph is above 9 5 73 2 6 2 drawbacks of chemical precipitation method although the process is having low capital costs and ease of operation advantages the operating costs involved are high due to the use of chemicals high energy costs and the disposal of the precipitated sludge that is produced 77 furthermore the process has a tendency to form complex ions which are highly soluble when treating wastewaters containing ammonia and cyanide demanding chemical treatment to break down the complexions formed or preventing their formation 46 pollution is also a major concern due to the use of chemicals such as phosphoric acid or phosphate which is required for the reaction system the incomplete reaction has a negative effect of excess phosphoric acid or phosphate which restricts the large scale use of chemical precipitation methods 46 2 7 breakpoint chlorination breakpoint chlorination is the process whereby excessive chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite is introduced into wastewater oxidizing nh4 n into n2 78 the excess dosage of chlorine increases the free chlorine available in wastewater forming breakpoints the following reactions take place when chlorine is introduced to water 79 9 cl 2 h 2 o hocl hcl 10 nh 4 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o h 11 nh 2 cl hocl nh cl 2 h 2 o 12 nhcl 2 hocl n cl 3 h 2 o in the first step monochloroamine nh2cl is formed followed by the formation of dichloramine in the second step while the nh4 n concentration decreases and free chlorine concentration increases complete conversion of ammonia into trichloramine ncl3 is achieved when the breaking point is reached 79 the advantages of breakpoint chlorination are that it can achieve complete oxidation of ammonia and the process is not complex to apply the process is also not independent of reaction conditions such as toxic substances and temperature 80 2 7 1 factors affecting breakpoint chlorination process the type of chloramine formed depends on the ph in most previous studies monochloroamine was the constituent at a ph range of 7 8 5 81 it was also reported that dichloramine starts to form when the ph is below 7 and dominates when the ph range is at 4 5 5 0 when the ph is below 4 nitrogen trichloride is the chief product 82 theoretically 7 6 mg l of chlorine is needed to oxidize 1 mg l of nh4 n at a breakpoint 83 however laky and licskó 83 studied the removal of ammonium from deep waters and found that the cl2 nh4 n ratio at the breakpoint was between 9 7 and 14 5 2 7 2 drawbacks of breakpoint chlorination method however this technique can only be applied as an advanced treatment due to the fact that it is not suitable to treat wastewater containing a high concentration of high nh4 n 46 environmental pollution is also a major concern with this process due to the production of halogenated organic compounds such as chloramines which can be toxic to both aquatic and human health 79 the process is also associated with high operational costs due to high chlorine consumption another drawback of this method is that chlorine reacts with tri halo methane thm which is carcinogenic to human beings thm requires the use of activated carbon to be removed which makes the process not economically attractive 84 2 8 adsorption adsorption is a technique by which the concentration of adsorbate from its gas or liquid form sticks onto the surface or pores of a solid adsorbent 85 the method relies upon the presence of a force at the outer layer of a solid which reduces the potential energy of an adsorbed molecule below that of the liquid phase 86 the performance of the adsorbent determines the success or failure of the adsorption process the adsorbent with good capacity yet sluggish kinetics is anything is not a good choice due to the fact that adsorbate molecules will take a long time to even consider arriving at the particle interior along these lines brings about lengthy adsorbate residence time subsequently a low output additionally in the event that an adsorbent has quick kinetics yet low capacity a large amount of solid is needed for a given yield consequently a good solid is one that offers great adsorptive capacity as well as great kinetics there are various sorts of adsorption processes specifically physical adsorption and chemical adsorption physical adsorption happens in the event that the attraction forces existing among adsorbate and adsorbent are vander waal s forces this type of adsorption can be reversed by either expanding the temperature or limiting the pressure because of the way that the existing forces are weak chemical adsorption occurs assuming that the existing force of attraction among adsorbate and adsorbent are the practically same strength as chemical bonds 87 this type of adsorption can t be reversed because of the way that the forces involved are a lot stronger and include a considerable degree of electron transfer as in the formation of a chemical bond 88 these two types of adsorptions have various characteristics which are recorded in table 3 the adsorption process has been proved to be an efficient removal of both organic and inorganic solutes in wastewater treatment 89 the adsorption process has many advantages compared to other treatment methods which include high removal efficiency low cost ease to apply low sensitivity to ph and temperature and environmentally friendliness 90 different authors studied the use of several adsorbents for nitrogen removal from wastewater 91 however recent research has been focusing on the development of low cost adsorbents that have the highest capability to remove impurities from wastewater such as natural materials agricultural wastes and industrial wastes 92 among the different porous solids studied activated carbons have numerous advantages such as a high surface area highly developed porous structure and the possibility to modify the porous structure and surface chemistry in order to adapt it for a special application 93 the adsorption process is highly dependent on time it is vital to know the rate at which the process takes place before designing and estimation of adsorbent 94 therefore it is very important to identify the adsorption and kinetics and determine their phenomenological coefficients describing the transport of adsorbates within adsorbents 95 adsorption kinetics gives attention to variations in chemical properties in time and it deals especially with rates of changes 96 theoretically different models can be used to evaluate the kinetics of the adsorption process lagergren 97 recommended a rate equation with the adsorption of dissolved materials theory and suggested the pseudo first order rate eq 13 13 d q d t k 1 q e q where q and q e are the grams of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent at any time and at equilibrium respectively and k 1 is the rate constant of first order adsorption another model used to evaluate the kinetics of the adsorption process is pseudo second order model and it is expressed by eq 14 14 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where q and q e are the grams of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent at any time and at equilibrium respectively and k 2 is the rate constant of second order adsorption 74 adsorption equilibrium is reached when the adsorbent and adsorbate are in contact for a certain period and demonstrate a constant amount between the amount of adsorbate adsorbed and the amount of adsorbate in solution the equilibrium relationship is defined by adsorption isotherms an adsorption isotherm is defined as a curve relating the equilibrium concentration of a solute on the surface of an adsorbent to the concentration of the solute in the aqueous solution with which it is in interaction it is also an equation relating the amount of solute adsorbed onto the solid and the equilibrium concentration of the solute in solution at a known temperature 2 8 1 factors affecting the adsorption process ph has a major influence on the removal of ammonium by the adsorption process the ammonium removal efficiency reduces with an increase in ph due to the fewer ammonia ions that exist in alkaline environments in acidic solutions ammonium exists as nh4 and competes with h reducing the adsorption of nh4 ions onto the adsorbent also in basic solutions nh4 reacts with oh in the solution and leads to the formation of molecular ammonia nh3 consequently the adsorption of nh4 is most favorable at neutral ph 98 tang et al 99 achieved 70 ammonium removal efficiency at ph 4 0 ammonium removal efficiency increased from 70 to 100 when ph was increased to 7 0 liang et al 100 reported that the adsorption rate of ammonium nitrogen with biochar gradually stabilized and reached a peak at ph 10 an increase in ph decreased the adsorption rate rapidly when ph was greater than 10 contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate is another important factor affecting the removal of ammonium from wastewater by adsorption it can also influence the economic effectiveness of the process as well as the adsorption kinetics ammonium removal efficiency is fast at the beginning but slowly decreases with contact time this is due to the fact that initially adsorbent sites are empty and the ammonium concentration gradient is high as adsorption sites and the concentration gradient decrease the rate of ammonium adsorption also decreases the adsorption equilibrium between adsorbent and ammonium is also controlled by adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency of ammonium increases with increasing adsorbent dosage this is due to the fact that high adsorbent dosage results in an increase in the surface area of the adsorbent and the number of active surface sites 101 however equilibrium is reached when the dosage reaches a certain value depending on the material used due to the aggregate formation or particle precipitation at a high liquid solid ratio 99 el shafey et al 102 studied the adsorption of ammonium ions onto natural and modified egyptian kaolinites and found that maximum nh4 adsorption was achieved when the amount of employed adsorbent was 0 1g it was also found that nh4 adsorption decreased when the adsorbent dosage was above 0 1 g due to interference caused by the interaction of active sites of an adsorbent therefore it is important to optimize the dosage of an adsorbent for achieving effective nh4 removal wastewater usually includes coexisting ions such as na k mg2 and ca2 which may affect the removal of ammonium by the adsorption process the presence of cations results in a decrease in ammonium adsorption capacity due to the fact that these ions compete with ammonium for the available ion exchange sites 99 several studies indicated that the presence of cations k na ca2 mg2 zn2 and cd2 in aqueous solutions reduce ammonium removal 103 mazloomi and jalali 104 studied ammonium removal from aqueous solutions by natural iranian zeolite in the presence of organic acids cations and anions the study found that anions such as cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 negatively influenced the ammonium removal efficiency of natural zeolites the study also showed that the presence of low molecular weight organic acids oxalic acid malic acid and citric acid increased ammonium adsorption onto natural zeolites due to the fact that the presence of organic compounds possibly reduced surface tension in the aqueous phase to the point of enhancing access of counter ions to fixed sites and to the microporous and mesoporous structure of the zeolite the particle size of the adsorbent is a crucial factor affecting the adsorption rate of ammonium from wastewater the smaller the particle size of the adsorbent the more ammonia nitrogen will be adsorbed this is due to the fact that the smaller particle size increases the available surface area to enable ammonium adsorption 105 2 8 2 drawbacks of adsorption method there are several disadvantages of the adsorption process such as low removal efficiency a complicated redevelopment process of adsorbents and specific ph ranges furthermore adsorbents only last for a short period of time demanding continuous replacement which generates wastes that require further treatment and disposal 45 the process is also associated with relatively high capital costs the used adsorbent may also be considered hazardous waste 106 2 9 advanced oxidation processes aops aops produce very active radicals such as the hydroxyl radical ho superoxide radical anions o2 hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 sulphate radicals so4 and organic peroxyl radicals roo insufficient quantity for degradation of pollutants found in wastewater at near ambient temperature and pressure 107 the mechanism of contaminant degradation involves mainly two steps which are the generation of radicals at electrode surface followed by oxidation of pollutants by the action of generated radicals 108 the primary purpose of aops is to increase the biodegradability of nitrogen pollutants for following biological treatment to directly remove nitrogen pollutants or to further degrade nitrogen pollutants as a post treatment unit for other technologies 109 hydroxyl radical is mainly used in advanced oxidation processes as it is having a high standard redox potential of 2 8 v thus it reacts non selectively with nitrogen contaminants 110 table 4 presents different oxidants with their oxidation potential in wastewater treatment aops processes cover o3 and h2o2 as oxidants with support from light catalyst fe2 fe3 or tio2 ultrasonic supplement and thermal input various studies have shown that aots could be single or combined in wastewater treatment however two or more treatment methods are more advantageous results in greater efficiency than the single method processing single advanced oxidation technology is not capable of completely eliminating the pollutants due to the fact that it generates untraceable inhibitory and intermediate by products that are sometimes toxic than the parent compounds 111 in order to achieve complete decomposition of pollutants present in wastewater process combination rather than a single technology system is required 112 there are numerous combinations of cost effective technologies such as fenton h2o2 fe2 photo fenton h2o2 uv fe2 peroxidation combined with ultraviolet light h2o2 uv peroxone o3 h2o2 peroxone combined with ultraviolet light o3 h2o2 uv o3 uv system o3 tio2 h2o2 and o3 tio2 electron beam irradiation these oxidation processes form non selective active species that oxidize a diversity of non biodegradable compounds and they have shown good results in the treatment of nitrogen pollutants in wastewater treatment 113 aops have numerous advantages as it works in ambient temperature and pressure it has less reaction time and is more economical and feasible than conventional methods 114 furthermore the process requires no use of chemicals for the treatment no sludge production comparatively lower investment cost and high pollutant removal efficiency ease of the process and low space requirements 115 rajasekhar et al 115 studied the treatment of urban wastewater using ti sb sno2 pbo2 as anode and stainless steel as the cathode and it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal was 99 with low energy consumption however the presence of chloride ions was reported to be an issue that may produce organo chlorinated compounds 2 9 1 factors affecting advanced oxidation process the advanced oxidation process is highly influenced by the ph of the solution to be treated due to the fact that the production of oh radical is controlled by ph therefore to improve the overall degradation efficiency for efficient generation of oh radical ph value needs to be optimized 116 the oxidation potential of oh radicals decrease with increasing ph the process is effective in an acidic medium sluggish in an alkaline medium and highly efficient at ph 2 4 117 when the ph is greater than 4 5 the formation of oh radicals is retarded due to the decomposition of h2o2 into o2 gas and lose its oxidation ability on the other hand ph of less than 2 is not favorable for the formation of oh radicals due to the fact that association of h2o2 occurs which becomes more stable and reduces its reactivity to generate oh radicals 114 pani et al 117 studied the removal of nh3 n from dye intermediate manufacturing industrial wastewater using the fenton oxidation method and found that the maximum nh3 n removal was achieved at ph 3 and decreasing by increasing the ph to 3 5 oxidant concentration h2o2 o3 is another factor affecting the degradation of nitrogen pollutants by an advanced oxidation process the reaction rate increases with increasing oxidant concentration therefore sufficient oxidants must be added in order to push the reaction beyond that point 118 2 9 2 drawbacks of advanced oxidation processes aops are difficult to treat wastewater having a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen due to the fact that hydroxyl radicals have a very slow reaction rate with ammonia 119 when using the fenton process solid iron sludge as the iron reduction byproduct is continuously produced accompanied by the elimination of nitrogen pollutants the unwanted sludge needs to be disposed of thereby increasing the operational treatment costs 120 the process is also associated with high energy consumption and operating cost 2 10 comparison of the nitrogen removal efficiency of these nitrogen removal processes many different processes have been studied in available literature to remove nitrogen from wastewater these treatment processes can be classified as chemical physical and biological methods and they are often selected based on many advantages such as high selective separation simplicity in control and lower space requirement advanced oxidation processes proved to be highly efficient treatment processes as their removal efficiency is 95 however the high operational costs and energy consumption due to the disposal of unwanted sludge make this process economically unfriendly overall each treatment process has its own advantages and limitations table 5 presents the nitrogen removal efficiencies of the different processes at the same conditions 3 conclusion nitrogen removal from wastewater can be achieved by applying physicochemical chemical bio electrochemical and biological treatments the operating conditions advantages and disadvantages of different processes were reviewed including factors affecting each process aops proved to be highly efficient treatment processes as their removal efficiency is 95 however the high operational costs due to the disposal of unwanted sludge make this process economically unfriendly the chemical precipitation process was found to have the least efficiency of about 20 30 with a high dependency on the process ph on the other hand the removal of ammonia by air stripping is the most used process for wastewater pre treatment however the process requires large stripping towers it is time consuming and it forms calcium carbonate scale in the packing of stripping towers considering the complication of wastewater the combination of different methods is recommended based on the advantages of each method for treating wastewater effectively and economically according to the desired water quality characteristics and the demands of the effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12913,nitrogen is important for all living matter however extreme release of nitrogen into water bodies can lead to the acceleration of eutrophication in natural aquatic environments therefore removal of nitrogen is very important this article focuses on reviewing the different methods used for nitrogen removal from wastewater including physicochemical chemical bio electrochemical and biological techniques the review paper examines the differences among the removal methods in terms of duration and overall efficiencies the combination of different methods is recommended based on the advantages of each method for treating wastewater effectively and economically keywords wastewater treatment nitrogen removal ammonium nitrate 1 introduction nitrogen is crucial for all living matter as it is the main component in proteins nucleic acids and other nitrogenous substances of living creatures 1 however excessive discharge of organic and inorganic nitrogen can have harmful consequences on receiving water environments the most predominant forms of nitrogen in wastewaters are organic ammonium and nitrate nitrogen and they need to be properly treated to the minimum required concentrations due to the fact that they have a negative environmental impact 2 high release of these nitrogen containing wastes into waterways and lakes causes environmental problems such as eutrophication of amphibian biological systems depletion of oxygen in waterways environments killing off aquatic life and contamination of groundwater by nitrate and its impact on the general wellbeing of infants as free ammonia nitrogen can be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic organisms due to the fact that ammonia deplete dissolved oxygen required by those living organisms 3 leaching of nitrate from the soil leads to groundwater contamination which when used as drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia also known as a blue baby syndrome which affects infants less than three months 4 in all forms nitrogen also causes eutrophication in waterways since it is a nutrient for aquatic plants eutrophication emerges from the excess supply of nutrients into the waterways which stimulates a large number of plants and algae growth after such aquatic plants die the bacterial decomposition of their biomass consumes the most oxygen in the water leading to hypoxia 5 an increase in water usage has increased the amount of nitrogen discharged into natural water bodies which causes serious environmental problems untreated wastewaters could deteriorate water quality stimulate eutrophication and alter the aquatic biodiversity in water resources 6 nitrogen removal from wastewaters is extremely important to protect water resources nitrogen can be present in many forms in wastewater due to the high number of oxidation states it can accept which makes the process of its removal from water complex and challenging 7 table 1 presents the nitrogenous compounds exist in different stages of wastewater treatment and their oxidation states several review articles have focused on various technologies for biological removal and recovery and energy cost 6 on microbiology characteristics and efficiency of either conventional process control strategies critical operation parameters and bioreactor design 8 12 biochemical removal 13 the present study provides a comprehensive review of the different nitrogen removal processes used for wastewater treatment including the factors affecting each process advantages and disadvantages of each method for treating wastewater effectively and economically over the past years several processes such as physicochemical chemical bio electrochemical and biological techniques have been applied in response to address complications caused by the discharge of high nitrogen wastewater into the environment 2 technologies review 2 1 biological nutrients removal bnr one of the notable procedures for the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater is biological nutrient removal bnr nitrogen removal by autotrophic microorganisms would be preferable since it leaves the organic matter for methanogenic bacteria during wastewater treatment autotrophic denitrification 14 photoautotrophic systems 15 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox processes 16 17 are the autotrophic nitrogen removal approaches among them anammox process in wastewater systems has resulted in higher rates of nitrogen removal and lower energy requirements than those for conventional nitrogen removal 18 new biological nitrogen removal technologies based on the principle of anammox process have been developed partial nitrification anammox with a cost efficiency and environmentally friendly 19 the removal of nitrogen from wastewater using the bnr process consists also of nitrification and denitrification 20 21 the nitrification interaction comprises of two step autotrophic reactions by which ammonium is converted over to nitrite and afterward nitrite is oxidized further to nitrate within the sight of oxygen during first step oxidation of ammonia ammonium to nitrite is carried by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob such as nitrosomonas nitrosococcus and nitrosospira whereby the following reactions take place 1 2 nh 4 3 o 2 bacteria 2 no 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 2 nh 3 o 2 bacteria no 2 3 h 2 e these aob s utilize carbon dioxide or inorganic carbon as their carbon source for the synthesis of cellular material hypothetically roughly 30 molecules of ammonium ions or 100 molecules of nitrite ions must be oxidized for every single molecule of carbon dioxide adapted into cellular material by aob 18 in the subsequent advance oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is conveyed by nitrite oxidizing microorganisms nob in particular nitrobacter nitrospira and nitrococcus by which the accompanying reaction 3 takes place 3 no 2 h 2 o ba c teria no 3 2 h 2 e the development and procreation of the nitrifying microscopic organisms are influenced by several factors such as dissolved oxygen alkalinity and ph temperature inhibition toxicity and mode of operation for instance when the temperature increases the growth of the nitrifying bacteria also increases hence nitrification takes place easily when the temperature decreases nitrifying bacteria grow very slow and nitrification takes place at a lower rate consequently during cold temperatures an increase of nitrite ions may occur as nob oxidizes nitrite ions more slowly than aob oxidizes ammonium ions table 2 presents numerous genera of nitrifying bacteria responsible for the nitrification process 18 denitrification is the microbial course of diminishing nitrate no 3 to gaseous forms of nitrogen mostly nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen n2 22 the microorganisms accountable for the denitrification interaction are denitrifiers specifically thiobacillus micrococcus serratia pseudomonas and achromobacter during that process the following reaction takes place 4 2 no 3 10 e 12 h bacteria n 2 6 h 2 o the bnr process is considered to have numerous advantages regarding the removal of nitrogen from wastewater due to the fact that it utilizes naturally occurring microorganisms over costly chemicals that eventually appear in digested sludge and treatment plants effluents it additionally delivers less abundance sludge that requires slight handling and simple removal which has a lot of lower metal substance and can be applied to agrarian land 23 24 2 1 1 factors affecting the bnr process numerous factors are affecting the bnr process such as ph temperature sludge retention time srt carbon to nitrogen ratio c n hydraulic retention time hrt dissolved oxygen do and food to microorganism ratio f m sewage wastewater is normally alkaline due to the presence of potable water supply infiltration of groundwater and chemical compounds discharged to the sewer system however ph is lowered by the production of hydrogen ions h and nitrite ions no2 during nitrification according to reactions 1 3 25 nitrification starts at a ph of 5 0 begins to accelerate at a ph of 6 7 and the optimum ph range for nitrification is 7 2 to 8 0 26 gerardi 21 stated that above 10 c nitrification is almost directly proportional to temperature however below 10 c nitrification gradually decreases randall et al 27 studied nitrification kinetics in single sludge biological nutrient removal activated sludge system and found that maximum nitrification was achieved at 20 c with an srt of 2 7 days the study also showed that at a lower temperature of 10 c the effect of nitrification was lower than 65 shahzad et al 28 reported that the temperature increases of 1 c reduced srt needed for nitrification by 10 the denitrification process is highly dependent on c n in the biological the c n ratio must be high to denitrify all nitrate formed by the nitrification process 27 previous studies recommended a c n ratio of 3 4 for the microorganisms are to function at maximum efficiency 25 however komorowska kaufman et al 29 recommended a higher c n ratio of greater than 13 due to rapid initial cod removal by adsorption another important factor affecting the bnr process is do concentration nitrification starts to occur at a do concentration of less than 0 5 mg l however the optimum rate of nitrification can be accomplished by do concentration of 2 4 mg l and it should be maintained in the aeration basin to ensure the wastewater treatment facility complies with acceptable mixed liquor effluent concentrations for nh3 nh4 no2 and no3 18 yuan and gao 30 studied the impact of do on nitrogen removal and found that the decrease in do from 4 to 1 mg l the time to achieve nitrification was increased from 125 min to 240 min while the rate of nitrification reduced from 0 0595 0 0251 mgnh4 n g mlss min consequently it was concluded in the study that high do concentration enhances nitrification rate and reduces the reaction duration 28 however if do concentration is too high it can lead to shearing of floc particles enrich foam production and increase operational costs 18 2 1 2 drawbacks of bnr process the bnr has several drawbacks due to the fact that the processes involved are vulnerable to organic frothing and muck building especially during cold winter 28 the process also requires more elevated levels of operators abilities and consideration more broad research facility work and a more serious level of cycle checking and change 24 other disadvantages with the bnr process are complications of sludge settle ability and the need for large reactors settling tanks biomass recycling slow reaction rate decreasing nitrification activity by ammonium and organic matter overload the need to control oxygen and the demand for two reactors 29 huge reactor size or long hydraulic hrt are needed for maximum nh4 n removal due to low nitrification rate resulting in high operating costs 2 2 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd are the mechanism by which nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously under indistinguishable working circumstances in a single reactor when using snd in wastewater treatment both aob and nob perform both nitrification and denitrification in one reactor additionally snd consumes only 20 40 fewer carbon sources reducing sludge yield by 30 when contrasted with the traditional bnr framework 30 the operational costs are also low due to the fact that sludge recycling is not necessary 31 aob and nob coexist at low levels of dissolved oxygen the process also eliminates the consecutive activity of two isolated tanks and therefore requires easier operational procedures 32 hence the reactor size treatment time and energy required for separate aerobic and anoxic anaerobic treatment are also reduced 33 2 2 1 factors affecting snd processes dissolved oxygen do present in the system is an important factor affecting the snd process theoretically denitrification can be best achieved with zero dissolved oxygen concentration the efficiency of the denitrification process declines when oxygen concentrations are above 0 2 mg o2 l 34 then again do concentration for nitrification ought to be higher than 2 mg o2 l additionally a value of 0 2 mg o2 l is considered as a basic worth at which nitrification does not happen anymore 35 münch et al 35 studied simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in bench scale sequencing group reactors and decided a do centralization of 0 5 mg l at which the nitrification rate would approach the denitrification rate which would prompt total snd organic carbon is likewise perhaps the most pivotal variable in accomplishing snd since it is expected as a carbon and energy hotspot for the microbes it was found that total denitrification can be accomplished at tcod tkn ratio of 7 36 goronszy 37 found that a minimum tcod tkn ratio of 9 is required for achieving nitrogen removal isaacs and henze 38 suggested that a tcod tkn ratio of 3 5 4 5 is required for denitrification to occur 2 2 2 drawbacks of snd processes different authors have shown many benefits of the snd process however the process is having several shortcomings that hold back sufficient operational conditions bernet et al 39 studied nitrification at low oxygen concentration in a biofilm reactor and found that the growth rate of microorganisms involved was low the study also reported the high sensitivity to moderate concentrations of sulphur compounds nitrates and nitrites the process is also associated with high energy expenses and high accessibility of organic matter 32 2 3 ion exchange ion exchange is a process wherein ions on the outer layer of the solid are exchanged for ions of a comparative accuse in a solution of which the solid is in touch 40 ion exchange can be utilized to eliminate nitrogen pollutants from wastewater cations are exchanged for hydrogen or sodium and anions for hydroxide or chloride ions the removal of ammonium ions with the cation exchange on a hydrogen cycle can be expressed by the following reaction 5 h 2 r 2 n h 4 nh 4 2 r 2 h where r represents the resin the nitrate removal can be expressed by the following equation 6 no 3 r oh 2 no 3 2 r 2 oh after all the exchange spots have been replaced with ammonium or nitrate ions the resin must be revived the cation exchanger can be recovered by passing a concentrated sodium chloride solution over the bed while the anion exchanger which for this situation is of hydroxide structure should be treated by sodium hydroxide 41 recently natural and synthetic zeolites are used to remove nitrogen ions from wastewater by using ion exchange process due to the fact that they have high sorption and ion exchange limit ion exchange selectivity catalytic movement and primary temperature strength up to 700 750 c 42 rozic et al 43 explored the removal of ammonium ions from fluid arrangements utilizing a blend of natural clay and zeolite and observed that zeolite eliminates more than 50 wt of ammonia nitrogen while clay should be included a fluid colloidal state to increase the specific surface area and to acquire most extreme productivity rahmani et al 44 concentrated on the removal of ammonia from manufactured solutions utilizing semnan clinoptilolite and observed that the complete exchange capacity of such zeolite for three different lattice sizes was between 17 31 and 18 98 mgnh4 g dry weight in any case the ion exchange process has a downside because of the exchange of pollutants from the emanating stream to sludge that should be discarded in view of added recovery synthetic compounds 45 2 3 1 factors affecting the ion exchange process there are numerous factors affecting the removal of ammonium and nitrate ions from wastewater such as ph temperature particle size initial ammonium concentration contact time and adsorbent dosage at the ph of greater than 7 the removal of nh4 n decreases due to the fact that the reaction favors the formation of nh3 which does not have the ability to be exchanged onto the adsorbent also at ph less than 5 the existing h ions compete with nh4 lowering the removal of nh4 the reaction taking place is exothermic hence an increase in temperature increases the removal of nh4 however the removal of nh4 consequently decreases after the reaction reaches equilibrium while the adsorption rate can be increased by increasing the temperature before the reaction reaches equilibrium 46 another important factor affecting the adsorption of nh4 n by adsorbents and exchangers is particle size the smaller the particle size the more nh4 due to the large surface area of the small particles widiastuti et al 47 studied the removal of ammonium from greywater using natural zeolite at ph of 5 the temperature of 25 c contact time of 8 h initial ammonium concentration of 50 mg l and zeolite loading of 1 g 100 ml the ammonium removal was found to be 97 sarioglu 48 found that increasing initial ammonium nitrogen concentration from 5 0 to 12 0 mg l using natural turkish dogantepe zeolite increased the exchange capacity from 0 70 to 1 08 mg nh4 n however the highest adsorption capacity was achieved at a ph of 4 48 2 3 2 drawbacks of ion exchange method although the ion exchange method has many advantages such as low costs good stability and the ability to reduce also organic matter and heavy metals from wastewater there are some drawbacks associated with this technique ion exchangers and adsorbents have a very limited life span and they need to be changed continuously which generates more wastes that involve additional treatment and disposal 46 the low ammonia removal efficiency of this method was proven by rozic et al 43 through the study of ammoniacal nitrogen removal from water it was found that zeolites only removed 50 of ammonia nitrogen maximum removal efficiency increased when clay was added but an additional process is required to treat the effluent due to the introduction of colloidal clay 2 4 air stripping air stripping is a method by which wastewater is introduced into the air to release volatiles of substances existing in wastewater and carried away in gaseous form by air 49 the process creates a state in which a huge surface area of wastewater is presented to air and advances the exchange of the pollutant from the fluid stage to the vaporous stage the counter current flow takes place through a packing material inside a packed tower consisting of a cylindrical drum fitted with air inlet and distributing space at the bottom wastewater inlet at the top and air and wastewater outlets at the top and bottom respectively the process comprises of a counter current streams of water and air through a packing material the packed tower comprises of a round and hollow drum furnished with a gas inlet and circulating space at the bottom a liquid inlet and distributor at the top gas and liquid outlets at top and bottom respectively wastewater is acquainted to the top of the tower and streams down over the inert packing then again the air is siphoned counter currently from the lower part of the tower nitrogen impurities for example ammonia and nitrates are then stripped out of the water into the air stream 2 4 1 factors affecting the efficiency of stripping there are numerous factors affecting the efficiency of stripping such as temperature ph stripping time and the ratio of air to liquid volume 50 for the removal of nh4 n and nh3 ph is the leading influencing factor due to the fact that it affects the form of nh4 present in the wastewater when the ph is high the nh3 fraction will also be high 21 therefore increasing the ph level of the wastewater before ammonia stripping is vital for the formation of molecular ammonia nitrogen for stripping however an extreme increase in ph results in the extra cost of lime that is used to raise the ph level therefore an optimal ph is required to stabilize process efficiency and economic cost hidalgo et al 51 studied ammonia stripping found that when the ph was more than 10 5 the removal efficiency was irrelevant because ph no longer affected the balance between nh3 and nh4 but the associated cost increased considerably due to the additional lime consumption required to increase the ph levels 51 also an enormous quantity of acid is needed to neutralize the extreme alkali caused by an extremely ph increasing the cost and salinity of the treatment process 52 the use of other different types of alkali such as koh naoh and ca oh 2 were also studied and it was found that calcium hydroxide showed best results due to additional reduction of solids heavy metals and wastewater color 53 temperature is another important factor affecting the stripping efficiency by affecting the reaction rate constant for the removal of nh4 n and nh3 the following exothermic reaction takes place 7 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o from the above reaction decreasing the temperature causes the reaction to move to the right thereby producing more nh3 hence higher nh3 removal can be achieved at higher temperatures from previous studies it was found that high ammonia stripping was achieved at a temperature of 80 c at 40 c ammonia removal was less with about 50 compared with stripping at 80 c however the increasing temperature may also increase the costs of preheating 54 another significant boundary impacting the removal rate of ammonia in wastewater is the fluctuation between ammonia concentration level in liquid structure and air phase is impacted by mass exchange of ammonia into the air 49 li et al 52 studied the pretreatment of anaerobic digestion discharge with ammonia stripping and biogas refinement it was observed that the ammonia stripping effectiveness of anaerobic digestion effluent was impacted by air wastewater proportions it was additionally observed that a higher ammonia removal rate was accomplished after 12 h at a higher air stream flowrate of 10 l min contrasted with lower air stream flowrate of 3 l min and 5 l min 52 likewise it was additionally tracked down that the impact of air to water proportion on ammonia stripping removal at higher temperatures didn t have a significant impact as it brought about ammonia removal more prominent than 91 at 60 c with air flowrate between 73 l h and 120 l h 55 2 4 2 drawbacks of air stripping method the method has been applied for various kinds of high ammonia wastewater however it is having numerous drawbacks firstly the issue of fouling due to the creation of calcium carbonate caco3 scale on the surface of the packing equipment results in poor stripping performance 54 the study was done by viotti and gavasci 56 found that fouling formed on the surface of the packing equipment lowered the efficiency of stripping 18 after 6 months of operation it was concluded that the caco3 scale is formed by the reaction of carbon dioxide co2 available in the air stream with limewater used to increase the ph of the wastewater 54 secondly the air stripping process is associated with high sludge production and alkalinity effluent which increases costs due to the need for additional treatment nevertheless the caco3 can be recovered by using the flotation method and make up for the loss of associated costs 57 further feasibility and performance enhancement studies were assessed for the treatment of alkaline stripped effluent in aerated constructed wetlands which were quite simple and economically friendly due to the fact that they can tolerate high ph wastewater 58 furthermore the release of ammonia gas from the stripping process to the atmosphere results in environmental pollution however ammonia gas release can be prevented by adsorption techniques using hcl or h2so4 subsequently increasing the functional expense of wastewater treatment due to the use of chemicals in another study sulphuric acid was utilized as an acidic substance permeable to recuperate ammonia from landfill leachate from that review 87 of the stripped ammonia was adsorbed 59 zhu et al 60 likewise studied the adsorption of ammonia by sulphuric acid and observed that under the ideal state of ph 12 air flowrate of 0 50 m3 h the temperature of 60 c and stripping time of 120 min 93 of the ammonia stripped can be adsorbed per volume of the acetylene decontamination wastewater 2 5 reverse osmosis reverse osmosis ro is a method applied to separate dissolved solids from wastewater using a selectively permeable membrane the water molecules are forced by a high pressure pump through a permeable membrane separating wastewater streams into permeate and concentrate streams which are continuously discharged 61 ro can be utilized to either refine water or to concentrate and recuperate dissolved solids in the feed water and the technique is applied in various processes like desalination of seawater brackish water generation of ultrapure water for the microelectronics industry generation of high purity water for pharmaceutical industry generation of interaction water for beverages handling of dairy items concentration of corn sweeteners wastewater treatment for the recuperation of interaction materials and water recovery of domestic and industrial wastewaters 62 one of the advantages of the ro process is that the essential equipment used is easy to operate small and not difficult to keep under control furthermore the equipment is flexible and can consequently be scaled up or operated at a limited space 62 also the process is more economically viable compared to other membrane separation processes due to the fact that it does not require the application of heat and it includes no phase change nor the addition of chemicals 61 the process has been proven to remove more than 99 of the organic macromolecules up to 99 of the inorganic ions and all micro organisms from wastewater under definite operating conditions 63 walrand görller 64 studied industrial wastewater treatment by reverse osmosis and found that 80 of the permeate was recovered at 50 60 bars however high recovery resulted from recycling the concentrate into the feed stream the study also proved that fouling of the membranes occurred during the tests in another study treatment of olive mill wastewaters by membrane techniques was investigated and the removal efficiency was more than 96 at 25 bars however it was reported that pre treatment is required to improve the treatment process 65 2 5 1 factors affecting the performance of the ro system temperature is one of the key influences affecting the performance of the reverse osmosis system theoretically when increasing the temperature of the feed the diffusion coefficient increases whereas viscosity decreases resulting in schmidt number to reduce conforming to darcy s law increasing the temperature increases permeate flux due to the decrease in viscosity 66 however temperature increase enhances concentration polarization and fouling which is a build up of dirt layers on the surface of the membrane thus reducing membrane efficiency and inside the pore of the ro membrane if the particles involved are smaller than the pores of the membrane this might cause internal pore fouling and reduction of the pore size which is very difficult to clean thus tightening the pore flow previous studies showed that high temperature increased both permeability and fouling 67 68 removal of ammonia from wastewater also by reverse osmosis also depends on the ph of the feed water when the ph is low ammonia exists in the form of nh 4 and in basic solutions it exists as nh3 69 the separation of nh 4 by membranes is more effective than the separation of free ammonia winfield 69 studied the variables influencing the rate of fouling of ro membranes treating auxiliary sewage effluents and observed that the system delivered an initial rate of decline when the ph of the water feed was 5 and 7 compared with the operation at ph 6 in another review hydrodynamic variables influencing flux and fouling during ro of seawater were examined and the outcomes showed that the minimum values of permeable flux were found at a ph of 6 because of the way that the net electrostatic forces among solutes and among solutes and membrane surface are attractive at that ph value in this manner it was recommended to change the feed ph to a value either lower than 5 or greater than 7 67 2 5 2 drawbacks of reverse osmosis method nitrogen removal by ro membrane separation yields a quite huge volume of concentrate which requires further treatment ro membranes cannot operate proficiently when the feed water to be processed is having suspended solids hence the pre treatment separation processes must anyhow prevent solids carryover to the membrane system 70 one more downside of treating wastewater with ro is membrane fouling which lessens the treatment effectiveness and concentrate production which is hard to make due 71 2 6 chemical precipitation chemical precipitation in wastewater treatment is the change in the form of materials dissolved in water into solid particles 72 this method has been utilized for the treatment of various kinds of wastewaters for example municipal wastewater digesters supernatant industrial wastewater piggery wastewater landfill leachate and coal acid drainage wastewater 72 73 the method is used to generate low solubility salt for example magnesium ammonium phosphate by adding synthetic compounds like mgcl2 h3po4 or phosphate to wastewater containing high nh4 n accordingly eliminating nh4 n from the wastewater 74 the fundamental synthetic response of struvite arrangement is expressed as follows 8 mg 2 nh 4 po 4 3 6 h 2 o mgn h 4 po 4 6 h 2 o with pks 12 6 at 25 c struvite is having an extremely low solubility of 0 169 g l of h2o at 25 c because of its low solubility it very well may be effectively isolated from the water phase 62 hypothetically 17 5 g mgnh4po4 6h2o should be formed as precipitated sludge to eliminate 1 g of nh4 n the limiting reactant in the reaction is magnesium since its concentration is normally lower when contrasted with the ammonium and phosphate ions therefore a magnesium source mgcl2 or mgo must be added to the system 74 the method is enjoying a few benefits contrasted with other methods because of the way that it is monetarily well disposed and simple to work 46 one more benefit is that struvite has the ability to be utilized in horticulture to settle manure garden soil or dried sewage sludge because of the way that has a comparable composition of mg p and n to that of commercial fertilizers 72 notwithstanding whenever utilized in horticulture with ordinary equipment struvite should be dried first for simpler taking care of because of the high crystal water content it contains thus the utilization of struvite is currently not financially reasonable because of the significant expenses of drying 75 2 6 1 factors affecting chemical precipitation process several variables influencing the productivity of the substance precipitation process in wastewater treatment include ph ammonia concentration and the mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportions 73 the method is profoundly proficient in basic solutions because of the way that struvite is soluble in acidic solutions a few investigations revealed that struvite is formed at a ph range of 7 to 11 with crystallization beginning to happen at 8 to 9 ph levels 73 salutsky et al 74 investigated the removal of ammonia from wastewater using this method and observed that removal effectiveness expanded from 41 at ph 8 5 to 93 at ph 10 khai and trang 75 studied chemical precipitation of ammonia from landfill leachate and reported that as 80 6 of nh4 n removal was accomplished at a ph of 9 5 and the mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportion of 1 15 1 1 ammonia removal from excess sludge solution was likewise studied and results showed that more than 90 nh3 n removal productivity was accomplished at ph 11 and mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportion of 1 0 1 0 1 0 76 zhang et al 72 explored ideal ph molar proportion and various types of chemicals combinations for magnesium ammonium phosphate precipitation on the pre treatment of ammonium removal from landfill leachate and observed that the most extreme removal of ammonia was accomplished at ph of 9 5 and mg2 nh4 po4 3 m proportion of 1 15 1 1 the outcomes from the study showed that when the ph was lower than 9 5 hydrogen ions in the reaction solution would restrain struvite development and reduce ammonium removal likewise when the ph was higher than 9 5 mg3 po4 2 was formed rather than struvite along then limiting the ammonium removal it was likewise revealed that the formed precipitate will have a strong smell of free ammonia assuming the solution ph is above 9 5 73 2 6 2 drawbacks of chemical precipitation method although the process is having low capital costs and ease of operation advantages the operating costs involved are high due to the use of chemicals high energy costs and the disposal of the precipitated sludge that is produced 77 furthermore the process has a tendency to form complex ions which are highly soluble when treating wastewaters containing ammonia and cyanide demanding chemical treatment to break down the complexions formed or preventing their formation 46 pollution is also a major concern due to the use of chemicals such as phosphoric acid or phosphate which is required for the reaction system the incomplete reaction has a negative effect of excess phosphoric acid or phosphate which restricts the large scale use of chemical precipitation methods 46 2 7 breakpoint chlorination breakpoint chlorination is the process whereby excessive chlorine gas or sodium hypochlorite is introduced into wastewater oxidizing nh4 n into n2 78 the excess dosage of chlorine increases the free chlorine available in wastewater forming breakpoints the following reactions take place when chlorine is introduced to water 79 9 cl 2 h 2 o hocl hcl 10 nh 4 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o h 11 nh 2 cl hocl nh cl 2 h 2 o 12 nhcl 2 hocl n cl 3 h 2 o in the first step monochloroamine nh2cl is formed followed by the formation of dichloramine in the second step while the nh4 n concentration decreases and free chlorine concentration increases complete conversion of ammonia into trichloramine ncl3 is achieved when the breaking point is reached 79 the advantages of breakpoint chlorination are that it can achieve complete oxidation of ammonia and the process is not complex to apply the process is also not independent of reaction conditions such as toxic substances and temperature 80 2 7 1 factors affecting breakpoint chlorination process the type of chloramine formed depends on the ph in most previous studies monochloroamine was the constituent at a ph range of 7 8 5 81 it was also reported that dichloramine starts to form when the ph is below 7 and dominates when the ph range is at 4 5 5 0 when the ph is below 4 nitrogen trichloride is the chief product 82 theoretically 7 6 mg l of chlorine is needed to oxidize 1 mg l of nh4 n at a breakpoint 83 however laky and licskó 83 studied the removal of ammonium from deep waters and found that the cl2 nh4 n ratio at the breakpoint was between 9 7 and 14 5 2 7 2 drawbacks of breakpoint chlorination method however this technique can only be applied as an advanced treatment due to the fact that it is not suitable to treat wastewater containing a high concentration of high nh4 n 46 environmental pollution is also a major concern with this process due to the production of halogenated organic compounds such as chloramines which can be toxic to both aquatic and human health 79 the process is also associated with high operational costs due to high chlorine consumption another drawback of this method is that chlorine reacts with tri halo methane thm which is carcinogenic to human beings thm requires the use of activated carbon to be removed which makes the process not economically attractive 84 2 8 adsorption adsorption is a technique by which the concentration of adsorbate from its gas or liquid form sticks onto the surface or pores of a solid adsorbent 85 the method relies upon the presence of a force at the outer layer of a solid which reduces the potential energy of an adsorbed molecule below that of the liquid phase 86 the performance of the adsorbent determines the success or failure of the adsorption process the adsorbent with good capacity yet sluggish kinetics is anything is not a good choice due to the fact that adsorbate molecules will take a long time to even consider arriving at the particle interior along these lines brings about lengthy adsorbate residence time subsequently a low output additionally in the event that an adsorbent has quick kinetics yet low capacity a large amount of solid is needed for a given yield consequently a good solid is one that offers great adsorptive capacity as well as great kinetics there are various sorts of adsorption processes specifically physical adsorption and chemical adsorption physical adsorption happens in the event that the attraction forces existing among adsorbate and adsorbent are vander waal s forces this type of adsorption can be reversed by either expanding the temperature or limiting the pressure because of the way that the existing forces are weak chemical adsorption occurs assuming that the existing force of attraction among adsorbate and adsorbent are the practically same strength as chemical bonds 87 this type of adsorption can t be reversed because of the way that the forces involved are a lot stronger and include a considerable degree of electron transfer as in the formation of a chemical bond 88 these two types of adsorptions have various characteristics which are recorded in table 3 the adsorption process has been proved to be an efficient removal of both organic and inorganic solutes in wastewater treatment 89 the adsorption process has many advantages compared to other treatment methods which include high removal efficiency low cost ease to apply low sensitivity to ph and temperature and environmentally friendliness 90 different authors studied the use of several adsorbents for nitrogen removal from wastewater 91 however recent research has been focusing on the development of low cost adsorbents that have the highest capability to remove impurities from wastewater such as natural materials agricultural wastes and industrial wastes 92 among the different porous solids studied activated carbons have numerous advantages such as a high surface area highly developed porous structure and the possibility to modify the porous structure and surface chemistry in order to adapt it for a special application 93 the adsorption process is highly dependent on time it is vital to know the rate at which the process takes place before designing and estimation of adsorbent 94 therefore it is very important to identify the adsorption and kinetics and determine their phenomenological coefficients describing the transport of adsorbates within adsorbents 95 adsorption kinetics gives attention to variations in chemical properties in time and it deals especially with rates of changes 96 theoretically different models can be used to evaluate the kinetics of the adsorption process lagergren 97 recommended a rate equation with the adsorption of dissolved materials theory and suggested the pseudo first order rate eq 13 13 d q d t k 1 q e q where q and q e are the grams of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent at any time and at equilibrium respectively and k 1 is the rate constant of first order adsorption another model used to evaluate the kinetics of the adsorption process is pseudo second order model and it is expressed by eq 14 14 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where q and q e are the grams of adsorbate per gram of adsorbent at any time and at equilibrium respectively and k 2 is the rate constant of second order adsorption 74 adsorption equilibrium is reached when the adsorbent and adsorbate are in contact for a certain period and demonstrate a constant amount between the amount of adsorbate adsorbed and the amount of adsorbate in solution the equilibrium relationship is defined by adsorption isotherms an adsorption isotherm is defined as a curve relating the equilibrium concentration of a solute on the surface of an adsorbent to the concentration of the solute in the aqueous solution with which it is in interaction it is also an equation relating the amount of solute adsorbed onto the solid and the equilibrium concentration of the solute in solution at a known temperature 2 8 1 factors affecting the adsorption process ph has a major influence on the removal of ammonium by the adsorption process the ammonium removal efficiency reduces with an increase in ph due to the fewer ammonia ions that exist in alkaline environments in acidic solutions ammonium exists as nh4 and competes with h reducing the adsorption of nh4 ions onto the adsorbent also in basic solutions nh4 reacts with oh in the solution and leads to the formation of molecular ammonia nh3 consequently the adsorption of nh4 is most favorable at neutral ph 98 tang et al 99 achieved 70 ammonium removal efficiency at ph 4 0 ammonium removal efficiency increased from 70 to 100 when ph was increased to 7 0 liang et al 100 reported that the adsorption rate of ammonium nitrogen with biochar gradually stabilized and reached a peak at ph 10 an increase in ph decreased the adsorption rate rapidly when ph was greater than 10 contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate is another important factor affecting the removal of ammonium from wastewater by adsorption it can also influence the economic effectiveness of the process as well as the adsorption kinetics ammonium removal efficiency is fast at the beginning but slowly decreases with contact time this is due to the fact that initially adsorbent sites are empty and the ammonium concentration gradient is high as adsorption sites and the concentration gradient decrease the rate of ammonium adsorption also decreases the adsorption equilibrium between adsorbent and ammonium is also controlled by adsorbent dosage the removal efficiency of ammonium increases with increasing adsorbent dosage this is due to the fact that high adsorbent dosage results in an increase in the surface area of the adsorbent and the number of active surface sites 101 however equilibrium is reached when the dosage reaches a certain value depending on the material used due to the aggregate formation or particle precipitation at a high liquid solid ratio 99 el shafey et al 102 studied the adsorption of ammonium ions onto natural and modified egyptian kaolinites and found that maximum nh4 adsorption was achieved when the amount of employed adsorbent was 0 1g it was also found that nh4 adsorption decreased when the adsorbent dosage was above 0 1 g due to interference caused by the interaction of active sites of an adsorbent therefore it is important to optimize the dosage of an adsorbent for achieving effective nh4 removal wastewater usually includes coexisting ions such as na k mg2 and ca2 which may affect the removal of ammonium by the adsorption process the presence of cations results in a decrease in ammonium adsorption capacity due to the fact that these ions compete with ammonium for the available ion exchange sites 99 several studies indicated that the presence of cations k na ca2 mg2 zn2 and cd2 in aqueous solutions reduce ammonium removal 103 mazloomi and jalali 104 studied ammonium removal from aqueous solutions by natural iranian zeolite in the presence of organic acids cations and anions the study found that anions such as cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 negatively influenced the ammonium removal efficiency of natural zeolites the study also showed that the presence of low molecular weight organic acids oxalic acid malic acid and citric acid increased ammonium adsorption onto natural zeolites due to the fact that the presence of organic compounds possibly reduced surface tension in the aqueous phase to the point of enhancing access of counter ions to fixed sites and to the microporous and mesoporous structure of the zeolite the particle size of the adsorbent is a crucial factor affecting the adsorption rate of ammonium from wastewater the smaller the particle size of the adsorbent the more ammonia nitrogen will be adsorbed this is due to the fact that the smaller particle size increases the available surface area to enable ammonium adsorption 105 2 8 2 drawbacks of adsorption method there are several disadvantages of the adsorption process such as low removal efficiency a complicated redevelopment process of adsorbents and specific ph ranges furthermore adsorbents only last for a short period of time demanding continuous replacement which generates wastes that require further treatment and disposal 45 the process is also associated with relatively high capital costs the used adsorbent may also be considered hazardous waste 106 2 9 advanced oxidation processes aops aops produce very active radicals such as the hydroxyl radical ho superoxide radical anions o2 hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 sulphate radicals so4 and organic peroxyl radicals roo insufficient quantity for degradation of pollutants found in wastewater at near ambient temperature and pressure 107 the mechanism of contaminant degradation involves mainly two steps which are the generation of radicals at electrode surface followed by oxidation of pollutants by the action of generated radicals 108 the primary purpose of aops is to increase the biodegradability of nitrogen pollutants for following biological treatment to directly remove nitrogen pollutants or to further degrade nitrogen pollutants as a post treatment unit for other technologies 109 hydroxyl radical is mainly used in advanced oxidation processes as it is having a high standard redox potential of 2 8 v thus it reacts non selectively with nitrogen contaminants 110 table 4 presents different oxidants with their oxidation potential in wastewater treatment aops processes cover o3 and h2o2 as oxidants with support from light catalyst fe2 fe3 or tio2 ultrasonic supplement and thermal input various studies have shown that aots could be single or combined in wastewater treatment however two or more treatment methods are more advantageous results in greater efficiency than the single method processing single advanced oxidation technology is not capable of completely eliminating the pollutants due to the fact that it generates untraceable inhibitory and intermediate by products that are sometimes toxic than the parent compounds 111 in order to achieve complete decomposition of pollutants present in wastewater process combination rather than a single technology system is required 112 there are numerous combinations of cost effective technologies such as fenton h2o2 fe2 photo fenton h2o2 uv fe2 peroxidation combined with ultraviolet light h2o2 uv peroxone o3 h2o2 peroxone combined with ultraviolet light o3 h2o2 uv o3 uv system o3 tio2 h2o2 and o3 tio2 electron beam irradiation these oxidation processes form non selective active species that oxidize a diversity of non biodegradable compounds and they have shown good results in the treatment of nitrogen pollutants in wastewater treatment 113 aops have numerous advantages as it works in ambient temperature and pressure it has less reaction time and is more economical and feasible than conventional methods 114 furthermore the process requires no use of chemicals for the treatment no sludge production comparatively lower investment cost and high pollutant removal efficiency ease of the process and low space requirements 115 rajasekhar et al 115 studied the treatment of urban wastewater using ti sb sno2 pbo2 as anode and stainless steel as the cathode and it was found that the ammonia nitrogen removal was 99 with low energy consumption however the presence of chloride ions was reported to be an issue that may produce organo chlorinated compounds 2 9 1 factors affecting advanced oxidation process the advanced oxidation process is highly influenced by the ph of the solution to be treated due to the fact that the production of oh radical is controlled by ph therefore to improve the overall degradation efficiency for efficient generation of oh radical ph value needs to be optimized 116 the oxidation potential of oh radicals decrease with increasing ph the process is effective in an acidic medium sluggish in an alkaline medium and highly efficient at ph 2 4 117 when the ph is greater than 4 5 the formation of oh radicals is retarded due to the decomposition of h2o2 into o2 gas and lose its oxidation ability on the other hand ph of less than 2 is not favorable for the formation of oh radicals due to the fact that association of h2o2 occurs which becomes more stable and reduces its reactivity to generate oh radicals 114 pani et al 117 studied the removal of nh3 n from dye intermediate manufacturing industrial wastewater using the fenton oxidation method and found that the maximum nh3 n removal was achieved at ph 3 and decreasing by increasing the ph to 3 5 oxidant concentration h2o2 o3 is another factor affecting the degradation of nitrogen pollutants by an advanced oxidation process the reaction rate increases with increasing oxidant concentration therefore sufficient oxidants must be added in order to push the reaction beyond that point 118 2 9 2 drawbacks of advanced oxidation processes aops are difficult to treat wastewater having a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen due to the fact that hydroxyl radicals have a very slow reaction rate with ammonia 119 when using the fenton process solid iron sludge as the iron reduction byproduct is continuously produced accompanied by the elimination of nitrogen pollutants the unwanted sludge needs to be disposed of thereby increasing the operational treatment costs 120 the process is also associated with high energy consumption and operating cost 2 10 comparison of the nitrogen removal efficiency of these nitrogen removal processes many different processes have been studied in available literature to remove nitrogen from wastewater these treatment processes can be classified as chemical physical and biological methods and they are often selected based on many advantages such as high selective separation simplicity in control and lower space requirement advanced oxidation processes proved to be highly efficient treatment processes as their removal efficiency is 95 however the high operational costs and energy consumption due to the disposal of unwanted sludge make this process economically unfriendly overall each treatment process has its own advantages and limitations table 5 presents the nitrogen removal efficiencies of the different processes at the same conditions 3 conclusion nitrogen removal from wastewater can be achieved by applying physicochemical chemical bio electrochemical and biological treatments the operating conditions advantages and disadvantages of different processes were reviewed including factors affecting each process aops proved to be highly efficient treatment processes as their removal efficiency is 95 however the high operational costs due to the disposal of unwanted sludge make this process economically unfriendly the chemical precipitation process was found to have the least efficiency of about 20 30 with a high dependency on the process ph on the other hand the removal of ammonia by air stripping is the most used process for wastewater pre treatment however the process requires large stripping towers it is time consuming and it forms calcium carbonate scale in the packing of stripping towers considering the complication of wastewater the combination of different methods is recommended based on the advantages of each method for treating wastewater effectively and economically according to the desired water quality characteristics and the demands of the effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12914,in the current study the facile method of 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound functionalization was introduced to synthesize the new kind of pectin based material with high functionality and hydrophilicity the obtained pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was characterized by sem xrd ftir and edx consequently it was incorporated into the polyethersulfone pes nanofiltration nf membrane at different loadings the pectin pt composite membranes pt 0 3 and pt 0 5 were also prepared to further prove the influence of the used pt functionalization method on membrane performance the surface properties and filtration performance of the composite membranes were studied all composite membranes showed higher pure water flux compared to the bare membrane pt 0 and in the best case the pure water flux value of 43 22 l m2h was obtained for the 0 3 wt pcpt composite membrane pcpt 0 3 pcpt 0 3 showed the highest mean pore size porosity surface hydrophilicity smoothness and negative charge among all prepared composite membranes after incorporation of pcpt hybrid the salt rejection was considerably enhanced with the sequence of na2so4 nacl verifying the typical nf behavior of the membranes for pcpt 0 3 the rejection of direct red 16 dr16 and crystal violet cv was 99 82 and 98 24 and the corresponding permeate flux was 40 2 and 40 1 l m2h respectively pb2 cu2 and cd2 rejections were measured 31 00 32 00 and 32 50 for pt 0 whereas they were 98 09 98 32 and 98 63 pcpt 0 3 respectively moreover pcpt 0 3 exhibited excellent antifouling properties nominating the pcpt hybrid as a privileged membrane modifier for the treatment of water wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pectin nanofiltration heavy metals dyes 1 introduction nowadays water pollution with industrial contaminations such as heavy metals inorganic salts and mutagenic dyes is becoming a growing threat 1 the increasing occurrence of heavy metals in water resources is a menace to the living world due to their high toxicity stability non biodegradability decomposability and tendency to bioaccumulate in the human body even at trace concentrations 2 3 releasing inorganic salts e g nacl and na2so4 from industrial effluents to the surface water can decrease the water quality for human utilization 4 5 meanwhile contamination of water and wastewater by different types of carcinogenic organic dyes such as direct red 16 dr16 and crystal violet cv can cause damage to human health prevent the penetration of sunlight to the aqueous media disturb the oxygen transfer mechanism and interfere with the photosynthetic activities of aquatics living organisms 6 10 if the efficient treatment and purification procedure is applied the industrial wastewater containing different types of pollutants heavy metals dyes and salts may be deemed as a noteworthy water source across the world for human use particularly in regions with water scarcity 11 12 therefore exploring the cost efficient and effective techniques for industrial wastewater treatment is essential up to now different technologies comprising biological treatment adsorption physical removal ion exchange chemical treatment and membrane separation have been used to eliminate these pollutants from water and wastewater 13 14 among these technologies many environmental researchers have considered membrane separation an efficient water purification method 15 on the basis of its distinguishing properties of the charged surface and pore size 0 5 2 nm nanofiltration nf is considered as an economical sustainable easy to operate and high efficient technology for the removal of pollutants with a molecular weight cut off mwco 200 da 16 polyethersulfone pes is a more widely used polymer for the preparation of nf membranes because of its firmness mechanical stability chemical resistance and thermostability 17 however the separation efficiency of the pes nf membrane is inherently low due to the absence of active functionalities on its surface and the pollutant rejection is dramatically reduced due to the prompt fouling attributed to the rejected pollutants 18 this can lead to permeability deacrease membrane life decrement higher energy consumption and additional cleaning requirements 19 incorporating modifiers e g nanoparticles and nanotubes into the matrix of these membranes is beneficial to enhance their permeability and decrease their fouling 20 for instance kamari et al 11 reported that incorporating chitosan functionalized fe3o4 sio2 nanocomposite in the pes nf membrane was an efficient way to improve the solute rejection and antifouling attributes of the membrane pectin pt presented in all citrus plants is a natural anionic polysaccharide composed of α 1 4 d galacturonic acid with a part of methoxylated carboxyl groups 21 pt can be considered as a low cost nominee material for modification of pes membrane due to its numerous functionalities such as hydroxyl and carboxyl carboxylate along with its biodegradable and non toxic nature 22 23 the technological and chemical characteristics of pt can be improved by chemical modification 24 the application of pt in membrane fabrication for water purification and fouling assessment has not been reported in the literature for the first time pt was functionalized with 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound and characterized then the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was incorporated in the pes membrane matrix as a novel non toxic and low cost modifier the pectin pt composite membranes were also prepared to elucidate the impact of the used pt functionalization method on the membrane structure and performance the functional groups surface and cross section morphology and physicochemical properties of the membranes were fully investigated the prepared composite membranes were used to measure pure water flux salts na2so4 and nacl rejection dye dr16 and cv retention cu2 cd2 and pb2 rejection fouling properties and eventually the membrane with optimum pcpt loading was specified 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyethersulfone pes mw of 58 000 g mol was provided by basf germany cyclodextrin ferric sulfate 97 ferrous

preparation of the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was synthesized by a three step process at first cl modification of pectin with thionyl chloride was carried out for this aim 1 g of pt was dissolved in a flask containing 50 ml of toluene by using stirring at room temperature one gram of thionyl chloride was added to the above mixed solution and stirred for 24 h at room temperature the cl modified pt was collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone and distilled water and then dried at 85 c for 2 h in the second step the 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound was synthesized by one pot multicomponent click synthesis 25 in the third step the synthesized cl modified pt was functionalized with pyrazole compound for this purpose 1 g of cl modified pt was dispersed in 50 ml toluene under sonication for 30 min afterward 2 g of the synthesized pyrazole compound was added to the as prepared cl modified pt suspension and refluxed at 110 c for 24 h lastly the product was collected by filtering and washed with acetone and ethanol the prepared pcpt hybrid was dried in an oven at 80 c the chemical structure of the obtained pcpt hybrid is represented in fig 1 2 3 preparation of the composite nf membranes in this study the phase inversion technique was used for preparing the membranes pre determined amounts of modifiers pt or pcpt hybrid were added to dmac solvent and stirred for 12 h to disperse modifiers into the solvent then a pre determined amount of pes as a polymer and pvp as a pore former were added to the dmac pt or pcpt hybrid solution with vigorous mixing after 24 h magnet stirring at room temperature sonication was carried out for 30 min to eliminate gasses afterward each solution was cast on a smooth glass plate using a handmade film applicator with a casting knife of 150 μm gap size the obtained casting solution coated plate was immersed into a distilled water coagulation bath to induce the exchange between solvent dmac and nonsolvent water the prepared membranes were preserved in distilled water overnight to complete phase inversion and eliminate the remaining dmac solvent before use compositions of the casting solutions for the composite membranes are shown in table 1 2 4 characterization methods ftir spectra of pt pcpt hybrid and the prepared membranes were obtained by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet avatar 370 usa x ray diffraction analysis xrd pattern of the pt and pcpt hybrid was obtained by xrd philips pw

mean difference between the highest points and the lowest pores and root mean square of y data respectively were identified using atomic force microscopy afm nanosurf mobiles the hydrophilicity of membranes was investigated by using the sessile drop technique at room temperature pictures were taken from the deionized water droplet 4 μl on at least eight random zones on the membrane surface and the average value was reported the overall porosity and pore size of the membranes were determined based on our previous studies 20 26 molecular weight cut off mwco for the prepared membranes was determined using the filtration of 200 mg l peg aqueous solutions at various molecular weights of 200 400 600 800 1000 1500 and 2000 g mol at a pressure of 0 4 mpa the concentration of peg was measured by the total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan mwco is defined as peg molecular weight at which the peg rejection is 90 the whole filtration experiments were carried out at a temperature of 25 c the pressure of 0 4 mpa and ph of 6 in a dead end filtration unit with an effective membrane area of 12 56 cm2 and volume capacity of 150 ml after compacting the testing membrane with deionized water at 0 6 mpa for 30 min the pure water flux pwf measurements were carried out for 60 min the following equation was used to calculate the pure water flux pw 1 l m2h 1 p w 1 m a m t where m is the permeate volume l am is the effective area of the testing membrane m2 and t is the permeation time h the separation performance of the membranes was investigated by the filtration of dyes cv and dr16 50 mg l heavy metal ions cd2 cu2 and pb2 10 mg l salt na2so4 and nacl 300 mg l solutions at the pressure of 0 4 mpa and ph of 6 the cv and dr16 with formula structure mw and maximum wavelength λmax table 2 were used as cationic and anionic testing dyes respectively the feed solution in the filtration cell was stirred at a speed of 200 rpm during the filtration at least three repeated experiments were performed for all filtration studies to calculate the average values the following equation was used to calculate the rejection rate r 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represent the concentration of solute dye salt heavy metal ion in permeate and feed solutions respectively in salt rejection experiments the conductivity meter was used to measure the concentrations of testing solutions and in the case of dye rejection experiments a biomate 5 uv visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific was used to measure the concentrations of testing solutions at the wavelengths of maximum absorbance of 590 and 526 nm for cv and dr16 respectively in order to study the stability of the pcpt composite membranes for long term filtration a continuous 144 h single solute filtration of na2so4 cd2 and dr16 solutions was carried out using the well performed membrane at the pressure of 0 4 mpa and ph of 6 the feed concentration of na2so4 cd2 and dr16 solution was 300 10 and 50 mg l respectively during the filtration process the antifouling behavior of the membrane is a crucial issue to be considered therefore the fouling experiments were performed with an aqueous milk powder solution 8000 mg l by a similar method reported previously during the fouling process the pure water flux pw 1 l m2h the milk solution flux pm l m2h and the water flux after washing pw 2 l m2h were recorded finally the flux recovery ration frr and fouling resistance parameters including irreversible fouling resistance rir reversible fouling ratio rr and total fouling

fig 2a and b show the fesem images of pt and pcpt pt presented to be fibrous in shape fig 2a similar results were also reported for pt 27 after surface modification of pt with 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound the surface morphology became smoother fig 2b xrd patterns of pt and pcpt are depicted in fig 2c the xrd spectra of both pt and pcpt showed a broad peak at 2θ equal to 20 with indicated their amorphous behavior 28 the spectrum of pcpt showed additional peaks near 2θ at 29 8 and 45 1 which could be the characteristic of 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile 25 by comparing the edx results for pt and pcpt hybrid fig 2d and e it was found that the edx analysis of pcpt indicated the presence of n and s atoms which further proves the successful functionalization of pt with the pyrazole compound as shown in fig 3 there are two intense peaks at 1068 and 3422 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of both pt and pcpt samples related to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl and skeletal ring of galacturonic sugar units 23 in addition the stretching vibration of cooch3 and coo groups can be seen at around 1627 cm 1 in both pt and pcpt samples 29 both samples present the band at 2924 cm 1 which is related to the asymmetric ch vibrations in ch ch2 and ch3 groups 29 in the ftir spectrum of pcpt hybrid the peak assigned to characteristic c s c and cn groups are visualized at 1033 and 2249 cm 1 respectively 30 in addition the peaks at 1450 and 1584 cm 1 are attributed to the cc of aromatic rings of pcpt structure 3 2 characterization of the prepared composite membranes as can be seen in fig 4a the main characteristic ftir bands for pes are as follows the band at 1107 cm 1 is related to the aromatic ring vibrations 31 bands at 1151 and 1320 cm 1 are due to the symmetric and asymmetric so2 groups the band at 1488 cm 1 is owned to the stretching mode of benzene ring 32 and the band at 1241 cm 1 is originated from aromatic ether stretching 33 as displayed in fig 4b different from the pt 0 membrane the pt 0 5 membrane showed the new peak at 1627 cm 1 originates from the spectrum of pt the additional peaks further confirm the incorporation of pt in the studied membrane at 2924 and 3422 cm 1 which are attributed to the stretching vibration of cn groups and of hydroxyl skeletal ring of galacturonic sugar units of pt respectively as shown in fig 4c compared to the pt 0 membrane the pcpt 0 5 membrane displays additional peaks at 1450 cc aromatic rings 1627 cooch3 and coo groups 2249 cn groups and 3422 cm 1 hydroxyl and skeletal ring of galacturonic sugar units of pt which confirm the incorporation of pcpt hybrid in the pcpt composite membranes in order to compare the chemical elements of pt 0 pt 0 5 and pcpt 0 5 membranes edx analysis was carried out table 3 and fig 5 as can be seen for pt 0 membrane the quantity of oxygen 30 67 wt and sulfur 0 17 wt was less than in pt 0 5 with 44 03 wt oxygen and 1 83 wt sulfur and pcpt 0 5 with 52 24 wt oxygen and 10 15 wt sulfur membranes which were due to the incorporation of modifiers pt or pcpt in casting solutions moreover the quantity of carbon was increased from 69 16 wt for pt 0 membrane to 53 14 and 35 07 wt by incorporating the 0 5 wt pt and pcpt respectively notably 2 54 wt nitrogen was detected in pcpt 0 5 membrane which further proves the presence of pcpt hybrid in pcpt 0 5 membrane a cross sectional fesem analysis was conducted in fig 6 to observe the morphology of the prepared composite membranes all membranes showed finger like pore structure and the surface was covered with a dense selective barrier comparison between the cross sectional fesem images of pt 0 and composite membranes pt 0 3 pt 0 5 pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 shows that the addition of used modifier pt or pcpt to casting solution does not change the fabrication mechanism of the pes membrane structure through phase inversion procedure increasing modifier loading in membrane matrix higher than 0 3 wt enlarged the finger like pores of a porous sublayer of the membranes this is probably caused by the prompt mass transfer among the solvent dmac and non solvent water during the non solvent phase inversion process as the loading of hydrophilic modifier pt or pcpt increases compared to the pt 0 membrane the water penetration from the coagulation bath to polymer layer is accelerated resulting in the formation of large finger like pores table 4 reports mean pore size mwco and porosity also fig 7 represents the mwco and pore size distribution of the prepared membranes as reported in the first column of table 4 increasing the loading of pt or pcpt in membrane matrix from 0 to 0 3 wt increased the mean pore size from 0 7 to 0 78 and 0 81 nm respectively an identical trend is observed for porosity as shown in the third column of table 4 in other words as the mean pore size of the membrane increases the porosity is increased too all composite membranes had higher porosity mean pore size and mwco than pt 0 membrane during phase inversion hydrophilic modifier migrates towards the membrane surface resulting in more instantaneous solvent and non solvent replacement and subsequently forming membrane with enlarged pore size 34 this phenomenon is responsible for the increment in mwco of membranes 35 however with increasing the modifier loading higher than 0 3 wt the mean pore size porosity and mwco decreased somewhat this is very likely due to the presence of modifier agglomerates and incrementing the casting solution viscosity that hinders the phase inversion process and subsequently forms lower size pores in the membrane structure 36 from the afm images of the prepared membranes fig 8 incorporation of the used modifiers in the membrane matrix significantly affected the surface roughness of the membranes particularly at 0 3 wt loading the lowest roughness values were observed the roughness parameters of the membranes consisting of the average difference between four the deepest pores and the highest points sy root mean square of y data sq and mean roughness sa were calculated using nanosurf c3000 version 3 10 0 and the related results are reported in table 5 based on the results the mitigation of roughness values was observed after the incorporation of modifier and the lowest values were obtained for pcpt 0 5 sa 4 36 nm sq 5 43 nm and sy 32 76 nm however addition on pt and pcpt loading higher than 0 3 wt increased the values among the composite membranes the highest values of sa 18 67 nm sq 23 67 nm and sy 169 43 nm were obtained for the pcpt 0 5 membrane this can be elucidated by observing the agglomeration of pcpt on the pcpt 0 5 membrane fig 6 since hydrophilicity has profound effects on membrane performance in terms of permeability and antifouling properties our next inquisitiveness was to study the water contact angle wca of the prepared composite membranes which is illustrative of their surface hydrophilicity as observed in fig 9a the wca of the pt 0 membrane decreased after the incorporation of the used modifier especially in the case of the pcpt hybrid furthermore the wca of the composite membranes decreased by incrementing the modifier loading up to 0 3 wt and the pcpt 0 3 membrane demonstrated the lowest wca of 50 2 it should be noted that compared to the pt the pcpt hybrid had a stronger effect on the hydrophilicity enhancement confirming the effectiveness of pt functionalization on membrane properties since the pcpt hybrid is hydrophilic owing to the hydrophilic functionalities such as nitrile hydroxyl c s c cooch3 and coo groups by incorporating the pcpt hybrid to the membrane structure the surface hydrophilicity enhanced following 37 in the case of c s c and cooch3 the presence of lone pair of electrons on s and n species caused negative partial charges on these atoms which induced the negative net charge on the surface of the pcpt hybrid as a result the presence of the pcpt hybrid on the surface of the pcpt composite membranes increased the density of negative charge on the surface of these membranes the increase in density of negative charge on the membrane enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane in other words during the phase inversion process the hydrophilic modifier tends to move towards the surface of polymeric film which decreases the interface energy at the top layer of the fabricated membranes hence the adsorption of water molecules by the hydrophilic modifier located on the membrane surface makes it wet resulting in higher hydrophilicity of the composite membrane however the wca of the composite membrane did not further decrease by increasing the pt or pcpt in membrane matrix higher than 0 3 wt which may be owing to the possible agglomeration of these modifiers in membrane structure the pwf from the comparison of the pt 0 membrane pt composite membranes pt 0 3 and pt 0 5 and pcpt composite membranes pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 is depicted in fig 9a the pwf of the membranes increased by incrementing the modifier loading up to 0 3 wt in the case of pcpt 0 3 membrane which demonstrated the most sufficing permeability the pwf was increased to 43 22 l m2h in general the permeability is mainly determined by surface hydrophilicity pore size structure and porosity of the composite membrane the high permeability of the pcpt 0 3 membrane was due to its highest surface hydrophilicity mean pore size and porosity the permeability decrement of the pcpt 0 5 membrane could be because of a decrease in hydrophilicity and porosity the surface charge of the prepared membranes as the most important parameter determining the solute rejection of nf membranes through electrostatic effects was studied in terms of zeta potential the related results are shown in fig 9b all composite membranes had negative zeta potential in the range of about 4 to 24 mv at a ph range of 4 10 the presence of sulfone groups of polymer pes and oc and cn groups of pore former pvp made the surface charge of the pt 0 membrane negative 38 the negative surface charge of pt 0 membrane was improved after incorporation of the used modifier up to 0 3 wt especially for pcpt the increasing the negatively charged functional groups of pt hydroxyl and carboxylic acid and pcpt hydroxyl carboxylic acid nitrile and aromatic ring partial negative charge embedded in the membrane structure was probably responsible for the negative surface charge increase in the composite membranes however by increasing the modifier loading from 0 3 to 0 5 wt a declining trend was observed for the pcpt composite membranes this can be probably due to the formation of pt or pcpt agglomerations on the membrane surface or within its pores that reduces the negative charge of the resulting membranes 39 40 3 3 solute rejection the effect of pt and pcpt loading on the performance of the resultant composite membranes was investigated involving a series of salts na2so4 and nacl dyes dr16 and cv and heavy metal ions cd2 cu2 and pb2 solutions thereinto the filtration for 300 mg l na2so4 and nacl solutions were carried out at 0 40 mpa and the results are depicted in fig 10 as shown with the increment of pt or pcpt loading 0 0 3 wt the permeate flux and rejection of the composite membranes for both salts concurrently increased in all membranes the rejection of na2so4 was higher than nacl this was in agreement with the salt rejection characteristic of the nf membranes with a negative charge 5 pcpt 0 3 membrane indicated the maximum salt rejection of 24 31 and 96 91 for nacl and na2so4 and the highest permeate fluxes of 38 82 and 40 32 l m2h for nacl and na2so4 solutions respectively as proved by zeta potential data in fig 9b the negative surface charge of the pcpt composite membranes were higher than the pt composite membranes and the highest negative surface charge was obtained for pcpt 0 3 indeed the presence of functional groups on pcpt caused more negative charges on the surface of the pcpt composite membranes which strengthened the electrostatic repulsive interactions donnan exclusion and inevitably hampered the transportations of inorganic ions 41 an always lower rejection of nacl 17 25 24 31 than for na2so4 78 90 96 91 was due to the weaker anion repulsive force 42 in other words in the case of the rejection in nf membrane with a negative surface charge the charge is greatly in control of the anion valence for instance the divalent anions such as so4 2 are more powerfully repelled by the membrane surface than monovalent anions such as cl as a result the cl containing salts exhibit lower rejections than so4 2 containing salts moreover the higher hydration radius of so4 2 3 79 å than cl 3 32 å could help the high rejection of so4 2 containing salt na2so4 through sieving effects 8 43 further study of the effect of used modifiers on the pt 0 3 pt 0 5 pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 membranes separation performance for 50 mg l dr16 and cv solutions was implemented from fig 11 both permeate flux of dye rejection increased with the appropriate pt and pcpt loading 0 3 wt for both of them the highest porosity and pore size in ptpc 0 3 membrane porosity and pore size were larger compared to pt 0 membrane see table 4 coupled with surface hydrophilicity increment see fig 9a could be the main reason for the increase in permeability of ptpc 0 3 membrane 44 the last factor surface hydrophilicity can also increase the removal of organic dyes as the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane increases the dissolution and penetration of water molecules than those of less polar organic molecules used dyes promotes resulting in higher rejection of dyes 31 all membranes exhibited higher rejection for dr16 than cv the higher dr16 rejection can be elucidated as follows firstly the mw of dr16 637 55 da is greater than the mwco of the prepared membranes 450 612 da see table 4 and fig 7a thus the rejection of the negatively charged dr16 is mainly determined by size sieving secondly the electrostatic repulsive forces of the negatively charged membranes pt 0 3 pt 0 5 pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 on anionic dr16 dye can be the other reason for its higher rejection 45 the slight increase of negative surface charge resulting from the increase of pt and pcpt loading to 0 3 wt as shown in the zeta potential results in fig 9b also contributed to the enhancement of dr16 rejection by these membranes moreover for the studied cationic dye cv with mw of 407 99 da smaller mwco than that of the membranes the adsorption of dye molecules by the negatively charged membranes can be the main reason for high cv rejection it should be noted that the pcpt 0 3 had the highest permeate flux 40 20 and 40 10 l m2h for dr16 and cv solutions respectively and rejection for both dyes 99 82 and 98 24 for dr16 and cv respectively while when the loading of pcpt increased from 0 3 to 0 5 wt the rejection reduced slightly possibly owing to the mitigation in membrane negative charge 9 the capability of the prepared membranes in the rejection of cd2 cu2 and pb2 heavy metal ions was investigated at a feed concentration of 10 mg l pressure of 0 4 mpa ph of 6 and room temperature and the related results are demonstrated in fig 12 for all testing heavy metal ions the rejection was respectively increased and declined by enhancing the modifier loading from 0 to 0 3 wt to 0 3 0 5 wt it was shown that for all three heavy metal ions the maximum rejection was relevant to pcpt 0 3 the remarkable improvement of heavy metal ion removal by the composite membrane in comparison to the bare one could be elucidated in the following 1 by incorporating the pcpt hybrid into the membrane structure the chelate complex is formed between the heavy metal ions and hydroxyl or the lone pair electron of n atoms of pcpt hybrid on the surface of the pcpt composite membranes hence the heavy metal ions will be chelated and removed regarding the pt composite membranes the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl functional groups of pt located on the membrane surface can chelate the heavy metal ions and cause removal 2 for all prepared membranes the rejection values were higher for cd2 ions than pb2 and cu2 ions this can be ascribed to the higher hydration radius of cd2 0 426 nm than cu2 0 419 nm and pb2 0 401 nm hence the heavy metal removal by the prepared composite membranes is affected by the membrane pore size 43 however according to the data in fig 12 the composite membrane with a larger pore size indicated higher heavy metal ion removal hence it can be inferred that the adsorption should be the main reason for the metal ion rejection and the highest porosity of pcpt 0 5 contributed to the highest rejection for metal ions 20 moreover when the pt and pcpt loading increased to 0 5 wt a small decrement in removal was observed which could be due to the possible agglomeration of these modifiers 3 4 long term filtration in order to study the stability of the pcpt composite membranes for long term filtration a continuous 144 h single solute filtration of na2so4 cd2 and dr16 solutions was carried out using the well performed membrane pcpt 0 3 regarding na2so4 the rejection and permeate flux remained almost unchanged which confirmed that the electrostatic exclusion of the pcpt 0 3 was stable in long term use for cd2 the permeate flux remained virtually unchanged 43 11 l m2h the rejection of cd2 was almost stable in the range of 98 30 and 98 63 and did not indicate a considerable reduction over 144 h of filtration demonstrating good interactions of the adsorptive functional groups of the pcpt hybrid on the membrane surface with cd2 for dr16 the rejction was almost constant while the permeate flux slightly decreased from 40 2 to 36 l m2h the observed reduction in dye solution permeate flux could be related to concentration polarization caused by the accumulation of dye molecules on the membrane surface the related results proved that the pcpt composite membrane was stable during the long term use in water this could be ascribed to h bond or strong adsorption interaction force between the pcpt hybrid and the polymer pes 3 5 antifouling properties fig 13a presents the calculated frr for the membranes in this test after the filtration of aqueous milk solution the membrane was submerged in distilled water for about 20 min to remove the reversibly adsorbed foulants from fig 14a all the prepared composite membranes had more frr than the pt 0 membrane which confirms the superior effect of used modifiers pt or pcpt hybrid on antifouling behavior for instance the frr value for pt 0 was 34 00 while its value increased to 71 23 and 86 12 for 0 1 wt pt and 0 1 wt pcpt composite membranes respectively the highest frr value 94 50 was achieved for 0 3 wt pcpt composite membrane pcpt 0 3 membrane pcpt 0 5 membrane showed a decrement owing to the pcpt agglomerations which could lessen the beneficial effect of this modifier 46 the resistance of the membranes to foulant deposition is one of the important matters to be considered hence three types of resistance including rir rr and rt sum of rir and rr were studied fig 13b shows that the pt 0 had the highest irreversibility 66 0 while the pcpt 0 3 had the lowest irreversibility 5 5 the total resistance of the membranes was decreased by the addition of 0 3 wt pt and 0 3 wt pcpt and increased by the addition of 0 5 wt pt and 0 5 wt pcpt in general the membrane with high surface hydrophilicity faces lower adsorption of the foulants on the other hand water molecules can be easily adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface this phenomenon develops a layer of water molecules on the membrane surface that hinders the adsorption of foulants via increasing the reversible foulant adsorption the reversible fouling is ameliorated using simple washing however the stuck of foulants in membrane pores or their adsorption on the membrane surface can cause irreversible fouling the results obtained suggest that the pcpt hybrid was more efficient than pt in ameliorating the antifouling behavior of the membrane this was probably due to the greater influence of pcpt on hydrophilicity charge and roughness of the membrane 4 conclusions in the present study for the first time the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was synthesized and used as a modifier to fabricate a new pes nf membrane with high separation efficiency towards salts dyes and heavy metal ions sem xrd ftir and edx characterizations confirmed the successful synthesis of the pcpt hybrid the authenticity and trustability of the physical and chemical properties of the fabricated membranes were successfully demonstrated by edx sem ftir zeta potential and afm the related results showed that by incrementing the loading of pcpt hybrid from 0 to 0 3 wt in the membrane structure the mean pore size porosity zeta potential and pure water flux increased while the average surface roughness and water contact angle decreased the effect of pt and pcpt loading on the performance of the composite membranes was investigated by salts dyes and heavy metal ions solutions pcpt 0 3 membrane showed the maximum salt rejection of 24 31 and 96 91 for nacl and na2so4 and the highest permeate fluxes of 38 82 and 40 32 l m2h for nacl and na2so4 solutions respectively it also had the highest permeate flux and rejection for both used dyes dr16 and cv for all testing heavy metal ions pb2 cu2 and cd2 the rejection was respectively increased and declined by enhancing the modifier loading from 0 to 0 3 wt to 0 3 0 5 wt it was shown that for all three heavy metal ions the maximum rejection was relevant to pcpt 0 3 furthermore pcpt composite membranes showed more permeation flux and remarkable antifouling properties than pt 0 membrane as a whole the prepared pcpt composite membrane in this study is shown to be a

12914,in the current study the facile method of 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound functionalization was introduced to synthesize the new kind of pectin based material with high functionality and hydrophilicity the obtained pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was characterized by sem xrd ftir and edx consequently it was incorporated into the polyethersulfone pes nanofiltration nf membrane at different loadings the pectin pt composite membranes pt 0 3 and pt 0 5 were also prepared to further prove the influence of the used pt functionalization method on membrane performance the surface properties and filtration performance of the composite membranes were studied all composite membranes showed higher pure water flux compared to the bare membrane pt 0 and in the best case the pure water flux value of 43 22 l m2h was obtained for the 0 3 wt pcpt composite membrane pcpt 0 3 pcpt 0 3 showed the highest mean pore size porosity surface hydrophilicity smoothness and negative charge among all prepared composite membranes after incorporation of pcpt hybrid the salt rejection was considerably enhanced with the sequence of na2so4 nacl verifying the typical nf behavior of the membranes for pcpt 0 3 the rejection of direct red 16 dr16 and crystal violet cv was 99 82 and 98 24 and the corresponding permeate flux was 40 2 and 40 1 l m2h respectively pb2 cu2 and cd2 rejections were measured 31 00 32 00 and 32 50 for pt 0 whereas they were 98 09 98 32 and 98 63 pcpt 0 3 respectively moreover pcpt 0 3 exhibited excellent antifouling properties nominating the pcpt hybrid as a privileged membrane modifier for the treatment of water wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pectin nanofiltration heavy metals dyes 1 introduction nowadays water pollution with industrial contaminations such as heavy metals inorganic salts and mutagenic dyes is becoming a growing threat 1 the increasing occurrence of heavy metals in water resources is a menace to the living world due to their high toxicity stability non biodegradability decomposability and tendency to bioaccumulate in the human body even at trace concentrations 2 3 releasing inorganic salts e g nacl and na2so4 from industrial effluents to the surface water can decrease the water quality for human utilization 4 5 meanwhile contamination of water and wastewater by different types of carcinogenic organic dyes such as direct red 16 dr16 and crystal violet cv can cause damage to human health prevent the penetration of sunlight to the aqueous media disturb the oxygen transfer mechanism and interfere with the photosynthetic activities of aquatics living organisms 6 10 if the efficient treatment and purification procedure is applied the industrial wastewater containing different types of pollutants heavy metals dyes and salts may be deemed as a noteworthy water source across the world for human use particularly in regions with water scarcity 11 12 therefore exploring the cost efficient and effective techniques for industrial wastewater treatment is essential up to now different technologies comprising biological treatment adsorption physical removal ion exchange chemical treatment and membrane separation have been used to eliminate these pollutants from water and wastewater 13 14 among these technologies many environmental researchers have considered membrane separation an efficient water purification method 15 on the basis of its distinguishing properties of the charged surface and pore size 0 5 2 nm nanofiltration nf is considered as an economical sustainable easy to operate and high efficient technology for the removal of pollutants with a molecular weight cut off mwco 200 da 16 polyethersulfone pes is a more widely used polymer for the preparation of nf membranes because of its firmness mechanical stability chemical resistance and thermostability 17 however the separation efficiency of the pes nf membrane is inherently low due to the absence of active functionalities on its surface and the pollutant rejection is dramatically reduced due to the prompt fouling attributed to the rejected pollutants 18 this can lead to permeability deacrease membrane life decrement higher energy consumption and additional cleaning requirements 19 incorporating modifiers e g nanoparticles and nanotubes into the matrix of these membranes is beneficial to enhance their permeability and decrease their fouling 20 for instance kamari et al 11 reported that incorporating chitosan functionalized fe3o4 sio2 nanocomposite in the pes nf membrane was an efficient way to improve the solute rejection and antifouling attributes of the membrane pectin pt presented in all citrus plants is a natural anionic polysaccharide composed of α 1 4 d galacturonic acid with a part of methoxylated carboxyl groups 21 pt can be considered as a low cost nominee material for modification of pes membrane due to its numerous functionalities such as hydroxyl and carboxyl carboxylate along with its biodegradable and non toxic nature 22 23 the technological and chemical characteristics of pt can be improved by chemical modification 24 the application of pt in membrane fabrication for water purification and fouling assessment has not been reported in the literature for the first time pt was functionalized with 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound and characterized then the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was incorporated in the pes membrane matrix as a novel non toxic and low cost modifier the pectin pt composite membranes were also prepared to elucidate the impact of the used pt functionalization method on the membrane structure and performance the functional groups surface and cross section morphology and physicochemical properties of the membranes were fully investigated the prepared composite membranes were used to measure pure water flux salts na2so4 and nacl rejection dye dr16 and cv retention cu2 cd2 and pb2 rejection fouling properties and

preparation of the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was synthesized by a three step process at first cl modification of pectin with thionyl chloride was carried out for this aim 1 g of pt was dissolved in a flask containing 50 ml of toluene by using stirring at room temperature one gram of thionyl chloride was added to the above mixed solution and stirred for 24 h at room temperature the cl modified pt was collected by centrifugation and washed with acetone and distilled water and then dried at 85 c for 2 h in the second step the 5 amino 1

with pyrazole compound for this purpose 1 g of cl modified pt was dispersed in 50 ml toluene under sonication for 30 min afterward 2 g of the synthesized pyrazole compound was added to the as prepared cl modified pt suspension and refluxed at 110 c for 24 h lastly the product was collected by filtering and washed with acetone and ethanol the prepared pcpt hybrid was dried in an oven at 80 c the chemical structure of the obtained pcpt hybrid is represented in fig 1 2 3 preparation of the composite nf membranes in this study the phase inversion technique was used for preparing the membranes pre determined amounts of modifiers pt or pcpt hybrid were added to dmac solvent and stirred for 12 h to disperse modifiers into the solvent then a pre determined amount of pes as a polymer and pvp as a pore former were added to the dmac pt or pcpt hybrid solution with vigorous mixing after 24 h magnet stirring at room temperature sonication was carried out for 30 min to eliminate gasses afterward each solution was cast on a smooth glass plate using a handmade film applicator with a casting knife of 150 μm gap size the obtained casting solution coated plate was immersed into a distilled water coagulation bath to induce the exchange between solvent dmac and nonsolvent water the prepared membranes were preserved in distilled water overnight to complete phase inversion and eliminate the remaining dmac solvent before use compositions of the casting solutions for the composite membranes are shown in table 1 2 4 characterization methods ftir spectra of pt pcpt hybrid and the prepared

mean difference between the highest points and the lowest pores and root mean square of y data respectively were identified using atomic force microscopy afm nanosurf mobiles the hydrophilicity of membranes was investigated by using the sessile drop technique at room temperature pictures were taken from the deionized water droplet 4 μl on at least eight random zones on the membrane surface and the average value was reported the overall porosity and pore size of the membranes were determined based on our previous studies 20 26 molecular weight cut off mwco for the prepared membranes was determined using the filtration of 200 mg l peg aqueous solutions at various molecular weights of 200 400 600 800 1000 1500 and 2000 g mol at a pressure of 0 4 mpa the concentration of peg was measured by the total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan mwco is defined as peg molecular weight at which the peg rejection is 90 the whole filtration experiments were carried out at a temperature of 25 c the pressure of 0 4 mpa and ph of 6 in a dead end filtration unit with an effective membrane area of 12 56 cm2 and volume capacity of 150 ml after compacting the testing membrane with deionized water at 0 6 mpa for 30 min the pure water flux pwf measurements were carried out for 60 min the following equation was used to calculate the pure water flux pw 1 l m2h 1 p w 1 m a m t where m is the permeate volume l am is the effective area of the testing membrane m2 and t is the permeation time h the separation performance of the membranes was investigated by the filtration of dyes cv and dr16 50 mg l heavy metal ions cd2 cu2 and pb2 10 mg l salt na2so4 and nacl 300 mg l solutions at the pressure of 0 4 mpa and ph of 6 the cv and dr16 with formula structure mw and maximum wavelength λmax table 2 were used as cationic and anionic testing dyes respectively the feed solution in the filtration cell was stirred at a speed of 200 rpm during the filtration at least three repeated experiments were performed for all filtration studies to calculate the average values the following equation was used to calculate the rejection rate r 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represent the concentration of solute dye salt heavy metal ion in permeate and feed solutions respectively in salt rejection experiments the conductivity meter was used to measure the concentrations of testing solutions and in the case of dye rejection experiments a biomate 5 uv visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific was used to measure the concentrations of testing solutions at the wavelengths of maximum absorbance of 590 and 526 nm for cv and dr16 respectively in order to study the stability of the pcpt composite membranes for long term filtration a continuous 144 h single solute filtration of na2so4 cd2 and dr16 solutions was carried out using the well performed membrane at the pressure of 0 4 mpa and ph of 6 the feed concentration of na2so4 cd2 and dr16 solution was 300 10 and 50 mg l respectively during the filtration process the antifouling behavior of the membrane is a crucial issue to be considered therefore the fouling experiments were performed with an aqueous milk powder solution 8000 mg l by a similar method reported previously during the fouling process the pure water flux pw 1 l m2h the milk solution flux pm l m2h and the water flux after

thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile pyrazole compound the surface morphology became smoother fig 2b xrd patterns of pt and pcpt are depicted in fig 2c the xrd spectra of both pt and pcpt showed a broad peak at 2θ equal to 20 with indicated their amorphous behavior 28 the spectrum of pcpt showed additional peaks near 2θ at 29 8 and 45 1 which could be the characteristic of 5 amino 1 phenyl 3 thiophen 2 yl 1h pyrazole 4 carbonitrile 25 by comparing the edx results for pt and pcpt hybrid fig 2d and e it was found that the edx analysis of pcpt indicated the presence of n and s atoms which further proves the successful functionalization of pt with the pyrazole compound as shown in fig 3 there are two intense peaks at 1068 and 3422 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of both pt and pcpt samples related to the stretching vibration of hydroxyl and skeletal ring of galacturonic sugar units 23 in addition the stretching vibration of cooch3 and coo groups can be seen at around 1627 cm 1 in both pt and pcpt samples 29 both samples present the band at 2924 cm 1 which is related to the asymmetric ch vibrations in ch ch2 and ch3 groups 29 in the ftir spectrum of pcpt hybrid the peak assigned to characteristic c s c and cn groups are visualized at 1033 and 2249 cm 1 respectively 30 in addition the peaks at 1450 and 1584 cm 1 are attributed to the cc of aromatic rings of pcpt structure 3 2 characterization of the prepared composite membranes as can be seen in fig 4a the main characteristic ftir bands for pes are as follows the band at 1107 cm 1 is related to the aromatic ring vibrations 31 bands at 1151 and 1320 cm 1 are due to the symmetric and asymmetric so2 groups the band at 1488 cm 1 is owned to the stretching mode of benzene ring 32 and the band at 1241 cm 1 is originated from aromatic ether stretching 33 as displayed in fig 4b different from the pt 0 membrane the pt 0 5 membrane showed the new peak at 1627 cm 1 originates from the spectrum of pt the additional peaks further confirm the incorporation of pt in the studied membrane at 2924 and 3422 cm 1 which are attributed to the stretching vibration of cn groups and of hydroxyl skeletal ring of galacturonic sugar units of pt respectively as shown in fig 4c compared to the pt 0 membrane the pcpt 0 5 membrane displays additional peaks at 1450 cc aromatic rings 1627 cooch3 and coo groups 2249 cn groups and 3422 cm 1 hydroxyl and skeletal ring of galacturonic sugar units of pt which confirm the incorporation of pcpt hybrid in the pcpt composite membranes in order to compare the chemical elements of pt 0 pt 0 5 and pcpt 0 5 membranes edx analysis was carried out table 3 and fig 5 as can be seen for pt 0 membrane the quantity of oxygen 30 67 wt and sulfur 0 17 wt was less than in pt 0 5 with 44 03 wt oxygen and 1 83 wt sulfur and pcpt 0 5 with 52 24 wt oxygen and 10 15 wt sulfur membranes which were due to the incorporation of modifiers pt or pcpt in casting solutions moreover the quantity of carbon was increased from 69 16 wt for pt 0 membrane to 53 14 and 35 07 wt by incorporating the 0 5 wt pt and pcpt respectively notably 2 54 wt nitrogen was detected in pcpt 0 5 membrane which further proves the presence of pcpt hybrid in pcpt 0 5 membrane a cross sectional fesem analysis was conducted in fig 6 to observe the morphology of the prepared composite membranes all membranes showed finger like pore structure and the surface was covered with a dense selective barrier comparison between the cross sectional fesem images of pt 0 and composite membranes pt 0 3 pt 0 5 pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 shows that the addition of used modifier pt or pcpt to casting solution does not change the fabrication mechanism of the pes membrane structure through phase inversion procedure increasing modifier loading in membrane matrix higher than 0 3 wt enlarged the finger like pores of a porous sublayer of the membranes this is probably caused by the prompt mass transfer among the solvent dmac and non solvent water during the non solvent phase inversion process as the loading of hydrophilic modifier pt or pcpt increases compared to the pt 0 membrane the water penetration from the coagulation bath to polymer layer is accelerated resulting in the formation of large finger like pores table 4 reports mean pore size mwco and porosity also fig 7 represents the mwco and pore size distribution of the prepared membranes as reported in the first column of table 4 increasing the loading of pt or pcpt in membrane matrix from 0 to 0 3 wt increased the mean pore size from 0 7 to 0 78 and 0 81 nm respectively an identical trend is observed for porosity as shown in the third column of table 4 in other words as the mean pore size of the membrane increases the porosity is increased too all composite membranes had higher porosity mean pore size and mwco than pt 0 membrane during phase inversion hydrophilic modifier migrates towards the membrane surface resulting in more instantaneous solvent and non solvent replacement and subsequently forming membrane with enlarged pore size 34 this phenomenon is responsible for the increment in mwco of membranes 35 however with increasing the modifier loading higher than 0 3 wt the mean pore size porosity and mwco decreased somewhat this is very likely due to the presence of modifier agglomerates and incrementing the casting solution viscosity that hinders the phase inversion process and subsequently forms lower size pores in the membrane structure 36 from the afm images of the prepared membranes fig 8 incorporation of the used modifiers in the membrane matrix significantly affected the surface roughness of the membranes particularly at 0 3 wt loading the lowest roughness values were observed the roughness parameters of the membranes consisting of the average difference between four the deepest pores and the highest points sy root mean square of y data sq and mean roughness sa were calculated using nanosurf c3000 version 3 10 0 and the related results are reported in table 5 based on the results the mitigation of roughness values was observed after the incorporation of modifier and the lowest values were obtained for pcpt 0 5 sa 4 36 nm sq 5 43 nm and sy 32 76 nm however addition on pt and pcpt loading higher than 0 3 wt increased the values among the composite membranes the highest values of sa 18 67 nm sq 23 67 nm and sy 169 43 nm were obtained for the pcpt 0 5 membrane this can be elucidated by observing the agglomeration of pcpt on the pcpt 0 5 membrane fig 6 since hydrophilicity has profound effects on membrane performance in terms of permeability and antifouling properties our next inquisitiveness was to study the water contact angle wca of the prepared composite membranes which is illustrative of their surface hydrophilicity as observed in fig 9a the wca of the pt 0 membrane decreased after the incorporation of the used modifier especially in the case of the pcpt hybrid furthermore the wca of the composite membranes decreased by incrementing the modifier loading up to 0 3 wt and the pcpt 0 3 membrane demonstrated the lowest wca of 50 2 it should be noted that compared to the pt the pcpt hybrid had a stronger effect on the hydrophilicity enhancement confirming the effectiveness of pt functionalization on membrane properties since the pcpt hybrid is hydrophilic owing to the hydrophilic functionalities such as nitrile hydroxyl c s c cooch3 and coo groups by incorporating the pcpt hybrid to the membrane structure the surface hydrophilicity enhanced following 37 in the case of c s c and cooch3 the presence of lone pair of electrons on s and n species caused negative partial charges on these atoms which induced the negative net charge on the surface of the pcpt hybrid as a result the presence of the pcpt hybrid on the surface of the pcpt composite membranes increased the density of negative charge on the surface of these membranes the increase in density of negative charge on the membrane enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane in other words during the phase inversion process the hydrophilic modifier tends to move towards the surface of polymeric film which decreases the interface energy at the top layer of the fabricated membranes hence the adsorption of water molecules by the hydrophilic modifier located on the membrane surface makes it wet resulting in higher hydrophilicity of the composite membrane however the wca of the composite membrane did not further decrease by increasing the pt or pcpt in membrane matrix higher than 0 3 wt which may be owing to the possible agglomeration of these modifiers in membrane structure the pwf from the comparison of the pt 0 membrane pt composite membranes pt 0 3 and pt 0 5 and pcpt composite membranes pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 is depicted in fig 9a the pwf of the membranes increased by incrementing the modifier loading up to 0 3 wt in the case of pcpt 0 3 membrane which demonstrated the most sufficing permeability the pwf was increased to 43 22 l m2h in general the permeability is mainly determined by surface hydrophilicity pore size structure and porosity of the composite membrane the high permeability of the pcpt 0 3 membrane was due to its highest surface hydrophilicity mean pore size and porosity the permeability decrement of the pcpt 0 5 membrane could be because of a decrease in hydrophilicity and porosity the surface charge of the prepared membranes as the most important parameter determining the solute rejection of nf membranes through electrostatic effects was studied in terms of zeta potential the related results are shown in fig 9b all composite membranes had negative zeta potential in the range of about 4 to 24 mv at a ph range of 4 10 the presence of sulfone groups of polymer pes and oc and cn groups of pore former pvp made the surface charge of the pt 0 membrane negative 38 the negative surface charge of pt 0 membrane was improved after incorporation of the used modifier up to 0 3 wt especially for pcpt the increasing the negatively charged functional groups of pt hydroxyl and carboxylic acid and pcpt hydroxyl carboxylic acid nitrile and aromatic ring partial negative charge embedded in the membrane structure was probably responsible for the negative surface charge increase in the composite membranes however by increasing the modifier loading from 0 3 to 0 5 wt a declining trend was observed for the pcpt composite membranes this can be probably due to the formation of pt or pcpt agglomerations on the membrane surface or within its pores that reduces the negative charge of the resulting membranes 39 40 3 3 solute rejection the effect of pt and pcpt loading on the performance of the resultant composite membranes was investigated involving a series of salts na2so4 and nacl dyes dr16 and cv and heavy metal ions cd2 cu2 and pb2 solutions thereinto the filtration for 300 mg l na2so4 and nacl solutions were carried out at 0 40 mpa and the results are depicted in fig 10 as shown with the increment of pt or pcpt loading 0 0 3 wt the permeate flux and rejection of the composite membranes for both salts concurrently increased in all membranes the rejection of na2so4 was higher than nacl this was in agreement with the salt rejection characteristic of the nf membranes with a negative charge 5 pcpt 0 3 membrane indicated the maximum salt rejection of 24 31 and 96 91 for nacl and na2so4 and the highest permeate fluxes of 38 82 and 40 32 l m2h for nacl and na2so4 solutions respectively as proved by zeta potential data in fig 9b the negative surface charge of the pcpt composite membranes were higher than the pt composite membranes and the highest negative surface charge was obtained for pcpt 0 3 indeed the presence of functional groups on pcpt caused more negative charges on the surface of the pcpt composite membranes which strengthened the electrostatic repulsive interactions donnan exclusion and inevitably hampered the transportations of inorganic ions 41 an always lower rejection of nacl 17 25 24 31 than for na2so4 78 90 96 91 was due to the weaker anion repulsive force 42 in other words in the case of the rejection in nf membrane with a negative surface charge the charge is greatly in control of the anion valence for instance the divalent anions such as so4 2 are more powerfully repelled by the membrane surface than monovalent anions such as cl as a result the cl containing salts exhibit lower rejections than so4 2 containing salts moreover the higher hydration radius of so4 2 3 79 å than cl 3 32 å could help the high rejection of so4 2 containing salt na2so4 through sieving effects 8 43 further study of the effect of used modifiers on the pt 0 3 pt 0 5 pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 membranes separation performance for 50 mg l dr16 and cv solutions was implemented from fig 11 both permeate flux of dye rejection increased with the appropriate pt and pcpt loading 0 3 wt for both of them the highest porosity and pore size in ptpc 0 3 membrane porosity and pore size were larger compared to pt 0 membrane see table 4 coupled with surface hydrophilicity increment see fig 9a could be the main reason for the increase in permeability of ptpc 0 3 membrane 44 the last factor surface hydrophilicity can also increase the removal of organic dyes as the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane increases the dissolution and penetration of water molecules than those of less polar organic molecules used dyes promotes resulting in higher rejection of dyes 31 all membranes exhibited higher rejection for dr16 than cv the higher dr16 rejection can be elucidated as follows firstly the mw of dr16 637 55 da is greater than the mwco of the prepared membranes 450 612 da see table 4 and fig 7a thus the rejection of the negatively charged dr16 is mainly determined by size sieving secondly the electrostatic repulsive forces of the negatively charged membranes pt 0 3 pt 0 5 pcpt 0 1 pcpt 0 3 and pcpt 0 5 on anionic dr16 dye can be the other reason for its higher rejection 45 the slight increase of negative surface charge resulting from the increase of pt and pcpt loading to 0 3 wt as shown in the zeta potential results in fig 9b also contributed to the enhancement of dr16 rejection by these membranes moreover for the studied cationic dye cv with mw of 407 99 da smaller mwco than that of the membranes the adsorption of dye molecules by the negatively charged membranes can be the main reason for high cv rejection it should be noted that the pcpt 0 3 had the highest permeate flux 40 20 and 40 10 l m2h for dr16 and cv solutions respectively and rejection for both dyes 99 82 and 98 24 for dr16 and cv respectively while when the loading of pcpt increased from 0 3 to 0 5 wt the rejection reduced slightly possibly owing to the mitigation in membrane negative charge 9 the capability of the prepared membranes in the rejection of cd2 cu2 and pb2 heavy metal ions was investigated at a feed concentration of 10 mg l pressure of 0 4 mpa ph of 6 and room temperature and the related results are demonstrated in fig 12 for all testing heavy metal ions the rejection was respectively increased and declined by enhancing the modifier loading from 0 to 0 3 wt to 0 3 0 5 wt it was shown that for all three heavy metal ions the maximum rejection was relevant to pcpt 0 3 the remarkable improvement of heavy metal ion removal by the composite membrane in comparison to the bare one could be elucidated in the following 1 by incorporating the pcpt hybrid into the membrane structure the chelate complex is formed between the heavy metal ions and hydroxyl or the lone pair electron of n atoms of pcpt hybrid on the surface of the pcpt composite membranes hence the heavy metal ions will be chelated and removed regarding the pt composite membranes the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl functional groups of pt located on the membrane surface can chelate the heavy metal ions and cause removal 2 for all prepared membranes the rejection values were higher for cd2 ions than pb2 and cu2 ions this can be ascribed to the higher hydration radius of cd2 0 426 nm than cu2 0 419 nm and pb2 0 401 nm hence the heavy metal removal by the prepared composite membranes is affected by the membrane pore size 43 however according to the data in fig 12 the composite membrane with a larger pore size indicated higher heavy metal ion removal hence it can be inferred that the adsorption should be the main reason for the metal ion rejection and the highest porosity of pcpt 0 5 contributed to the highest rejection for metal ions 20 moreover when the pt and pcpt loading increased to 0 5 wt a small decrement in removal was observed which could be due to the possible agglomeration of these modifiers 3 4 long term filtration in order to study the stability of the pcpt composite membranes for long term filtration a continuous 144 h single solute filtration of na2so4 cd2 and dr16 solutions was carried out using the well performed membrane pcpt 0 3 regarding na2so4 the rejection and permeate flux remained almost unchanged which confirmed that the electrostatic exclusion of the pcpt 0 3 was stable in long term use for cd2 the permeate flux remained virtually unchanged 43 11 l m2h the rejection of cd2 was almost stable in the range of 98 30 and 98 63 and did not indicate a considerable reduction over 144 h of filtration demonstrating good interactions of the adsorptive functional groups of the pcpt hybrid on the membrane surface with cd2 for dr16 the rejction was almost constant while the permeate flux slightly decreased from 40 2 to 36 l m2h the observed reduction in dye solution permeate flux could be related to concentration polarization caused by the accumulation of dye molecules on the membrane surface the related results proved that the pcpt composite membrane was stable during the long term use in water this could be ascribed to h bond or strong adsorption interaction force between the pcpt hybrid and the polymer pes 3 5 antifouling properties fig 13a presents the calculated frr for the membranes in this test after the filtration of aqueous milk solution the membrane was submerged in distilled water for about 20 min to remove the reversibly adsorbed foulants from fig 14a all the prepared composite membranes had more frr than the pt 0 membrane which confirms the superior effect of used modifiers pt or pcpt hybrid on antifouling behavior for instance the frr value for pt 0 was 34 00 while its value increased to 71 23 and 86 12 for 0 1 wt pt and 0 1 wt pcpt composite membranes respectively the highest frr value 94 50 was achieved for 0 3 wt pcpt composite membrane pcpt 0 3 membrane pcpt 0 5 membrane showed a decrement owing to the pcpt agglomerations which could lessen the beneficial effect of this modifier 46 the resistance of the membranes to foulant deposition is one of the important matters to be considered hence three types of resistance including rir rr and rt sum of rir and rr were studied fig 13b shows that the pt 0 had the highest irreversibility 66 0 while the pcpt 0 3 had the lowest irreversibility 5 5 the total resistance of the membranes was decreased by the addition of 0 3 wt pt and 0 3 wt pcpt and increased by the addition of 0 5 wt pt and 0 5 wt pcpt in general the membrane with high surface hydrophilicity faces lower adsorption of the foulants on the other hand water molecules can be easily adsorbed on the hydrophilic surface this phenomenon develops a layer of water molecules on the membrane surface that hinders the adsorption of foulants via increasing the reversible foulant adsorption the reversible fouling is ameliorated using simple washing however the stuck of foulants in membrane pores or their adsorption on the membrane surface can cause irreversible fouling the results obtained suggest that the pcpt hybrid was more efficient than pt in ameliorating the antifouling behavior of the membrane this was probably due to the greater influence of pcpt on hydrophilicity charge and roughness of the membrane 4 conclusions in the present study for the first time the pyrazole compound pectin pcpt hybrid was synthesized and used as a modifier to fabricate a new pes nf membrane with high separation efficiency towards salts dyes and heavy metal ions sem xrd ftir and edx characterizations confirmed the successful synthesis of the pcpt hybrid the authenticity and trustability of the physical and chemical properties of the fabricated membranes were successfully demonstrated by edx sem ftir zeta potential and afm the related results showed that by incrementing the loading of pcpt hybrid from 0 to 0 3 wt in the membrane structure the mean pore size porosity zeta potential and pure water flux increased while the average surface roughness and water contact angle decreased the effect of pt and pcpt loading on the performance of the composite membranes was investigated by salts dyes and heavy metal ions solutions pcpt 0 3 membrane showed the maximum salt rejection of 24 31 and 96 91 for nacl and na2so4 and the highest permeate fluxes of 38 82 and 40 32 l m2h for nacl and na2so4 solutions respectively it also had the highest permeate flux and rejection for both used dyes dr16 and cv for all testing heavy metal ions pb2 cu2 and cd2 the rejection was respectively increased and declined by enhancing the modifier loading from 0 to 0 3 wt to 0 3 0 5 wt it was shown that for all three heavy metal ions the maximum rejection was relevant to pcpt 0 3 furthermore pcpt composite membranes showed more permeation flux and remarkable antifouling properties than pt 0 membrane as a whole the prepared pcpt composite membrane in this study is shown to be a
