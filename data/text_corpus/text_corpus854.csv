4270,green infrastructure gi location planning involves multi objective spatial analysis considering simultaneous benefits fast optimization results are often required e g collaborative modeling exercises and stakeholder involvement workshops while the simulation optimization approach is impractical for these cases if it relies on time consuming simulations of complex drainage system models this paper proposes a new method using a surrogated model based upon targeted executions of a more complex urban drainage model this method uses a piece wise linear interpolation to predict the hydrological impact of individual impervious to pervious area changes and the mixed integer linear optimization to find the optimal location of gi practices we applied the methodology to the capital city of colombia bogotá with the objectives of reducing runoff combined sewer overflows csos and separate sanitary overflows ssos two multi objective optimization approaches i e a lexicographic and a weighted sum model were explored showing the high efficiency of this approach in building pareto fronts and rapidly suggesting alternative solutions for different budgets it was found that by implementing gis on one third of the city s gi feasible public areas 2 2 of city area under a 10 year 6 h rainfall event the total reduction on runoff cso and sso are 0 9 1 8 and 2 4 respectively these results show the importance of promoting gi among private land owners especially in cities with land predominantly private owned this new approach is particularly useful for applications under data scarcity and high uncertainty scenarios keywords green infrastructure mixed integer linear programming optimization piece wise interpolation spatial location urban drainage 1 introduction green infrastructure gi is an environmental friendly approach to stormwater management using a combination of natural hydrologic features such as green roofs bioswales rain gardens etc in addition to storing and redirecting urban runoff gi also provides multiple social and aesthetic benefits fletcher et al 2015 from a hydrologic perspective effective location planning of gi at the city scale must consider the types of gi features and the interactions between multiple urban subcatchments as affected by local soil infiltration rates groundwater interactions and connectivity of the sewer network brown 2005 di and ahiablame 2015 the placement of gi features can be guided by decision support tools that combine an urban drainage model udm with an optimization procedure typically a metaheuristic such as an evolutionary algorithm or simulated annealing lee et al 2012 macro et al 2018 raei et al 2019 ghodsi et al 2020 saldarriaga et al 2020 the udm component is important because it quantifies the hydrologic impact of the gi with a high degree of accuracy however udm simulations often require considerable computation which may reduce the effectiveness of the optimization process by limiting the gi candidate designs that can be evaluated against specified objectives for example when the udm includes a coupled runoff pipe network model with a substantial degree of spatial resolution the resulting simulation optimization problem could require several days or even weeks of run time wang et al 2019 zhang and chui 2018 shojaeizadeh et al 2021 the burden of simulating gi systems is intensified for multi objective applications that require for example the involvement of stakeholders during multiple stages of the process jones et al 2020 young et al 2014 the evaluation of social and nonhydrologic environmental benefits of gi and or consider multiple baseline and extreme weather conditions for applications that involve a computationally demanding udm and multiple project objectives the computational burden can be reduced by 1 employing a simplified udm and or 2 replacing the udm with classical optimization techniques such as linear integer and dynamic programming mays and bedient 1982 sample et al 2001 limbrunner et al 2013 sebti et al 2015 torres et al 2020 the former approach is usually performed by reducing the spatial temporal resolution e g using a larger or dynamic simulation time step and or employing simpler hydrologic hydraulic process models e g statistical rather than mechanistic while the latter models directly the dynamics of the systems as components of comprehensive mathematical formulations that are then solved using commercial optimization software sadler et al 2019 moreover mathematical formulations are highly flexible can be easily parameterized and the solutions produced are proven optimal under the assumptions of such models a key advantage of these approaches is that they can often be solved significantly faster than a udm simulation the downside however is their limited accuracy when compared to the udm simulations as they can only capture a simplified version of the complex hydrological dynamics of the system limbrunner et al 2013 as a result selecting the appropriate approach for gi planning comes with a critical trade off between the desired precision and the speed and flexibility this paper presents a new approach for optimal location planning of gi that combines two components first the build up of piece wise linear response curves that capture and estimate the hydrological benefits of gi features in a runoff sewer system embedding the role of the udm in our optimization problem and second the guidance of the optimization search by means of integer programming instead of metaheuristics although the former still requires a handful of udm runs to train the linear functions the resulting framework significantly reduces the computational burden of simulation optimization which provides the flexibility needed to explore a range of multi objective planning scenarios that could evolve with ongoing stakeholder input besides this approach can be used in tandem with the metaheuristics as our model can be used to efficiently generate starting solutions that guide them to explore high quality regions of the solution space the proposed hybrid approach was applied to a real world case study using the distributed udm for the large and highly urbanized city of bogotá colombia the methodology was illustrated by optimizing for three distinct objective functions reflective of planning priorities to reduce 1 total runoff volume 2 volume of combined sewer overflows csos and 3 volume of separate sewer overflows sso other noteworthy features of the case study include the use of satellite imagery to identify candidate green space for gi features and preliminary feasibility analyses to identify the available area for gi in each subcatchment this computational approach generated individual solutions to the gi design problem in the order of minutes which facilitates its use in collaborative decision making processes that require repeated updates to the project objectives the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the development of the hydrological benefit curves as a substitute for a more complicated udm and details the construction and formal definition of the above mentioned integer program section 3 presents the case study and bogotá s udm section 4 summarizes and analyzes the results of this paper s methodological proposal finally section 5 summarizes and discusses the findings and outlines some opportunities for future research 2 methodology the methodology is divided into the two stages depicted in fig 1 in the first stage spatial data operations to identify feasible areas for gi are performed in doing so hydrological benefits curves related to the installation of gi are built through the evaluation execution of multiple gi configurations on the udm torres et al 2019 in the second stage the previously constructed hydrological benefits curves are used to define and construct the mathematical representation of physical and requirement constraints and the objective function the execution of stage 2 results in an optimal gi location in this stage the optimal result can be iterated through the re definition of the objective function this loop has the added value of easily adding other criteria besides the hydrological benefits and rapidly determining alternative solutions hydrological impact while avoiding re running the udm stage 1 starts with a feasibility analysis using spatial data data transformations are performed to unify the available information under a standard format as suggested by jato espino et al 2016 transforming available data into the raster format allows straightforward calculations with map algebra to determine feasibility the spatial resolution and data accuracy determine how strict the feasibility thresholds are to be set for example suppose the water table information is extracted from a surface interpolated from scarce sample points in that case the threshold should be flexible enough to account for uncertainties derived from the interpolation procedure or if the type of soil is reported in large polygons it is recommended to transform to rasters using a mesh of a resolution coherent with the other data sets any geographical information system gis can be used in this stage through spatial analysis tools such as raster calculations intersections or proximity analysis e g ariza et al 2019 jato espino et al 2016 torres et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 2 the udm is then used to quantify the hydrological performance of implementing gi in feasible areas modeled as a change from impervious to pervious surfaces imperviousness is a dominant factor in the observed alterations of surface and subsurface flows in urbanized watersheds arnold and gibbons 1996 epps and hathaway 2019 using impervious to pervious areal changes to model gi impact is appropriate since it targets the spatial distribution of gi at large scales i e city subcatchments lim and welty 2017 and not in the differential performance of gi types additionally it is a widely adopted measure for gi planning purposes both by practitioners and academics and because it is a measurable and straightforward concept it is convenient to explain to stakeholders the idea of evaluating the impact in runoff volumes by gradually changing the effective impervious area was tested by palla and gnecco 2015 who proved its usage is key under data scarcity and high uncertainty scenarios the feasible areas are spatially overlapped with the udm spatial units e g catchment land parcel or modeling cell to create an upper bound of available area per spatial unit for potential gi installation to build the hydrological response curves a set of gi implementation areas are modeled using the udm for each spatial unit such a set can be defined as percentages of the available area for potential gi installation or simply as particular values of interest fig 2 illustrates a semi distributed udm with catchments as spatial units a b c and d represent the four catchments in the system while the double gray lines are the drainage connections for each catchment the set of gi areas are tested independently in the udm in other words the total number of udm executions are number of subcatchments number of gi areas the gi areas and their corresponding hydrological benefit extracted from the udm are herein called sampling pairs these sampling pairs of each spatial unit catchments in fig 2 are then used to build a hydrological benefit curve using a piece wise linear approximation which converts the response curve into a more manageable format and enables the use of gradient based optimization this approach is built upon the assumption that the individual hydrological contributions are modular in the sense that the global impact is the sum of the individual areas contributions this assumption is reasonable considering that 1 the average distance among scattered gis at a city scale is sufficient to disregard interactions in the order of kilometers and 2 the available and feasible areas for gi are small and scattered compared with the total area of an urban center making gi flow interconnections very unlikely in the example shown in fig 2 10 runs each corresponding to a gi implementation area are used to describe the spatial unit s hydrological benefit curve the illustration shows two broadly accepted measures of large scale gi performance i e runoff and cso volume montalto et al 2007 tavakol davani et al 2016 li et al 2019 nonetheless any other response measure extracted from the udm can be used instead e g hydrologic response footprint hrf or peak runoff reduction the setup of the udm runs e g continuous or event based simulation time steps must consider a model execution for each sampling pair the udm setup is case study based and will depend on the udm capabilities the execution time and desired accuracy a set of indices that convert dynamic outputs e g event runoff volume cso discharge into a standard index format is used to build normalized response curves the indices correspond to the marginal hydrological benefits by a change in imperviousness on a spatial unit of the udm 2 1 urban drainage model outputs the indices q are defined as the ratio of the udm output series area under the curve e g total runoff and cso volume in our example with and without gi see eq 1 eq 1 describes how the indices are calculated where the sub index u denotes the subcatchment and a represents the gi implementation area the function f t is the output series in the original condition while f u a t is the output series when a gi implementation area a is considered in subcatchment u by design the indices q range from 0 to 1 where 0 implies that there is no change from the original condition thus larger values are desired the behavior of the index for increasing gi implementation area is expected to be non decreasing and concave and is assumed to be linear among areas within the set of intervals r such behavior is expected because for the same spatial unit a larger pervious area is anticipated to achieve at least the same reduction of say the runoff or cso as a smaller area does 1 q u a f t dt f u a t dt f t dt 2 2 piece wise linear approximation and optimization model one common way to reduce the complexity of a function for optimization purposes is to use piece wise polynomials eriksson et al 2004 the idea consists in approximating a function g x on an interval a b using linear polynomials on n divisions bounded by intervals a i b i where i n this logic is used to build the piece wise linear interpolations a piece wise linear interpolation is used to simplify each udm spatial unit response curve this transformation of the solution space enables the use of exact optimization search algorithms fig 3 illustrates the piece wise linear interpolation using three indices a non decreasing trend is expected for every index with the particularity of decreasing slopes for increasing pervious areas this is the marginal hydrological benefit for a unitary increase of gi area is expected to decrease for larger areas previous local and regional studies report diminishing runoff control gi efficiencies for larger rainfall events and gi design volume capacity exceeding the rainfall event volume ahiablame et al 2012 ghodsi et al 2020 li et al 2021 fig 3 illustrates n 6 sampling pairs for each of the indices in subcatchment u and considering 5 ranges r each area range is bounded by lower κ and upper ϕ limits any concave response curve can be built using the piece wise linear approximation the number of sample points required per spatial unit depends on the curve s degree of nonlinearity the more linear the curve the fewer point samples required the latter has to be tested by inspecting a couple of subcatchments hydrological response curves exhaustively running the udm for many impervious to pervious areas additionally the time availability and the needed accuracy are factors to consider when defining the number of model executions 2 2 1 problem formulation the problem is defined over a set u of n spatial units e g subcatchments considering a set of indices i the available area for potential gi installation α u for each subcatchment u u and the budgetary total gi area β to install and to distribute among the spatial units are known each of the indices in the set i are described by piece wise linear concave functions to describe these functions a set of lines one for each catchment u u index i i and range r r are used and defined through μ ur i and θ ur i the slope and intercept respectively the κ ur and ϕ ur are the lower and upper limits of the area range r r respectively for each subcatchment u u and area range r r y ur is a variable that takes the value of 1 if the pervious area to be installed in subcatchment u is in the area range r and 0 otherwise x ur is a variable that represents the value of area of gi to be installed in the subcatchment u in the area range r for subcatchment u u w u a variable that computes the total pervious area to be installed in u while q u i is a variable that stores the value of the index i i finally z i is an auxiliary variable that stores the sum on u u of q u i for each index i i a summary of this notation is available in appendix a 2 2 2 objective functions the objective is to maximize the sum of the index values eq 2 two commonly used optimization functions were selected to deal with multiple objectives the weighted sum approach ehrgott 2005 and the lexicographic multi objective or constraints method ehrgott 2005 waltz 1967 marler and arora 2004 the first consists of aggregating the multiple objectives into a single objective function by introducing a normalization weight for each objective the latter uses a lexicographic order i e a given ranking of the objective functions based on their importance the lexicographic approach optimizes the model sequentially following this predefined order each time for a new objective function to guarantee the quality of the solution with respect to the previous objectives the method introduces additional constraints that limit the detriment of the previous objectives to be at most a predefined value φ 2 max z i 2 2 3 constraints eq 3 represents the set of constraints that guarantee that the installed pervious area in each subcatchment does not exceed the available area for potential installation while eq 4 constitutes the set of constraints that compute the total pervious area assigned to each subcatchment 3 w u α u u u 4 w u r r x ur u u eqs 5 7 are the constraints that linearize the indices eq 5 defines the upper and lower limits of each range r r and subcatchment u u while eq 6 guarantees that the selected impervious to pervious area of subcatchment u u belongs to only one of the area ranges r r eq 7 computes the value of index i i and subcatchment u u using the piece wise linear interpolation approach that is using the slopes μ ur and intercept θ ur i for area range r r 5 κ ur y ur x ur ϕ ur y ur u u r r 6 r r y ur

indices is not greater than 1 8 u u w u β 9 z i u u q u i i i 10 z i 1 i i finally eqs 11 15 represent the constraints of decision variables nature 11 z i 0 i i 12 w u 0 u u 13 q u i 0 u u i i 14 x ur

the precipitation pattern is bimodal with rainy seasons in april june and september november anselm et al 2020 total annual rainfall ranges from 500 to 1 200 mm ideam 2019 fig 4 a illustrates the total rainfall depth for a 10 year return period and 6 h duration event this rainfall event was selected for bogotá since its magnitude produces flooding in critical areas of the city ciia 2015 and because it allows accounting for the spatial variability of rainfall the largest rainfall depth occurs in the northeast area of the city adjacent to the eastern andean mountains bogotá s drainage system is divided in four main catchments each draining from east to west fig 4b shows the tributary rivers torca salitre fucha and tunjuelo which discharge into the main stream of the city the bogotá river the constructed drainage system contains 2 000 km of storm pipes and 6 600 km of combined sewer pipes torres et al 2017 fontecha et al 2021 the combined sewer system corresponds to the oldest part of the city located in the central east area while the separated system spreads across the urban area i e fontecha et al 2016 see fig 4c bogotá is under a variety of environmental stress factors due to the unregulated growth and mismanagement of resources rodríguez et al 2008 ramírez et al 2013 of extreme relevance is the frequent occurrence of pluvial flooding events castaneda 1989 romero lankao et al 2014 during wet weather wastewater and cso discharges frequently occur as a result of the lacking capacity of the sewer system and the wastewater treatment plant additionally the system has a high number of wrong connections estimated between 22 and 99 and a high infiltration flow into the sewer system estimated to be 50 of the mean wastewater flow rodríguez et al 2008 for these reasons the pluvial drainage system s untreated discharges from now on referred to as separate sewer overflows ssos are also a source of pollution and are of environmental concern to summarize the objectives according to bogotá s priorities are to maximize the sum of the reduction indexes refer to 2 2 2 runoff volume z run cso volume z cso and sso volume z sso although governmental city agencies agree on the need to implement gi as a complementary solution to reduce the effects of urbanization on runoff this implementation has been slow e g gi design legislation was issued very recently in 2018 among the reasons that explain this implementation delay are i the financial support and the institutional coordination which leaves unclear the roles and responsibilities of each governmental agency ciia 2015 ii the scarcity of local information on costs and efficiencies of gi structures ciia 2015 and iii the lack of city wide studies or tools that quantify the effect of these implementations and prioritize areas of the city to date the only prioritization effort for gi placement at the level of the city was performed using secondary information ariza et al 2019 unfortunately these analyses do not include modeling or quantification of gi hydrological benefits similar to many other municipalities approaches gi implementation in bogotá began in public areas in the city about 80 of the land is private martinez 2017 drastically limiting the area that is both public and feasible for gi to identify the land parcels that fulfill both requirements this study counted on the spatial information a 1 meter resolution dem a 2 meter lidar a 50 meter infiltration rate raster a 230 meter groundwater table raster and city wide buildings and public areas e g sidewalks parks plazas polygon layers ciia 2015 as suggested by ariza et al 2019 the slope groundwater table soil infiltration rate and distance to buildings were considered to determine viable lots for gi installation 3 2 bogotá s urban drainage model bogota s udm is built in citydrain ii rodríguez et al 2009 an open source toolbox constructed and hosted in matlab simulink environment achleitner et al 2007 citydrain ii models the rainfall runoff process by coupling the catchment loss model with a simplified muskingum routing method achleitner et al 2007 the model is a semi distributed model that uses subcatchments as spatial units in total the model counts on 469 subcatchments 106 combined 274 separated and 89 undeveloped which do not count on drainage sewer system 11 natural wetlands and 13 pumping stations dry weather measurements were used to calibrate the model since unfortunately rainfall runoff data scarcity at the city scale prevented wet weather calibration the model was carefully parameterized to guarantee the system s best possible representation including the attentive selection of muskingum parameters 3 3 catchment loss model parameters estimation the inputs for the udm s catchment loss model are the runoff coefficient initial losses and permanent losses three parameters that depend on the imperviousness of the subcatchment because a high resolution land use classification is not available for bogotá city and because the publicly available land use classification e g the us geological survey s global land cover characterization is unsuitable for highly urbanized areas the near difference vegetation index ndvi was used as a proxy to imperviousness from a high resolution commercial image pervious impervious areas were categorized using a 4 bands multispectral image from planet imagery planet 2019 3 5 and 0 72 meter resolution using the ndvi approach the ndvi is defined in eq 16 in which a nir and a vis correspond to the near infrared and the red visible spectrum respectively carlson and ripley 1997 this calculation can be carried out using built in tools of any commercial gis or remote sensing software e g qgis arcgis snap envi or can be easily programmed using raster algebraic operations 16 ndvi a nir a vis a nir a vis ndvi values range between 1 and 1 higher reflectance on the nir band corresponds to denser and healthier green vegetation a higher ndvi indicates a larger fraction of vegetation in a pixel yuan and bauer 2007 hence a value closer to 1 indicates a higher proportion of pervious impervious areas since the ndvi values vary among case studies a threshold value to determine the pervious impervious area proportion must be established by subjective judgment it is suggested to turn on and off the ndvi raster layer the image true color and false color combinations and a server high resolution imagery layer e g esri 2021 to determine a threshold value that better captures the vegetation without overestimating the pervious area once the threshold values are established the ndvi raster layer is reclassified to reflect the original state spatial distribution of impervious pixels an illustrative example of this procedure is provided in appendix b while appendix c illustrates the comparison of two ndvi threshold values the hydrological benefit curves are built by modeling different gi implementation areas in the udm via modification of the catchment loss model parameters the runoff coefficient and the initial losses parameters are calculated by assigning differentiated values to the two types of areas 0 9 pervious and 0 2 impervious for runoff coefficients and 0 28 mm pervious and 0 07 mm impervious for initial losses permanent losses are determined using kidd lowring 1997 formula d k 1 s where d is the depression storage in millimeters s is the slope and k 1 is a coefficient that depends on whether the area is pervious or impervious kidd and lowring 1979 fig 5 summarizes the methodology stages for the case study including the estimation of the impervious area from the satellite image and the 10 yr 6 h rainfall used as input to the udm the feasible gi implementation area third input to the city drain ii in fig 5 specifies the sub catchments total public land potentially used for gi siting the parameters for the catchment loss model first input to the city drain ii in fig 5 are modified to reflect the set of gi areas to be executed in the udm i e the sampling pairs 4 results 4 1 stage 1 results parameterization of the optimization model planet satellite images were obtained for the first of january 2019 this month is historically known for low precipitation and cloudiness which permitted a high quality satellite image with minimum cloud removal requirement the products were processed in r using the maptools and raster packages after calculating the ndvi for the 4 meters raster a threshold value of 0 35 was selected see appendix c for a comparison of ndvi thresholds fig 6 shows the mean weighted ndvi and runoff coefficients per subcatchment when assigning a coefficient of 0 2 to permeable and 0 9 to impermeable areas the peripheries of the city have the highest ndvi values and lowest runoff coefficients shown in green while the most urbanized areas are concentrated in the south east of the city shown in red it was found that about 85 of bogotá s urban subcatchments have coefficients higher than 0 7 results coherent to escobedo et al 2018 and calderón et al 2019 findings the right side of fig 6 shows a comparison of google earth high resolution imagery 0 1 m and the ndvi extracted from planet imagery 4 m as can be observed the ndvi can distinguish green areas from pervious urban elements such as roads and roofs the yellow color indicates a combination of both types of surfaces the yellow vertical stripe among the red vertical areas is in fact partially covered by sidewalk and grass in total the city has 32 6 km 2 7 2 of the city s total area available for gi sitting on public spaces including sidewalks parks plazas and road dividers the hydrological response curves were built by simulating impervious to pervious changes up to 30 of the available area for potential gi installation in each subcatchment considering that gi competes for the urban space with many other public services e g roads bicycle parking racks gardens etc a conservative maximum implementation area of one third of gi potential area was selected for each subcatchment using an event of 6 hours duration and 10 years return period the runoff cso and sso time series were extracted and eq 1 was used to convert the dynamic series into indices the number of sample pairs required to build the response curve for each subcatchment is determined by evaluating the deviation from linearity results show that for this particular case of study and udm the behavior of the three indices as a function of an increasing change of pervious to impervious area is almost linear as evidenced by high r 2 no lower than 0 9 in all the tested subcatchments this behavior is attributed to the simplified underlying equations of the catchment loss model linear water balance equations considering the close to linear behavior of the gi hydrological benefits curve and that each udm run takes around 20 min to complete it was decided to perform 5 runs 5 sampling pairs per subcatchment this results in a total of 2 345 model executions 5 sampling points 469 subcatchments the runs were performed in a dell optiplex 7060 equipped with an intel r core tm i7 3 4 ghz processor 32 gb of ram and running windows 10 by making parallel udm executions the total computational time was reduced from 781 h 32 days to 111 h 4 days resulting runoff indices z run in eq 9 varied from 0 0001 to 0 25 higher values indicate a larger reduction of the runoff volume of the city expressed as a ratio to the original condition the upper right corner of fig 7 shows the linear behavior of 5 subcatchments a b c d and e whose index values ranges from 0 04 to 0 76 for each subcatchment the runoff index behavior is non decreasing with similar slopes for different gi areas differences do not surpass the 0 001 the gi area availability is determined by the feasibility analysis and hence the subcatchments have different capacities for accommodating gi different ranges of x axis in fig 7 for illustration purposes and since the variability among the slopes of the same subcatchment is negligible a unique slope was calculated using the first and last index sample points the spatial distribution of the index slope and its frequency are illustrated in fig 7 the north east area of the city consistently presents higher index values compared to the south west areas the index spatial distribution shows the precipitation strong influence in the runoff index refer to fig 4 similar maps and data analysis were developed for cso and sso index and are shown in appendix d 4 2 stage 2 results optimization the previous analyses were used to calculate the parameters of the optimization model the approach was implemented in python language and solved with the commercial optimizer gurobi 7 0 2 optimization 2017 once all the sampling points and curves were obtained which took 4 days to complete the optimization model experiments were solved in seconds the next subsections provide keys insights obtained from experimenting with i uni objective optimization for each of the indices runoff sso and cso ii varying objectives order with a lexicographic multi objective model and iii using a weighted sum multi objective approach 4 2 1 optimization for individual objectives fig 8 illustrates results of maximizing the three indices separately for a set of budgets that range from 10 0 32 km 2 to 100 32 km 2 of the total public area for gi in blue z run is the index of runoff volume reduction while sso and cso volume reduction corresponds to z cso and z sso in yellow and gray respectively index values vary from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no change in volume and 1 indicates complete volume reduction see eq 1 sso and cso indices values are one order of magnitude larger than the runoff index indicating that relative to the original condition the impact of implementing a unit area of gi say 1 km 2 is larger for cso and sso than for runoff volumes fig 8 shows a non decreasing runoff index z run this was expected given that the pervious area and the runoff volume generated are inversely proportional cso and sso z cso and z sso exhibit a concave line indicating there is a point in which a change from pervious to impervious area does no longer reduce the observed overflow this behavior could be explained by the spatially differential drainage capacity of the sewer system in some areas of the city the gi could reduce the excess volume and eliminate local csos or ssos completely hence additional gi will not be reflected as volume reductions in the outfall in other more critical areas of the city with no space for gi e g dense unplanned neighborhoods with limited sewer system capacity the installation of more gi areas in other sub catchments will not show outfall volume reductions in such cases conventional measures to cso abatement such as in line storage systems and cso tanks brombach 2002 montalto et al 2007 are required to expand the sewer system capacity and reduce the overflow volume increasing the sewer capacity is an effective measure to reduce cso rathnayake and anwar 2019 still it has the drawbacks of a heavy financial burden e g nasri and haynes 2015 and the lack of co benefits e g social and environmental 4 2 2 lexicographic multi objective optimization a previous work in bogotá city carried out a soft systems methodology ssm to identify the different perspectives of involved actors ariza et al 2019 i e water utility environmental authority urban development institute etc this exercise resulted in similar scores for the three objectives but suggested giving priority to runoff volume in the first place and cso volume in the second place following this suggestion the lexicographic model was implemented using the order runoff reduction z run cso reduction z cso and sso reduction z sso with an allotted detriment φ of 5 fig 9 illustrates the resulting selected subcatchments using varying budgets up to 30 of the total available area for gi sitting in the public space fig 9 evidences that increasing the budget does not necessarily result in consistently selecting the catchments with higher performance particularly according to fig 7 the subcatchments located in the north east zone of the city provide a higher reduction of runoff for a unitary increase in gi area this lack of a clear pattern indicates i that the prioritization of subcatchments is not trivial and can not be solved using a mere ranking of the best performing subcatchments and ii the existence of alternative optima to provide a better understanding of the three objectives interaction fig 10 illustrates the 6 possible combinations of the objective function orders here runoff volume z run uses the secondary right axis while cso z cso and sso z sso are graphed in the primary axis cso z cso and runoff z run indices exhibit a similar behavior notwithstanding the order of the lexicographic model while sso z sso index deviate from this pattern whenever sso index z sso is the first objective the other two objective functions are dominated they reach considerable lower values than in other configurations on the contrary when cso index z cso goes in the third position it reaches the lowest values near the inflection points in runoff z run fig 11 illustrates the gap between the optimal values for each order combination and the optimal value obtained by optimizing each objective independently the best possible outcome for each objective function the first objective function of the six graphs is close to 0 since up to the first stage this sole objective function is considered and the gap is negligible here it is confirmed that the behavior of runoff index z run and cso index z cso are close and that whenever sso index z sso is in the first or second place the other two objective functions gaps increase considerably 4 2 3 weighted sum multi objective optimization based on the previously evidenced relations among the objective functions the implementation of a weighted sum approach ehrgott 2005 is explored here a larger weight is typically given to the objectives of greater importance however since in subsection 4 2 2 it was found that two of the three objectives behave similarly it is proposed to give equal weight to the sum of runoff and cso index the terms z run z cso and sso index z sso see eq 17 17 max δ z run z cso 2 1 δ z sso to identify several optimal non dominated solutions in the form of a pareto frontier for different subcatchments selection the proposed formulation was solved by varying the value of δ fig 12 shows the non dominated solutions for the two budgets of interest 4 9 km 2 and 24 4 km 2 refer to the inflection points in fig 8 x axis and y axis are normalized to reflect how far the solution obtained with a particular value of δ is from the dual bound i e the best possible solution if only this objective is considered this is the closer to 1 the better for that particular objective the pareto frontiers have different shapes depending on the budget selected a large budget allows the selection of larger areas that will be changed from impervious to pervious hence reaching values closer to the dual bound closer to 1 for both graphs the suggested solution i e the closest to the dual bound in both axis z run z cso 2 and z sso is in the upper right corner however this is just a suggestion since all points in the pareto frontier are guaranteed to be optimal each solution offers a different configuration from which the decision maker can select according to their criteria examples are preferences for certain subcatchments that will provide side benefits or economic financial advantages not considered in the optimization exercise the decision of which optimal solution is selected from the pareto front relies heavily on the variable values in each solution specifically on the xs and ys variables which define the selected subcatchment and the installation area for gi the budget used to define the pareto frontier clearly affects its shape a larger budget provides values closer to the dual bound in the two axes hence values closer to 1 dominate fig 12 b resulting in straight lines parallel to the axis and a sharp corner in fig 12 a the shape is smooth evidencing how an improvement in one objective decreases the performance in the second for example when moving in the x axis from left to right after 0 6 any improvement in z run z cso 2 creates a detriment in z sso finally for the maximum budget 32 km 2 the pareto frontier is represented by only three points 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 since for this budget all the objective functions z run z cso 2 and z sso have already reached their dual bound 4 3 measuring the quality of the proposed interpolation the results obtained by the proposed piece wise linear interpolation were compared with the umd simulation showing that this model is able to produce solutions that estimate the actual performance of the system quite accurately first the optimal solutions for budgets between 0 and 10 km 2 were simulated in the udm recall that each udm execution takes around 20 min the results runoff cso and sso volumes of these simulations were compared with those obtained using the piece wise linear interpolation fig 13 shows in blue the udm results and in yellow the piece wise model results the first row in fig 13 shows the runoff cso and sso volumes from left to right in million cubic meters the second row shows in black the percentage difference among these models for the runoff volume the piece wise interpolation is under estimating the volume reduction by at most 0 5 150 000 m 3 when the gi implementation area is 10 km 2 for the cso and sso volumes the piece wise interpolation is over estimating by at most 0 8 10 000 m 3 and 4 3 215 000 m 3 respectively both in the maximum area 10 km 2 this difference could be explained by the assumption that the interactions among subcatchments are small in this udm from fig 13 it is observed that the three differences in volume increase for larger areas showing that the interactions are stronger for larger impervious to pervious areas this observation supports the idea of gi trains runoff volumes that exceeded the upstream gis capacity can be captured by downstream regional gis resulting in an increased overall system capacity in general the underestimation of the runoff volume reduction is expected as larger pervious areas close to each other tend to produce additive effects increasing the systems buffer capacity that our model is not considering similarly the over estimation of cso and sso reduction could also be explained by these interactions as the larger the runoff volume captured in the gi the smaller the volume reaching the sewer system however since the sewer system network carries flows from multiplesources flows among the sso and cso pipes potable water and groundwater infiltration sewer system losses etc explaining the difference between these metrics requires a deeper analysis to improve the precision of our model one may incorporate the interactions between connected or nested subcatchments this would reduce the differences between the proposed piece wise linear interpolation and the udm simulation by capturing the additive effects of nested subcatchments nevertheless the number of additional udm executions required to quantify these interactions during the parameterization stages depending on the system size may be substantial and not worth the added precision furthermore based on our results the proposed interpolation is sufficient to generate a good proxy of the system bogotá s udm exhibited a close to linear behavior in volume reduction for a large rainfall event the latter also plays a relevant role in the precision of the piece wise interpolation since larger rainfalls will more likely surpass the gi capacity causing the downstream buffer effect to diminish the abovementioned findings regarding the precision of the model may vary for other case studies with more complex udms smaller rainfall events and larger gi installation areas still the piece wise interpolation model will invariably capture the general trend and serve the purpose of aiding decision makers in the initial stages of the decision process 5 conclusions this manuscript described a new hybrid approach for optimizing the planning of gi in a large city this approach is particularly useful when fast solutions are required i e diverse criteria are to be considered and the optimization model is modified for multiple tests in the first stage piece wise linear curves representing the hydrological benefit of different gi spatial configurations are built by sampling of all possible gi locations using a udm in the second stage the curves are input to parameterize the mixed integer linear optimization program this approach bypasses the iterative scheme of simulation optimization methods by embedding the role of the udm in the optimization problem another advantage of this approach is that its building blocks can be selected according to the data and udm availability of the case study making it easily transferable to other contexts an example is the use of a processed remote sensing image as a proxy of imperviousness in the absence of a more accurate land use classification additionally the optimization model can be solved without the need for heavily specialized hardware any black box commercial optimizer can be effectively used by exploring two multi objective optimization approaches i e a lexicographic and a weighted sum model we showed the high efficiency of this approach in building pareto fronts and rapidly suggesting alternative solutions for different budgets we also showed that the optimal solutions are very sensitive to the configuration of objective functions e g the weight given to each criterion and the order of implementation highlighting the importance of maintaining effective communication with decision makers so that the solution fulfills their expectations torres et al 2020 in this case study we evaluate the impact in runoff cso and sso by gradually changing the impervious area and extracting results from the udm to build a hydrological response piece wise interpolation it is assumed that the gi total hydrological benefit can be estimated by adding gi individual contributions the piece wise linear interpolation of hydrological benefit curves is a substitute for a more complicated udm based on 1 the work needed for upfront to build train the model 2 its output of interest accuracy and 3 its behavior when coupled with an optimization process there are intertwined interactions in the urban drainage system that contradict this assumption e g complex underground sewer system connections and intentional and unintentional surface flow between gis nonetheless good performance of the piece wise interpolation model 5 in volume reduction when compared to the udm was found for the case study of bogota city a natural next step in the refinement of this approach would be the quantification of the interactions among nested subcatchments at least for pairs or three interconnected and spatially close subcatchments however the improved precision might be small when compared with the required udm executions and computational time demanded in this respect it worth mentioning that simplified approaches with acceptable accuracy are useful and necessary for the screening stage in any decision making process limbrunner et al 2013 sebti et al 2015 for the case study of bogota we showed that the prioritization of subcatchments is not straightforward and cannot be accomplished using a simple ranking of individual subcatchment performance it was also noted that the available public area for gi placement was very limited 32 6 km 2 or 7 2 of the urban surface which would require the municipalities to pursue the implementation of gi on private lands to achieve a substantial reduction in runoff we calculated that by implementing 30 of the gi feasible public area i e 2 2 of the city area the reduction on runoff cso and sso would be 0 9 1 8 and 2 4 respectively implementation of gi on public land has multiple benefits including better opportunities to monitor performance and environmental benefits jones et al 2020 as well as increased public participation and workforce development nonetheless implementation on private land may be necessary to achieve larger reductions in runoff garcia cuerva et al 2018 fontecha et al 2021 furthermore our results show that in some sub catchments the use of gi alone is not sufficient to achieve substantial cso and sso reductions hence for cities similar to the case study future work should consider the combined optimized operation and implementation of gray e g fontecha et al 2020

4270,green infrastructure gi location planning involves multi objective spatial analysis considering simultaneous benefits fast optimization results are often required e g collaborative modeling exercises and stakeholder involvement workshops while the simulation optimization approach is impractical for these cases if it relies on time consuming simulations of complex drainage system models this paper proposes a new method using a surrogated model based upon targeted executions of a more complex urban drainage model this method uses a piece wise linear interpolation to predict the hydrological impact of individual impervious to pervious area changes and the mixed integer linear optimization to find the optimal location of gi practices we applied the methodology to the capital city of colombia bogotá with the objectives of reducing runoff combined sewer overflows csos and separate sanitary overflows ssos two multi objective optimization approaches i e a lexicographic and a weighted sum model were explored showing the high efficiency of this approach in building pareto fronts and rapidly suggesting alternative solutions for different budgets it was found that by implementing gis on one third of the city s gi feasible public areas 2 2 of city area under a 10 year 6 h rainfall event the total reduction on runoff cso and sso are 0 9 1 8 and 2 4 respectively these results show the importance of promoting gi among private land owners especially in cities with land predominantly private owned this new approach is particularly useful for applications under data scarcity and high uncertainty scenarios keywords green infrastructure mixed integer linear programming optimization piece wise interpolation spatial location urban drainage 1 introduction green infrastructure gi is an environmental friendly approach to stormwater management using a combination of natural hydrologic features such as green roofs bioswales rain gardens etc in addition to storing and redirecting urban runoff gi also provides multiple social and aesthetic benefits fletcher et al 2015 from a hydrologic perspective effective location planning of gi at the city scale must consider the types of gi features and the interactions between multiple urban subcatchments as affected by local soil infiltration rates groundwater interactions and connectivity of the sewer network brown 2005 di and ahiablame 2015 the placement of gi features can be guided by decision support tools that combine an urban drainage model udm with an optimization procedure typically a metaheuristic such as an evolutionary algorithm or simulated annealing lee et al 2012 macro et al 2018 raei et al 2019 ghodsi et al 2020 saldarriaga et al 2020 the udm component is important because it quantifies the hydrologic impact of the gi with a high degree of accuracy however udm simulations often require considerable computation which may reduce the effectiveness of the optimization process by limiting the gi candidate designs that can be evaluated against specified objectives for example when the udm includes a coupled runoff pipe network model with a substantial degree of spatial resolution the resulting simulation optimization problem could require several days or even weeks of run time wang et al 2019 zhang and chui 2018 shojaeizadeh et al 2021 the burden of simulating gi systems is intensified for multi objective applications that require for example the involvement of stakeholders during multiple stages of the process jones et al 2020 young et al 2014 the evaluation of social and nonhydrologic environmental benefits of gi and or consider multiple baseline and extreme weather conditions for applications that involve a computationally demanding udm and multiple project objectives the computational burden can be reduced by 1 employing a simplified udm and or 2 replacing the udm with classical optimization techniques such as linear integer and dynamic programming mays and bedient 1982 sample et al 2001 limbrunner et al 2013 sebti et al 2015 torres et al 2020 the former approach is usually performed by reducing the spatial temporal resolution e g using a larger or dynamic simulation time step and or employing simpler hydrologic hydraulic process models e g statistical rather than mechanistic while the latter models directly the dynamics of the systems as components of comprehensive mathematical formulations that are then solved using commercial optimization software sadler et al 2019 moreover mathematical formulations are highly flexible can be easily parameterized and the solutions produced are proven optimal under the assumptions of such models a key advantage of these approaches is that they can often be solved significantly faster than a udm simulation the downside however is their limited accuracy when compared to the udm simulations as they can only capture a simplified version of the complex hydrological dynamics of the system limbrunner et al 2013 as a result selecting the appropriate approach for gi planning comes with a critical trade off between the desired precision and the speed and flexibility this paper presents a new approach for optimal location planning of gi that combines two components first the build up of piece wise linear response curves that capture and estimate the hydrological benefits of gi features in a runoff sewer system embedding the role of the udm in our optimization problem and second the guidance of the optimization search by means of integer programming instead of metaheuristics although the former still requires a handful of udm runs to train the linear functions the resulting framework significantly reduces the computational burden of simulation optimization which provides the flexibility needed to explore a range of multi objective planning scenarios that could evolve with ongoing stakeholder input besides this approach can be used in tandem with the metaheuristics as our model can be used to efficiently generate starting solutions that guide them to explore high quality regions of the solution space the proposed hybrid approach was applied to a real world case study using the distributed udm for the large and highly urbanized city of bogotá colombia the methodology was illustrated by optimizing for three distinct objective functions reflective of planning priorities to reduce 1 total runoff volume 2 volume of combined sewer overflows csos and 3 volume of separate sewer overflows sso other noteworthy features of the case study include the use of satellite imagery to identify candidate green space for gi features and preliminary feasibility analyses to identify the available area for gi in each subcatchment this computational approach generated individual solutions to the gi design problem in the order of minutes which facilitates its use in collaborative decision making processes that require repeated updates to the project objectives the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the development of the hydrological benefit curves as a substitute for a more complicated udm and details the construction and formal definition of the above mentioned integer program section 3 presents the case study and bogotá s udm section 4 summarizes and analyzes the results of this paper s methodological proposal finally section 5 summarizes and discusses the findings and outlines some opportunities for future research 2 methodology the methodology is divided into the two stages depicted in fig 1 in the first stage spatial data operations to identify feasible areas for gi are performed in doing so hydrological benefits curves related to the installation of gi are built through the evaluation execution of multiple gi configurations on the udm torres et al 2019 in the second stage the previously constructed hydrological benefits curves are used to define and construct the mathematical representation of physical and requirement constraints and the objective function the execution of stage 2 results in an optimal gi location in this stage the optimal result can be iterated through the re definition of the objective function this loop has the added value of easily adding other criteria besides the hydrological benefits and rapidly determining alternative solutions hydrological impact while avoiding re running the udm stage 1 starts with a feasibility analysis using spatial data data transformations are performed to unify the available information under a standard format as suggested by jato espino et al 2016 transforming available data into the raster format allows straightforward calculations with map algebra to determine feasibility the spatial resolution and data accuracy determine how strict the feasibility thresholds are to be set for example suppose the water table information is extracted from a surface interpolated from scarce sample points in that case the threshold should be flexible enough to account for uncertainties derived from the interpolation procedure or if the type of soil is reported in large polygons it is recommended to transform to rasters using a mesh of a resolution coherent with the other data sets any geographical information system gis can be used in this stage through spatial analysis tools such as raster calculations intersections or proximity analysis e g ariza et al 2019 jato espino et al 2016 torres et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 2 the udm is then used to quantify the hydrological performance of implementing gi in feasible areas modeled as a change from impervious to pervious surfaces imperviousness is a dominant factor in the observed alterations of surface and subsurface flows in urbanized watersheds arnold and gibbons 1996 epps and hathaway 2019 using impervious to pervious areal changes to model gi impact is appropriate since it targets the spatial distribution of gi at large scales i e city subcatchments lim and welty 2017 and not in the differential performance of gi types additionally it is a widely adopted measure for gi planning purposes both by practitioners and academics and because it is a measurable and straightforward concept it is convenient to explain to stakeholders the idea of evaluating the impact in runoff volumes by gradually changing the effective impervious area was tested by palla and gnecco 2015 who proved its usage is key under data scarcity and high uncertainty scenarios the feasible areas are spatially overlapped with the udm spatial units e g catchment land parcel or modeling cell to create an upper bound of available area per spatial unit for potential gi installation to build the hydrological response curves a set of gi implementation areas are modeled using the udm for each spatial unit such a set can be defined as percentages of the available area for potential gi installation or simply as particular values of interest fig 2 illustrates a semi distributed udm with catchments as spatial units a b c and d represent the four catchments in the system while the double gray lines are the drainage connections for each catchment the set of gi areas are tested independently in the udm in other words the total number of udm executions are number of subcatchments number of gi areas the gi areas and their corresponding hydrological benefit extracted from the udm are herein called sampling pairs these sampling pairs of each spatial unit catchments in fig 2 are then used to build a hydrological benefit curve using a piece wise linear approximation which converts the response curve into a more manageable format and enables the use of gradient based optimization this approach is built upon the assumption that the individual hydrological contributions are modular in the sense that the global impact is the sum of the individual areas contributions this assumption is reasonable considering that 1 the average distance among scattered gis at a city scale is sufficient to disregard interactions in the order of kilometers and 2 the available and feasible areas for gi are small and scattered compared with the total area of an urban center making gi flow interconnections very unlikely in the example shown in fig 2 10 runs each corresponding to a gi implementation area are used to describe the spatial unit s hydrological benefit curve the illustration shows two broadly accepted measures of large scale gi performance i e runoff and cso volume montalto et al 2007 tavakol davani et al 2016 li et al 2019 nonetheless any other response measure extracted from the udm can be used instead e g hydrologic response footprint hrf or peak runoff reduction the setup of the udm runs e g continuous or event based simulation time steps must consider a model execution for each sampling pair the udm setup is case study based and will depend on the udm capabilities the execution time and desired accuracy a set of indices that convert dynamic outputs e g event runoff volume cso discharge into a standard index format is used to build normalized response curves the indices correspond to the marginal hydrological benefits by a change in imperviousness on a spatial unit of the udm 2 1 urban drainage model outputs the indices q are defined as the ratio of the udm output series area under the curve e g total runoff and cso volume in our example with and without gi see eq 1 eq 1 describes how the indices are calculated where the sub index u denotes the subcatchment and a represents the gi implementation area the function f t is the output series in the original condition while f u a t is the output series when a gi implementation area a is considered in subcatchment u by design the indices q range from 0 to 1 where 0 implies that there is no change from the original condition thus larger values are desired the behavior of the index for increasing gi implementation area is expected to be non decreasing and concave and is assumed to be linear among areas within the set of intervals r such behavior is expected because for the same spatial unit a larger pervious area is anticipated to achieve at least the same reduction of say the runoff or cso as a smaller area does 1 q u a f t dt f u a t dt f t dt 2 2 piece wise linear approximation and optimization model one common way to reduce the complexity of a function for optimization purposes is to use piece wise polynomials eriksson et al 2004 the idea consists in approximating a function g x on an interval a b using linear polynomials on n divisions bounded by intervals a i b i where i n this logic is used to build the piece wise linear interpolations a piece wise linear interpolation is used to simplify each udm spatial unit response curve this transformation of the solution space enables the use of exact optimization search algorithms fig 3 illustrates the piece wise linear interpolation using three indices a non decreasing trend is expected for every index with the particularity of decreasing slopes for increasing pervious areas this is the marginal hydrological benefit for a unitary increase of gi area is expected to decrease for larger areas previous local and regional studies report diminishing runoff control gi efficiencies for larger rainfall events and gi design volume capacity exceeding the rainfall event volume ahiablame et al 2012 ghodsi et al 2020 li et al 2021 fig 3 illustrates n 6 sampling pairs for each of the indices in subcatchment u and considering 5 ranges r each area range is bounded by lower κ and upper ϕ limits any concave response curve can be built using the piece wise linear approximation the number of sample points required per spatial unit depends on the curve s degree of nonlinearity the more linear the curve the fewer point samples required the latter has to be tested by inspecting a couple of subcatchments hydrological response curves exhaustively running the udm for many impervious to pervious areas additionally the time availability and the needed accuracy are factors to consider when defining the number of model executions 2 2 1 problem formulation the problem is defined over a set u of n spatial units e g subcatchments considering a set of indices i the available area for potential gi installation α u for each subcatchment u u and the budgetary total gi area β to install and to distribute among the spatial units are known each of the indices in the set i are described by piece wise linear concave functions to describe these functions a set of lines one for each catchment u u index i i and range r r are used and defined through μ ur i and θ ur i the slope and intercept respectively the κ ur and ϕ ur are the lower and upper limits of the area range r r respectively for each subcatchment u u and area range r r y ur is a variable that takes the value of 1 if the pervious area to be installed in subcatchment u is in the area range r and 0 otherwise x ur is a variable that represents the value of area of gi to be installed in the subcatchment u in the area range r for subcatchment u u w u a variable that computes the total pervious area to be installed in u while q u i is a variable that stores the value of the index i i finally z i is an auxiliary variable that stores the sum on u u of q u i for each index i i a summary of this notation is available in appendix a 2 2 2 objective functions the objective is to maximize the sum of the index values eq 2 two commonly used optimization functions were selected to deal with multiple objectives the weighted sum approach ehrgott 2005 and the lexicographic multi objective or constraints method ehrgott 2005 waltz 1967 marler and arora 2004 the first consists of aggregating the multiple objectives into a single objective function by introducing a normalization weight for each objective the latter uses a lexicographic order i e a given ranking of the objective functions based on their importance the lexicographic approach optimizes the model sequentially following this predefined order each time for a new objective function to guarantee the quality of the solution with respect to the previous objectives the method introduces additional constraints that limit the detriment of the previous objectives to be at most a predefined value φ 2 max z i 2 2 3 constraints eq 3 represents the set of constraints that guarantee that the installed pervious area in each subcatchment does not exceed the available area for potential installation while eq 4 constitutes the set of constraints that compute the total pervious area assigned to each subcatchment 3 w u α u u u 4 w u r r x ur u u eqs 5 7 are the constraints that linearize the indices eq 5 defines the upper and lower limits of each range r r and subcatchment u u while eq 6 guarantees that the selected impervious to pervious area of subcatchment u u belongs to only one of the area ranges r r eq 7 computes the value of index i i and subcatchment u u using the piece wise linear interpolation approach that is using the slopes μ ur and intercept θ ur i for area range r r 5 κ ur y ur x ur ϕ ur y ur u u r r 6 r r y ur

indices is not greater than 1 8 u u w u β 9 z i u u q u i i i 10 z i 1 i i finally eqs 11 15 represent the constraints of decision variables nature 11 z i 0 i i 12 w u 0 u u 13 q u i 0 u u i i 14 x ur

the precipitation pattern is bimodal with rainy seasons in april june and september november anselm et al 2020 total annual rainfall ranges from 500 to 1 200 mm ideam 2019 fig 4 a illustrates the total rainfall depth for a 10 year return period and 6 h duration event this rainfall event was selected for bogotá since its magnitude produces flooding in critical areas of the city ciia 2015 and because it allows accounting for the spatial variability of rainfall the largest rainfall depth occurs in the northeast area of the city adjacent to the eastern andean mountains bogotá s drainage system is divided in four main catchments each draining from east to west fig 4b shows the tributary rivers torca salitre fucha and tunjuelo which discharge into the main stream of the city the bogotá river the constructed drainage system contains 2 000 km of storm pipes and 6 600 km of combined sewer pipes torres et al 2017 fontecha et al 2021 the combined sewer system corresponds to the oldest part of the city located in the central east area while the separated system spreads across the urban area i e fontecha et al 2016 see fig 4c bogotá is under a variety of environmental stress factors due to the unregulated growth and mismanagement of resources rodríguez et al 2008 ramírez et al 2013 of extreme relevance is the frequent occurrence of pluvial flooding events castaneda 1989 romero lankao et al 2014 during wet weather wastewater and cso discharges frequently occur as a result of the lacking capacity of the sewer system and the wastewater treatment plant additionally the system has a high number of wrong connections estimated between 22 and 99 and a high infiltration flow into the sewer system estimated to be 50 of the mean wastewater flow rodríguez et al 2008 for these reasons the pluvial drainage system s untreated discharges from now on referred to as separate sewer overflows ssos are also a source of pollution and are of environmental concern to summarize the objectives according to bogotá s priorities are to maximize the sum of the reduction indexes refer to 2 2 2 runoff volume z run cso volume z cso and sso volume z sso although governmental city agencies agree on the need to implement gi as a complementary solution to reduce the effects of urbanization on runoff this implementation has been slow e g gi design legislation was issued very recently in 2018 among the reasons that explain this implementation delay are i the financial support and the institutional coordination which leaves unclear the roles and responsibilities of each governmental agency ciia 2015 ii the scarcity of local information on costs and efficiencies of gi structures ciia 2015 and iii the lack of city wide studies or tools that quantify the effect of these implementations and prioritize areas of the city to date the only prioritization effort for gi placement at the level of the city was performed using secondary information ariza et al 2019 unfortunately these analyses do not include modeling or quantification of gi hydrological benefits similar to many other municipalities approaches gi implementation in bogotá began in public areas in the city about 80 of the land is private martinez 2017 drastically limiting the area that is both public and feasible for gi to identify the land parcels that fulfill both requirements this study counted on the spatial information a 1 meter resolution dem a 2 meter lidar a 50 meter infiltration rate raster a 230 meter groundwater table raster and city wide buildings and public areas e g sidewalks parks plazas polygon layers ciia 2015 as suggested by ariza et al 2019 the slope groundwater table soil infiltration rate and distance to buildings were considered to determine viable lots for gi installation 3 2 bogotá s urban drainage model bogota s udm is built in citydrain ii rodríguez et al 2009 an open source toolbox constructed and hosted in matlab simulink environment achleitner et al 2007 citydrain ii models the rainfall runoff process by coupling the catchment loss model with a simplified muskingum routing method achleitner et al 2007 the model is a semi distributed model that uses subcatchments as spatial units in total the model counts on 469 subcatchments 106 combined 274 separated and 89 undeveloped which do not count on drainage sewer system 11 natural wetlands and 13 pumping stations dry weather measurements were used to calibrate the model since unfortunately rainfall runoff data scarcity at the city scale prevented wet weather calibration the model was carefully parameterized to guarantee the system s best possible representation including the attentive selection of muskingum parameters 3 3 catchment loss model parameters estimation the inputs for the udm s catchment loss model are the runoff coefficient initial losses and permanent losses three parameters that depend on the imperviousness of the subcatchment because a high resolution land use classification is not available for bogotá city and because the publicly available land use classification e g the us geological survey s global land cover characterization is unsuitable for highly urbanized areas the near difference vegetation index ndvi was used as a proxy to imperviousness from a high resolution commercial image pervious impervious areas were categorized using a 4 bands multispectral image from planet imagery planet 2019 3 5 and 0 72 meter resolution using the ndvi approach the ndvi is defined in eq 16 in which a nir and a vis correspond to the near infrared and the red visible spectrum respectively carlson and ripley 1997 this calculation can be carried out using built in tools of any commercial gis or remote sensing software e g qgis arcgis snap envi or can be easily programmed using raster algebraic operations 16 ndvi a nir a vis a nir a vis ndvi values range between 1 and 1 higher reflectance on the nir band corresponds to denser and healthier green vegetation a higher ndvi indicates a larger fraction of vegetation in a pixel yuan and bauer 2007 hence a value closer to 1 indicates a higher proportion of pervious impervious areas since the ndvi values vary among case studies a threshold value to determine the pervious impervious area proportion must be established by subjective judgment it is suggested to turn on and off the ndvi raster layer the image true color and false color combinations and a server high resolution imagery layer e g esri 2021 to determine a threshold value that better captures the vegetation without overestimating the pervious area once the threshold values are established the ndvi raster layer is reclassified to reflect the original state spatial distribution of impervious pixels an illustrative example of this procedure is provided in appendix b while appendix c illustrates the comparison of two ndvi threshold values the hydrological benefit curves are built by modeling different gi implementation areas in the udm via modification of the catchment loss model parameters the runoff coefficient and the initial losses parameters are calculated by assigning differentiated values to the two types of areas 0 9 pervious and 0 2 impervious for runoff coefficients and 0 28 mm pervious and 0 07 mm impervious for initial losses permanent losses are determined using kidd lowring 1997 formula d k 1 s where d is the depression storage in millimeters s is the slope and k 1 is a coefficient that depends on whether the area is pervious or impervious kidd and lowring 1979 fig 5 summarizes the methodology stages for the case study including the estimation of the impervious area from the satellite image and the 10 yr 6 h rainfall used as input to the udm the feasible gi implementation area third input to the city drain ii in fig 5 specifies the sub catchments total public land potentially used for gi siting the parameters for the catchment loss model first input to the city drain ii in fig 5 are modified to reflect the set of gi areas to be executed in the udm i e the sampling pairs 4 results 4 1 stage 1 results parameterization of the optimization model planet satellite images were obtained for the first of january 2019 this month is historically known for low precipitation and cloudiness which permitted a high quality satellite image with minimum cloud removal requirement the products were processed in r using the maptools and raster packages after calculating the ndvi for the 4 meters raster a threshold value of 0 35 was selected see appendix c for a comparison of ndvi thresholds fig 6 shows the mean weighted ndvi and runoff coefficients per subcatchment when assigning a coefficient of 0 2 to permeable and 0 9 to impermeable areas the peripheries of the city have the highest ndvi values and lowest runoff coefficients shown in green while the most urbanized areas are concentrated in the south east of the city shown in red it was found that about 85 of bogotá s urban subcatchments have coefficients higher than 0 7 results coherent to escobedo et al 2018 and calderón et al 2019 findings the right side of fig 6 shows a comparison of google earth high resolution imagery 0 1 m and the ndvi extracted from planet imagery 4 m as can be observed the ndvi can distinguish green areas from pervious urban elements such as roads and roofs the yellow color indicates a combination of both types of surfaces the yellow vertical stripe among the red vertical areas is in fact partially covered by sidewalk and grass in total the city has 32 6 km 2 7 2 of the city s total area available for gi sitting on public spaces including sidewalks parks plazas and road dividers the hydrological response curves were built by simulating impervious to pervious changes up to 30 of the available area for potential gi installation in each subcatchment considering that gi competes for the urban space with many other public services e g roads bicycle parking racks gardens etc a conservative maximum implementation area of one third of gi potential area was selected for each subcatchment using an event of 6 hours duration and 10 years return period the runoff cso and sso time series were extracted and eq 1 was used to convert the dynamic series into indices the number of sample pairs required to build the response curve for each subcatchment is determined by evaluating the deviation from linearity results show that for this particular case of study and udm the behavior of the three indices as a function of an increasing change of pervious to impervious area is almost linear as evidenced by high r 2 no lower than 0 9 in all the tested subcatchments this behavior is attributed to the simplified underlying equations of the catchment loss model linear water balance equations considering the close to linear behavior of the gi hydrological benefits curve and that each udm run takes around 20 min to complete it was decided to perform 5 runs 5 sampling pairs per subcatchment this results in a total of 2 345 model executions 5 sampling points 469 subcatchments the runs were performed in a dell optiplex 7060 equipped with an intel r core tm i7 3 4 ghz processor 32 gb of ram and running windows 10 by making parallel udm executions the total computational time was reduced from 781 h 32 days to 111 h 4 days resulting runoff indices z run in eq 9 varied from 0 0001 to 0 25 higher values indicate a larger reduction of the runoff volume of the city expressed as a ratio to the original condition the upper right corner of fig 7 shows the linear behavior of 5 subcatchments a b c d and e whose index values ranges from 0 04 to 0 76 for each subcatchment the runoff index behavior is non decreasing with similar slopes for different gi areas differences do not surpass the 0 001 the gi area availability is determined by the feasibility analysis and hence the subcatchments have different capacities for accommodating gi different ranges of x axis in fig 7 for illustration purposes and since the variability among the slopes of the same subcatchment is negligible a unique slope was calculated using the first and last index sample points the spatial distribution of the index slope and its frequency are illustrated in fig 7 the north east area of the city consistently presents higher index values compared to the south west areas the index spatial distribution shows the precipitation strong influence in the runoff index refer to fig 4 similar maps and data analysis were developed for cso and sso index and are shown in appendix d 4 2 stage 2 results optimization the previous analyses were used to calculate the parameters of the optimization model the approach was implemented in python language and solved with the commercial optimizer gurobi 7 0 2 optimization 2017 once all the sampling points and curves were obtained which took 4 days to complete the optimization model experiments were solved in seconds the next subsections provide keys insights obtained from experimenting with i uni objective optimization for each of the indices runoff sso and cso ii varying objectives order with a lexicographic multi objective model and iii using a weighted sum multi objective approach 4 2 1 optimization for individual objectives fig 8 illustrates results of maximizing the three indices separately for a set of budgets that range from 10 0 32 km 2 to 100 32 km 2 of the total public area for gi in blue z run is the index of runoff volume reduction while sso and cso volume reduction corresponds to z cso and z sso in yellow and gray respectively index values vary from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no change in volume and 1 indicates complete volume reduction see eq 1 sso and cso indices values are one order of magnitude larger than the runoff index indicating that relative to the original condition the impact of implementing a unit area of gi say 1 km 2 is larger for cso and sso than for runoff volumes fig 8 shows a non decreasing runoff index z run this was expected given that the pervious area and the runoff volume generated are inversely proportional cso and sso z cso and z sso exhibit a concave line indicating there is a point in which a change from pervious to impervious area does no longer reduce the observed overflow this behavior could be explained by the spatially differential drainage capacity of the sewer system in some areas of the city the gi could reduce the excess volume and eliminate local csos or ssos completely hence additional gi will not be reflected as volume reductions in the outfall in other more critical areas of the city with no space for gi e g dense unplanned neighborhoods with limited sewer system capacity the installation of more gi areas in other sub catchments will not show outfall volume reductions in such cases conventional measures to cso abatement such as in line storage systems and cso tanks brombach 2002 montalto et al 2007 are required to expand the sewer system capacity and reduce the overflow volume increasing the sewer capacity is an effective measure to reduce cso rathnayake and anwar 2019 still it has the drawbacks of a heavy financial burden e g nasri and haynes 2015 and the lack of co benefits e g social and environmental 4 2 2 lexicographic multi objective optimization a previous work in bogotá city carried out a soft systems methodology ssm to identify the different perspectives of involved actors ariza et al 2019 i e water utility environmental authority urban development institute etc this exercise resulted in similar scores for the three objectives but suggested giving priority to runoff volume in the first place and cso volume in the second place following this suggestion the lexicographic model was implemented using the order runoff reduction z run cso reduction z cso and sso reduction z sso with an allotted detriment φ of 5 fig 9 illustrates the resulting selected subcatchments using varying budgets up to 30 of the total available area for gi sitting in the public space fig 9 evidences that increasing the budget does not necessarily result in consistently selecting the catchments with higher performance particularly according to fig 7 the subcatchments located in the north east zone of the city provide a higher reduction of runoff for a unitary increase in gi area this lack of a clear pattern indicates i that the prioritization of subcatchments is not trivial and can not be solved using a mere ranking of the best performing subcatchments and ii the existence of alternative optima to provide a better understanding of the three objectives interaction fig 10 illustrates the 6 possible combinations of the objective function orders here runoff volume z run uses the secondary right axis while cso z cso and sso z sso are graphed in the primary axis cso z cso and runoff z run indices exhibit a similar behavior notwithstanding the order of the lexicographic model while sso z sso index deviate from this pattern whenever sso index z sso is the first objective the other two objective functions are dominated they reach considerable lower values than in other configurations on the contrary when cso index z cso goes in the third position it reaches the lowest values near the inflection points in runoff z run fig 11 illustrates the gap between the optimal values for each order combination and the optimal value obtained by optimizing each objective independently the best possible outcome for each objective function the first objective function of the six graphs is close to 0 since up to the first stage this sole objective function is considered and the gap is negligible here it is confirmed that the behavior of runoff index z run and cso index z cso are close and that whenever sso index z sso is in the first or second place the other two objective functions gaps increase considerably 4 2 3 weighted sum multi objective optimization based on the previously evidenced relations among the objective functions the implementation of a weighted sum approach ehrgott 2005 is explored here a larger weight is typically given to the objectives of greater importance however since in subsection 4 2 2 it was found that two of the three objectives behave similarly it is proposed to give equal weight to the sum of runoff and cso index the terms z run z cso and sso index z sso see eq 17 17 max δ z run z cso 2 1 δ z sso to identify several optimal non dominated solutions in the form of a pareto frontier for different subcatchments selection the proposed formulation was solved by varying the value of δ fig 12 shows the non dominated solutions for the two budgets of interest 4 9 km 2 and 24 4 km 2 refer to the inflection points in fig 8 x axis and y axis are normalized to reflect how far the solution obtained with a particular value of δ is from the dual bound i e the best possible solution if only this objective is considered this is the closer to 1 the better for that particular objective the pareto frontiers have different shapes depending on the budget selected a large budget allows the selection of larger areas that will be changed from impervious to pervious hence reaching values closer to the dual bound closer to 1 for both graphs the suggested solution i e the closest to the dual bound in both axis z run z cso 2 and z sso is in the upper right corner however this is just a suggestion since all points in the pareto frontier are guaranteed to be optimal each solution offers a different configuration from which the decision maker can select according to their criteria examples are preferences for certain subcatchments that will provide side benefits or economic financial advantages not considered in the optimization exercise the decision of which optimal solution is selected from the pareto front relies heavily on the variable values in each solution specifically on the xs and ys variables which define the selected subcatchment and the installation area for gi the budget used to define the pareto frontier clearly affects its shape a larger budget provides values closer to the dual bound in the two axes hence values closer to 1 dominate fig 12 b resulting in straight lines parallel to the axis and a sharp corner in fig 12 a the shape is smooth evidencing how an improvement in one objective decreases the performance in the second for example when moving in the x axis from left to right after 0 6 any improvement in z run z cso 2 creates a detriment in z sso finally for the maximum budget 32 km 2 the pareto frontier is represented by only three points 0 1 1 0 and 1 1 since for this budget all the objective functions z run z cso 2 and z sso have already reached their dual bound 4 3 measuring the quality of the proposed interpolation the results obtained by the proposed piece wise linear interpolation were compared with the umd simulation showing that this model is able to produce solutions that estimate the actual performance of the system quite accurately first the optimal solutions for budgets between 0 and 10 km 2 were simulated in the udm recall that each udm execution takes around 20 min the results runoff cso and sso volumes of these simulations were compared with those obtained using the piece wise linear interpolation fig 13 shows in blue the udm results and in yellow the piece wise model results the first row in fig 13 shows the runoff cso and sso volumes from left to right in million cubic meters the second row shows in black the percentage difference among these models for the runoff volume the piece wise interpolation is under estimating the volume reduction by at most 0 5 150 000 m 3 when the gi implementation area is 10 km 2 for the cso and sso volumes the piece wise interpolation is over estimating by at most 0 8 10 000 m 3 and 4 3 215 000 m 3 respectively both in the maximum area 10 km 2 this difference could be explained by the assumption that the interactions among subcatchments are small in this udm from fig 13 it is observed that the three differences in volume increase for larger areas showing that the interactions are stronger for larger impervious to pervious areas this observation supports the idea of gi trains runoff volumes that exceeded the upstream gis capacity can be captured by downstream regional gis resulting in an increased overall system capacity in general the underestimation of the runoff volume reduction is expected as larger pervious areas close to each other tend to produce additive effects increasing the systems buffer capacity that our model is not considering similarly the over estimation of cso and sso reduction could also be explained by these interactions as the larger the runoff volume captured in the gi the smaller the volume reaching the sewer system however since the sewer system network carries flows from multiplesources flows among the sso and cso pipes potable water and groundwater infiltration sewer system losses etc explaining the difference between these metrics requires a deeper analysis to improve the precision of our model one may incorporate the interactions between connected or nested subcatchments this would reduce the differences between the proposed piece wise linear interpolation and the udm simulation by capturing the additive effects of nested subcatchments nevertheless the number of additional udm executions required to quantify these interactions during the parameterization stages depending on the system size may be substantial and not worth the added precision furthermore based on our results the proposed interpolation is sufficient to generate a good proxy of the system bogotá s udm exhibited a close to linear behavior in volume reduction for a large rainfall event the latter also plays a relevant role in the precision of the piece wise interpolation since larger rainfalls will more likely surpass the gi capacity causing the downstream buffer effect to diminish the abovementioned findings regarding the precision of the model may vary for other case studies with more complex udms smaller rainfall events and larger gi installation areas still the piece wise interpolation model will invariably capture the general trend and serve the purpose of aiding decision makers in the initial stages of the decision process 5 conclusions this manuscript described a new hybrid approach for optimizing the planning of gi in a large city this approach is particularly useful when fast solutions are required i e diverse criteria are to be considered and the optimization model is modified for multiple tests in the first stage piece wise linear curves representing the hydrological benefit of different gi spatial configurations are built by sampling of all possible gi locations using a udm in the second stage the curves are input to parameterize the mixed integer linear optimization program this approach bypasses the iterative scheme of simulation optimization methods by embedding the role of the udm in the optimization problem another advantage of this approach is that its building blocks can be selected according to the data and udm availability of the case study making it easily transferable to other contexts an example is the use of a processed remote sensing image as a proxy of imperviousness in the absence of a more accurate land use classification additionally the optimization model can be solved without the need for heavily specialized hardware any black box commercial optimizer can be effectively used by exploring two multi objective optimization approaches i e a lexicographic and a weighted sum model we showed the high efficiency of this approach in building pareto fronts and rapidly suggesting alternative solutions for different budgets we also showed that the optimal solutions are very sensitive to the configuration of objective functions e g the weight given to each criterion and the order of implementation highlighting the importance of maintaining effective communication with decision makers so that the solution fulfills their expectations torres et al 2020 in this case study we evaluate the impact in runoff cso and sso by gradually changing the impervious area and extracting results from the udm to build a hydrological response piece wise interpolation it is assumed that the gi total hydrological benefit can be estimated by adding gi individual contributions the piece wise linear interpolation of hydrological benefit curves is a substitute for a more complicated udm based on 1 the work needed for upfront to build train the model 2 its output of interest accuracy and 3 its behavior when coupled with an optimization process there are intertwined interactions in the urban drainage system that contradict this assumption e g complex underground sewer system connections and intentional and unintentional surface flow between gis nonetheless good performance of the piece wise interpolation model 5 in volume reduction when compared to the udm was found for the case study of bogota city a natural next step in the refinement of this approach would be the quantification of the interactions among nested subcatchments at least for pairs or three interconnected and spatially close subcatchments however the improved precision might be small when compared with the required udm executions and computational time demanded in this respect it worth mentioning that simplified approaches with acceptable accuracy are useful and necessary for the screening stage in any decision making process limbrunner et al 2013 sebti et al 2015 for the case study of bogota we showed that the prioritization of subcatchments is not straightforward and cannot be accomplished using a simple ranking of individual subcatchment performance it was also noted that the available public area for gi placement was very limited 32 6 km 2 or 7 2 of the urban surface which would require the municipalities to pursue the implementation of gi on private lands to achieve a substantial reduction in runoff we calculated that by implementing 30 of the gi feasible public area i e 2 2 of the city area the reduction on runoff cso and sso would be 0 9 1 8 and 2 4 respectively implementation of gi on public land has multiple benefits including better opportunities to monitor performance and environmental benefits jones et al 2020 as well as increased public participation and workforce development nonetheless implementation on private land may be necessary to achieve larger reductions in runoff garcia cuerva et al 2018 fontecha et al 2021 furthermore our results show that in some sub catchments the use of gi alone is not sufficient to achieve substantial cso and sso reductions hence for cities similar to the case study future work should consider the combined optimized operation and implementation of gray e g fontecha et al 2020

4271,evaluating the function and effectiveness of the nabatean flash flood management system in petra requires both insight into the nature and extent of the system as well as its hydrological information studies of runoff and flooding in semi arid mountainous regions with high potential for flash floods such as petra can be limited by the lack of any runoff measurements as well as low resolution rainfall and terrain data wadi hremiyyeh is a small catchment that flows into the treasury plaza and is responsible for much of the flooding that occurs there half meter spatial resolution digital elevation model dem was built for this catchment using unmanned aerial vehicles uav surveying which was useful in determining the exact sites of terraces built by the nabataeans for flood management rainfall data from the nearby wadi musa station was supplemented with a new station installed through this project for continuous precipitation measurements at the site new water level meters specifically designed for that purpose were installed within the main channel four of the ancient nabataean and post nabataean check dams were restored data collected from the 2019 2020 rainy season created an understanding of the rain runoff conditions at the site and was utilized in constructing and calibrating hydrological models using hec hms and hec ras software the function and the effectiveness of the rebuilt terraces were evaluated the models suggest that terraces are effective at delaying the flood peak time up to 25 minute delay for an 18 dam setup and at reducing the actual amount of water arriving downstream 13 5 volume reduction similar results can be observed for lower frequency flood analysis in which the models also show effectiveness of these interventions modeling of a large dam rather than the smaller terraces and check dams shows that such an intervention would result in a reduction of 30 5 in peak flow but a delay of the peak of merely 14 min while petra was the venue for this work its techniques and suggested parameters are applicable to cases of similar arid and semi arid mountainous regions that are subjected to flash floods keywords check dams numerical modeling environmental monitoring hec ras flash floods semi arid 1 introduction flooding has always been a challenge for settled peoples especially given their tendency to congregate in river valleys each drainage system offers a different set of challenges in the nile valley the predictability of annual floods allowed for the planning of their agricultural cycle mays 2010 in contrast the tigris and euphrates rivers have less predictable flooding patterns that are also temporally misaligned with the cropping pattern this necessitated an elaborate high maintenance water management system tamburrino 2010 that led to widespread soil and groundwater salination due to poor understanding of the irrigation system tamburrino 2010 in addition to flood management for agriculture societies in riverine urban settings also manage floods to protect cities in ancient china ongoing flood hazards led to consistent efforts through urban planning and flood water diversion qingzhou 1989 in pre columbian america flood management was also an important component of urban planning and design davis salazar 2006 similar approaches were implemented in urfa by emperor justinian in the 6th century ce kürkçüoğlu et al 2013 despite the long established human engineering experience with the problem of flooding most of the water management examples are utilized for irrigation and urban planning are related to perennial rivers with predictable flooding patterns while our research focuses on arid environments excess water and flooding provided an issue for tropical maya cities of the classic period as well chase and cesaretti 2019 scarborough and sierra 2015 šprajc et al 2021 however in a similarly arid but less rugged environment than our study area another exception to this can be found at the ancient site of persepolis in persia where builders utilized runoff water from the adjacent hill while alleviating flooding at the same time moradi jalal et al 2010 relative to persepolis the experience of the nabateans in petra is unique as people generally avoided low lying areas in tightly constrained valleys susceptible to the devastating impacts of flash flooding as the nature of the site dictated that it would be settled and urbanized the nabateans tried to live up to the challenges that the site imposed typical channeling and diverting of water that has been seen in other areas was used here but was insufficient for a city situated under steep cliffs with multiple sources of flash floods these flash floods would channel through narrow gorges that were heavily utilized as the entrance of petra moreover sediments and debris left behind after flood events would have been a recurring problem to manage the unique nature of the challenges that faced petra and of the interventions that were used provides an important case study the flood control system used here which consisted of a large number of terraces gabions and check dams was found in disrepair because of siltation destruction and gullying this paper documents an attempt to revive this system and evaluate the hydrological impacts that it made on the drainage basin the insights gained exceeds the simple curiosity of how the ancient nabateans managed the problem of flash floods but may provide lessons on how flash floods particularly in urban areas may be managed in the modern world it has been strongly suggested that revival of ancient agricultural terrace techniques is a key to future sustainability though this remains more of an idea that is generally relegated to the imagination fisher 2020 similarly the idea of reviving the use of cisterns for rainwater collection in modern urban contexts has generated much interest recently awawdeh et al 2012 the nabateans relied on springs for the majority of their water needs though the collection of water in numerous cisterns throughout the area was extensive laureano 2001 1 1 petra and wadi hremiyyeh the physical setting and climate of petra which is part of the wadi musa drainage basin make it particularly susceptible to flash floods the steep slopes that run from the sharah mountain 1600 masl in the east towards petra 900 masl over about 6 km are characterized by thin loose soil and has poor plant cover while the average annual rainfall in the area is relatively low 178 mm as shown in fig 1 it often occurs as sudden cloud bursts associated with the convective storm events of the red sea trough al qudah 2011 when such events pass a threshold estimated to be at an average of about 22 mm day runoff can be generated and flash floods become possible alhasanat 2014 rain runoff experiments in the area show that runoff begins between 10 and 17 min after initiating simulations of 25 mm hour this translates to between 4 and 7 mm of rainfall for the initiation of runoff al qudah et al 2016 the degree of the saturation of soil effects this amount runoff coefficients were reported ranging between 16 and 91 al qudah et al 2016 the wadi hremiyyeh catchment is part of the larger drainage basin of wadi musa that joins the wadi after the siq entrance at the treasury plaza the catchment has an area of 1 1 km2 the maximum elevation in the basin may rise up to 1378 m above msl its lowest elevation drops to 1012 m above msl with a maximum catchment relief of 365 m the headwater of the wadi hremiyyeh catchment begins at the highlands of the sharah mountain with characteristic upper cretaceous limestone outcrops of the wadi sir and the undifferentiated fuhais hummar and wadi shuaib formations and is rising to the east of the tertiary wadi musa fault barjous 2003 drainage flows across the fault towards the center of petra through exposures of the cambrian umm ishrin and the ordovician disi formations the average slope is about 0 27 m m in this area the area of interest is to the west of the wadi musa fault within the exposures of the umm ishrin and disi sandstone formations across this area coarse calcareous sandy soil and colluvium deposits overlay the bed rock with exposures of various types of terrestrial carbonates some of which could be used to determine the locations and heights of now destroyed terraces and check dams abu jaber et al 2020 sparse desert shrubs are spread on the slopes downstream to the west of the wadi musa fault below 1080 m above msl the average slope of the stream becomes more gentle 0 17 m m and only the umm ishrin sandstone is exposed all the way to the catchment outlet where it pours water right next to the treasury monument of petra the downstream terrain is mostly bare rock with rough topography on either side of the wadi hremiyyeh stream the catchment of wadi hremiyyeh has a longitudinal shape with the longest axis being 2430 m long the area where much of the ancient flood control measures were implemented lies at and directly to the west of the wadi musa fault where the maximum slope is observed this area was also the focus of this investigation 1 2 historical flooding and flood management in petra flooding in petra is an issue that has had to be dealt with since the city was first established in the 2nd century bce archaeological excavations beneath the treasury have shown that early 1st century bce tombs were buried in flood deposits to a depth of 2 6 m while an early façade of the treasury that is 5 4 m high was completely buried by sediment prior to the carving of the current iconic façade farajat and nawafleh 2005 it is estimated that the entire sequence of building in the area happened over a period of only 40 years during which sediment deposits from at least 15 flood events were laid farajat and nawafleh 2005 paradoxically there is no evidence of major sediment deposition after the carving of the upper façade i e in the last 1900 years suggesting that interventions in the drainage basin resulted in the desired effect of mitigating flooding and sediment deposition in the courtyard in front of the treasury as illustrated in fig 2 the main interventions included the diversion of water that had previously flowed through wadi musa the siq and through the wadi al mudhlim diversion canal system bellwald 2008 the dams serve both to divert the water and to trap large amounts of sediments carried with the water bellwald 2008 however the impact of flash floods exceeds the area of the siq and the treasury and could lead to blocking or damaging of structures and leading to siltation of fields dams and cisterns and road systems hamarneh 2020 moreover in this arid environment this flowing water could not be allowed to go to waste thus it was fundamental to collect and store it for the later hot and dry seasons of the year this situation is similar to that prevalent in other arid regions while the use of dams cisterns and various distribution networks helped alleviate some of the water shortages the storage capacity in these systems was sufficient for domestic use on the other hand the capacity for storing water in the form of soil moisture allows for substantial potential which can be best used in dryland agriculture hamarneh 2020 through time the inhabitants of petra developed water management strategies to mitigate surface water flow and to divert and store it in soil as well as in cisterns and dams the earliest water management interventions started around the iron ii but the most extensive development took place with the nabataeans period onwards hamarneh 2020 interventions started at the upper catchment areas with sturdy stepped terraces known as gabions these were constructed to withstand the water flow at the high elevations and prevent the debris downwash these were followed by sets of contour terraces that covered the catchment slopes these were built to intersect sheet flow and protect the scarce soil cover al qudah et al 2016 hamarneh 2020 towards the lower parts of the drainage basins narrow gorges and wadis posed the highest threat of funnelling water down the slope various interventions weirs check dams barrages were introduced at various points of the wadis to slow the water flow and break the flow speed weirs are stone barriers built from collected boulders of few rows and one layer check dams were constructed in the narrow wadies these structures were built in strict proportions depending on the width of the wadi while dams designed for water storage were plastered in order to prevent water leakage check dams were not plastered as its function was to slow the water flow minimize the flow volume and filter out debris hamarneh 2020 another strategy for water flow control was diversion by means of constructing barriers such as barrages these were built within the middle of a catchment area as the slope gradient varied their concave shape down the slope prevented the water from flowing down the slope redirecting its flow sideways to other wadies or to storage facilities such as cisterns small gullies were mitigated by means of weirs which were generally placed at the lower segment of the catchment interventions were sometimes instituted at the level of the building in the case of the theater runoff water from rainwater falling on and near the site was carefully diverted in a system of pipes and channels through and away from the structure towards the natural drainage channel hammond 1965 while largely effective there is evidence of devastating flooding sometime between the earthquake of 363 ce and the middle of the 5th century paradise 2012 flooding has been an ongoing process until now akasheh 2018 1 3 the terraces of the study area numerous ancient terraces of various forms cover the whole of the east and southwest slopes of wadi hremiyyeh their function is to retain the soil interrupt the surface flow and prevent gully development from the surface pottery collection it becomes clear that these terraces were constructed exploited and maintained from the nabataean until the early byzantine periods with some minimum exploitation during the 9th century a d hamarneh 2020 the first dam of those located in the middle of the catchment area was constructed to intersect two gullies developing at the upper segment of the catchment area and is part of a complex structure that is linked with adjacent terraces for support its construction resembles a contour terrace with a facing wall and a fill this was constructed of irregular limestone boulders of a lower craftsmanship within the middle catchment area a set of six check dams were the focus of this investigation these terraces were of the pyramidal type constructed of a facing wall and retaining wall with a fill their thickness varied between 1 and 3 m their length depended on the wadi width approximately ranging between 6 and 35 m while the vertical distances varied between 16 and 40 m apart one check dam number 5 extended for approximately 20 m was around 2 m high and had a thickness of about 1 m this check dam was constructed in a narrow deep part of the wadi and was silted over these terraces were laid of regular unhewn stones of local material mainly white limestone chiseled from the fallen debris of the upper cretaceous limestone formations outcropping at the upper catchment and were mixed with stones taken from the red umm ishrin sandstone outcropping within the wadi large boulders were placed in the lower courses with intermediate stones towards the middle and upper courses and small stones placed in between to anchor the stones 1 4 rationale and approach to this study studying flash floods in arid areas and in petra in particular is challenging from a hydraulic hydrologic perspective nearly every piece of information required for the proper understanding of flash floods in the area is insufficient to non existent rainfall data for example is available from the records of the wadi musa meteorological station however the data is constrained to daily rainfall readings up to a few years ago after which 6 h readings are available flash flood events typically happen over the course of a few minutes up to an hour or so in order to evaluate flooding events it would be preferable if higher temporal resolutions could be available moreover often the convective storms that cause flood events are highly variable in their spatial distribution al qudah 2011 this makes reliance on one station problematic the small area of the wadi hremiyyeh drainage basin creates its own challenges this is because the terrain within this area is highly variable in terms of slope and soil cover geological outcrops and vegetation cover this variability is difficult to assess using the available maps and digital elevation models dem which do not have the needed resolution to be used for modeling runoff particularly given the very irregular nature of the wadies existing maps and dem also do not have the resolution to allow for an understanding of the ancient terrace and dam distributions in the area from a hydraulic modeling standpoint the extremely low flow rates due to the small basin area make it very difficult to perform stable unsteady stats simulations to the best of the authors knowledge all the studies addressing the petra floods have relied on either generic data or official low resolution records of rain as well as low to medium resolution dems the hydrological impacts of terracing and other flood control interventions have scarcely been addressed in those studies al weshah and el khoury 1999 this study utilizes different data sources including uav based remote sensing techniques for creating a high resolution dem documenting as built ancient terraces and check dams and a network of rain and home built stream gages this study starts by understanding rainfall and runoff patterns and then developing a hydrologic numerical model for rainfall runoff predictions and a hydraulic numerical model for unsteady flow simulations the models are further used for evaluating the effect of the ancient terracing techniques for flood management and compares the performance of different alternatives for modern day flood management this is based on the outcomes of rebuilding of some of these collapsed structures finally the lack of availability of instrumentation and tools needed to measure runoff in the area poses a significant constraint on quantifying flood events and constructing the hydrographs for them while some stations have been established in the wadi musa drainage basin none has been established at wadi hremiyyeh additionally the existing monitoring stations are susceptible to vandalism other problems and obtaining useful information from them was not possible hence the advantage of the home designed and built monitoring system 2 materials and methods to study flash floods and the impact ancient terracing has on managing them a number of activites were performed these activities involved performing site surveys and detailed documentation of the archeological site for the purpose of identifying the baseline condition a topographic survey to get elevations developing and installing an environmental monitoring system to measure essential data of rain and flow collecting and analyzing of data and finally the development of numerical models for prediction of the performance of the system fig 3 shows an overall schematic of research 2 1 high resolution topographic survey accurate three dimensional 3d reconstruction of ones surroundings has become essential for non traditional mapping applications such as urban planning environmental monitoring infrastructure monitoring archaeological and heritage documentation and flash flood management and monitoring lari et al 2015 al rawabdeh et al 2016 recent advances in uavs or drones and hardware and software development have made it possible to conduct accurate 3d mapping through cost efficient time efficient and high end data acquisition systems al rawabdeh et al 2016 in this study uav based mapping systems provided high quality mapping products i e 3d point cloud generation dem and orthomosaic while bridging a big gap in terms of the extent of the area to be mapped as well as resolve accessibility constraints between traditional terrestrial and airborne applications the orthomosaic map allowed us to generate detailed information and documentation of about 115 ancient check dams and terraces with different conditions within the wadi hremiyyeh drainage basin an aerial survey of the wadi hremiyyeh catchment area was acquired on dec 23 2017 using a customized dji phantom ii quadcopter eight missions were conducted at 50 m height above the ground the drone offers approximately 30 min of flight duration on a single battery which is sufficient to cover up to 500 m2 area the drone has a gimbal stabilized dji zenmuse h4 3d camera containing the gopro hero black with a relatively wide field of view fov of 94 a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 20 mm in a medium view angle mode the camera was calibrated before the flight mission by the laboratory of applied geoinformatics yarmouk university jordan to derive an accurate estimation of the internal camera characteristics this information is essential for the 3d object space reconstruction out of the 2d image space i e 3d point cloud generation dem and orthomosaic al rawabdeh 2014 a total of 3358 high resolution aerial images with a 75 overlap in flying direction and a 70 side lap between adjacent flight lines were acquired from eight flight

especially when sensors are installed in remote locations for these reasons several in house designed and built low cost monitoring rainfall and stream gage measurement units were developed and deployed in the wadi hremiyyeh and around petra with their small footprint and contained nature their potential for vandalism was reduced data recorded using these units were stored locally and transmitted via global system for mobile communications gsm in near real time to a specially prepared website where the results are displayed and stored for further analysis details of the development and deployment of the measurement devices can be found at qasem abdelal 2020 qasem m abdelal and nizar abu jaber 2019 fig 4 shows the examples of the deployed devices at the project location 2 3 precipitation analysis total daily precipitation data were obtained for the nearby wadi musa station for the period between may 1st 1984 and dec 31st 2018 there was missing data at the end of the years 2011 2012 and 2014 data was analyzed and an intensity duration frequency idf curve was created several studies presented values for intensity duration and frequency of precipitation in petra alhasanat 2014 and al weshah and el khoury 1999 or the yearly rainfall records akasheh 2018 yet an illustration of the method for calculation of the idf curve and the extraction of the n hour storm out of the 24 h storm is necessary this study addresses that method daily precipitation values were obtained for 33 years and an analysis of the data using the empirical plotting position approach ven te chow and mays 1988 violina basumatary 2018 was done the annual maximum 24hr precipitation was extracted from the data set the return period t was obtained by applying the weibull plotting position formula as given in equation 1 and the probability of exceedance p in years is the reciprocal of the return period 1 t n 1 m where n is the number of years of rainfall used in the analysis and m is the rank of the event a curve fitting technique microsoft excel s trendline analysis is used to identify a direct relation between the rainfall intensity and the return period from which the corresponding intensities to known predefined return periods were obtained the obtained intensities are for 24 hour durations since there are no historical records for lower frequency precipitation those had to be obtained mathematically one approach which has been used extensively al mamun et al 2018 chowdhury 2007 munshi md rasel 2015 violina basumatary 2018 is that of the indian meteorological department in which the precipitation pt at a certain time t is a function of the total precipitation in 24hr p24 see equation 2 in original formula the variable x holds a value of 3 in this study it was dealt with as an optimization parameter to accommodate local conditions 2 p t p 24 t 24 1 x several works describe approaches for obtaining n hour precipitation based on 24hr precipitation records the standard natural resources conservation services nrcs types i and ii synthetic rainfall distributions have been used for design and planning united states department of agriculture 2015 the original documentation of their development is not available and thus their use is limited to cases where the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa atlas 14 is valid geoffrey m bonnin 2011 the atlas was developed based on rain stations with daily records of more than twenty years and hourly records of more than 15 years volume 1 of the atlas covers areas with climatic resemblance to jordan and thus the ratios for 5 min 10 min 15 min and 30 min were used in the analysis in this research to optimize the x parameter in equation 2 table 1 shows the ratios of the precipitation of the designated time of the storm 5 min to 30 min with respect to that of a 1 hour 2 4 plot rainfall simulation tests to better understand rainfall runoff relationships and thereby evaluate the runoff coefficient rainfall simulation tests were done on different topographic locations in the watershed the sprinkler system that has been used has an adjustable flow rate ranging from 0 1 to 10 l min using a rotating sprinkler system with a radius of 0 92 m covering an area of 2 65 m2 to accommodate the high spatial variability of the surface topography the sprinkler was designed to be adjustable to different height ranges 1 2 and 3 m height which corresponds to surface plot areas of 2 4 and 9 m2 respectively four designed rainfall tests were done in the catchment with flow rate at 1l minute and a surface runoff area of 2 65 m2 that is equivalent to about 25 mm h of rainfall intensity 2 5 terrace restoration parts of the flood control system have been revived through restoration of four check dams out of a total of 115 installations in the wadi these were on the main channel and included two which lay upstream from the flow monitoring system described above and two which were downstream these were built with local stones and according to the dimensions that best reflected the nature of the remains seen at the specific location where the interventions were conducted in compliance with regulations of unesco and the jordanian department of antiquities with delineation of original fabric using only reversible material the constructed terraces have allowed for monitoring of how these interventions change the flow of water both through the use of the flood gage as well as through the measurement of high water marks left after each event 2 6 hydrological and hydraulic modeling a digital elevation model of a 0 5 m spatial resolution based on the results of the aforementioned section 2 1 is utilized in this study a much finer resolution dem is available through the survey but the 0 5 m provides a good balance between high resolution and acceptable run and processing times the watershed was delineated using aquaveo s watershed modeling system wms such that the outlet was at the location of a stream gage in the middle of the wadi the size of the delineated watershed with an outlet set at the stream gage is small 1 km2 it is a longitudinal watershed with a length of approximately 2430 m and a watershed relief of 366 m the maximum longitudinal slope of the wadi can be as high as 0 5 m m in the upstream parts of the watershed east of the wadi musa fault with an average slope of approximately 0 27 m m and an average of 0 17 m m in the milder downstream parts of the wadi these extreme changes in the topography dictate the need for high resolution dem to be used in the modeling process see fig 5 the recorded river stages were used in the model calibration the delineated watershed was exported to hec hms in which the rainfall runoff was simulated the two minute recorded precipitation was used as the precipitation in the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms model to simulate the generated runoff at the specified gage location hec hms was set up to utilize the soil conservation services scs curve number for its loss calculation method the outcome of the hec hms model is used as an input to the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras model hec ras can be used to perform 1d or 2d steady and transient flow calculations in addition to sediment transport and water quality modeling in this application the stream flow generated by the hec hms model at the watershed outlet is used as an upstream boundary flow hydrograph in hec ras hec ras was run under a 1d transient state condition one of the most important parameters in the modeling of riverine systems is the manning s roughness coefficient n a parameter that accounts for the energy loss due to resistance of the terrain to water movement its value depends on type and composition of stream how much debris there is the water level the terrain slope etc the application in this research is non typical since it is a mountainous stream with values for n potentially being more than 0 25 this value is unusually high but is deemed necessary for these kinds of setups ashley a ostraff et al 2018aa 2018ab reid and hickin 2008 several sources outline the reasonable range and the calculation methods for manning s roughness coefficient an analytical technique that is most suitable for calculating manning s n for mountain stream is using the jarrett s equation jarrett 1984 1988 in which the manning s roughness equation is a function of the slope and the hydraulic radius this method is much more applicable for shallow and low flow conditions there are several published variations of the jarrett equation a more recent application of the equation was that of ashley ostraff and rakotoarisaona 2016 and ashley ostraff and rakotoarisaona 2016 in that application the manning s roughness coefficient is given by equation 3 3 n 0 34 s0 36r 0 16 where s is the slope of the water surface the original jarrett equation has the slope of the energy grade line under uniform flow conditions the value of slope of the ground surface is used as the water surface slope ground slope is obtained by aerial survey using the uavs r in equation 3 is the hydraulic radius this equation suggest that manning s n can take values much higher than those commonly presented in classical literature such as chow 1959 in fact values of n were reported at 0 685 ashley a ostraff et al 2018aa 2018ab and can go as high as 7 95 reid and hickin 2008 under very low flow conditions mean depth 0 06 m and low velocity values 0 004 m s these conditions can be very similar to what was observed in the study area where the discharge is small due to the small watershed and the depth is also small due to the extreme bed slopes in this research average values of the slope and the hydraulic radius were obtained for several sections along the wadi subsequently a range value for manning s coefficient is calculated from equation 3 the chosen value within the range is identified such that it gives the best model calibration the performance indicators for the reconstructed check dams height of upstream water after a certain storm and the elevation of water downstream were used as an input to the hydrological hydraulic study for example the high water marks associated with specific storms during the 2019 2020 season were recorded and used for model calibration the rating curve of the dam was calibrated such that the simulated headwater height resembled the observed one the rating curve parameters were used for the rest of the check dams one of the goals of this study was to simulate these dams using a numerical model and evaluate their impact on flood behavior several flow scenarios were investigated the majority of the simulations utilized the flow resulting from the storm that was properly documented and that resulted in the largest runoff during the study duration that of march 13 14 2020 other smaller storms were investigated eg that of february 25 but are not reported here part of the reason for not reporting them was due to either their low runoff depth thus falling close to the error range of the ultrasonic depth measurement device or having some missing data through the storm due to loss in the gsm signal used for transmitting the readings it should be noted also that with the region of the study being arid to semi arid the number of yearly storms is limited other simulations utilized the frequency flows identified in the idf curve for the 10 50 100 and 500 year storms the geometry used in the model included four scenarios the first scenario included no functional check dams which was the existing case before the re construction of the check dams the second involved six check dams resembling all those planned to be re constructed in the field the choice of location of these in the model followed their location in the field choosing which dams to re construct was a function of several factors including hydrological significance of the dam for flood management the availability of reconstruction material on site as well as archeological considerations the third scenario involved a total of 18 check dams to cover the whole study area the location of these eighteen was chosen such that they span through the whole study area the fourth involved a larger single dam of 10 m height that was placed in a rather central location the 10 m dam was introduced to compare its performance to several smaller size check dams this 10 m dam was proposed in a recent consultation study as a flood management intervention unisco 2020 see fig 6 for location of the dams in the different modeling scenarios note that scenario 1 has no functional dams the rating curve of the various dams was generated using the methods proposed in the work of fadhil mohamed al mohammed 2015 in his work he studied flow through gabions and stone weirs he developed an equation for the upstream head of the water as a function of flow rate per unit width through the check dam the length of the dam in the direction of flow and the gabion stone size the developed equation had a high coefficient of determination 0 94 and therefore was rearranged to produce the discharge as a function of the upstream water height i e the rating curve the rearranged equation takes the following form 4 q w h u d m 0 34 1 607 l 0 349 1 0 66 where q is the discharge m3 s w is the width of the check dam perpendicular to the flow direction m hu is the upstream water height m l is the length of the check dam in the direction of flow m dm is the mean stone diameter m of the gabion the modeling within this research was particularly challenging as the flow rate was very low even in the event of thunderstorms in addition the terrain is very steep slope varying between 0 11 and 0 5 m m which can result in high localized water velocities and therefore model instabilities for the model to be stabilized the intermediate cross sections were very closely spaced 2 meter spacing due to the relatively high water velocity the computation step had to be lowered significantly so that the water does not skip sections during a single time step resulting in model instability 3 results based on the extensive surveys and orthomosaic map generation locations for the interventions were identified the locations of check dam re construction and pictures of some dams before and after construction are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively 3 1 rainfall analysis and runoff during this research several storms were recorded at the rain gage station closer to the wadi hremiyyeh fig 9 top illustrates the date and total daily precipitation for the recorded rain events as seen in the fig 9 top the variation in the storm size was significant in addition the antecedent moisture conditions were also different due to the presence of storm prior to the one recorded thus changing the runoff coefficient significantly it should also be noted that while the watershed size is rather small the thunderstorms can be very highly variable spatially and therefore precipitation patterns may not be uniform across the whole area thunderstorm or convection storm season in the study area is in the october november and march april months it was also noted that low precipitation would not result in runoff of significance as the majority of the rainfall will be absorbed by the soil is subject to evaporation fig 9 bottom summarizes the results of the rainfall runoff data for the 2019 2020 season the total rainfall over the watershed after the rainfall events of the 2019 2020 season was then compared with the amount of water ultimately stored behind the rebuilt check dams based on the high water marks recorded there this allowed for the calculation of a runoff coefficient for the drainage basin of the specific events the data is presented in fig 9 bottom the resulting runoff coefficients were highly variable with an average value of 9 but with a standard deviation of 13 the data derived from the rain runoff simulation experiments showed a range of between 16 and 91 runoff coefficients for the various surface types within the catchment area as described in section 2 3 storm events with duration of less than 24 h were extrapolated from the date obtained from the longer record wadi musa meteorological station the originally developed formula for calculating precipitation of frequencies less than 24 h developed by the indian meteorological department equation 2 used an value of three for the purposes of this study the variable in the function was considered a fitting parameter and was optimized based on a series of reported fractions that are listed in table 1 upon optimizing it was found that an x factor of 2 5 in equation 2 gives predictions that best match the ratio values in table 1 the equation was then used to produce idf curve of the city of petra see fig 10 3 2 model development only the storm on 13 14 3 2020 was used for analysis and model calibration as described in section 2 6 fig 11 below shows the delineated model a the recorded precipitation using the installed rain gage b and the corresponding runoff generated using the hec hms software for the storm of 13 14 3 2020 c the software hec ras was then used for transient state hydraulic modeling for the hremiyyeh basin a random subset of 11 stations was selected to identify average values of the parameters needed for identifying manning s roughness coefficient using jarrett s equation equation 3 these parameters are summarized in table 2 the analysis above helped identify a reasonable range of the n values that are suitable for the wadi hremiyyeh terrain the calculated values ranged between 0 17 and 0 31 this parameter can be used for calibration where its value can be altered until a good match is secured between the observed and model predicted flow elevations the storm of march 13 14 2020 was used for model calibration fig 12 a shows the model predicted values of the water depth throughout the day fig 12 b zooms in to the first storm it shows the model and observed results while fig 12 c shows the model and observed results for the second storm during the day the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient for the first storm 12 b was 0 38 while the efficiency coefficient for the second storm 12 c was 0 53 the overall features of the flow are captured but the model tends have a sharp rise to the peak relative to a more gradual and earlier rise of the observed data it can be seen that the lack of match between modeled and observed elevations particularly at high flow values dictated the calculation of the nash sutcliffe coefficient and was the main reason for its relatively low values one other reason is the scatter in the observed values mostly around low flow values which can be attributed to the very shallow flow and rough terrain and the fact that these shallow flows are almost at measurement accuracy of the ultrasonic device nonetheless the overall trend of the flood wave was satisfactorily captured 3 3 flood modeling remnants of ancient terraces and check dams at wadi hremiyyeh demonstrate the construction of large number of rather small up to three meters high structures the developed numerical model was used to study the impact of having several check dams constructed along the wadi fig 13 a shows the result of the number of check dam analysis using the data from the march 13 14 storm it can be seen that 6 dams resulted in delaying the peak discharge by six minutes increasing the number of check dams to 18 on the other hand resulted in delaying the peak discharge by approximately 25 min the number of dams is chosen such that the whole sub basin is covered with check dams that are reasonably spaced several simulations were run in each subsequent run more dams were added in the direction of flow so that by the end the 18 dams would have covered the whole region as shown previously in fig 6 fig 13 b illustrates the reduction in the peak flow as a result of the building several dams while building 6 dams didn t seem to provide much advantage increasing the number to 18 dams resulted in a reduction of approximately 13 5 this is a good benefit given that these check dams are not meant to be water storage structures one proposed solution for managing floodwater in wadi hremiyyeh is a 10 m high earth dam this proposed solution was compared to three other scenarios the first is a no intervention scenario for comparison with the others the second involved simulating 6 check dams within the area of the existing interventions the third involved simulating 18 check dams along the whole wadi results of this simulation are shown in fig 14 in which the results show the minimum peak flow can be achieved using a 10 m high earth dam with a peak flow reduction of 30 5 and a peak flow delay of 14 min the 18 check dam scenario showed the next best performance by achieving peak flow reduction of 13 5 with a peak flow delay of 25 min therefore while it didn t reduce the peak discharge as much as the single dike did it extended the time to peak by approximately 11 min the simulation of the 6 check dams resulted in a peak flow reduction of merely 0 06 with a peak flow delay time of 6 min therefore the desired outcome of the intervention and the limitations such as cost material availability and aesthetic considerations will dictate which type of intervention is better in petra and since prolonging the lag time is an advantage in flood management as it allows enough time to take action the more small size check dams are used the more advantage is gained other locations and setups may require different interventions depending on what gives more advantage to investigate the validity of findings on different storm sizes several other simulations were made utilizing flows from frequency storms of 10 50 100 and 500 years these simulations also investigated the effects of having 6 check dams 18 check dams distributed across the whole wadi and a 10 m dam with respect to the scenario of no interventions the results are shown in fig 15 a summary of the results of the frequency storm analysis is presented in fig 16 it illustrates the percent reduction in flow and delay in peak flow in minutes it can be seen that the peak flow reduction percentage is greatest for the 10 meter dam as opposed to the other scenarios for the 10 50 100 and 500 year storm the percent reduction range between 24 and 34 for the different storms the scenario that ranks second is the 18 dam scenario where the reduction ranges between 13 5 and 24 the analysis on the reduction to time of peak showed a clear advantage for the 18 dam scenario where the delay could reach up to 24 min relative to a maximum delay of 11 min for the 10 m dam these findings are consistent with those obtained with the analysis on march 13 14 storm 4 discussion and conclusions magnitude and severity of flash floods are a function of not only precipitation magnitude and intensity but also on the basin characteristics particularly land use vegetative cover soil type and geomorphology mohammed abdel fattah et al 2017 in arid and semi arid regions vegetative cover is slim most of the areas within the watershed are non urbanized and therefore geomorphology and soil type are the most significant factors one of the main challenges in modelling flooding in such areas is the lack of a consistent rain runoff relationship that can be used to anticipate flooding it was observed that relatively high runoff coefficients were either associated with high moisture conditions of the soil as seen through historical records of previous day precipitation or as a result of extended periods of active precipitation for the whole storm duration it was also observed that a daily precipitation of more than 10 mm is needed to produce a runoff coefficient of 5 or more comparisons between the measured rain runoff relationships derived from the physical rainfall simulation tests at specific locations and those measured herein show that the lower range seen in the simulations 16 are slightly higher than those seen using basin wide analysis 9 on the other hand the higher range up to 91 seen on bare rock and some loose sands is significantly higher than what is observed basin wide these observations suggest that much of what flows off the low permeability surfaces is absorbed by the soils that intersect the flow of water the modeling results show that the impact of the check dams is not so much to lower the volume of flow as much as to delay the flooding events and to spread out the peak over a longer time period this observation is particularly true for cases where the number of check dams are limited the more check dams there are the less permeable they become with time due to accumulation of silt within the check dam and they can hold back more water thus in our area of investigation this provides an explanation for why the nabataeans built so many dams in the wadi as a means of managing floods while the models suggest a 24 minute delay in flooding as a result of a 10 year event intercepted by 18 dams by extrapolation 115 dams in the wadi could result in a more than two hours of delay in the arrival of the peak flow assuming that all the dams are concurrently operational in modern day petra this delay can be very important in properly notifying tourists and locals to evacuate low lands if needed such a delay may have also have been important in earlier times as well as local watch posts may have been able to send advanced warning to the people downstream this result while presented for the case of petra is applicable to all sites worldwide utilizing similar interventions it can also be noted as seen previously in fig 13 b that a reduction of 13 5 in the peak discharge can be achieved by introducing 18 check dams relative to not having any dams this helps in minimizing the flood impacts of storms even if the amount of water reduction was not considered very significant it is probable that the amount of sediment movement was much more significantly reduced as attested by the later siltation of these structures the delay achieved by increasing the number of check dams can also be very important in limiting the aggregation of the peak flow from various wadis and thus reducing the overall combined peak discharge while outside the scope of this project it would be useful to conduct a wider scope analysis on all the wadis contributing to the area of interest the courtyard of the treasury in this case such that the number of dams to be constructed is optimized to allow for different peak times from each wadi the models on flood management scenarios suggest that while the 10 m high dam results in the lowest peak discharge it falls generally second in lag time elongation after the scenario of the 18 check dams the peak discharge for the larger return period storms is delayed for the small dams see fig 16 as opposed to a sharper increase in the flow seen for the 10 meter dam in the particular location of petra the difference in the amount of discharge is insufficient to justify the damage to the aesthetic value caused by constructing the 10 meter dam at the site or to the legal status conferred to the site by virtue of its world heritage status choosing among alternatives goes beyond the efficiency of the alternative in flood mitigation to considerations of economics safety and aesthetics particularly in petra therefore in petra the smaller size 3 m high check dams are less invasive less expensive are more consistent with ancient practices and provide very satisfactory results in addition to being more fitting to a site of such a statues the smaller size dams have historically been used due to structural stability and ease of construction in addition to their advantage in being much easier and cheaper to maintain than the larger alternatives this work has demonstrated their superiority in flood management as well same finding is applicable to different parts of the world where such small scale interventions can be applicable the performance of the check dams is clear when analyzing the peak flow reduction and the time to peak increase for the frequency storms installing more dams clearly helps with reducing peak discharge and increasing the time to peak discharge this is particularly true in more intense and less frequent storm events which may have been the intention of the flood control system devised by nabataean engineers initially fig 16 summarizes these improvements whether the intervention of choice is a larger dam or a series of smaller dams continuous monitoring should be done once the intervention is done long term effect on the performance of the intervention in terms of structural stability siltation and flow delay and reduction should be assessed changes with time are expected due to the accumulation of sediments behind and inside the check dams thereby reducing the active storage capacity and minimizing the flow through rate these studies are important for assessing the need for continuous maintenance and building new dams in addition sediment transport modeling should be done on the site to assess the impact of these check dams in reducing the overall sediment load carried downstream the site would additionally benefit from continuous monitoring of soil erosion rates through terrestrial laser scanning techniques funding this research was funded by the united states ambassadors fund for cultural preservation 2017

4271,evaluating the function and effectiveness of the nabatean flash flood management system in petra requires both insight into the nature and extent of the system as well as its hydrological information studies of runoff and flooding in semi arid mountainous regions with high potential for flash floods such as petra can be limited by the lack of any runoff measurements as well as low resolution rainfall and terrain data wadi hremiyyeh is a small catchment that flows into the treasury plaza and is responsible for much of the flooding that occurs there half meter spatial resolution digital elevation model dem was built for this catchment using unmanned aerial vehicles uav surveying which was useful in determining the exact sites of terraces built by the nabataeans for flood management rainfall data from the nearby wadi musa station was supplemented with a new station installed through this project for continuous precipitation measurements at the site new water level meters specifically designed for that purpose were installed within the main channel four of the ancient nabataean and post nabataean check dams were restored data collected from the 2019 2020 rainy season created an understanding of the rain runoff conditions at the site and was utilized in constructing and calibrating hydrological models using hec hms and hec ras software the function and the effectiveness of the rebuilt terraces were evaluated the models suggest that terraces are effective at delaying the flood peak time up to 25 minute delay for an 18 dam setup and at reducing the actual amount of water arriving downstream 13 5 volume reduction similar results can be observed for lower frequency flood analysis in which the models also show effectiveness of these interventions modeling of a large dam rather than the smaller terraces and check dams shows that such an intervention would result in a reduction of 30 5 in peak flow but a delay of the peak of merely 14 min while petra was the venue for this work its techniques and suggested parameters are applicable to cases of similar arid and semi arid mountainous regions that are subjected to flash floods keywords check dams numerical modeling environmental monitoring hec ras flash floods semi arid 1 introduction flooding has always been a challenge for settled peoples especially given their tendency to congregate in river valleys each drainage system offers a different set of challenges in the nile valley the predictability of annual floods allowed for the planning of their agricultural cycle mays 2010 in contrast the tigris and euphrates rivers have less predictable flooding patterns that are also temporally misaligned with the cropping pattern this necessitated an elaborate high maintenance water management system tamburrino 2010 that led to widespread soil and groundwater salination due to poor understanding of the irrigation system tamburrino 2010 in addition to flood management for agriculture societies in riverine urban settings also manage floods to protect cities in ancient china ongoing flood hazards led to consistent efforts through urban planning and flood water diversion qingzhou 1989 in pre columbian america flood management was also an important component of urban planning and design davis salazar 2006 similar approaches were implemented in urfa by emperor justinian in the 6th century ce kürkçüoğlu et al 2013 despite the long established human engineering experience with the problem of flooding most of the water management examples are utilized for irrigation and urban planning are related to perennial rivers with predictable flooding patterns while our research focuses on arid environments excess water and flooding provided an issue for tropical maya cities of the classic period as well chase and cesaretti 2019 scarborough and sierra 2015 šprajc et al 2021 however in a similarly arid but less rugged environment than our study area another exception to this can be found at the ancient site of persepolis in persia where builders utilized runoff water from the adjacent hill while alleviating flooding at the same time moradi jalal et al 2010 relative to persepolis the experience of the nabateans in petra is unique as people generally avoided low lying areas in tightly constrained valleys susceptible to the devastating impacts of flash flooding as the nature of the site dictated that it would be settled and urbanized the nabateans tried to live up to the challenges that the site imposed typical channeling and diverting of water that has been seen in other areas was used here but was insufficient for a city situated under steep cliffs with multiple sources of flash floods these flash floods would channel through narrow gorges that were heavily utilized as the entrance of petra moreover sediments and debris left behind after flood events would have been a recurring problem to manage the unique nature of the challenges that faced petra and of the interventions that were used provides an important case study the flood control system used here which consisted of a large number of terraces gabions and check dams was found in disrepair because of siltation destruction and gullying this paper documents an attempt to revive this system and evaluate the hydrological impacts that it made on the drainage basin the insights gained exceeds the simple curiosity of how the ancient nabateans managed the problem of flash floods but may provide lessons on how flash floods particularly in urban areas may be managed in the modern world it has been strongly suggested that revival of ancient agricultural terrace techniques is a key to future sustainability though this remains more of an idea that is generally relegated to the imagination fisher 2020 similarly the idea of reviving the use of cisterns for rainwater collection in modern urban contexts has generated much interest recently awawdeh et al 2012 the nabateans relied on springs for the majority of their water needs though the collection of water in numerous cisterns throughout the area was extensive laureano 2001 1 1 petra and wadi hremiyyeh the physical setting and climate of petra which is part of the wadi musa drainage basin make it particularly susceptible to flash floods the steep slopes that run from the sharah mountain 1600 masl in the east towards petra 900 masl over about 6 km are characterized by thin loose soil and has poor plant cover while the average annual rainfall in the area is relatively low 178 mm as shown in fig 1 it often occurs as sudden cloud bursts associated with the convective storm events of the red sea trough al qudah 2011 when such events pass a threshold estimated to be at an average of about 22 mm day runoff can be generated and flash floods become possible alhasanat 2014 rain runoff experiments in the area show that runoff begins between 10 and 17 min after initiating simulations of 25 mm hour this translates to between 4 and 7 mm of rainfall for the initiation of runoff al qudah et al 2016 the degree of the saturation of soil effects this amount runoff coefficients were reported ranging between 16 and 91 al qudah et al 2016 the wadi hremiyyeh catchment is part of the larger drainage basin of wadi musa that joins the wadi after the siq entrance at the treasury plaza the catchment has an area of 1 1 km2 the maximum elevation in the basin may rise up to 1378 m above msl its lowest elevation drops to 1012 m above msl with a maximum catchment relief of 365 m the headwater of the wadi hremiyyeh catchment begins at the highlands of the sharah mountain with characteristic upper cretaceous limestone outcrops of the wadi sir and the undifferentiated fuhais hummar and wadi shuaib formations and is rising to the east of the tertiary wadi musa fault barjous 2003 drainage flows across the fault towards the center of petra through exposures of the cambrian umm ishrin and the ordovician disi formations the average slope is about 0 27 m m in this area the area of interest is to the west of the wadi musa fault within the exposures of the umm ishrin and disi sandstone formations across this area coarse calcareous sandy soil and colluvium deposits overlay the bed rock with exposures of various types of terrestrial carbonates some of which could be used to determine the locations and heights of now destroyed terraces and check dams abu jaber et al 2020 sparse desert shrubs are spread on the slopes downstream to the west of the wadi musa fault below 1080 m above msl the average slope of the stream becomes more gentle 0 17 m m and only the umm ishrin sandstone is exposed all the way to the catchment outlet where it pours water right next to the treasury monument of petra the downstream terrain is mostly bare rock with rough topography on either side of the wadi hremiyyeh stream the catchment of wadi hremiyyeh has a longitudinal shape with the longest axis being 2430 m long the area where much of the ancient flood control measures were implemented lies at and directly to the west of the wadi musa fault where the maximum slope is observed this area was also the focus of this investigation 1 2 historical flooding and flood management in petra flooding in petra is an issue that has had to be dealt with since the city was first established in the 2nd century bce archaeological excavations beneath the treasury have shown that early 1st century bce tombs were buried in flood deposits to a depth of 2 6 m while an early façade of the treasury that is 5 4 m high was completely buried by sediment prior to the carving of the current iconic façade farajat and nawafleh 2005 it is estimated that the entire sequence of building in the area happened over a period of only 40 years during which sediment deposits from at least 15 flood events were laid farajat and nawafleh 2005 paradoxically there is no evidence of major sediment deposition after the carving of the upper façade i e in the last 1900 years suggesting that interventions in the drainage basin resulted in the desired effect of mitigating flooding and sediment deposition in the courtyard in front of the treasury as illustrated in fig 2 the main interventions included the diversion of water that had previously flowed through wadi musa the siq and through the wadi al mudhlim diversion canal system bellwald 2008 the dams serve both to divert the water and to trap large amounts of sediments carried with the water bellwald 2008 however the impact of flash floods exceeds the area of the siq and the treasury and could lead to blocking or damaging of structures and leading to siltation of fields dams and cisterns and road systems hamarneh 2020 moreover in this arid environment this flowing water could not be allowed to go to waste thus it was fundamental to collect and store it for the later hot and dry seasons of the year this situation is similar to that prevalent in other arid regions while the use of dams cisterns and various distribution networks helped alleviate some of the water shortages the storage capacity in these systems was sufficient for domestic use on the other hand the capacity for storing water in the form of soil moisture allows for substantial potential which can be best used in dryland agriculture hamarneh 2020 through time the inhabitants of petra developed water management strategies to mitigate surface water flow and to divert and store it in soil as well as in cisterns and dams the earliest water management interventions started around the iron ii but the most extensive development took place with the nabataeans period onwards hamarneh 2020 interventions started at the upper catchment areas with sturdy stepped terraces known as gabions these were constructed to withstand the water flow at the high elevations and prevent the debris downwash these were followed by sets of contour terraces that covered the catchment slopes these were built to intersect sheet flow and protect the scarce soil cover al qudah et al 2016 hamarneh 2020 towards the lower parts of the drainage basins narrow gorges and wadis posed the highest threat of funnelling water down the slope various interventions weirs check dams barrages were introduced at various points of the wadis to slow the water flow and break the flow speed weirs are stone barriers built from collected boulders of few rows and one layer check dams were constructed in the narrow wadies these structures were built in strict proportions depending on the width of the wadi while dams designed for water storage were plastered in order to prevent water leakage check dams were not plastered as its function was to slow the water flow minimize the flow volume and filter out debris hamarneh 2020 another strategy for water flow control was diversion by means of constructing barriers such as barrages these were built within the middle of a catchment area as the slope gradient varied their concave shape down the slope prevented the water from flowing down the slope redirecting its flow sideways to other wadies or to storage facilities such as cisterns small gullies were mitigated by means of weirs which were generally placed at the lower segment of the catchment interventions were sometimes instituted at the level of the building in the case of the theater runoff water from rainwater falling on and near the site was carefully diverted in a system of pipes and channels through and away from the structure towards the natural drainage channel hammond 1965 while largely effective there is evidence of devastating flooding sometime between the earthquake of 363 ce and the middle of the 5th century paradise 2012 flooding has been an ongoing process until now akasheh 2018 1 3 the terraces of the study area numerous ancient terraces of various forms cover the whole of the east and southwest slopes of wadi hremiyyeh their function is to retain the soil interrupt the surface flow and prevent gully development from the surface pottery collection it becomes clear that these terraces were constructed exploited and maintained from the nabataean until the early byzantine periods with some minimum exploitation during the 9th century a d hamarneh 2020 the first dam of those located in the middle of the catchment area was constructed to intersect two gullies developing at the upper segment of the catchment area and is part of a complex structure that is linked with adjacent terraces for support its construction resembles a contour terrace with a facing wall and a fill this was constructed of irregular limestone boulders of a lower craftsmanship within the middle catchment area a set of six check dams were the focus of this investigation these terraces were of the pyramidal type constructed of a facing wall and retaining wall with a fill their thickness varied between 1 and 3 m their length depended on the wadi width approximately ranging between 6 and 35 m while the vertical distances varied between 16 and 40 m apart one check dam number 5 extended for approximately 20 m was around 2 m high and had a thickness of about 1 m this check dam was constructed in a narrow deep part of the wadi and was silted over these terraces were laid of regular unhewn stones of local material mainly white limestone chiseled from the fallen debris of the upper cretaceous limestone formations outcropping at the upper catchment and were mixed with stones taken from the red umm ishrin sandstone outcropping within the wadi large boulders were placed in the lower courses with intermediate stones towards the middle and upper courses and small stones placed in between to anchor the stones 1 4 rationale and approach to this study studying flash floods in arid areas and in petra in particular is challenging from a hydraulic hydrologic perspective nearly every piece of information required for the proper understanding of flash floods in the area is insufficient to non existent rainfall data for example is available from the records of the wadi musa meteorological station however the data is constrained to daily rainfall readings up to a few years ago after which 6 h readings are available flash flood events typically happen over the course of a few minutes up to an hour or so in order to evaluate flooding events it would be preferable if higher temporal resolutions could be available moreover often the convective storms that cause flood events are highly variable in their spatial distribution al qudah 2011 this makes reliance on one station problematic the small area of the wadi hremiyyeh drainage basin creates its own challenges this is because the terrain within this area is highly variable in terms of slope and soil cover geological outcrops and vegetation cover this variability is difficult to assess using the available maps and digital elevation models dem which do not have the needed resolution to be used for modeling runoff particularly given the very irregular nature of the wadies existing maps and dem also do not have the resolution to allow for an understanding of the ancient terrace and dam distributions in the area from a hydraulic modeling standpoint the extremely low flow rates due to the small basin area make it very difficult to perform stable unsteady stats simulations to the best of the authors knowledge all the studies addressing the petra floods have relied on either generic data or official low resolution records of rain as well as low to medium resolution dems the hydrological impacts of terracing and other flood control interventions have scarcely been addressed in those studies al weshah and el khoury 1999 this study utilizes different data sources including uav based remote sensing techniques for creating a high resolution dem documenting as built ancient terraces and check dams and a network of rain and home built stream gages this study starts by understanding rainfall and runoff patterns and then developing a hydrologic numerical model for rainfall runoff predictions and a hydraulic numerical model for unsteady flow simulations the models are further used for evaluating the effect of the ancient terracing techniques for flood management and compares the performance of different alternatives for modern day flood management this is based on the outcomes of rebuilding of some of these collapsed structures finally the lack of availability of instrumentation and tools needed to measure runoff in the area poses a significant constraint on quantifying flood events and constructing the hydrographs for them while some stations have been established in the wadi musa drainage basin none has been established at wadi hremiyyeh additionally the existing monitoring stations are susceptible to vandalism other problems and obtaining useful information from them was not possible hence the advantage of the home designed and built monitoring system 2 materials and methods to study flash floods and the impact ancient terracing has on managing them a number of activites were performed these activities involved performing site surveys and detailed documentation of the archeological site for the purpose of identifying the baseline condition a topographic survey to get elevations developing and installing an environmental monitoring system to measure essential data of rain and flow collecting and analyzing of data and finally the development of numerical models for prediction of the performance of the system fig 3 shows an overall schematic of research 2 1 high resolution topographic survey accurate three dimensional 3d reconstruction of ones surroundings has become essential for non traditional mapping applications such as urban planning environmental monitoring infrastructure monitoring archaeological and heritage documentation and flash flood management and monitoring lari et al 2015 al rawabdeh et al 2016 recent advances in uavs or drones and hardware and software development have made it possible to conduct accurate 3d mapping through cost efficient time efficient and high end data acquisition systems al rawabdeh et al 2016 in this study uav based mapping systems provided high quality mapping products i e 3d point cloud generation dem and orthomosaic while bridging a big gap in terms of the extent of the area to be mapped as well as resolve accessibility constraints between traditional terrestrial and airborne applications the orthomosaic map allowed us to generate detailed information and documentation of about 115 ancient check dams and terraces with different conditions within the wadi hremiyyeh drainage basin an aerial survey of the wadi hremiyyeh catchment area was acquired on dec 23 2017 using a customized dji phantom ii quadcopter eight missions were conducted at 50 m height above the ground the drone offers approximately 30 min of flight duration on a single battery which is sufficient to cover up to 500 m2 area the drone has a gimbal stabilized dji zenmuse h4 3d camera containing the gopro hero black with a relatively wide field of view fov of 94 a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 20 mm in a medium view angle mode the camera was calibrated before the flight mission by the laboratory of applied geoinformatics yarmouk university jordan to derive an accurate estimation of the internal camera characteristics this information is essential for the 3d object space reconstruction out of the 2d image space i e 3d point cloud generation dem and orthomosaic al rawabdeh 2014 a total of 3358 high resolution aerial images with a 75 overlap in flying direction and a 70 side lap between adjacent flight lines were acquired from eight flight missions and geotagged using the quadcopter s navigational gps global positioning system containing its positioning information twelve 50 cm 50 cm survey targets were used as ground control points gcps and checkpoints cp 7 gcps and 5 cp which were essential for accurately geo referencing the final data al rawabdeh et al 2017 the coordinates for gcps and cp were surveyed at a centimeter level accuracy using a dual frequency real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite systems gnss trimble spectra precision sp80 receiver 2020 the 3d model associated dem and orthomosaic products were then created using agisoft metashape professional software 2020 based on the uav acquired dataset a global bundle adjustment with the gcps was applied in order to refine the estimated parameters and spatial geo referencing accuracy of dem the accuracy and the reliability of the topographical survey model have been performed through independent checks using 7 gcps and 5 cps a good match was found between the 3d topographical model and the verification cps points average accuracy of overall cps ground model x y and z found to be 6 cm 4 cm and 8 cm respectively and the average rmse values of gcps is less than 9 cm 2 2 site instrumentation environmental and hydrogeological monitoring systems can be expensive especially when many sensors are needed expense can be compounded by vandalism especially when sensors are installed in remote locations for these reasons several in house designed and built low cost monitoring rainfall and stream gage measurement units were developed and deployed in the wadi hremiyyeh and around petra with their small footprint and contained nature their potential for vandalism was reduced data recorded using these units were stored locally and transmitted via global system for mobile communications gsm in near real time to a specially prepared website where the results are displayed and stored for further analysis details of the development and deployment of the measurement devices can be found at qasem abdelal 2020 qasem m abdelal and nizar abu jaber 2019 fig 4 shows the examples of the deployed devices at the project location 2 3 precipitation analysis total daily precipitation data were obtained for the nearby wadi musa station for the period between may 1st 1984 and dec 31st 2018 there was missing data at the end of the years 2011 2012 and 2014 data was analyzed and an intensity duration frequency idf curve was created several studies presented values for intensity duration and frequency of precipitation in petra alhasanat 2014 and al weshah and el khoury 1999 or the yearly rainfall records akasheh 2018 yet an illustration of the method for calculation of the idf curve and the extraction of the n hour storm out of the 24 h storm is necessary this study addresses that method daily precipitation values were obtained for 33 years and an analysis of the data using the empirical plotting position approach ven te chow and mays 1988 violina basumatary 2018 was done the annual maximum 24hr precipitation was extracted from the data set the return period t was obtained by applying the weibull plotting position formula as given in equation 1 and the probability of exceedance p in years is the reciprocal of the return period 1 t n 1 m where n is the number of years of rainfall used in the analysis and m is the rank of the event a curve fitting technique microsoft excel s trendline analysis is used to identify a direct relation between the rainfall intensity and the return period from which the corresponding intensities to known predefined return periods were obtained the obtained intensities are for 24 hour durations since there are no historical records for lower frequency precipitation those had to be obtained mathematically one approach which has been used extensively al mamun et al 2018 chowdhury 2007 munshi md rasel 2015 violina basumatary 2018 is that of the indian meteorological department in which the precipitation pt at a certain time t is a function of the total precipitation in 24hr p24 see equation 2 in original formula the variable x holds a value of 3 in this study it was dealt with as an optimization parameter to accommodate local conditions 2 p t p 24 t 24 1 x several works describe approaches for obtaining n hour precipitation based on 24hr precipitation records the standard natural resources conservation services nrcs types i and ii synthetic rainfall distributions have been used for design and planning united states department of agriculture 2015 the original documentation of their development is not available and thus their use is limited to cases where the national oceanic and atmospheric association noaa atlas 14 is valid geoffrey m bonnin 2011 the atlas was developed based on rain stations with daily records of more than twenty years and hourly records of more than 15 years volume 1 of the atlas covers areas with climatic resemblance to jordan and thus the ratios for 5 min 10 min 15 min and 30 min were used in the analysis in this research to optimize the x parameter in equation 2 table 1 shows the ratios of the precipitation of the designated time of the storm 5 min to 30 min with respect to that of a 1 hour 2 4 plot rainfall simulation tests to better understand rainfall runoff relationships and thereby evaluate the runoff coefficient rainfall simulation tests were done on different topographic locations in the watershed the sprinkler system that has been used has an adjustable flow rate ranging from 0 1 to 10 l min using a rotating sprinkler system with a radius of 0 92 m covering an area of 2 65 m2 to accommodate the high spatial variability of the surface topography the sprinkler was designed to be adjustable to different height ranges 1 2 and 3 m height which corresponds to surface plot areas of 2 4 and 9 m2 respectively four designed rainfall tests were done in the catchment with flow rate at 1l minute and a surface runoff area of 2 65 m2 that is equivalent to about 25 mm h of rainfall intensity 2 5 terrace restoration parts of the flood control system have been revived through restoration of four check dams out of a total of 115 installations in the wadi these were on the main channel and included two which lay upstream from the flow monitoring system described above and two which were downstream these were built with local stones and according to the dimensions that best reflected the nature of the remains seen at the specific location where the interventions were conducted in compliance with regulations of unesco and the jordanian department of antiquities with delineation of original fabric using only reversible material the constructed terraces have allowed for monitoring of how these interventions change the flow of water both through the use of the flood gage as well as through the measurement of high water marks left after each event 2 6 hydrological and hydraulic modeling a digital elevation model of a 0 5 m spatial resolution based on the results of the aforementioned section 2 1 is utilized in this study a much finer resolution dem is available through the survey but the 0 5 m provides a good balance between high resolution and acceptable run and processing times the watershed was delineated using aquaveo s watershed modeling system wms such that the outlet was at the location of a stream gage in the middle of the wadi the size of the delineated watershed with an outlet set at the stream gage is small 1 km2 it is a longitudinal watershed with a length of approximately 2430 m and a watershed relief of 366 m the maximum longitudinal slope of the wadi can be as high as 0 5 m m in the upstream parts of the watershed east of the wadi musa fault with an average slope of approximately 0 27 m m and an average of 0 17 m m in the milder downstream parts of the wadi these extreme changes in the topography dictate the need for high resolution dem to be used in the modeling process see fig 5 the recorded river stages were used in the model calibration the delineated watershed was exported to hec hms in which the rainfall runoff was simulated the two minute recorded precipitation was used as the precipitation in the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms model to simulate the generated runoff at the specified gage location hec hms was set up to utilize the soil conservation services scs curve number for its loss calculation method the outcome of the hec hms model is used as an input to the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras model hec ras can be used to perform 1d or 2d steady and transient flow calculations in addition to sediment transport and water quality modeling in this application the stream flow generated by the hec hms model at the watershed outlet is used as an upstream boundary flow hydrograph in hec ras hec ras was run under a 1d transient state condition one of the most important parameters in the modeling of riverine systems is the manning s roughness coefficient n a parameter that accounts for the energy loss due to resistance of the terrain to water movement its value depends on type and composition of stream how much debris there is the water level the terrain slope etc the application in this research is non typical since it is a mountainous stream with values for n potentially being more than 0 25 this value is unusually high but is deemed necessary for these kinds of setups ashley a ostraff et al 2018aa 2018ab reid and hickin 2008 several sources outline the reasonable range and the calculation methods for manning s roughness coefficient an analytical technique that is most suitable for calculating manning s n for mountain stream is using the jarrett s equation jarrett 1984 1988 in which the manning s roughness equation is a function of the slope and the hydraulic radius this method is much more applicable for shallow and low flow conditions there are several published variations of the jarrett equation a more recent application of the equation was that of ashley ostraff and rakotoarisaona 2016 and ashley ostraff and rakotoarisaona 2016 in that application the manning s roughness coefficient is given by equation 3 3 n 0 34 s0 36r 0 16 where s is the slope of the water surface the original jarrett equation has the slope of the energy grade line under uniform flow conditions the value of slope of the ground surface is used as the water surface slope ground slope is obtained by aerial survey using the uavs r in equation 3 is the hydraulic radius this equation suggest that manning s n can take values much higher than those commonly presented in classical literature such as chow 1959 in fact values of n were reported at 0 685 ashley a ostraff et al 2018aa 2018ab and can go as high as 7 95 reid and hickin 2008 under very low flow conditions mean depth 0 06 m and low velocity values 0 004 m s these conditions can be very similar to what was observed in the study area where the discharge is small due to the small watershed and the depth is also small due to the extreme bed slopes in this research average values of the slope and the hydraulic radius were obtained for several sections along the wadi subsequently a range value for manning s coefficient is calculated from equation 3 the chosen value within the range is identified such that it gives the best model calibration the performance indicators for the reconstructed check dams height of upstream water after a certain storm and the elevation of water downstream were used as an input to the hydrological hydraulic study for example the high water marks associated with specific storms during the 2019 2020 season were recorded and used for model calibration the rating curve of the dam was calibrated such that the simulated headwater height resembled the observed one the rating curve parameters were used for the rest of the check dams one of the goals of this study was to simulate these dams using a numerical model and evaluate their impact on flood behavior several flow scenarios were investigated the majority of the simulations utilized the flow resulting from the storm that was properly documented and that resulted in the largest runoff during the study duration that of march 13 14 2020 other smaller storms were investigated eg that of february 25 but are not reported here part of the reason for not reporting them was due to either their low runoff depth thus falling close to the error range of the ultrasonic depth measurement device or having some missing data through the storm due to loss in the gsm signal used for transmitting the readings it should be noted also that with the region of the study being arid to semi arid the number of yearly storms is limited other simulations utilized the frequency flows identified in the idf curve for the 10 50 100 and 500 year storms the geometry used in the model included four scenarios the first scenario included no functional check dams which was the existing case before the re construction of the check dams the second involved six check dams resembling all those planned to be re constructed in the field the choice of location of these in the model followed their location in the field choosing which dams to re construct was a function of several factors including hydrological significance of the dam for flood management the availability of reconstruction material on site as well as archeological considerations the third scenario involved a total of 18 check dams to cover the whole study area the location of these eighteen was chosen such that they span through the whole study area the fourth involved a larger single dam of 10 m height that was placed in a rather central location the 10 m dam was introduced to compare its performance to several smaller size check dams this 10 m dam was proposed in a recent consultation study as a flood management intervention unisco 2020 see fig 6 for location of the dams in the different modeling scenarios note that scenario 1 has no functional dams the rating curve of the various dams was generated using the methods proposed in the work of fadhil mohamed al mohammed 2015 in his work he studied flow through gabions and stone weirs he developed an equation for the upstream head of the water as a function of flow rate per unit width through the check dam the length of the dam in the direction of flow and the gabion stone size the developed equation had a high coefficient of determination 0 94 and therefore was rearranged to produce the discharge as a function of the upstream water height i e the rating curve the rearranged equation takes the following form 4 q w h u d m 0 34 1 607 l 0 349 1 0 66 where q is the discharge m3 s w is the width of the check dam perpendicular to the flow direction m hu is the upstream water height m l is the length of the check dam in the direction of flow m dm is the mean stone diameter m of the gabion the modeling within this research was particularly challenging as the flow rate was very low even in the event of thunderstorms in addition the terrain is very steep slope varying between 0 11 and 0 5 m m which can result in high localized water velocities and therefore model instabilities for the model to be stabilized the intermediate cross sections were very closely spaced 2 meter spacing due to the relatively high water velocity the computation step had to be lowered significantly so that the water does not skip sections during a single time step resulting in model instability 3 results based on the extensive surveys and orthomosaic map generation locations for the interventions were identified the locations of check dam re construction and pictures of some dams before and after construction are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively 3 1 rainfall analysis and runoff during this research several storms were recorded at the rain gage station closer to the wadi hremiyyeh fig 9 top illustrates the date and total daily precipitation for the recorded rain events as seen in the fig 9 top the variation in the storm size was significant in addition the antecedent moisture conditions were also different due to the presence of storm prior to the one recorded thus changing the runoff coefficient significantly it should also be noted that while the watershed size is rather small the thunderstorms can be very highly variable spatially and therefore precipitation patterns may not be uniform across the whole area thunderstorm or convection storm season in the study area is in the october november and march april months it was also noted that low precipitation would not result in runoff of significance as the majority of the rainfall will be absorbed by the soil is subject to evaporation fig 9 bottom summarizes the results of the rainfall runoff data for the 2019 2020 season the total rainfall over the watershed after the rainfall events of the 2019 2020 season was then compared with the amount of water ultimately stored behind the rebuilt check dams based on the high water marks recorded there this allowed for the calculation of a runoff coefficient for the drainage basin of the specific events the data is presented in fig 9 bottom the resulting runoff coefficients were highly variable with an average value of 9 but with a standard deviation of 13 the data derived from the rain runoff simulation experiments showed a range of between 16 and 91 runoff coefficients for the various surface types within the catchment area as described in section 2 3 storm events with duration of less than 24 h were extrapolated from the date obtained from the longer record wadi musa meteorological station the originally developed formula for calculating precipitation of frequencies less than 24 h developed by the indian meteorological department equation 2 used an value of three for the purposes of this study the variable in the function was considered a fitting parameter and was optimized based on a series of reported fractions that are listed in table 1 upon optimizing it was found that an x factor of 2 5 in equation 2 gives predictions that best match the ratio values in table 1 the equation was then used to produce idf curve of the city of petra see fig 10 3 2 model development only the storm on 13 14 3 2020 was used for analysis and model calibration as described in section 2 6 fig 11 below shows the delineated model a the recorded precipitation using the installed rain gage b and the corresponding runoff generated using the hec hms software for the storm of 13 14 3 2020 c the software hec ras was then used for transient state hydraulic modeling for the hremiyyeh basin a random subset of 11 stations was selected to identify average values of the parameters needed for identifying manning s roughness coefficient using jarrett s equation equation 3 these parameters are summarized in table 2 the analysis above helped identify a reasonable range of the n values that are suitable for the wadi hremiyyeh terrain the calculated values ranged between 0 17 and 0 31 this parameter can be used for calibration where its value can be altered until a good match is secured between the observed and model predicted flow elevations the storm of march 13 14 2020 was used for model calibration fig 12 a shows the model predicted values of the water depth throughout the day fig 12 b zooms in to the first storm it shows the model and observed results while fig 12 c shows the model and observed results for the second storm during the day the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient for the first storm 12 b was 0 38 while the efficiency coefficient for the second storm 12 c was 0 53 the overall features of the flow are captured but the model tends have a sharp rise to the peak relative to a more gradual and earlier rise of the observed data it can be seen that the lack of match between modeled and observed elevations particularly at high flow values dictated the calculation of the nash sutcliffe coefficient and was the main reason for its relatively low values one other reason is the scatter in the observed values mostly around low flow values which can be attributed to the very shallow flow and rough terrain and the fact that these shallow flows are almost at measurement accuracy of the ultrasonic device nonetheless the overall trend of the flood wave was satisfactorily captured 3 3 flood modeling remnants of ancient terraces and check dams at wadi hremiyyeh demonstrate the construction of large number of rather small up to three meters high structures the developed numerical model was used to study the impact of having several check dams constructed along the wadi fig 13 a shows the result of the number of check dam analysis using the data from the march 13 14 storm it can be seen that 6 dams resulted in delaying the peak discharge by six minutes increasing the number of check dams to 18 on the other hand resulted in delaying the peak discharge by approximately 25 min the number of dams is chosen such that the whole sub basin is covered with check dams that are reasonably spaced several simulations were run in each subsequent run more dams were added in the direction of flow so that by the end the 18 dams would have covered the whole region as shown previously in fig 6 fig 13 b illustrates the reduction in the peak flow as a result of the building several dams while building 6 dams didn t seem to provide much advantage increasing the number to 18 dams resulted in a reduction of approximately 13 5 this is a good benefit given that these check dams are not meant to be water storage structures one proposed solution for managing floodwater in wadi hremiyyeh is a 10 m high earth dam this proposed solution was compared to three other scenarios the first is a no intervention scenario for comparison with the others the second involved simulating 6 check dams within the area of the existing interventions the third involved simulating 18 check dams along the whole wadi results of this simulation are shown in fig 14 in which the results show the minimum peak flow can be achieved using a 10 m high earth dam with a peak flow reduction of 30 5 and a peak flow delay of 14 min the 18 check dam scenario showed the next best performance by achieving peak flow reduction of 13 5 with a peak flow delay of 25 min therefore while it didn t reduce the peak discharge as much as the single dike did it extended the time to peak by approximately 11 min the simulation of the 6 check dams resulted in a peak flow reduction of merely 0 06 with a peak flow delay time of 6 min therefore the desired outcome of the intervention and the limitations such as cost material availability and aesthetic considerations will dictate which type of intervention is better in petra and since prolonging the lag time is an advantage in flood management as it allows enough time to take action the more small size check dams are used the more advantage is gained other locations and setups may require different interventions depending on what gives more advantage to investigate the validity of findings on different storm sizes several other simulations were made utilizing flows from frequency storms of 10 50 100 and 500 years these simulations also investigated the effects of having 6 check dams 18 check dams distributed across the whole wadi and a 10 m dam with respect to the scenario of no interventions the results are shown in fig 15 a summary of the results of the frequency storm analysis is presented in fig 16 it illustrates the percent reduction in flow and delay in peak flow in minutes it can be seen that the peak flow reduction percentage is greatest for the 10 meter dam as opposed to the other scenarios for the 10 50 100 and 500 year storm the percent reduction range between 24 and 34 for the different storms the scenario that ranks second is the 18 dam scenario where the reduction ranges between 13 5 and 24 the analysis on the reduction to time of peak showed a clear advantage for the 18 dam scenario where the delay could reach up to 24 min relative to a maximum delay of 11 min for the 10 m dam these findings are consistent with those obtained with the analysis on march 13 14 storm 4 discussion and conclusions magnitude and severity of flash floods are a function of not only precipitation magnitude and intensity but also on the basin characteristics particularly land use vegetative cover soil type and geomorphology mohammed abdel fattah et al 2017 in arid and semi arid regions vegetative cover is slim most of the areas within the watershed are non urbanized and therefore geomorphology and soil type are the most significant factors one of the main challenges in modelling flooding in such areas is the lack of a consistent rain runoff relationship that can be used to anticipate flooding it was observed that relatively high runoff coefficients were either associated with high moisture conditions of the soil as seen through historical records of previous day precipitation or as a result of extended periods of active precipitation for the whole storm duration it was also observed that a daily precipitation of more than 10 mm is needed to produce a runoff coefficient of 5 or more comparisons between the measured rain runoff relationships derived from the physical rainfall simulation tests at specific locations and those measured herein show that the lower range seen in the simulations 16 are slightly higher than those seen using basin wide analysis 9 on the other hand the higher range up to 91 seen on bare rock and some loose sands is significantly higher than what is observed basin wide these observations suggest that much of what flows off the low permeability surfaces is absorbed by the soils that intersect the flow of water the modeling results show that the impact of the check dams is not so much to lower the volume of flow as much as to delay the flooding events and to spread out the peak over a longer time period this observation is particularly true for cases where the number of check dams are limited the more check dams there are the less permeable they become with time due to accumulation of silt within the check dam and they can hold back more water thus in our area of investigation this provides an explanation for why the nabataeans built so many dams in the wadi as a means of managing floods while the models suggest a 24 minute delay in flooding as a result of a 10 year event intercepted by 18 dams by extrapolation 115 dams in the wadi could result in a more than two hours of delay in the arrival of the peak flow assuming that all the dams are concurrently operational in modern day petra this delay can be very important in properly notifying tourists and locals to evacuate low lands if needed such a delay may have also have been important in earlier times as well as local watch posts may have been able to send advanced warning to the people downstream this result while presented for the case of petra is applicable to all sites worldwide utilizing similar interventions it can also be noted as seen previously in fig 13 b that a reduction of 13 5 in the peak discharge can be achieved by introducing 18 check dams relative to not having any dams this helps in minimizing the flood impacts of storms even if the amount of water reduction was not considered very significant it is probable that the amount of sediment movement was much more significantly reduced as attested by the later siltation of these structures the delay achieved by increasing the number of check dams can also be very important in limiting the aggregation of the peak flow from various wadis and thus reducing the overall combined peak discharge while outside the scope of this project it would be useful to conduct a wider scope analysis on all the wadis contributing to the area of interest the courtyard of the treasury in this case such that the number of dams to be constructed is optimized to allow for different peak times from each wadi the models on flood management scenarios suggest that while the 10 m high dam results in the lowest peak discharge it falls generally second in lag time elongation after the scenario of the 18 check dams the peak discharge for the larger return period storms is delayed for the small dams see fig 16 as opposed to a sharper increase in the flow seen for the 10 meter dam in the particular location of petra the difference in the amount of discharge is insufficient to justify the damage to the aesthetic value caused by constructing the 10 meter dam at the site or to the legal status conferred to the site by virtue of its world heritage status choosing among alternatives goes beyond the efficiency of the alternative in flood mitigation to considerations of economics safety and aesthetics particularly in petra therefore in petra the smaller size 3 m high check dams are less invasive less expensive are more consistent with ancient practices and provide very satisfactory results in addition to being more fitting to a site of such a statues the smaller size dams have historically been used due to structural stability and ease of construction in addition to their advantage in being much easier and cheaper to maintain than the larger alternatives this work has demonstrated their superiority in flood management as well same finding is applicable to different parts of the world where such small scale interventions can be applicable the performance of the check dams is clear when analyzing the peak flow reduction and the time to peak increase for the frequency storms installing more dams clearly helps with reducing peak discharge and increasing the time to peak discharge this is particularly true in more intense and less frequent storm events which may have been the intention of the flood control system devised by nabataean engineers initially fig 16 summarizes these improvements whether the intervention of choice is a larger dam or a series of smaller dams continuous monitoring should be done once the intervention is done long term effect on the performance of the intervention in terms of structural stability siltation and flow delay and reduction should be assessed changes with time are expected due to the accumulation of sediments behind and inside the check dams thereby reducing the active storage capacity and minimizing the flow through rate these studies are important for assessing the need for continuous maintenance and building new dams in addition sediment transport modeling should be done on the site to assess the impact of these check dams in reducing the overall sediment load carried downstream the site would additionally benefit from continuous monitoring of soil erosion rates through terrestrial laser scanning techniques funding this research was funded by the united states ambassadors fund for cultural preservation 2017

4272,the highlighting and study of extreme water temperatures which endanger numerous species is of particular interest for river managers planning for future thermal conditions extreme water temperatures defined as temperatures outside the normal range are predicted to occur more frequently this range includes seasonality and other trends in temperature time series first extreme water temperatures were highlighted using generalized additive modeling gam to extract within year variations seasonality and long term changes trend second the temporal dynamics of water temperature around extremes were modeled using specific differential equations the period considered was 15 days 7 days before and after each extreme considered day the data were water temperatures measured every 10 min for 7 years 2012 2018 at 94 measurement sites sites were located evenly throughout the walloon southern belgium hydrological network results showed that gam was robust for capturing seasonality and trend and highlighting extreme water temperatures gam had already been used in water temperature studies but not yet to detect extremes the thermal dynamics of water temperature around extremes was successfully modeled using differential equations several equations expressing heat flux processes between air and water interface were tested two correlations were analyzed i between the model coefficients and the number of extreme days and ii between the model coefficients and the number of days above a fixed thermal threshold significant positive correlations were found in both cases considering the value ranges of the model coefficients it is thus possible to describe rivers thermal sensitivity with our approach river s managers can now better address the important issue of extreme water temperature in the context of climate change keywords water temperature extreme river differential model gam 1 introduction water temperature is one of the driving regulators for physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic ecosystem as established by various studies caissie 2006 kaur et al 2018 it influences the distribution mohseni et al 2003 growth rate leblanc et al 1997 survival of species wolter 2007 migrations marzadri et al 2013 and swimming endurance of aquatic species ojanguren and brañta 2000 it also has an impact on pollutants armour 1991 and diseases chandelier et al 2006 in a context of climate change rising water temperature is predicted to be a major issue in the coming decades cheng et al 2020 water temperatures are already changing isaak et al 2012 kaushal et al 2010 mantua et al 2010 mohseni et al 1999 isaak et al 2010 studied a 2500 km river network in central idaho usa and showed that basin average water temperature increased by 0 38 c and maxima increased by 0 48 c between 1993 and 2006 in their study on water temperature projections from 2070 to 2099 morrison et al 2002 predicted that the summer mean water temperature would increase by 1 98 c in the fraser river canada bartholow 2005 found an increase of approximately 0 5 c decade for 1962 2001 in the klamath river california between 1990 and 2006 in central england water temperature increased on average by 0 03 c orr et al 2015 climate change is also expected to lead to more frequent extreme events with damaging repercussion on biodiversity unusually high temperatures ipcc 2014 can modify productivity and spatial distributions lawrence et al 2014 and cause the extinction of species subordinated to their environment eaton et al 1995 sinokrot et al 1995 water temperature rise is problematic for both aquatic species and river managers first the increase in water temperature causes thermal stress for particularly ectothermic species portner and farrell 2008 van vliet et al 2011 for example water temperature rise is problematic for salmonids brett 1952 high water temperature can reduce dissolved oxygen and cause fish mortality cheng et al 2020 if the preferred temperature range of the species is exceeded eaton et al 1995 georges et al 2019 despite some uncertainty the forecasts point to a worsening situation for these species in the coming years besides the harmful impact of temperature rises on fish management actions currently in place could become ineffective in the coming years orr et al 2015 current field actions to limit thermal heating in rivers consist in increasing riparian shade areas and improving thermal refuges orr et al 2015 indirect measures such as controlling river flow and modifying channel hydromorphology are also in place orr et al 2015 however a poor understanding of thermal processes can lead to inappropriate river management and waste financial and human resources orr et al 2015 a better understanding of thermal processes in rivers is crucial for coping with climate change in the context of climate change and to respond to the needs of managers it is essential to first develop a robust method to detect extreme water temperature extreme water temperature can be defined as temperatures that lie outside the seasonal norms abnormal having such a method is important to obtain an overview of the future potential thermal context of our rivers and to analyze these extremes and their drivers water temperature studies usually focus on metrics expressing maximum water temperature e g eaton et al 1995 welsh et al 2001 however high values of maximum water temperature are not necessarily extreme the study of absolute maximum temperature has the drawback of ignoring seasonality an essential variable in the development of the species for example in the case of fish species davies and bromage 2002 show that if the spawning time is advanced because the temperatures are optimal for this development phase but are above the seasonal norms a dysfunction in ovarian development occurs that can lead to non viable eggs incorporating the change over time i e the within year variation seasonality and the long term change trend is essential to identify extreme abnormal water temperature only a few studies have focused on such extreme water temperatures caissie et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 despite many studies on water temperatures and many proposed analytical methodologies very few studies have considered the spatial temporal component caissie et al 2020 siegel and volk 2019 also to our knowledge none have considered the thermal dynamics of the overheating events a key aspect in understanding the drivers that lead to extreme water temperature this is mostly because water temperature variations in time and space are difficult to model requiring extremely large quantities of temporal and spatial data the purpose of this study was to improve our understanding of thermal processes in rivers for aquatic ecosystem and river managers it used an innovative method focusing on changes in water temperatures over time together with generalized additive modeling gam to highlight extremes differential equations were used to model the thermal dynamics around the extreme events high spatial temporal resolution data from a large river network covering approximately 8900 km2 in northwestern europe southern belgium were used water temperature and streamflow were measured at 94 sites every 10 min for 7 years 2012 2018 2 materials methods 2 1 study area and dataset 2 1 1 study area the study took place in wallonia a territory of 16 903 km2 in southern belgium western europe the river network is classified into navigable 900 km and non navigable watercourses non navigable watercourses comprise those with a watershed of more than 50 km2 2000 km and below this limit 10 000 km wallonia possessed a variety of landscapes reflecting regional diversity its northern part is mainly agricultural composed of cropland and with high human population densities brogna et al 2018 by contrast its southern and eastern parts are mostly forests especially needle leaf forests and grassland with a lower population density fig 1 the elevation gradient ranges from 0 m to 694 m the median daily air minimum and maximum temperatures measured at the 94 sites from 2012 to 2018 were between 5 c and 6 5 c and between 13 c and 16 5 c respectively fig 2 2 2 water and air temperature dataset the walloon hydrographic network is densely monitored with an array of 140 measurement sites each is equipped with a non immersed radar sensor or a pressure level sensor with capillaries ott hydromet model pls placed in a metal tube and immersed in the watercourse although this array was originally designed to measure water level georges et al 2019 demonstrated the utility of water temperature data recorded by the probes streamflow was also extracted at the measurement sites from the water level data using calibration curves water level water temperature and streamflow data were measured continuously every 10 min continuous data were available from 2012 to 2018 water temperature data was first controlled for quality as some new measurement sites had been added and older ones removed between 2012 and 2018 secondly data obtained when the water level was less than 4 cm around the probe real water level could be higher was discarded a low water level can adversely affect the measurement of water temperature because the emerged probe then tends to measure the air temperature approximately 1 of the total water temperature data was discarded finally out of 140 a total of 94 measurement sites with a complete water temperature dataset were retained for the study with their watershed covering a surface area of approximately 8900 km2 about 55 of the study area fig 3 daily air temperature data was derived from 5 km 5 km grids provided by the royal belgian

was applied using generalized additive modeling gam to highlight extreme water temperature in classical regression observations must be independent of each other tobias and saez 2004 however gam can integrate a temporal structure also called autocorrelation tobias and saez 2004 which means that present values have a highly temporal correlation with past values laurinec 2017 gam is of particular interest because it can split the observed pattern into three easily interpretable components describing changes over time he et al 2006 new and akram 2016 tobias and saez 2004 trend a change in long term data between years dominici et al 2002 new and akram 2016 seasonality or within year variation simpson 2014 data are influenced by seasonal factors at a regular time step season month week dominici et al 2002 new and akram 2016 the remainder or irregular component new and akram 2016 what remains after removing trend and seasonality data gam is commonly used to model time series data gam

molecular biology and medicine dominici et al 2002 to our knowledge this study is the first to use gam to highlight extreme water temperatures unlike simple parametric linear regression gam is a non linear regression analysis allowing non parametric adjustments to model changes over time new and akram 2016 tobias and saez 2004 the general model equation is y i0 f change over time x e 1 y i 0 s

ftrend a linear function for the trend part and e the error smooth functions are extremely flexible soskuthy 2017 and can be thin plate regression splines cubic regression splines cyclic cubic regression splines or p splines laurinec 2017 the daily maximum water temperature was used as the dependent variable and the gam was adjusted considering potential smooth functions for trend and seasonal changes for seasonality a cyclic cubic spline was used separated by a preset number of knots for each day of the year 3 6 6 the effect of the trend was not smoothed because its influence was clearly linear a correlation term with a continuous time covariate of order 1 was added to the gam to account for auto correlation the package mgcv wood 2011 of r software r core team 2018 was used the remainder was estimated as the gam residuals of each water temperature measurement site it thus captures water temperature fluctuation above or below the seasonality and trend a threshold was applied to the remainder to highlight extreme water temperatures for each measurement site any date classified as extreme in at least one site was considered as extreme for all sites the threshold was defined to have an appropriate number of extreme events while keeping them independent different thermal thresholds were tested from 5 c to 7 c in 1 c steps table 3 caissie et al 2020 observed that extreme water temperature events lasted between 1 and 7 days extremes events were thus considered as independent if the time interval between two consecutive extreme dates exceeded 7 days with a 5 c threshold 1748 extreme dates were highlighted all sites considered table 3 the number of corresponding unique dates was 203 after removing the repetitions of identical dates between sites this number of dates was too high because it led to about 2 3 of the annual dates being considered as extreme many annual dates could not be considered as extreme as defined abnormal thresholds of 6 c and 7 c were thus also tested table 3 the 6 c threshold was the best compromise meeting the following two conditions i enough unique independent dates and ii consistent number of unique dates 2 5 thermal dynamics around extreme water temperature differential equations were used to improve our understanding of thermal dynamics i e water temperature change over time around extreme water temperatures since two extreme events were considered to be independent if they were at least 7 days apart the extreme water temperatures were studied by considering the 7 days following and preceding the extreme date the water temperature evolution around an extreme date therefore covered a period of 15 days water temperature is controlled by complex energy exchanges webb et al 2008 the water temperature change over time at a given measurement site was therefore assumed to be related to heat exchange the most commonly energy balance is given by equation 2 brown 1969 leblanc et al 1997 2 δ e f n r f e f c f h f a where δ e is the net change in energy stored f nr is the net thermal radiative flux f e is the evaporative flux f c is the conductive flux f h is the convective flux and f a is the advective flux from the energy balance equation 2 a set of differential equations was derived to model water temperature change over time d t w dt using air temperature and the streamflow data available at the measurement site as water temperature data daily minimum tam and maximum tam air temperatures at the extreme water temperature dates for each measurement site were interpolated from the meteorological data these two variables are well known to impact on water temperature and fluctuate over time like water temperature only the most realistic tested equations for expressing water temperature variations over time are presented below ordered by complexity equation 3 to equation 7 3 d t w dt a t am t w c 4 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w 5 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w c 6 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w c q 7 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w q c all the equations include air water temperature gradients that are responsible for convective heat transfer since energy is transported between air and water at their interface brown 1969 leblanc et al 1997 to estimate the conventional warming of the water during the day and its cooling at night positive and potentially negative transfers were respectively represented by terms including daily maximal temperature t am and daily minimal temperature t am differences with water temperature stream morphology through the channel dimension must be taken into account for water temperature simulations allen et al 1994 van vliet et al 2012 to avoid having too many variables in our models and since the streamflow was already included a simplified form of the relationship established by allen et al 1994 and van vliet et al 2012 between water depth and streamflow was used the potential effect of this variable is included in equations 6 and 7 because the rate of water temperature change is inversely proportional to streamflow leblanc et al 1997 q was included in the denominator of the corresponding equations the final equations therefore comprise at most three coefficients including in some equations equations 3 5 6 and 7 a constant a constant was added to integrate other heat flux processes not directly linked to air temperature such as radiation and advection and which could not be directly measured in our experiment a b and c are thus the coefficients to be adjusted table 1 the differential equations equations 3 to 7 were fitted for each unique independent extreme date and each measurement site 15 day period as numerical model fitting can be sensitive to the initial values of parameters different pseudorandom sets of starting values were generated and the sets yielding the best adjustment performance were selected for each equation the quality of the adjustments was evaluated and the best equation equations 3 to 7 was selected through the mean square error of the fits equation 8 8 m s e t v a r t b i a s t t 2 where mse is the mean square error var the residual variance bias the mean of the raw residuals t the daily water temperature and t the estimated value of the daily water temperature by the equation mean square error was extracted from the ms mean square residuals component of the modfit function in r r core team 2018 mean square error was calculated for each site extreme date combination 3478 in all and we selected the equation with the smallest average mse on all combinations once adjusted the selected equation describing energy exchange with the river was applied to each measurement site at each extreme date to estimate their specific best fit coefficients a b and c differential equations and equation selection were done using the statistical software r r core team 2018 and the desolve package version 1 28 soetaert et al 2010 3 results 3 1 detection of extreme temperature using gam gam was applied on daily maximum water temperatures to model changes over time the three components namely seasonality trend and remainder were estimated for each site fig 4 shows an example for one site for all sites a slight increasing but not statistically significant trend was observed table 2 a seasonality was described as expected in our study area by a sinusoid with higher temperatures in summer than in winter based on the gam fitting threshold analysis was applied to the non seasonal events remainder part descriptive statistics of the gam applied to each measurement site were extracted values have been aggregated for minimum median and maximum in table 2 table 2 a shows the descriptive statistics of the linear part of the gam model since no smoothing is applied the statistical variables are comparable to a standard regression model the intercept was statistically significant unlike the trend reported above table 2 b shows approximate significance of the smooth term the smooth component of our model tested by the f test was statistically significant p 0 edf stands for the effective degrees of freedom in our model eight terms are associated with this smooth although the smooth is based on a close number of degrees of freedom edf is slightly smaller because the smoothing process results in penalties related to curve fitting clark 2019 using the best threshold 6 c 37 unique independent extreme dates were selected for differential analysis table 3 3 2 thermal dynamics around extreme water temperature fig 5 shows

equation 7 on water temperature for a selection of site measurements and extreme dates 4 discussion 4 1 gam gam had already been used in water temperature studies especially to model water temperature ananda 2019 laanaya et al 2017 morton and henderson 2008 murphy et al 2019 and yang and moyer 2020 also used gam to detect trends in high frequency water quality monitoring data however in the field of river temperature our study is the first demonstrating that gam has a strong potential to highlight extreme temperatures by removing seasonality and trends in the temperature time series so being able to detect extreme temperature events even during cold periods the method makes it possible to identify days when temperatures exceed the seasonal norms also outside the hottest period of the year caissie et al 2020 also highlight water temperature extremes by isolating the seasonality but using the peak over threshold pot method in the proposed gam approach water temperature data was divided into time subsamples seasonality trend and remainders after defining a threshold data from the remainders constituted the extremes in pot a threshold is established to define the extremes without considering all the components of the time series abad et al 2014 szubzda and chlebus 2020 as shown here fig 4 extreme water temperature does not necessarily relate to annual maxima extreme water temperatures are well distributed over time for example three of the extreme independent dates 2018 02 17 2016 10 31 and 2012 03 28 were not in the warmest period of the year summer for the description of thermal regimes of rivers the whole year can be considered not on absolute maxima but on difference from seasonality the highlighting of extreme water temperature is of great interest for managing cold water fish which are highly sensitive to warming water jonsson and jonsson 2009 the proposed gam method could be easily used by managers to better describe the intensity and frequency of extremes both of which increasing with global warming 4 2 differential equation unlike other analysis methods used in the field of watercourses differential analyses can focus on the temporal thermal dynamics before and after the highlighted extremes it is most important to look at the warming drivers leading to the temperature peak to identify and understand the causative variables equation 7 applied to the 3478 site extreme date combinations accurately described the thermal dynamics fig 6 the use of fewer coefficients 3 is an obvious advantage for interpretation in addition the use of commonly recorded variables air temperature and streamflow makes this method suitable for characterizing thermal dynamics during extreme events in many other watersheds providing these are equipped with a high frequency stream and temperature recorder georges et al 2020 the three coefficient values for each site extreme date combination are directly related to the formation of an extreme temperature event and characterize different origins of this occurrence they could thus be used as explanatory variables to describe the relationship between water temperature and the surrounding environment as a proof of concept two applications were run using correlation analysis to determine whether the coefficients adequately reflected sensitivity to stream heating first for each site the number of days when the recorded water temperature was above the threshold of 6 c was correlated with the median of the coefficients extracted from our final thermal models for each site correlation test results are presented in table 4 correlation coefficients were statistically significant meaning that the value of the coefficient was closely related to the number of extreme days second the values of the coefficients were similarly analyzed with the number of days for each station when the daily maximum water temperature exceeded the upper thermal tolerance of the brown trout before thermal stress 19 c however we note that the thermal requirements vary according to the species life stage elliott and elliott 2010 table 5 shows the corresponding correlation coefficients unlike coefficients b and c coefficient a was not statistically significant coefficient a was thus not a good indicator for the number of days when the daily maximum water temperature exceeded the upper thermal tolerance of the brown trout before thermal stress 19 c these correlations tables 4 and 5 indicate that thermal regime variables requiring traditionally long term data collection such as number of days exceeding a defined threshold per year could be inferred by coefficients extracted from differential equations needing only short term 15 days high frequency data in other words managers could establish through the range value of the coefficients a thermal sensitivity indicator for their rivers that might help them focus management on their rivers without needing long term historical thermal series based on the calibration of our models susceptibility to overheating measured either through the number of extreme days or the number of days with water temperature above 19 c on the network for the studied period can be estimated by recording water temperature air temperature and streamflow for short periods as short as 15 days the modeling period taken in our study to estimate the value of coefficients a b and c on streams of a studied region not covered by a permanent water temperature network 4 3 perspective besides demonstrating a powerful statistical method to highlight extreme thermal events our study successfully modeled the thermal dynamics during extreme periods the gam approach and differential models proposed are simple effective and innovative methods in river research they form the first step in a response for managers wishing to understand the thermal behavior of rivers particularly during extreme events future steps will characterize extreme thermal events using environmental variables to develop decision making tools for river managers to understand what influences the thermal dynamics around extreme events and therefore the

4272,the highlighting and study of extreme water temperatures which endanger numerous species is of particular interest for river managers planning for future thermal conditions extreme water temperatures defined as temperatures outside the normal range are predicted to occur more frequently this range includes seasonality and other trends in temperature time series first extreme water temperatures were highlighted using generalized additive modeling gam to extract within year variations seasonality and long term changes trend second the temporal dynamics of water temperature around extremes were modeled using specific differential equations the period considered was 15 days 7 days before and after each extreme considered day the data were water temperatures measured every 10 min for 7 years 2012 2018 at 94 measurement sites sites were located evenly throughout the walloon southern belgium hydrological network results showed that gam was robust for capturing seasonality and trend and highlighting extreme water temperatures gam had already been used in water temperature studies but not yet to detect extremes the thermal dynamics of water temperature around extremes was successfully modeled using differential equations several equations expressing heat flux processes between air and water interface were tested two correlations were analyzed i between the model coefficients and the number of extreme days and ii between the model coefficients and the number of days above a fixed thermal threshold significant positive correlations were found in both cases considering the value ranges of the model coefficients it is thus possible to describe rivers thermal sensitivity with our approach river s managers can now better address the important issue of extreme water temperature in the context of climate change keywords water temperature extreme river differential model gam 1 introduction water temperature is one of the driving regulators for physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic ecosystem as established by various studies caissie 2006 kaur et al 2018 it influences the distribution mohseni et al 2003 growth rate leblanc et al 1997 survival of species wolter 2007 migrations marzadri et al 2013 and swimming endurance of aquatic species ojanguren and brañta 2000 it also has an impact on pollutants armour 1991 and diseases chandelier et al 2006 in a context of climate change rising water temperature is predicted to be a major issue in the coming decades cheng et al 2020 water temperatures are already changing isaak et al 2012 kaushal et al 2010 mantua et al 2010 mohseni et al 1999 isaak et al 2010 studied a 2500 km river network in central idaho usa and showed that basin average water temperature increased by 0 38 c and maxima increased by 0 48 c between 1993 and 2006 in their study on water temperature projections from 2070 to 2099 morrison et al 2002 predicted that the summer mean water temperature would increase by 1 98 c in the fraser river canada bartholow 2005 found an increase of approximately 0 5 c decade for 1962 2001 in the klamath river california between 1990 and 2006 in central england water temperature increased on average by 0 03 c orr et al 2015 climate change is also expected to lead to more frequent extreme events with damaging repercussion on biodiversity unusually high temperatures ipcc 2014 can modify productivity and spatial distributions lawrence et al 2014 and cause the extinction of species subordinated to their environment eaton et al 1995 sinokrot et al 1995 water temperature rise is problematic for both aquatic species and river managers first the increase in water temperature causes thermal stress for particularly ectothermic species portner and farrell 2008 van vliet et al 2011 for example water temperature rise is problematic for salmonids brett 1952 high water temperature can reduce dissolved oxygen and cause fish mortality cheng et al 2020 if the preferred temperature range of the species is exceeded eaton et al 1995 georges et al 2019 despite some uncertainty the forecasts point to a worsening situation for these species in the coming years besides the harmful impact of temperature rises on fish management actions currently in place could become ineffective in the coming years orr et al 2015 current field actions to limit thermal heating in rivers consist in increasing riparian shade areas and improving thermal refuges orr et al 2015 indirect measures such as controlling river flow and modifying channel hydromorphology are also in place orr et al 2015 however a poor understanding of thermal processes can lead to inappropriate river management and waste financial and human resources orr et al 2015 a better understanding of thermal processes in rivers is crucial for coping with climate change in the context of climate change and to respond to the needs of managers it is essential to first develop a robust method to detect extreme water temperature extreme water temperature can be defined as temperatures that lie outside the seasonal norms abnormal having such a method is important to obtain an overview of the future potential thermal context of our rivers and to analyze these extremes and their drivers water temperature studies usually focus on metrics expressing maximum water temperature e g eaton et al 1995 welsh et al 2001 however high values of maximum water temperature are not necessarily extreme the study of absolute maximum temperature has the drawback of ignoring seasonality an essential variable in the development of the species for example in the case of fish species davies and bromage 2002 show that if the spawning time is advanced because the temperatures are optimal for this development phase but are above the seasonal norms a dysfunction in ovarian development occurs that can lead to non viable eggs incorporating the change over time i e the within year variation seasonality and the long term change trend is essential to identify extreme abnormal water temperature only a few studies have focused on such extreme water temperatures caissie et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 despite many studies on water temperatures and many proposed analytical methodologies very few studies have considered the spatial temporal component caissie et al 2020 siegel and volk 2019 also to our knowledge none have considered the thermal dynamics of the overheating events a key aspect in understanding the drivers that lead to extreme water temperature this is mostly because water temperature variations in time and space are difficult to model requiring extremely large quantities of temporal and spatial data the purpose of this study was to improve our understanding of thermal processes in rivers for aquatic ecosystem and river managers it used an innovative method focusing on changes in water temperatures over time together with generalized additive modeling gam to highlight extremes differential equations were used to model the thermal dynamics around the extreme events high spatial temporal resolution data from a large river network covering approximately 8900 km2 in northwestern europe southern belgium were used water temperature and streamflow were measured at 94 sites every 10 min for 7 years 2012 2018 2 materials methods 2 1 study area and dataset 2 1 1 study area the study took place in wallonia a territory of 16 903 km2 in southern belgium western europe the river network is classified into navigable 900 km and non navigable watercourses non navigable watercourses comprise those with a watershed of more than 50 km2 2000 km and below this limit 10 000 km wallonia possessed a variety of landscapes reflecting regional diversity its northern part is mainly agricultural composed of cropland and with high human population densities brogna et al 2018 by contrast its southern and eastern parts are mostly forests especially needle leaf forests and grassland with a lower population density fig 1 the elevation gradient ranges from 0 m to 694 m the median daily air minimum and maximum temperatures measured at the 94 sites from 2012 to 2018 were between 5 c and 6 5 c and between 13 c and 16 5 c respectively fig 2 2 2 water and air temperature dataset the walloon hydrographic network is densely monitored with an array of 140 measurement sites each is equipped with a non immersed radar sensor or a pressure level sensor with capillaries ott hydromet model pls placed in a metal tube and immersed in the watercourse although this array was originally designed to measure water level georges et al 2019 demonstrated the utility of water temperature data recorded by the probes streamflow was also extracted at the measurement sites from the water level data using calibration curves water level water temperature and streamflow data were measured continuously every 10 min continuous data were available from 2012 to 2018 water temperature data was first controlled for quality as some new measurement sites had been added and older ones removed between 2012 and 2018 secondly data obtained when the water level was less than 4 cm around the probe real water level could be higher was discarded a low water level can adversely affect the measurement of water temperature because the emerged probe then tends to measure the air temperature approximately 1 of the total water temperature data was discarded finally out of 140 a total of 94 measurement sites with a complete water temperature dataset were retained for the study with their watershed covering a surface area of approximately 8900 km2 about 55 of the study area fig 3 daily air temperature data was derived from 5 km 5 km grids provided by the royal belgian meteorological institute rmi the data grids were made from point observations 139 meteorological sites in belgium pre processed outlier detection removal of unreliable climatological measurement sites interpolated on a grid 1 km 1 km with kriging with external drift terrain elevation and averaged over 5 km 5 km journée et al 2019 2 3 data availability statement the data that support the findings of this study are retrievable at aqualim environnement wallonie be with the permission of service public de wallonie and from the institut royal météorologique irm restrictions apply to the availability of these data which were used under license for this study 2 4 statistical methods 2 4 1 detection of extreme water temperatures since water temperature is measured over time time series regression was applied using generalized additive modeling gam to highlight extreme water temperature in classical regression observations must be independent of each other tobias and saez 2004 however gam can integrate a temporal structure also called autocorrelation tobias and saez 2004 which means that present values have a highly temporal correlation with past values laurinec 2017 gam is of particular interest because it can split the observed pattern into three easily interpretable components describing changes over time he et al 2006 new and akram 2016 tobias and saez 2004 trend a change in long term data between years dominici et al 2002 new and akram 2016 seasonality or within year variation simpson 2014 data are influenced by seasonal factors at a regular time step season month week dominici et al 2002 new and akram 2016 the remainder or irregular component new and akram 2016 what remains after removing trend and seasonality data gam is commonly used to model time series data gam has been widely used in studies of air pollution he et al 2006 zhao et al 2011 health schwartz 1994 morbidity dominici et al 2002 mortality dominici et al 2002 samet et al 2000 genetics epidemiology molecular biology and medicine dominici et al 2002 to our knowledge this study is the first to use gam to highlight extreme water temperatures unlike simple parametric linear regression gam is a non linear regression analysis allowing non parametric adjustments to model changes over time new and akram 2016 tobias and saez 2004 the general model equation is y i0 f change over time x e 1 y i 0 s seasonal x f trend x e where y is the response variable i0 the intercept fchange over time the general change over time function sseasonal the non parametric smooth function for the seasonal part ftrend a linear function for the trend part and e the error smooth functions are extremely flexible soskuthy 2017 and can be thin plate regression splines cubic regression splines cyclic cubic regression splines or p splines laurinec 2017 the daily maximum water temperature was used as the dependent variable and the gam was adjusted considering potential smooth functions for trend and seasonal changes for seasonality a cyclic cubic spline was used separated by a preset number of knots for each day of the year 3 6 6 the effect of the trend was not smoothed because its influence was clearly linear a correlation term with a continuous time covariate of order 1 was added to the gam to account for auto correlation the package mgcv wood 2011 of r software r core team 2018 was used the remainder was estimated as the gam residuals of each water temperature measurement site it thus captures water temperature fluctuation above or below the seasonality and trend a threshold was applied to the remainder to highlight extreme water temperatures for each measurement site any date classified as extreme in at least one site was considered as extreme for all sites the threshold was defined to have an appropriate number of extreme events while keeping them independent different thermal thresholds were tested from 5 c to 7 c in 1 c steps table 3 caissie et al 2020 observed that extreme water temperature events lasted between 1 and 7 days extremes events were thus considered as independent if the time interval between two consecutive extreme dates exceeded 7 days with a 5 c threshold 1748 extreme dates were highlighted all sites considered table 3 the number of corresponding unique dates was 203 after removing the repetitions of identical dates between sites this number of dates was too high because it led to about 2 3 of the annual dates being considered as extreme many annual dates could not be considered as extreme as defined abnormal thresholds of 6 c and 7 c were thus also tested table 3 the 6 c threshold was the best compromise meeting the following two conditions i enough unique independent dates and ii consistent number of unique dates 2 5 thermal dynamics around extreme water temperature differential equations were used to improve our understanding of thermal dynamics i e water temperature change over time around extreme water temperatures since two extreme events were considered to be independent if they were at least 7 days apart the extreme water temperatures were studied by considering the 7 days following and preceding the extreme date the water temperature evolution around an extreme date therefore covered a period of 15 days water temperature is controlled by complex energy exchanges webb et al 2008 the water temperature change over time at a given measurement site was therefore assumed to be related to heat exchange the most commonly energy balance is given by equation 2 brown 1969 leblanc et al 1997 2 δ e f n r f e f c f h f a where δ e is the net change in energy stored f nr is the net thermal radiative flux f e is the evaporative flux f c is the conductive flux f h is the convective flux and f a is the advective flux from the energy balance equation 2 a set of differential equations was derived to model water temperature change over time d t w dt using air temperature and the streamflow data available at the measurement site as water temperature data daily minimum tam and maximum tam air temperatures at the extreme water temperature dates for each measurement site were interpolated from the meteorological data these two variables are well known to impact on water temperature and fluctuate over time like water temperature only the most realistic tested equations for expressing water temperature variations over time are presented below ordered by complexity equation 3 to equation 7 3 d t w dt a t am t w c 4 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w 5 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w c 6 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w c q 7 d t w dt a t am t w b t am t w q c all the equations include air water temperature gradients that are responsible for convective heat transfer since energy is transported between air and water at their interface brown 1969 leblanc et al 1997 to estimate the conventional warming of the water during the day and its cooling at night positive and potentially negative transfers were respectively represented by terms including daily maximal temperature t am and daily minimal temperature t am differences with water temperature stream morphology through the channel dimension must be taken into account for water temperature simulations allen et al 1994 van vliet et al 2012 to avoid having too many variables in our models and since the streamflow was already included a simplified form of the relationship established by allen et al 1994 and van vliet et al 2012 between water depth and streamflow was used the potential effect of this variable is included in equations 6 and 7 because the rate of water temperature change is inversely proportional to streamflow leblanc et al 1997 q was included in the denominator of the corresponding equations the final equations therefore comprise at most three coefficients including in some equations equations 3 5 6 and 7 a constant a constant was added to integrate other heat flux processes not directly linked to air temperature such as radiation and advection and which could not be directly measured in our experiment a b and c are thus the coefficients to be adjusted table 1 the differential equations equations 3 to 7 were fitted for each unique independent extreme date and each measurement site 15 day period as numerical model fitting can be sensitive to the initial values of parameters different pseudorandom sets of starting values were generated and the sets yielding the best adjustment performance were selected for each equation the quality of the adjustments was evaluated and the best equation equations 3 to 7 was selected through the mean square error of the fits equation 8 8 m s e t v a r t b i a s t t 2 where mse is the mean square error var the residual variance bias the mean of the raw residuals t the daily water temperature and t the estimated value of the daily water temperature by the equation mean square error was extracted from the ms mean square residuals component of the modfit function in r r core team 2018 mean square error was calculated for each site extreme date combination 3478 in all and we selected the equation with the smallest average mse on all combinations once adjusted the selected equation describing energy exchange with the river was applied to each measurement site at each extreme date to estimate their specific best fit coefficients a b and c differential equations and equation selection were done using the statistical software r r core team 2018 and the desolve package version 1 28 soetaert et al 2010 3 results 3 1 detection of extreme temperature using gam gam was applied on daily maximum water temperatures to model changes over time the three components namely seasonality trend and remainder were estimated for each site fig 4 shows an example for one site for all sites a slight increasing but not statistically significant trend was observed table 2 a seasonality was described as expected in our study area by a sinusoid with higher temperatures in summer than in winter based on the gam fitting threshold analysis was applied to the non seasonal events remainder part descriptive statistics of the gam applied to each measurement site were extracted values have been aggregated for minimum median and maximum in table 2 table 2 a shows the descriptive statistics of the linear part of the gam model since no smoothing is applied the statistical variables are comparable to a standard regression model the intercept was statistically significant unlike the trend reported above table 2 b shows approximate significance of the smooth term the smooth component of our model tested by the f test was statistically significant p 0 edf stands for the effective degrees of freedom in our model eight terms are associated with this smooth although the smooth is based on a close number of degrees of freedom edf is slightly smaller because the smoothing process results in penalties related to curve fitting clark 2019 using the best threshold 6 c 37 unique independent extreme dates were selected for differential analysis table 3 3 2 thermal dynamics around extreme water temperature fig 5 shows the mean square error calculated for each site extreme date combination 3478 in all of the five equations tested based on an analysis of variance anova and a tukey test on the mean square error values log transformed to comply with anova assumptions equation 7 was selected as the best equation fit p 2e 16 once adjusted the selected equation 7 was applied to each measurement site 94 at each extreme date 37 to estimate their specific best fit coefficients a b and c for each coefficient 3478 values were computed fig 6 illustrates the result of the adjustment of a differential equation model equation 7 on water temperature for a selection of site measurements and extreme dates 4 discussion 4 1 gam gam had already been used in water temperature studies especially to model water temperature ananda 2019 laanaya et al 2017 morton and henderson 2008 murphy et al 2019 and yang and moyer 2020 also used gam to detect trends in high frequency water quality monitoring data however in the field of river temperature our study is the first demonstrating that gam has a strong potential to highlight extreme temperatures by removing seasonality and trends in the temperature time series so being able to detect extreme temperature events even during cold periods the method makes it possible to identify days when temperatures exceed the seasonal norms also outside the hottest period of the year caissie et al 2020 also highlight water temperature extremes by isolating the seasonality but using the peak over threshold pot method in the proposed gam approach water temperature data was divided into time subsamples seasonality trend and remainders after defining a threshold data from the remainders constituted the extremes in pot a threshold is established to define the extremes without considering all the components of the time series abad et al 2014 szubzda and chlebus 2020 as shown here fig 4 extreme water temperature does not necessarily relate to annual maxima extreme water temperatures are well distributed over time for example three of the extreme independent dates 2018 02 17 2016 10 31 and 2012 03 28 were not in the warmest period of the year summer for the description of thermal regimes of rivers the whole year can be considered not on absolute maxima but on difference from seasonality the highlighting of extreme water temperature is of great interest for managing cold water fish which are highly sensitive to warming water jonsson and jonsson 2009 the proposed gam method could be easily used by managers to better describe the intensity and frequency of extremes both of which increasing with global warming 4 2 differential equation unlike other analysis methods used in the field of watercourses differential analyses can focus on the temporal thermal dynamics before and after the highlighted extremes it is most important to look at the warming drivers leading to the temperature peak to identify and understand the causative variables equation 7 applied to the 3478 site extreme date combinations accurately described the thermal dynamics fig 6 the use of fewer coefficients 3 is an obvious advantage for interpretation in addition the use of commonly recorded variables air temperature and streamflow makes this method suitable for characterizing thermal dynamics during extreme events in many other watersheds providing these are equipped with a high frequency stream and temperature recorder georges et al 2020 the three coefficient values for each site extreme date combination are directly related to the formation of an extreme temperature event and characterize different origins of this occurrence they could thus be used as explanatory variables to describe the relationship between water temperature and the surrounding environment as a proof of concept two applications were run using correlation analysis to determine whether the coefficients adequately reflected sensitivity to stream heating first for each site the number of days when the recorded water temperature was above the threshold of 6 c was correlated with the median of the coefficients extracted from our final thermal models for each site correlation test results are presented in table 4 correlation coefficients were statistically significant meaning that the value of the coefficient was closely related to the number of extreme days second the values of the coefficients were similarly analyzed with the number of days for each station when the daily maximum water temperature exceeded the upper thermal tolerance of the brown trout before thermal stress 19 c however we note that the thermal requirements vary according to the species life stage elliott and elliott 2010 table 5 shows the corresponding correlation coefficients unlike coefficients b and c coefficient a was not statistically significant coefficient a was thus not a good indicator for the number of days when the daily maximum water temperature exceeded the upper thermal tolerance of the brown trout before thermal stress 19 c these correlations tables 4 and 5 indicate that thermal regime variables requiring traditionally long term data collection such as number of days exceeding a defined threshold per year could be inferred by coefficients extracted from differential equations needing only short term 15 days high frequency data in other words managers could establish through the range value of the coefficients a thermal sensitivity indicator for their rivers that might help them focus management on their rivers without needing long term historical thermal series based on the calibration of our models susceptibility to overheating measured either through the number of extreme days or the number of days with water temperature above 19 c on the network for the studied period can be estimated by recording water temperature air temperature and streamflow for short periods as short as 15 days the modeling period taken in our study to estimate the value of coefficients a b and c on streams of a studied region not covered by a permanent water temperature network 4 3 perspective besides demonstrating a powerful statistical method to highlight extreme thermal events our study successfully modeled the thermal dynamics during extreme periods the gam approach and differential models proposed are simple effective and innovative methods in river research they form the first step in a response for managers wishing to understand the thermal behavior of rivers particularly during extreme events future steps will characterize extreme thermal events using environmental variables to develop decision making tools for river managers to understand what influences the thermal dynamics around extreme events and therefore the shape of the modeling curve a specific study should focus on the coefficients of the differential equation conditions in the catchment land cover watershed area in the river sinuosity shade or at the measurement site water level elevation slope could be used to explain the thermal dynamics during extreme events the compilation and calculation of these different variables at several spatial scales could also highlight what areas should be prioritized for mitigating abnormal temperature rise 5 conclusion the first objective of our study was to examine the effectiveness of the gam method to highlight extreme events our study used gam to highlight extreme water temperature based on time series of daily maximum water temperature between 2012 and 2018 our analysis suggests that gam performs well in highlighting water temperature extremes gam can highlight trend seasonality and therefore reveal water temperature outside the normal ranges observed by defining a threshold in relation to this abnormal water temperature extreme water temperatures were highlighted water temperature is temporally very dynamic especially during extreme periods and highly dependent on heat fluxes

4273,this study investigated the transport and retention of bioluminescent escherichia coli strain 652t7 under different pore water velocities 8 7 cm h 1 and 13 0 cm h 1 and pore water saturations 85 and 100 utilizing a non invasive real time bioluminescent imaging technique under saturated flow conditions the concentrations of retained bioluminescent e coli 652t7 decreased exponentially with distance from the source at the lower velocity but decreased non exponentially at the higher velocity under unsaturated flow conditions pore water velocity had no significant effect on bacterial breakthrough concentration however the concentrations of retained cells were maximal at a significant distance from the source non monotonic the distance from source of the maximum concentration increased from 2 4 cm at 1 05 pore volumes to 4 3 cm at 3 15 pore volumes indicating slow translation of bacterial down gradient under unsaturated flow conditions that conditions were modestly unfavorable to attachment at the solid water interface swi was indicated by deposition rate coefficients being greater by a factor of four for simulations versus experiments and by significant repulsive barriers to attachment at both the swi 260 kt and the air water interface awi fully repulsive the inferred slow translation under unsaturated flow conditions therefore reflects either accumulation without arrest in the secondary minimum at the swi and or capillary interaction at the awi this non invasive bioluminescence method yielded real time quantitative observation of bacterial distribution from source and demonstrated contrasting transport behaviors previously obtained solely via more laborious methods with limited spatio temporal observation keywords bacterial transport unsaturated flow real time bioluminescent imaging flow velocity 1 introduction an improved understanding of processes that control the transport retention and release of bacteria in porous media is needed for a variety of environmental and industrial applications such as bioremediation of contaminated soils and aquifers and filtration of pathogenic microorganisms in groundwater or engineered water treatment systems redman et al 2004 liu et al 2007 bai et al 2016 sasidharan et al 2017 adadevoh et al 2018 in addition the knowledge of in situ spatial distribution of bacteria during their transport through heterogeneous porous media is required for accurate prediction of bacterial breakthrough behaviors tong et al 2005 keller and auset 2007 rockhold et al 2007 bradford and torkzaban 2008 engström et al 2015 however the mechanisms of bacterial transport and retention in porous media are complex and predictive capability is limited e g molnar et al 2015 for instance traditional colloid filtration theory assumes an exponential decrease in retained bacterial concentrations with transport distance e g yao et al 1971 logan et al 1995 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however under some conditions retained bacteria frequently exhibit a distance dependent deposition rate coefficient that decreases with transport distance multi exponential bolster et al 2000 redman et al 2001

et al 2006 johnson et al 2018 the above cited research primarily pertains to saturated porous media and less is known about the spatial distribution of bacteria during their transport and retention in unsaturated porous systems the above described behaviours aramrak et al 2011 2014 gómez suárez et al 1999 2000 lazouskaya et al 2011 noordmans et al 1997 sharma et al 2008 were investigated in packed columns by dissecting the column following the end of the experiment in these experiments the role of attachment versus retention without attachment in secondary minima was elucidated using replicate columns dissected following contrasting numbers of pore volumes e g tong et al 2005 and through direct pore scale observation in micromodels e g tong and johnson 2006 keller and auset 2007 thus far no method produces real time in situ information regarding bacterial retention at column scale zhuang et al 2020 the primary objective of this study was to examine real time in situ transport and retention of a constitutively bioluminescent escherichia coli strain in porous media using a novel real time bioluminescent imaging system 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria and culture conditions this study was performed using the constitutively bioluminescent escherichia coli strain 652t7 which consists of a t7 promoter fusion to the photorhabdus luminescens luxcdabe gene cassette shi et al 2014 e coli 652t7 subsequently generates a continuous 490 nm light signal a perkinelmer ivis spectrum was used to measure and capture bioluminescence emission in real time from strain 652t7 during its transport and retention in a sand column the strain was cultured in a sterile 250 ml baffled shake flask containing 100 ml of luria bertani lb with a final kanamycin cas 133 92 6 concentration of 10

the same background solution as used for the column experiments n 50 cell surface hydrophobicity was derived from the contact angles using a goniometer microscope krüss gmbh germany no significant

column assembly was comprised of a glass chromatography column diameter of 3 8 cm length of 10 cm containing a 40 60 mesh quartz sand kermel china ar at a porosity of 0 37 prior to the experiments the sand was washed in hcl 10 mm and then naoh 10 mm solutions to remove suspended impurities and then finally rinsed with deionized water the column was closed at one end with an 80 mesh nylon membrane and then dry packed with the cleaned sand in 1 cm increments with stirring and tapping after packing the other end similarly received an 80 mesh nylon membrane closure high pressure co2 gas was then

pore water velocity as the bacterial transport either 8 7 cm h 1 or 13 0 cm h 1 under the saturated flow conditions only one peristaltic pump was used to inject bacteria under unsaturated flow conditions a piston pump and a sprinkler head were connected to the top of the column to facilitate inflow of the bacterial culture while another peristaltic pump was connected to the bottom of the column to steadily extract the liquid arriving at the outlet specifically the column was first saturated by introducing the background solution then the lower peristaltic pump and upper piston pump were used in cooperation to desaturate the packed porous media to a saturation level of 85 an electronic scale was placed under the column system to monitor the change in water content the liquid amount of one pore volume under the saturated flow conditions was estimated by subtracting the solid volume of sand packed in the column from the total inside volume of the column the liquid volume of one pore volume under the unsaturated flow conditions was calculated by multiplying the saturated pore volume by pore water saturation the flow of the pump was decreased under unsaturated conditions to match the same pore water velocity under saturated situations all the column experiments excluded elution process once a column was packed it was placed vertically in the ivis spectrum imaging

for quantifying dispersivity and hydrodynamic conditions effluent samples were collected from each column at every 0 35 pore volume using a fraction collector each effluent sample was divided into two portions one portion was used to analyze br concentration using ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 while the other portion was used to measure cell concentration simultaneously by plate counting lb agar plates containing kanamycin at 10 mg l 1 and bioluminescence determination in a 96 well microtiter plate in order to obtain breakthrough curves of bacteria at the termination of each transport experiment the entire 10 cm length of the column was divided into 1 cm sections and the sand from each of these sections was used to determine retained bacterial concentrations along the column profile via plate counting and their bioluminescent emission profiles as measured in the ivis spectrum the ten sand segments were individually placed into 100 ml of sterile nacl 2 mm ph 6 5 to shake for 20 min at 160 rpm the suspension was then transferred to a 96 well plate for bioluminescent measurements hourly absorbance measurements of the input bacterial concentrations and their bioluminescence intensities during the entire experimental period 3 5 h indicated that the bacterial suspension remained stable at 2 0 09 108 cells ml 1 the breakthrough curves of bacteria were

water interface was therefore taken as the non tangential stress boundary on the outer boundary of the happel fluid envelope and although no colloid collector interactions were simulated at this interface during the trajectory simulations adding these interactions to that boundary is a potential future enhancement to parti suite because colloid interface interactions were repulsive at the air water interface this interaction was assumed to have negligible impact on colloid trajectories relative to bacterial surface interactions at the sediment water interface and capillary interactions at

the large coefficient of determination r 2 0 999 indicated that the ivis spectrum system was acceptable for detecting bacterial concentrations 3 2 tracer transport the good reproducibility of complete breakthrough of conservative bromide from all columns indicated the stability of the column system and flow conditions during the saturated and unsaturated experiments fig 2 the slight difference in dispersion coefficient d estimated using the ade equation under the same pore water saturation is attributed to the difference in pore water velocity table s1 the small increase in d value when pore water was desaturated is due to relatively larger hydrodynamic dispersion in unsaturated less connected pores yielding decreased mixing and increased tortuosity toride et al 2003 torkzaban et al 2006 3 3 bacterial transport under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions under saturated flow conditions increasing pore water velocity from 8 7 cm h 1 to 13 0 cm h 1 reduced the percentage of retained bacteria mret from 77 to 58 table s1 increased the effluent bacteria recovered during breakthrough meff increased the relative concentration c c0 during steady state breakthrough fig 3 and decreased the average retained concentrations fig 4 the lower and slightly rising steady state bacterial breakthrough c c0 under unsaturated relative to saturated flow conditions indicated greater retention of e coli 652t7 when an awi bounded a thinner water envelope surrounding grains in the porous media fig 3 the recovery percentage of retained bacteria mret also increased under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions from 77 to 84 at 8 7 cm h 1 and 58 to 82 at 13 0 cm h 1 table s1 in contrast to the saturated flow condition there was negligible impact of pore water velocity on the values of steady state c c0 and mret fig 3 table s1 demonstrating that decreased pore water content decreased the influence of velocity on retention of e coli 652t7 3 4 bacterial distribution under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions under saturated flow conditions the concentrations of retained e coli 652t7 decreased exponentially with migration distance from the entrance to the exit at the lower velocity fig 4 as shown by quantification of kf using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the value of kf increased slightly but within typical factor of two to three experimental error from 0 5 h 1 to 1 3 h 1 as the deposit was established from 1 05 to 3 15 pore volumes fig 5 likely due to the presence of both mobile and retained bacteria no elution equations 2 and 3 described well the breakthrough and retained profiles under the lower velocity condition 8 7 cm h 1 figs 4 and 5 demonstrating that retention was described using a spatially constant deposition rate and that retention reflected compounded loss for each collector passed in the porous medium johnson 2020 in contrast to the exponential retention profiles at lower pore water velocity the profiles at higher pore water velocity were multi exponential as shown by the deviation of the data from the description provided by eq 3 fig 5b the term multi exponential is used rather than hyper exponential because it has been shown that the profiles can be described by superposed exponential distributions e g johnson et al 2018 at the higher velocity the values of kf that described the retention profiles were a factor of two less than those that described the breakthrough curve fig 5d demonstrating a modest quantification discrepancy between direct observation of retention using the bioluminescence method and indirect detection from the effluent concentration however the method was sufficiently sensitive to describe the transition from exponential to multi exponential profile with increased velocity under unsaturated flow conditions the distribution of e coli 652t7 demonstrated a non monotonic trend with migration distance fig 6 the real time images showed that the maximum concentration of retained bacteria shifted gradually towards the outlet as the bacteria were continuously injected the distance of the maximum concentration of retained bacteria shifted down gradient with increased pvs at both velocities such non monotonic retention profiles contrasted with the exponential multi exponential profiles observed under saturated flow conditions reflecting similar contrasts observed for bacteria as a function of ionic strength tong et al 2005 and for carboxylate modified polystyrene latex microspheres cml in glass beads versus quartz sand johnson et al 2018 and for contrasting cml sizes in natural sand johnson 2020 4 discussion 4 1 bacterial distribution under saturated flow conditions the magnitudes of kf under saturated flow conditions estimated using the traj hap module in parti suite table 1 were 4 5 h 1 and 3 7 h 1 for the 8 7 cm h 1 and 13 0 cm h 1 fluid velocities respectively these values were approximately a factor of four greater than those obtained from the experimentally observed breakthrough fig 5 using equation 2 1 3 h 1 for the 8 7 cm h 1 velocity and 0 9 h 1 for the 13 0 cm h 1 velocity this indicates that the bacterium surface interactions at the swi were somewhat unfavorable agreeing with xdlvo calculations fig s1 table s2 which shows a significant but not particularly large barrier to attachment 260 kt as well as a deep secondary minimum 20 kt where bacteria may associate with the surface without attachment the multi exponential profile observed for the higher velocity under saturated flow conditions reflects an effective decrease in the deposition rate coefficient with distance of transport which has been tentatively attributed to heterogeneity in surface properties among bacterial populations yielding greater deposition of stickier bacteria upgradient of less sticky bacteria in the population albinger et al 1994 baygents et al 1998 simoni et al 1998 bolster et al 2000 redman et al 2001 tong and johnson 2007 jouvet et al 2018 alternatively bacterial retention in pore throats may reduce the effective pore throat size and increase subsequent filtration at the location shen et al 2020 although this temporal increase in retention should be reflected in decreased steady state breakthrough ripening tong et al 2008 that cml also display multi exponential profiles drive the standing hypothesis that incomplete pore scale mixing produces fast and slow attaching subpopulations of otherwise identical individuals johnson et al 2018 johnson 2020 4 2 bacterial distribution under unsaturated flow conditions the increased mret under unsaturated conditions may reflect increased retention at either the awi or at the swi whereas previous studies indicate the awi may attract cells air being hydrophobic bradford and torkzaban 2008 chen and walker 2012 madumathi et al 2017 the lifschitz van der waals combined hamaker constant and lewis acid base interactions were both repulsive for the awi fig s1 the influence on η and kf of decreased fluid shell thickness under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions was examined in the traj hap module of parti suite fig s2 wherein the average thickness of the fluid envelope of the happel collector was 56 µm and 44 µm under saturated and unsaturated conditions respectively in the trajectory simulations the outer boundary of the fluid envelope was not treated as repulsive such that the primary influence of unsaturated conditions was to increase the likelihood of intercepting the near surface fluid secondary minimum within which colloids may translate slowly down gradient without or prior to attachment johnson et al 2018 johnson 2020 the simulated values of kf were approximately 15 to 20 larger under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions increasing from 4 5 h 1 to 5 2 h 1 at the lower velocity 8 7 cm h 1 and from 3 7 h 1 to 4 4 h 1 at the higher velocity 13 0 cm h 1 this modest increase in simulated kf from saturated to unsaturated conditions is consistent with the observed decrease in breakthrough fig 3 and increase in retained mass table s1 under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions in contrast the trajectory simulations predict slightly decreased kf with increased velocity under unsaturated conditions from 5 2 h 1 to 4 4 h 1 however no obvious increase in retention with increased velocity was observed in the breakthrough concentrations under unsaturated conditions fig 3 this discrepancy suggests that increased retention under unsaturated conditions may not have been primarily driven by bacterial accumulation in secondary minima but may instead have involved retention by capillary forces at the awi which can also produce slow down gradient translation of bacteria bradford et al 2006 2007 tong et al 2008 torkzaban et al 2008 sen 2011 as driven by capillary fringe fluctuations noordmans et al 1997 gómez suárez et al 1999 2000 sharma et al 2008 aramrak et al 2011 2014 lazouskaya et al 2011 aramrak et al 2011 2014 whereas the average fluid shell thickness 44 µm greatly exceeds bacterial size this average does not account for the large fluid shell thickness at grain contacts pendant water and lesser fluid shell thickness away from grain contacts where there may be decreased dependence on fluid drag sedimentation and diffusion to bring bacteria into proximity with either interface the real time observation of bacterial distribution from source provided by the bioluminescence method showed that the shapes of the profiles exponential multi exponential non monotonic remained temporally consistent and did not evolve from one form into another as deposition continued this novel observation indicates that the predominance of particular mechanisms of retention remained consistent as deposition proceeded whereas this predominance shifted with modest change in velocity and saturation 5 conclusion bioluminescent imaging as performed here via the ivis spectrum was demonstrated as an effective method for real time observation of bacterial distribution and evolution of these profiles during transport through porous media under different flow conditions the range of outcomes from exponential to multi exponential to non monotonic distributions was observed with changes in flow velocity and pore water saturation non monotonic distribution reflected bacterial accumulation without arrest in either the secondary minimum at the swi and or capillary interaction at the awi this novel real time observation method showed that the forms of the distributions remained consistent as deposition continued these results provide critical information for understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of bacterial transport behaviors through porous media including deep

and 100 utilizing a non invasive real time bioluminescent imaging technique under saturated flow conditions the concentrations of retained bioluminescent e coli 652t7 decreased exponentially with distance from the source at the lower velocity but decreased non exponentially at the higher velocity under unsaturated flow conditions pore water velocity had no significant effect on bacterial breakthrough concentration however the concentrations of retained cells were maximal at a significant distance from the source non monotonic the distance from source of the maximum concentration increased from 2 4 cm at 1 05 pore volumes to 4 3 cm at 3 15 pore volumes indicating slow translation of bacterial down gradient under unsaturated flow conditions that conditions were modestly unfavorable to attachment at the solid water interface swi was indicated by deposition rate coefficients being greater by a factor of four for simulations versus experiments and by significant repulsive barriers to attachment at both the swi 260 kt and the air water interface awi fully repulsive the inferred slow translation under unsaturated flow conditions therefore reflects either accumulation without arrest in the secondary minimum at the swi and or capillary interaction at the awi this non invasive bioluminescence method yielded real time quantitative observation of bacterial

experimentally observed breakthrough fig 5 using equation 2 1 3 h 1 for the 8 7 cm h 1 velocity and 0 9 h 1 for the 13 0 cm h 1 velocity this indicates that the bacterium surface interactions at the swi were somewhat unfavorable agreeing with xdlvo calculations fig s1 table s2 which shows a significant but not particularly large barrier to attachment 260 kt as well as a deep secondary minimum 20 kt where bacteria may associate with the surface without attachment the multi exponential profile observed for the higher velocity under saturated flow conditions reflects an effective decrease in the deposition rate coefficient with distance of transport which has been tentatively attributed to heterogeneity in surface properties among bacterial populations yielding greater deposition of stickier bacteria upgradient of less sticky bacteria in the population albinger et al 1994 baygents et al 1998 simoni et al 1998 bolster et al 2000 redman et al 2001 tong and johnson 2007 jouvet et al 2018 alternatively bacterial retention in pore throats may reduce the effective pore throat size and increase subsequent filtration at the location shen et al 2020 although this temporal increase in retention should be reflected in decreased steady state breakthrough ripening tong et al 2008 that cml also display multi exponential profiles drive the standing hypothesis that incomplete pore scale mixing produces fast and slow attaching subpopulations of otherwise identical individuals johnson et al 2018 johnson 2020 4 2 bacterial distribution under unsaturated flow conditions the increased mret under unsaturated conditions may reflect increased retention at either the awi or at the swi whereas previous studies indicate the awi may attract cells air being hydrophobic bradford and torkzaban 2008 chen and walker 2012 madumathi et al 2017 the lifschitz van der waals combined hamaker constant and lewis acid base interactions were both repulsive for the awi fig s1 the influence on η and kf of decreased fluid shell thickness under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions was examined in the traj hap module of parti suite fig s2 wherein the average thickness of the fluid envelope of the happel collector was 56 µm and 44 µm under saturated and unsaturated conditions respectively in the trajectory simulations the outer boundary of the fluid envelope was not treated as repulsive such that the primary influence of unsaturated conditions was to increase the likelihood of intercepting the near surface fluid secondary minimum within which colloids may translate slowly down gradient without or prior to attachment johnson et al 2018 johnson 2020 the simulated values of kf were approximately 15 to 20 larger under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions increasing from 4 5 h 1 to 5 2 h 1 at the lower velocity 8 7 cm h 1 and from 3 7 h 1 to 4 4 h 1 at the higher velocity 13 0 cm h 1 this modest increase in simulated kf from saturated to unsaturated conditions is consistent with the observed decrease in breakthrough fig 3 and increase in retained mass table s1 under unsaturated relative to saturated conditions in contrast the trajectory simulations predict slightly decreased kf with increased velocity under unsaturated conditions from 5 2 h 1 to 4 4 h 1 however no obvious increase in retention with increased velocity was observed in the breakthrough concentrations under unsaturated conditions fig 3 this discrepancy suggests that increased retention under unsaturated conditions may not have been primarily driven by bacterial accumulation in secondary minima but may instead have involved retention by capillary forces at the awi which can also produce slow down gradient translation of bacteria bradford et al 2006 2007 tong et al 2008 torkzaban et al 2008 sen 2011 as driven by capillary fringe fluctuations noordmans et al 1997 gómez suárez et al 1999 2000 sharma et al 2008 aramrak et al 2011 2014 lazouskaya et al 2011 aramrak et al 2011 2014 whereas the average fluid shell thickness 44 µm greatly exceeds bacterial size this average does not account for the large fluid shell thickness at grain contacts pendant water and lesser fluid shell thickness away from grain contacts where there may be decreased dependence on fluid drag sedimentation and diffusion to bring bacteria into proximity with either interface the real time observation of bacterial distribution from source provided by the bioluminescence method showed that the shapes of the profiles exponential multi exponential non monotonic remained temporally consistent and did not evolve from one form into another as deposition continued this novel observation indicates that the predominance of particular mechanisms of retention remained consistent as deposition proceeded whereas this predominance shifted with modest change in velocity and saturation 5 conclusion bioluminescent imaging as performed here via the ivis spectrum was demonstrated as an effective method for real time observation of bacterial distribution and evolution of these profiles during transport through porous media under different flow conditions the range of outcomes from exponential to multi exponential to non monotonic distributions was observed with changes in flow velocity and pore water saturation non monotonic distribution reflected bacterial accumulation without arrest in either the secondary minimum at the swi and or capillary interaction at the awi this novel real time observation method showed that the forms of the distributions remained consistent as deposition continued these results provide critical information for understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of bacterial transport behaviors through porous media including deep

4274,to extract unconventional energy more efficiently the hydraulic fracturing technology is widely used to create fracture network in formations and facilitate the transport of hydrocarbons to production wells nevertheless fracture conductivity decreases sharply and continuously due to the increase of closure pressure or effective stress it is a challenging problem to maintain fracture conductivity and reduce the conductivity change rate during extraction therefore it is of great significance to predict the behavior of proppant embedment and compaction within hydraulic fractures the objective of this work is to establish a reasonable model to determine the essential controls on conductivity of hydraulic fractures conventional fracturing and channel fracturing under stress conditions compared with other models our analytical model is not limited to elastic deformation of proppants but takes elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation of proppants into account in addition the model also considers proppant compaction body deformation and structural deformation besides proppant embedment the predictions from the proposed model agree well with the available experimental data presented in the literature the results show that the conductivity curves can be characterized by six stages elastic embedment and elastic compaction stage elastoplastic embedment and elastic compaction stage plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage including body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage only containing body deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastoplastic compaction stage plastic embedment and plastic compaction stage although the proppant compaction depth is smaller than the proppant embedment depth the change of conductivity due to proppant compaction cannot be ignored specifically for the studied case the change of conductivity due to proppant compaction is larger than that due to proppant embedment during the stages 2 6 compared to the change of conductivity in harder rocks with larger elastic modulus conductivity changes more dramatically in softer rocks with lower hardness to reduce the rate of conductivity change proppants with lager elastic modulus and larger size are recommended in the field this work presents an accurate and efficient analytical model to quantify the conductivity of hydraulic fracture under stress condition the proposed model reveals more details of the mechanisms that affect the deformation behavior in hydraulic fractures and offer some insights for parameter design and optimization during the execution of hydraulic fracturing keywords hydraulic fracture proppant elastic plastic deformation conductivity analytical model 1 introduction to meet the demand for energy the development of unconventional reservoirs e g shale gas with extremely low in situ permeability has been increasing during the past decades curtis 2002 jarvie et al 2007 wang et al 2009 howarth et al 2011 feng et al 2020 in addition to extract these unconventional resources more efficiently and achieve economic yield the hydraulic fracturing technology is widely used in petroleum industry to increase the permeability of reservoirs king 2010 gregory et al 2011 holditch 2013 xu et al 2016 by pumping high pressure fracturing fluid mixed with proppant slugs or small size proppants into the target formation to generate artificial fractures the conductivity of hydraulic fractures will increase remarkably leading to the yield being enhanced significantly chen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 in general due to the partial distribution of proppants the hydraulic fractures bear larger effective stress or closure pressure which will cause the decline of conductivity of fractures cui et al 2014 chen et al 2017 2018 specifically several scholars have found fracture conductivity and fracture permeability decreased sharply due to its strong stress sensitivity lacy et al 1997 wen et al 2007 lee et al 2010 alramahi and sundberg 2012 therefore although the fracture conductivity is enhanced initially its long term conductivity may decrease leading to the yield falling down hughes 2013 thus studying the mechanistic behavior of hydraulic fractures with proppants is critical for the design of fracturing physically as a composite medium the conductivity of hydraulic fractures with proppant packs is integratedly affected by the fracture proppants and their interaction chen et al 2017 in addition the conductivity change or permeability change of hydraulic fracture with proppants is affected by the embedment and compaction of proppant packs xu et al 2018 as suggested by previous scholars lacy et al 1997 wen et al 2007 lee et al 2010 alramahi and sundberg 2012 gaurav et al 2012 chen et al 2017 2018 jia et al 2019 many petrophysical properties e g porosity permeability and conductivity of hydraulic fractures will be strongly influenced by proppant packs deformation embedment and compaction within the fracture physically the deformation of proppants narrows fracture aperture triggering fracture conductivity and permeability to decline walsh 1981 suggested that the stress dependent permeability of fractures can be determined based on the cubic pressure dependence law however it is commonly known that the cubic pressure dependence law is too simple to characterize the stress dependent permeability of fractures especially for the hydraulic fractures with proppants therefore it is of great significance to predict the behavior of proppant deformation embedment and compaction within hydraulic fractures generally speaking methods for proppant deformation study are categorized into experimental tests and theoretical modeling numerical simulation empirical expressions and analytical models as a straightforward method experimental tests have been proved to be an effective way to study the proppant deformation for example some basic understandings on proppant deformation have been discovered through laboratory tests alramahi and sundberg 2012 guo et al 2008 lacy et al 1997 tan et al 2017 however conducting experiments to measure proppant deformation is costly and incurs significant time in addition the tested results for a given rock with specific properties are not suitable for other rocks as an alternative way numerical models have been proposed to study the proppant deformation for example deng et al 2014 conducted discrete element numerical simulations to quantify the proppant deformation embedment and suggested a larger embedment depth corresponded to a smaller proppant concentration zhang et al 2015 carried out computational fluid dynamics simulations to study fracture conductivity loss mathematically numerical simulation can be used to quantify proppant deformation however it is limited by the large computation workload to reduce computational costs and expensive and time consuming experiments empirical models have been widely used in the petroleum engineering for example on basis of the empirical expression between penetration and hardness huitt and mcglothlin 1958 derived an embedment depth model in addition volk et al 1981 developed empirical models to predict embedment depth guo et al 2008 used a cubic polynomial to fit the experimental results and proposed an empirical model to predict embedment depth recently chen et al 2017 proposed an empirical model an empirical power function to illustrate the complicated relationship between embedment depth and effective stress or closure pressure however to the best of our knowledge empirical models have empirical constants or fitting parameters whose physical meanings are not clear moreover empirical models cannot distinguish between different mechanisms neto et al 2015 alternatively analytical models are derived to characterize the mechanistic behavior of hydraulic fractures with proppants guo and liu 2012 li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 chen et al 2018 guo and liu 2012 developed a pressure dependent embedment depth model with taking elastic deformation and creeping deformation into account based on hertzian contact theory li et al 2015 and guo et al 2017 derived elastic models to predict embedment depth as the predictions from their proposed models are underestimated they also developed empirical models on basis of their elastic models to modify the predicted results to eliminate the limitation of fully elastic assumption chen et al 2018 derived an elastic plastic model to study the stress dependent embedment depth and further verifications about the elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation are required physically these models are developed for conventional hydraulic fracturing and not suitable for channel fracturing recently some analytical models have been derived to study the proppant deformation in channel fracturing zhang and hou 2016 zheng et al 2017 hou et al 2017 xu et al 2018 based on creeping model zhang and hou 2016 and hou et al 2017 developed visco elastic models to study the proppant embedment in channel fracturing however they ignored the proppant compaction specifically most of these existing analytical models only account for the proppant embedment but ignore the proppant compaction within the fractures generally speaking due to the effective stress or closure pressure proppant packs will be compacted leading to the decline of pore space in fractures li et al 2015 chen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 jia et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 and xu et al 2018 took proppant compaction into account and derived analytical models to study the stress dependent conductivity of channel fracturing however these two models are limited by elastic contact assumption previous studies convince us that limited by the complex mechanisms relevant analytical methods for predicting proppant deformation proppant embedment and proppant compaction are still deficient in what follows new analytical models will be derived to study proppant embedment compaction in hydraulic fractures conventional fracturing for each proppant deformation proppant embedment or proppant compaction the fully elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation will be considered moreover during proppant compaction process the body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs will be considered as well then the stress dependent conductivity will be determined followed by the model validation and parameter sensitivity analysis finally we will extend our model to channel fracturing the developed model reveals more details of the mechanisms that affect proppant packs deformation behavior in hydraulic fractures and offer some insights for the parameter design and optimization during the execution of hydraulic fracturing 2 methodology in this section an analytical model for stress dependent conductivity of conventional fracturing hydraulic fractures is presented physically the deformation of spherical proppant packs due to effective stress or closure pressure contains proppant compaction i e the primary deformation and structural deformation of proppants and proppant embedment fig 1 which will be included in our model for each deformation process proppant embedment or proppant compaction the proposed model accounts for fully elastic elastoplastic and fully plastic deformation in what follows firstly the derivation of spherical proppant packs embedment and compaction will be stated in detail then the analytical model for stress dependent conductivity will be presented 2 1 embedment process suppose the rigid spherical proppant packs with identical properties e g proppant radius r elastic modulus e p and poisson s ratio v p distribute evenly in hydraulic fractures with fracture wall thickness d 2 elastic modulus e f and poisson s ratio v f fig 1a in general due to the exerting force f proppants in contact with fracture surface will embed into the fracture seen in fig 1c many scholars suggested lacy et al 1997 wen et al 2007 lee et al 2010 gaurav et al 2012 alramahi and sundberg 2012 chen et al 2017 2018 proppant embedment depth increases with the increasing effective stress or closure pressure in addition this embedment process can be divided into fully elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic embedment song and komvopoulos 2013 chen et al 2018 zhi and elsworth 2020 in particular the plastic behavior applied to the proppants and rock is like this when the yield point is first exceeded the plastic zone is small and fully contained by material which remains elastic however as the load increases the indentation becomes more severe and an increasing pressure is required beneath the indenter to produce the necessary expansion eventually the plastic zone breaks out to the free surface and the displaced material is free to escape by plastic flow to the sides of the indenter johnson 1985 strictly speaking the hydrostatic pressure should be included where the effective stress is usually taken as the difference between the total stress and the pore pressure in this study this factor is not considered as the hydrostatic pressure was not reported in most of the existing experiments as far as we know this issue has not been considered in previous models or analysis as well which remains an open question and requires further investigation physically proppant elastic embedment process can be characterized by hertz contact deformation principle i e the embedment of rigid spheres into a rigid fracture surface under normal closure pressure seen in fig a1 with the detailed derivation of elastic embedment depth stated in appendix a the correlation between elastic embedment depth δ e and the average closure pressure p eff can be determined as li et al 2015 1 δ e ε 1 r 3 l 2 δ p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 1 v f 2 e f 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 d 2 δ p eff e f p eff f 4 l 2 r 2 π a 2 p effa 4 l 2 r 2 where δp eff p eff p eff0 is the difference of the closure pressure p eff0 is the initial closure pressure of the system in this paper for simplicity we will use p eff to represent δp eff hereafter besides p effa is the contact stress a is the contact radii parameter l denotes the distance coefficient which is suggested to be unity when proppants contacts closely to each other in this paper as each proppant is assumed to be next to others i e the space between two adjacent proppants is zero l is suggested to be unity note that if l 2 in eq 1 is replaced with the actual area of representative elementary volume guo et al 2017 eq 1 can be extended to study proppant embedment even proppant packs are sparsely distributed in fractures moreover e presents the average elasticity modulus of this system which is 2 e 1 v p 2 e p 1 v f 2 e f 1 eq 1 reveals that the elastic embedment depth δ e is related to the average closure pressure p eff proppant radius r and lithology parameters of proppant and fracture moreover ε 1 in eq 1 is the correction factor which is larger than or equal to unity for typical rough fracture surfaces and proppant surfaces ε 1 should be larger than unity considering the effect of effective stress accumulation of multiple proppants while for smooth fracture surface and proppant surface ε 1 is suggested to be unity as the effect of effective stress accumulation is usually weak physically when the contact stress increases up to a certain value yield stress first yield will occur in general the onset point of first yield is related to mineral composition of rocks and varies with different samples johnson 1985 suggested that p effa was 1 1 times of yield stress i e when p effa was approximately equal to 1 1 times of yield stress first yield would occur here we assume that the elastoplastic deformation will occur when closure pressure increases up to ε e times of yield stress σ y where ε e is taken to be 1 1 in this study as a result the maximum elastic embedment depth δ e max is 3 δ e max ε 1 3 ε e σ y 2 3 1 e 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r d 2 ε e σ y e f as mentioned above with the continuously increasing of closure pressure or contact stress elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic embedment will happen big alabo et al 2015 suggested that when 1 1σ y p effa 2 8σ y elastoplastic deformation occurs and when p effa 2 8σ y fully plastic embedment occurs physically during fully plastic embedment process p effa remains constant big alabo et al 2015 chen et al 2018 thus during the fully plastic embedment process the average contact stress p effa remains constant at 2 8σ y the onset point of fully plastic embedment generally speaking the onset point of fully plastic embedment is also related to mineral composition of rocks and varies with different samples in this paper by modifying the equations proposed by big alabo et al 2015 the correlation of exerting force f and fully plastic embedment depth δ p could be written as 4a f k p δ p δ p min f δ δ p where 4b k p 2 π η 1 ε p 1 σ y r δ p min χ 1 δ e max f δ δ p π ε p 1 σ y r 2 δ p min δ e max where ε p1 represents the ratio of the onset contact stress of fully plastic embedment to the yield stress parameter η 1 is the correction factor which was suggested as 0 821 by big alabo et al 2015 in general for completely rigid proppant η 1 should be assigned as unity however for most of the cases proppants are not completely rigid thus to make the prediction more accurate the correction factor will be taken into account in this paper to simplify the model η 1 is assigned as 0 821 moreover the ratio of δ p min δ e max i e parameter χ 1 varies from different studies for example johnson 1985 found χ 1 was 73 by deriving an analytical model to study the mean stress during elastoplastic loading process stronge 2000 stated χ 1 was 82 5 however by conducting finite element studies stronge 2000 set χ 1 as 140 in addition brake 2012 suggested χ 1 was 7 84 big alabo et al 2015 found χ 1 varies from 28 to 140 and he assigned χ 1 as 82 5 in his model in general χ 1 is the function of petrophysical properties of rocks and proppants its accurate value needs to be determined from experimental data note that eq 4 is derived based on the assumption that the proppant or fracture is rigid smooth i e the asperity can be ignored and homogeneous however affected by complex geological deposit and evolution actual fractures in the subsurface are heterogeneous and rough furthermore due to the complex mineral composition actual fractures are not completely rigid consequently there somewhat exists discrepancy between the prediction from eq 4 and the actual results chen et al 2018 suggested that nanometer indentation experiment was a good way to get the actual results during plastic embedment big alabo et al 2015 suggested that the contact radius a p the minimum a p min and can be written as 5a a p r 2 γ p γ e max a p min r 2 γ p min γ e max then during fully plastic embedment the closure pressure p eff and the onset closure pressure point of fully plastic deformation p p min is li et al 2015 5b p eff π a p 2 p effa 4 l 2 r 2 π a p 2 ε p 1 σ y 4 l 2 r 2 p p min π a p min 2 ε p 1 σ y 4 l 2 r 2 ε p σ y physically the elastoplastic deformation transits from fully elastic embedment process to fully plastic embedment process with the embedment depth ranging from δ e max to δ p min kogut and etsion 2002 brake 2012 by fitting the experimental results francis 1976 found the ratio of the average closure pressure to the logarithm of embedment depth remained constant during the elastic embedment so a suggested equation for closure pressure in the elastoplastic region is 6a p eff a 1 a 2 ln δ ep where a 1 and a 2 are fitting coefficients δ ep denotes embedment depth during elastoplastic deformation in view of eq 6a chen et al 2018 proposed an equation to describe the elastoplastic embedment δ ep which is 6b p eff σ y ε e ε p ε e ln δ ep δ e max ln δ p min δ e max in this paper eq 6b is used to characterize the elastoplastic embedment we remark that eqs 6a and 6b are derived based on the assumption that the ratio of p eff to the logarithm of δ ep also remains constant which has not been proved as the experimental results francis 1976 just suggest the ratio of p eff to the logarithm of δ e remains constant eq 6b needs to be modified on basis of the equations stated above the determine equation of embedment depth δ can be summarized as 7a δ δ e 0 δ δ e max δ δ ep δ e max δ p min δ e max p eff ε e σ y ε p ε e σ y δ e max δ δ p min δ δ p δ p min f f δ δ p k p δ δ p min by modifying eq 7a the change in fracture aperture δ can be written as li et al 2015 7b δ δ e 0 δ δ e max δ δ ep δ e max δ δ p min δ δ p δ δ p min where the change in fracture aperture during different deformation stages elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation can be obtained by replacing the item 1 e 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 in eq 7a with 1 e 2 3 2 2 compaction process as stated in the literature weaver et al 2005 2007 terracina et al 2010 one of the most possible packing models for spherical proppants is square packing seen in fig 2 a under this circumstance during proppant compaction process due to the closure pressure body deformation e g proppant contact changes from point contact to surface contact and structural deformation i e arrangement of proppant packs will change of proppant packs will occur fig 2 for body deformation with the increasing of closure pressure fully elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic embedment will occur in sequence however for structural deformation the arrangement of proppant packs i e the contact angle varies with the closure pressure suppose the proppant packs have the identical properties e g particle radii r elastic modulus e p and poisson s ratio v p in view of hertz contact deformation principle contact radius a e and the compaction depth γ e of two adjacent proppants under exerting force f during fully elastic deformation i e closure pressure p eff ε e σ y are gangi 1978 mckee et al 1988 cao and lei 2019 8 a e 3 f 4 r 1 v p 2 e p 3 γ e 9 f 2 2 r 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 assuming the closure pressure is equal in everywhere of the fracture then on basis of eq a9 the average closure pressure in the system p eff is 9 p eff f 4 l 2 r 2 note that the closure pressure p eff in eq 9 also represents the difference of the closure pressure which has subtracted initial closure pressure p eff0 in a similar way the contact radius a e and fully elastic compaction depth γ e can be rewritten as 10a a e 3 l 2 p eff 1 v p 2 e p 3 r γ e 2 a e 2 r 2 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r in general the proppant surface is not fully smooth and proppants are not fully rigid hence eq 10a is modified as 10b γ e 2 ε 2 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r where ε 2 in eq 10b is the correction factor which is larger than or equal to unity for fully smooth fracture surface and proppant surface ε 2 is suggested to be unity mathematically γ e is much less than r chen et al 2017 taking the relevant parameters of well jhw020 in lucaogou tight oil reservoir china for example chen et al 2018 elastic modulus of proppants e p is 41306 mpa poission s ratio of proppants is 0 25 the harmonic average proppant radii r is 0 181 mm assuming the closure pressure is 120 mpa the yield stress of proppants based on eq 10 the γ e is approximately as 1 47 10 2 mm thus compared with r γ e 2 0 0013 γ e 2 16 1 35 10 5 can be neglected and we have r 2 a e 2 r 2 r γ e 2 r γ e 4 2 therefore according to eq 10 half the distance between the centers of two adjacent spherical proppants b e can be given by 11 b e r 2 a e 2 r γ e 4 r ε 2 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 2 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r 0 p eff ε e σ y by substituting p eff ε

and fully plastic deformations will not occur in most of the cases however in this paper to study the proppant compaction more in depth we also discuss the elastoplastic and fully plastic deformations of proppants in the same way during fully plastic deformation we have 13 f k p γ p γ p min f γ γ p where 14a k p 2 π η 1 ε p 1 σ y r av γ p min χ 1 γ e max f δ δ p π ε p 1 σ y r av 2 γ p min γ e max where γ p denotes the fully plastic compaction depth and γ p min denotes the minimum fully plastic compaction depth ε p1 represents the ratio of the onset contact stress of fully plastic embedment to the yield stress note that r av in eq 14 represents the average pore radii of two adjacent spherical proppants which is r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 however as the proppants in the fracture are assumed to have the same size r we have r av r 2 then eq 14a can be further determined as 14b k p π η 2 ε p 1 σ y r γ p min χ 2 γ e max f δ δ p π ε p 1 σ y r γ p min γ e max 2 in eq 14b correction factors η 2 and χ 2 are

v p 2 e p 2 3 r in the same way during plastic embedment the contact radius a p the minimum a p min the closure pressure and the onset closure pressure point of fully plastic deformation p p min can

elastoplastic deformation process i e closure pressure p eff varies from ε e σ y to ε p σ y the following equation can be given in accordance with eq 6b by 17 p eff σ y ε e ε p ε e ln γ ep γ e max ln γ p min γ e max where γ ep denotes the compaction depth of elastoplastic deformation with the determined γ ep the contact radius a ep for elastoplastic deformation ε e σ y p eff ε p σ y is given by 18 a ep r γ ep γ e max 2 eq 18 shows that when γ ep γ e max a ep can be simplified as a ep r γ e max 2 which is in line with eq 10 however when γ ep is equal to γ p min a ep can be simplified as a ep r γ p min γ e max 2 which is in accordance with eq 15 then according to eq 18 the distance b ep is 19 b ep r 2 a ep 2 r 2 r γ ep γ e max 2 on basis of the equations stated above the determine equation of

physically parameter ratio β п represents the changing rate of structural deformation of proppant packs the larger β п is the greater changing rate of structural deformation of proppant packs will be 2 3 conductivity as proppants are assumed to distribute homogeneously in the fracture the flow through fracture with proppants can be regarded as flow through a channel with identical cross sectional size then on basis of hagen poiseuille equation the initial permeability can be expressed as jia et al 2019 23 k φ r 2 8 τ φ 8 π τ 4 b 1 2 sin θ 4 a 1 b 1 π 4 arctan a 1 b 1 r 2 where φ represents porosity of fracture with proppants and τ denotes tortuosity slichter 1899 suggested that the initial porosity φ 0 and the initial tortuosity τ 0 could be written as 24 φ 0 1 π 6 1 cos θ 1 2 cos θ τ 0 1 cos θ 1 2 cos θ sin θ eq 24 reveals that when contact angle θ is π 6 φ 0 and τ 0 are identical to those determined by li et al 2015 as a result the equations in li et al 2015 are special cases of eq 24 then by combing proppant deformation proppant embedment and compaction we have li et al 2015 25 φ φ 0 h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ τ h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 2 τ 0 2 1 h 0 2

arctan a 1 b 1 r 2 π h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 26b c fn c f c f p eff 0 eq 26 implies that fracture conductivity or normalized conductivity during pressure loading process is a function of closure pressure rock lithology parameters proppant packs size and proppant packs lithology parameters etc 3 model validation 3 1 proppant packs embedment to verify the derived model in eq 7a the predicted stress dependent embedment depth from the new model is compared with available experimental results e g lacy et al 1997 1998 lu et al 2008 guo et al 2008 alramahi and sundberg 2012 fig 3 shows the proppant packs embedment depth versus the closure pressure for different samples the results suggest that the predictions provide a good match over the entire range of data fig 3 taking fig 3a for example alramahi and sundberg 2012 measured proppant embedment in shales and they found the embedment depth increased with the increasing of clay content in samples the known experimental conditions are r 0 3 mm 20 40 mesh proppants and d 2 7 6 mm as other experimental conditions are not clearly reported in our model e p is assigned as 21 306 gpa v p and v f are both assigned as 0 2 in addition as elastic modulus decreases linearly as clay content increases lei et al 2019 the elastic modulus is determined by e f 1 12 6 5 10 x where x is the clay content and the unit of e f is gpa theoretically the yield point is usually taken to be governed by von mises criterion or tresca s criterion johnson 1985 it should be measured in experiments but was not provided in most of the existing proppant embedment tests usually only the elastic modulus is provided in general the yielding stress can be determined graphically when the pressure depth curve finishes the curvature part elastic region and starts to become straight elastoplastic region in the semi log plot where the indentation is in log scale song and komvopoulos 2013 zhi and elsworth 2020 this process is adopted in our analysis not shown here and we show the cartesian plot instead for a better comparison with the experimental results fig 3a presents that the proposed model can fit well with experimental data for these six samples the results suggest that a higher clay content corresponds to a smaller yield stress in other words compared with a sample with lower clay content the elastoplastic deformation for the sample with higher clay content occurs earlier with the proppant embedment tester lacy et al 1997 conducted experiments to study stress dependent embedment depth for their tests the known conditions are r 0 3175 mm d 2 20 mm v p v f 0 13 and e p 21 306 gpa the main mismatch between the experimental data and the model prediction occurs when the clay content reaches 52 indicating that the high volume of clay significantly affects the mechanical properties of the rock system and this complicated phenomenon is possibly related to heterogeneity and requires further investigation the results shown in fig 3b suggest that the predicted values exhibit excellent agreements with the experimental data in order to further validate our proposed model the experimental data of lu et al 2008 and guo et al 2008 are also applied to validate our proposed model eq 7a based on the experimental conditions the corresponding parameters are summarized in fig 3c and d respectively we can see from fig 3c and d that our predictions are close to the experimental data moreover the results in fig 3d demonstrate that our predicted values are closer to experimental data than the empirical model based on our derived model we can see that for the experiments conducted by guo et al 2008 the onset points of elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation are approximately 20 mpa and 50 mpa respectively which was not revealed in guo s model these values lead to a ratio of the onset of fully plastic region and the yield point at about 50 20 2 5 close to the suggested value of 2 8 in the literature we remark that the experimental data is somehow dubious especially in the middle region specifically the data points near effective stress 28 mpa embedment depth 0 07 mm shows that the embedment depth slightly decreases as the effective stress or closure pressure increases which could be due to measurement error therefore we also analyzed another possible explanation that the embedment depth versus closure pressure is categorized into two regions elastic and elastoplastic in general cases we may just use the two region model if it is good enough for the interpretation of the pressure depth curve otherwise if a third region exists and exhibits clear different behavior from the other regions we may consider the three region model in addition to the basic physical parameters listed in the corresponding figures other parameters especially fitting parameters in each of the verification examples are summarized in table 1 3 2 proppant packs compaction to further verify the derived model the predicted stress dependent compaction depth from the new model is compared with available experimental data lacy et al 1998 conducted experiments on olmos sandstone to study the proppant embedment and proppant compaction with crushing for their tests the known conditions are r 0 3175 mm d 2 20 mm v p v f 0 13 and e p 21 306 gpa in view of their experimental conditions the corresponding parameters are summarized in fig 4 it s clear that our predicted stress dependent embedment depth is close to the experimental data which reveals that the values of the parameters in our model are reasonable then with these determined parameters the theoretical values of compaction depth can be predicted the results suggest that the predictions i e the stress dependent compaction depth provide a good match over the entire range of data fig 4 as we can see from fig 4 under a given closure pressure embedment depth is much larger than compaction depth as a result many scholars only considered proppant embedment but ignored proppant compaction and the available experimental data about compaction depth is limited however even though compaction depth is smaller than embedment depth it still affects proppant deformation 3 3 conductivity and normalized conductivity several experimental results about conductivity and normalized conductivity are applied to further validate our model fig 5 shows the curves of conductivity or normalized conductivity versus closure pressure in these figures the comparison of the measured data by various scholars wen et al 2007 guo et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 alramahi and sundberg 2012 and those predicted by our derived model are presented fig 5 reveals that the proposed model matches the experimental data well guo et al 2008 conducted conductivity tests on steel with relative larger elastic modulus and core slice with relative smaller elastic modulus and they found fracture conductivity decreased as closure pressure increased in their tests steel was applied to simulate the fracture in which proppant embedment depth was relative smaller and core slices were used to simulate the fractures in which proppant embedment depth was relative larger the parameter values known in these cases are given as r 0 3175 mm d 2 19 mm v p v f 0 148 and e p 35 gpa in addition the elastic modulus of core slice is 10 049 gpa note that in general the current practice is to assume the elastic modulus of steel platen to be about 200 gpa for all steel grades mahendran 1996 dehestani and mousavi 2015 mahendran 1996 also suggested that the elastic modulus of steel platen varied with the grade or the thickness of the steel by considering the bond slip effects in the embedded element dehestani and mousavi 2015 modified the elastic modulus of the steel and concluded that the elastic modulus of the steel was related to the strength of materials and geometric specifications of member for instance for the bare steel specimens r f60 d6 a and ur10 with elastic modulus of 200 gpa the modified elastic modulus is 119 77 gpa for the specimen r f60 d6 a and the modified elastic modulus for the specimen ur10 is 117 19 gpa in this paper for the sake of the simplification the elastic modulus of steel platen hereinafter is assumed to be 200 gpa in view of their experimental conditions the corresponding parameters are summarized in fig 5a it s clear that our predicted conductivity is close to the experimental data zhang et al 2008 measured stress dependent fracture conductivities of 10 20 and 20 40 mesh proppants quartz sands in their experiments the average radiuses of 10 20 and 20 40 mesh proppants are 0 55 mm and 0 3175 mm respectively with the parameters summarized in fig 5b the stress dependent fracture conductivity can be predicted quite well over the entire range of data using our proposed model what s more it s clear that under a given closure pressure a larger fracture conductivity corresponds to a greater proppant size when closure pressure is smaller than 20 mpa fracture conductivity curves for 10 20 and 20 40 mesh proppants decrease sharply as closure pressure increases and these two curves differ greatly however when closure pressure exceeds 20 mpa these two fracture conductivity curves change gently and have small difference due to the occurrence of the elastoplastic deformation li et al 2015 stated that as their model neglected proppant crush or elastoplastic deformation there existed a great difference between the experimental data and predicted values when closure pressure exceeded 20 mpa in contrast our proposed model took elastoplastic deformation and plastic deformation into account and provides more accurate predictions furthermore fig 5b also reveals that when closure pressure is lower than 20 mpa proppants with larger size are suggested to be applied in the field to further validate our model the experimental data from wen et al 2007 is applied to calibrate our proposed model fig 5c g in their tests proppants proppant 1 and proppant 2 with different sizes 20 40 mesh or 30 60 mesh were applied moreover steel with large elastic modulus and core slice with relative smaller elastic modulus were used to simulate the fractures for instance the elastic modulus of steel is 200 gpa while the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of dolomitic mudstone are 12 76 gpa and 0 32 additionally the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of siltstone are 22 18 gpa and 0 35 and the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of conglomerate are 19 39 gpa and 0 19 other known conditions are r 0 3175 mm for 20 40 mesh proppant and r 0 2125 mm for 30 60 mesh proppant with the parameters summarized in the corresponding figures the stress dependent conductivity can be modeled as shown in fig 5c g our proposed model can adequately characterize the stress dependent conductivity of fractures alramahi and sundberg 2012 measured stress dependent fracture conductivities and on basis of the proppant embedment depth they developed an analytical normalized conductivity model to explain the results fig 5h presents the comparison of the test data the normalized conductivity the predictions from alramahi and sundberg s model and the predicted normalized conductivity from our proposed model the parameter values known in alramahi and sundberg s experiments are r 0 3 mm and d 2 7 6 mm the values of other parameters are identical to those applied in fig 3a as shown in fig 5h compared with the predicted results from alramahi and sundberg s model our predicted results are closer to the experimental results 4 results and discussions 4 1 conventional fracturing after validation by exhaustive experimental data this derived model is used for sensitivity analysis of different conditions on fracture aperture change compaction depth and normalized conductivity of hydraulic fractures fig 6 shows the influences of different conditions e g proppant radii proppant elastic modulus and fracture elastic modulus on fracture aperture change ratio i e the ratio of fracture aperture change to fracture initial aperture and embedment depth ratio i e the ratio of embedment depth to fracture initial aperture in these cases the yield stress is 80 mpa parameter ε 1 is 10 parameter χ 1 is 2 parameter η 1 is 0 821 fracture initial aperture is 5 times the diameter of proppants and the onset point of plastic deformation is 120 mpa other basic parameters are summarized in the corresponding figures as one can see from fig 6 there exists positive relationship between fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio and closure pressure moreover the rate of change in fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio during elastoplastic deformation or plastic deformation is larger than that during elastic deformation which is as anticipated results fig 6a suggest that under a given closure pressure fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio decreases with the increasing of proppant size as a result under the same conditions compared with larger size proppants one of the problems regarding the use of smaller size proppants is the greater fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio as depicted in fig 6b under a given closure pressure embedment depth ratio increases as proppant elastic modulus increases however a larger fracture aperture change ratio corresponds to a smaller proppant elastic modulus the main reason is that a smaller value of proppant elastic modulus means more deformation of system proppant and fracture and proppant itself as the main controlling factor of conductivity change fracture aperture change ratio monotonically increases with proppant size although embedment depth the different between system deformation and proppant deformation monotonically decreases with proppant size proppants with larger elastic modulus are still suggested to be applied in the field fig 6c reveals that under a given closure pressure fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio decreases with the increasing of fracture elastic modulus in other words the rocks with lower elastic modulus are easier to be embedded with proppants similar findings have been also reported by various scholars chen et al 2017 lacy et al 1997 1998 zhang et al 2015 fig 7 shows the influences of proppant radius and proppant elastic modulus on compaction depth in these cases the initial closure pressure is 10 mpa the yield stress is 80 mpa parameter ε 2 is 1 parameter χ 2 is 2 parameter η 2 is 0 821 fracture initial aperture is 5 times the diameter of proppants and the onset point of plastic deformation is 120 mpa other basic parameters are summarized in the corresponding figures as one can see from fig 7 compaction depth is positively correlated with closure pressure furthermore the rate of the change in compaction depth during elastoplastic deformation or plastic deformation is larger than that in elastic deformation which is expected fig 7a reveals that under a given closure pressure compaction depth increases with the increasing of proppant size however compaction depth ratio i e the ratio of compaction depth to fracture initial aperture is free from influence of proppant size as depicted in fig 7b under a given closure pressure compaction depth monotonically increases with the decreasing of proppant elastic modulus as a result proppants with larger elastic modulus are suggested to be applied in the field fig 8 a shows the characteristic curves of normalized conductivity in these cases the initial closure pressure is 10 mpa the yield stress of rock is 40 mpa the onset point of rock plastic deformation is 80 mpa the yield stress of proppant is 140 mpa the onset point of proppant plastic deformation is 180 mpa parameter ε 1 is 11 parameter ε 2 is 1 parameters χ 1 and χ 2 are both 2 parameters η 1 and η 2 are both 0 821 fracture initial aperture is 5 times the diameter of proppants and other basic parameters are summarized in the corresponding figures results fig 8a illustrate that the normalized conductivity curves can be characterized by six stages the first stage is elastic embedment and elastic compaction stage in which the conductivity change is dominated by proppant size and elastic deformation parameters e g elastic modulus poisson s ratio correct factors ε 1 and ε 2 the larger rock yield stress is the longer the stage 1 will be the second stage is elastoplastic embedment and elastic compaction stage in which the conductivity change due to embedment is dominated by parameter χ 1 under a given rock yield stress the larger the onset point of plastic embedment is the longer the stage 2 will be the third stage is plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage during which the change of conductivity due to embedment presents a linearity relation to the closure pressure in addition body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs occur due to the closure pressure the length of stage 3 is dominated by parameter ratio β п theoretically the larger parameter ratio β п is the shorter the stage 3 will be the main reason is that a larger β п corresponds to a greater changing rate of structural deformation of proppant packs the fourth stage is also plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage however during this stage due to the closure pressure only the body deformation of proppant packs occurs and the structural deformation of proppant packs does not change anymore in other words the contact angle θ of proppants will not decrease as closure pressure increases the fifth stage is plastic embedment and elastoplastic compaction stage in which the conductivity change due to compaction is dominated by parameter χ 2 in general the larger the proppant yield stress is the longer the stage 5 will be the sixth stage is plastic embedment and plastic compaction stage in which conductivity varies linearly with closure pressure moreover in this case during stages 2 6 conductivity change due to compaction is larger than that due to embedment with the same parameters the influences of different conditions on normalized conductivity curves are presented in fig 8b d results fig 8b suggest that under a given closure pressure normalized conductivity increases with the increase of proppant size as a result one of the notable problems of using small size proppants in the field is the fast decrease of conductivity as depicted in fig 8c conductivity increases as proppant elastic modulus increases accordingly to maintain the conductivity of hydraulic fractures lager elastic modulus proppants are recommended in the field similar findings have also been noted by various scholars lacy et al 1997 1998 zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 fig 8d reveals that under a given closure pressure conductivity increases with the increasing of fracture elastic modulus consequently compared to conductivity change in harder rocks with larger elastic modulus conductivity change more dramatically in softer rocks with lower hardness 4 2 channel fracturing as stated above due to the effects of discontinuous distribution of proppant pillars and the free channel in fracture even if the structure of each proppant pillar is identical the stress deformation characteristic for channel fracturing is distinct from that for conventional fracturing gillard et al 2010 medvedev et al 2013 nguyen et al 2014 xu et al 2018 specifically compared with conventional fracturing channel fracturing has more void space left open to flow thus the closure pressure exerting on proppant packs in channel fracturing is larger than that in conventional fracturing in this paper for channel fracturing the closure pressure can be modified in accordance with the force balance in fracture aperture direction by xu et al 2018 27 p effm p eff a f a p p eff a p a vo a p p eff c where p effm represents the modified closure pressure a f is the total surface area of fracture a p is the area which is supported by proppants a vo is the void area which is unsupported by proppants and parameter c 0 c 1 represents the proppant area fraction which is used to characterize the cover extent physically a larger c value corresponds to a higher cover degree when parameter c is assigned as zero the channel fracturing fracture is simplified as a free channel i e a two parallel wall however when parameter c is set as unity the value of p effm equals to that of p eff which reveals that eq 27 is also suitable for conventional fracturing fracture and the conventional fracturing fracture is a special case of channel fracturing fracture in addition eq 27 implies that the modified closure pressure p effm for channel fracturing is larger than closure pressure p eff for conventional fracturing in general fluid flow along channel fracturing fracture is different with that for conventional fracturing fracture specifically it s not suitable to use darcy s law characterizing the flow in channel fracturing in general compared with permeability of free channel in the fracture permeability of proppant pillars is much lower moreover many scholar gillard et al 2010 medvedev et al 2013 xu et al 2018 found that due to the discontinuous distribution of proppants in channel fracturing flow pattern in channel fracturing would be dominated by navier stokes flow based on the two dimensional navier stokes equations brinkman 1949 vafai and tien 1982 kumar et al 1991 xu et al 2018 the following equation is used to describe the steady state flow through channel fracturing as 28 d p effm dx μ 1 c 2 2 u z z 2 μ k 2 u z where x denotes the direction along the fracture length z denotes the direction along fracture aperture μ is fluid viscosity u represents the average velocity in fracture plane and parameter k 2 is permeability coefficient suppose that the radius of each cylinder proppant pillar is identical to r p then k 2 can be suggested as kumar et al 1991 sangani and acrivos 1982 sangani and yao 1988 xu et al 2018 29 k 2 r p 2 8 c ln c 1 476 2 c 0 5 c 2 c 0 4 k 2 r p 2 3 34 c 1 1 10 c 5 2 0 4 c 0 8 assuming r p remains constant during deformation eq 29 implies that k 2 is independent of closure pressure by solving eq 28 we can determine the velocity u then the average velocity u a along the z direction i e fracture aperture direction can be obtained as 30 u a 1 h 1 2 h 1 2 h udz k 2 μ d p effm dx 1 tanh 1 c h 2 k 2 1 c h 2 k 2 where parameter h is the stress dependent fracture aperture which can be determined by h 0 2 δ by combing eq 30 and darcy s law the stress dependent permeability k of channel fracturing is kumar et al 1991 xu et al 2018 31 k k 2 1 tanh 1 c h 2 k 2 1 c h 2 k 2 by substituting eq 29 into eq 31 the stress dependent permeability k of channel fracturing can be determined then in view of the definition of dimensionless fracture conductivity we have 32 c fd kh k 0 h 0 1 tanh 1 c h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 2 k 2 1 c h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 2 k 2 1 tanh 1 c h 0 2 k 2 1 c h 0 2 k 2 h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ h 0 to verify the derived model in eq 32 for channel fracturing the predicted conductivity from eq 32 is compared with available experimental data fig 9 hou et al 2017 conducted experiments to study the effect of the proppant distribution on the fracture conductivity of channel fracturing in their tests the known conditions are given as r 0 3175 mm 20 40 mesh r p 16 4 mm and c 0 52 besides these known parameter values other parameter values applied in our calculation are d 2 20 mm v p 0 148 v f 0 25 e p 5 gpa and e f 2 gpa it s clear that our predicted stress dependent conductivity is close to the experimental data which reveals that our model in eq 32 can adequately characterize the stress dependent conductivity of channel fracturing 4 3 model advantages and limitations the analytical model developed in this paper lays theoretical foundations for characterizing the proppant deformation embedment and compaction in hydraulic fractures compared with former models our models take elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and plastic deformation into account moreover we extend our proposed model to study the deformation of channel fracturing as a result our derived model is of great significance in selecting proppants and optimizing parameters during the execution of hydraulic fracturing for instance the modeling results of our derived model suggest that it s better to apply proppants with larger elastic modulus and larger size in the field however it should be noted that the improvement on our model is still required for example some parameters in our derived model are related to lithology parameters which are needed to be further quantified moreover more available data about proppant compaction are needed to further validate our model in recent years proppants with other shapes e g rod shaped proppants have raised considerable interest in many reservoirs e g jia et al 2019 in general compared with spherical proppants rod shaped proppants can help to reduce friction pressure furthermore rod shaped proppants can provide high porosity packing however in this work our derived model is limited to deformation of spherical proppants further researches about deformation behavior of other shaped proppants are needed these findings suggest that we should exercise care in analyzing stress dependent conductivity of fractures as there are so many factors in these complex systems will contribute the errors the deformation of hydraulic fractures is an interesting and challenging topic and the corresponding work is still under processing 5 conclusions in this paper a novel analytical model is derived to investigate proppant embedment compaction and stress dependent conductivity of hydraulic fractures conventional fracturing and channel fracturing in reservoirs e g shale tight sandstone and coal etc in addition the characteristic curves of normalized conductivity are obtained compared with other models our proposed model take elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation into account the derived model is validated by various experimental data and is shown to perform well the derived model is also used to conduct sensitivity analysis of different conditions e g proppant size proppant elastic modulus rock elastic modulus on conductivity change of hydraulic fractures results indicate that the normalized conductivity curves can be characterized by six stages elastic embedment and elastic compaction stage elastoplastic embedment and elastic compaction stage plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage including body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage only containing body deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastoplastic compaction stage plastic embedment and plastic compaction stage moreover both proppant compaction and proppant embedment are of great significance to predict conductivity change of hydraulic fractures in order to reduce the rate of conductivity change proppants with lager elastic modulus and larger size are recommended in the field in addition to providing theoretical foundations for quantifying permeability change in fractures another advantage of these derived models is that with experimental permeability data it can be utilized to estimate relevant parameters

is proposed based on the classic hertzian contact deformation theory with the assumption that the fracture surface and proppant surface are sufficiently smooth however this assumption neglects topological features of natural fracture surfaces which will lead to the predictions are underestimated in addition the derived eq a12 only considers the deformation of a single rigid spherical proppant packs embedment in hydraulic fractures in other words the effect of effective stress accumulation is neglected thus to make the derived model more reasonable for typical rough fracture

4274,to extract unconventional energy more efficiently the hydraulic fracturing technology is widely used to create fracture network in formations and facilitate the transport of hydrocarbons to production wells nevertheless fracture conductivity decreases sharply and continuously due to the increase of closure pressure or effective stress it is a challenging problem to maintain fracture conductivity and reduce the conductivity change rate during extraction therefore it is of great significance to predict the behavior of proppant embedment and compaction within hydraulic fractures the objective of this work is to establish a reasonable model to determine the essential controls on conductivity of hydraulic fractures conventional fracturing and channel fracturing under stress conditions compared with other models our analytical model is not limited to elastic deformation of proppants but takes elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation of proppants into account in addition the model also considers proppant compaction body deformation and structural deformation besides proppant embedment the predictions from the proposed model agree well with the available experimental data presented in the literature the results show that the conductivity curves can be characterized by six stages elastic embedment and elastic compaction stage elastoplastic embedment and elastic compaction stage plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage including body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage only containing body deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastoplastic compaction stage plastic embedment and plastic compaction stage although the proppant compaction depth is smaller than the proppant embedment depth the change of conductivity due to proppant compaction cannot be ignored specifically for the studied case the change of conductivity due to proppant compaction is larger than that due to proppant embedment during the stages 2 6 compared to the change of conductivity in harder rocks with larger elastic modulus conductivity changes more dramatically in softer rocks with lower hardness to reduce the rate of conductivity change proppants with lager elastic modulus and larger size are recommended in the field this work presents an accurate and efficient analytical model to quantify the conductivity of hydraulic fracture under stress condition the proposed model reveals more details of the mechanisms that affect the deformation behavior in hydraulic fractures and offer some insights for parameter design and optimization during the execution of hydraulic fracturing keywords hydraulic fracture proppant elastic plastic deformation conductivity analytical model 1 introduction to meet the demand for energy the development of unconventional reservoirs e g shale gas with extremely low in situ permeability has been increasing during the past decades curtis 2002 jarvie et al 2007 wang et al 2009 howarth et al 2011 feng et al 2020 in addition to extract these unconventional resources more efficiently and achieve economic yield the hydraulic fracturing technology is widely used in petroleum industry to increase the permeability of reservoirs king 2010 gregory et al 2011 holditch 2013 xu et al 2016 by pumping high pressure fracturing fluid mixed with proppant slugs or small size proppants into the target formation to generate artificial fractures the conductivity of hydraulic fractures will increase remarkably leading to the yield being enhanced significantly chen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 in general due to the partial distribution of proppants the hydraulic fractures bear larger effective stress or closure pressure which will cause the decline of conductivity of fractures cui et al 2014 chen et al 2017 2018 specifically several scholars have found fracture conductivity and fracture permeability decreased sharply due to its strong stress sensitivity lacy et al 1997 wen et al 2007 lee et al 2010 alramahi and sundberg 2012 therefore although the fracture conductivity is enhanced initially its long term conductivity may decrease leading to the yield falling down hughes 2013 thus studying the mechanistic behavior of hydraulic fractures with proppants is critical for the design of fracturing physically as a composite medium the conductivity of hydraulic fractures with proppant packs is integratedly affected by the fracture proppants and their interaction chen et al 2017 in addition the conductivity change or permeability change of hydraulic fracture with proppants is affected by the embedment and compaction of proppant packs xu et al 2018 as suggested by previous scholars lacy et al 1997 wen et al 2007 lee et al 2010 alramahi and sundberg 2012 gaurav et al 2012 chen et al 2017 2018 jia et al 2019 many petrophysical properties e g porosity permeability and conductivity of hydraulic fractures will be strongly influenced by proppant packs deformation embedment and compaction within the fracture physically the deformation of proppants narrows fracture aperture triggering fracture conductivity and permeability to decline walsh 1981 suggested that the stress dependent permeability of fractures can be determined based on the cubic pressure dependence law however it is commonly known that the cubic pressure dependence law is too simple to characterize the stress dependent permeability of fractures especially for the hydraulic fractures with proppants therefore it is of great significance to predict the behavior of proppant deformation embedment and compaction within hydraulic fractures generally speaking methods for proppant deformation study are categorized into experimental tests and theoretical modeling numerical simulation empirical expressions and analytical models as a straightforward method experimental tests have been proved to be an effective way to study the proppant deformation for example some basic understandings on proppant deformation have been discovered through laboratory tests alramahi and sundberg 2012 guo et al 2008 lacy et al 1997 tan et al 2017 however conducting experiments to measure proppant deformation is costly and incurs significant time in addition the tested results for a given rock with specific properties are not suitable for other rocks as an alternative way numerical models have been proposed to study the proppant deformation for example deng et al 2014 conducted discrete element numerical simulations to quantify the proppant deformation embedment and suggested a larger embedment depth corresponded to a smaller proppant concentration zhang et al 2015 carried out computational fluid dynamics simulations to study fracture conductivity loss mathematically numerical simulation can be used to quantify proppant deformation however it is limited by the large computation workload to reduce computational costs and expensive and time consuming experiments empirical models have been widely used in the petroleum engineering for example on basis of the empirical expression between penetration and hardness huitt and mcglothlin 1958 derived an embedment depth model in addition volk et al 1981 developed empirical models to predict embedment depth guo et al 2008 used a cubic polynomial to fit the experimental results and proposed an empirical model to predict embedment depth recently chen et al 2017 proposed an empirical model an empirical power function to illustrate the complicated relationship between embedment depth and effective stress or closure pressure however to the best of our knowledge empirical models have empirical constants or fitting parameters whose physical meanings are not clear moreover empirical models cannot distinguish between different mechanisms neto et al 2015 alternatively analytical models are derived to characterize the mechanistic behavior of hydraulic fractures with proppants guo and liu 2012 li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 chen et al 2018 guo and liu 2012 developed a pressure dependent embedment depth model with taking elastic deformation and creeping deformation into account based on hertzian contact theory li et al 2015 and guo et al 2017 derived elastic models to predict embedment depth as the predictions from their proposed models are underestimated they also developed empirical models on basis of their elastic models to modify the predicted results to eliminate the limitation of fully elastic assumption chen et al 2018 derived an elastic plastic model to study the stress dependent embedment depth and further verifications about the elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation are required physically these models are developed for conventional hydraulic fracturing and not suitable for channel fracturing recently some analytical models have been derived to study the proppant deformation in channel fracturing zhang and hou 2016 zheng et al 2017 hou et al 2017 xu et al 2018 based on creeping model zhang and hou 2016 and hou et al 2017 developed visco elastic models to study the proppant embedment in channel fracturing however they ignored the proppant compaction specifically most of these existing analytical models only account for the proppant embedment but ignore the proppant compaction within the fractures generally speaking due to the effective stress or closure pressure proppant packs will be compacted leading to the decline of pore space in fractures li et al 2015 chen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 jia et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 and xu et al 2018 took proppant compaction into account and derived analytical models to study the stress dependent conductivity of channel fracturing however these two models are limited by elastic contact assumption previous studies convince us that limited by the complex mechanisms relevant analytical methods for predicting proppant deformation proppant embedment and proppant compaction are still deficient in what follows new analytical models will be derived to study proppant embedment compaction in hydraulic fractures conventional fracturing for each proppant deformation proppant embedment or proppant compaction the fully elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation will be considered moreover during proppant compaction process the body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs will be considered as well then the stress dependent conductivity will be determined followed by the model validation and parameter sensitivity analysis finally we will extend our model to channel fracturing the developed model reveals more details of the mechanisms that affect proppant packs deformation behavior in hydraulic fractures and offer some insights for the parameter design and optimization during the execution of hydraulic fracturing 2 methodology in this section an analytical model for stress dependent conductivity of conventional fracturing hydraulic fractures is presented physically the deformation of spherical proppant packs due to effective stress or closure pressure contains proppant compaction i e the primary deformation and structural deformation of proppants and proppant embedment fig 1 which will be included in our model for each deformation process proppant embedment or proppant compaction the proposed model accounts for fully elastic elastoplastic and fully plastic deformation in what follows firstly the derivation of spherical proppant packs embedment and compaction will be stated in detail then the analytical model for stress dependent conductivity will be presented 2 1 embedment process suppose the rigid spherical proppant packs with identical properties e g proppant radius r elastic modulus e p and poisson s ratio v p distribute evenly in hydraulic fractures with fracture wall thickness d 2 elastic modulus e f and poisson s ratio v f fig 1a in general due to the exerting force f proppants in contact with fracture surface will embed into the fracture seen in fig 1c many scholars suggested lacy et al 1997 wen et al 2007 lee et al 2010 gaurav et al 2012 alramahi and sundberg 2012 chen et al 2017 2018 proppant embedment depth increases with the increasing effective stress or closure pressure in addition this embedment process can be divided into fully elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic embedment song and komvopoulos 2013 chen et al 2018 zhi and elsworth 2020 in particular the plastic behavior applied to the proppants and rock is like this when the yield point is first exceeded the plastic zone is small and fully contained by material which remains elastic however as the load increases the indentation becomes more severe and an increasing pressure is required beneath the indenter to produce the necessary expansion eventually the plastic zone breaks out to the free surface and the displaced material is free to escape by plastic flow to the sides of the indenter johnson 1985 strictly speaking the hydrostatic pressure should be included where the effective stress is usually taken as the difference between the total stress and the pore pressure in this study this factor is not considered as the hydrostatic pressure was not reported in most of the existing experiments as far as we know this issue has not been considered in previous models or analysis as well which remains an open question and requires further investigation physically proppant elastic embedment process can be characterized by hertz contact deformation principle i e the embedment of rigid spheres into a rigid fracture surface under normal closure pressure seen in fig a1 with the detailed derivation of elastic embedment depth stated in appendix a the correlation between elastic embedment depth δ e and the average closure pressure p eff can be determined as li et al 2015 1 δ e ε 1 r 3 l 2 δ p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 1 v f 2 e f 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 d 2 δ p eff e f p eff f 4 l 2 r 2 π a 2 p effa 4 l 2 r 2 where δp eff p eff p eff0 is the difference of the closure pressure p eff0 is the initial closure pressure of the system in this paper for simplicity we will use p eff to represent δp eff hereafter besides p effa is the contact stress a is the contact radii parameter l denotes the distance coefficient which is suggested to be unity when proppants contacts closely to each other in this paper as each proppant is assumed to be next to others i e the space between two adjacent proppants is zero l is suggested to be unity note that if l 2 in eq 1 is replaced with the actual area of representative elementary volume guo et al 2017 eq 1 can be extended to study proppant embedment even proppant packs are sparsely distributed in fractures moreover e presents the average elasticity modulus of this system which is 2 e 1 v p 2 e p 1 v f 2 e f 1 eq 1 reveals that the elastic embedment depth δ e is related to the average closure pressure p eff proppant radius r and lithology parameters of proppant and fracture moreover ε 1 in eq 1 is the correction factor which is larger than or equal to unity for typical rough fracture surfaces and proppant surfaces ε 1 should be larger than unity considering the effect of effective stress accumulation of multiple proppants while for smooth fracture surface and proppant surface ε 1 is suggested to be unity as the effect of effective stress accumulation is usually weak physically when the contact stress increases up to a certain value yield stress first yield will occur in general the onset point of first yield is related to mineral composition of rocks and varies with different samples johnson 1985 suggested that p effa was 1 1 times of yield stress i e when p effa was approximately equal to 1 1 times of yield stress first yield would occur here we assume that the elastoplastic deformation will occur when closure pressure increases up to ε e times of yield stress σ y where ε e is taken to be 1 1 in this study as a result the maximum elastic embedment depth δ e max is 3 δ e max ε 1 3 ε e σ y 2 3 1 e 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r d 2 ε e σ y e f as mentioned above with the continuously increasing of closure pressure or contact stress elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic embedment will happen big alabo et al 2015 suggested that when 1 1σ y p effa 2 8σ y elastoplastic deformation occurs and when p effa 2 8σ y fully plastic embedment occurs physically during fully plastic embedment process p effa remains constant big alabo et al 2015 chen et al 2018 thus during the fully plastic embedment process the average contact stress p effa remains constant at 2 8σ y the onset point of fully plastic embedment generally speaking the onset point of fully plastic embedment is also related to mineral composition of rocks and varies with different samples in this paper by modifying the equations proposed by big alabo et al 2015 the correlation of exerting force f and fully plastic embedment depth δ p could be written as 4a f k p δ p δ p min f δ δ p where 4b k p 2 π η 1 ε p 1 σ y r δ p min χ 1 δ e max f δ δ p π ε p 1 σ y r 2 δ p min δ e max where ε p1 represents the ratio of the onset contact stress of fully plastic embedment to the yield stress parameter η 1 is the correction factor which was suggested as 0 821 by big alabo et al 2015 in general for completely rigid proppant η 1 should be assigned as unity however for most of the cases proppants are not completely rigid thus to make the prediction more accurate the correction factor will be taken into account in this paper to simplify the model η 1 is assigned as 0 821 moreover the ratio of δ p min δ e max i e parameter χ 1 varies from different studies for example johnson 1985 found χ 1 was 73 by deriving an analytical model to study the mean stress during elastoplastic loading process stronge 2000 stated χ 1 was 82 5 however by conducting finite element studies stronge 2000 set χ 1 as 140 in addition brake 2012 suggested χ 1 was 7 84 big alabo et al 2015 found χ 1 varies from 28 to 140 and he assigned χ 1 as 82 5 in his model in general χ 1 is the function of petrophysical properties of rocks and proppants its accurate value needs to be determined from experimental data note that eq 4 is derived based on the assumption that the proppant or fracture is rigid smooth i e the asperity can be ignored and homogeneous however affected by complex geological deposit and evolution actual fractures in the subsurface are heterogeneous and rough furthermore due to the complex mineral composition actual fractures are not completely rigid consequently there somewhat exists discrepancy between the prediction from eq 4 and the actual results chen et al 2018 suggested that nanometer indentation experiment was a good way to get the actual results during plastic embedment big alabo et al 2015 suggested that the contact radius a p the minimum a p min and can be written as 5a a p r 2 γ p γ e max a p min r 2 γ p min γ e max then during fully plastic embedment the closure pressure p eff and the onset closure pressure point of fully plastic deformation p p min is li et al 2015 5b p eff π a p 2 p effa 4 l 2 r 2 π a p 2 ε p 1 σ y 4 l 2 r 2 p p min π a p min 2 ε p 1 σ y 4 l 2 r 2 ε p σ y physically the elastoplastic deformation transits from fully elastic embedment process to fully plastic embedment process with the embedment depth ranging from δ e max to δ p min kogut and etsion 2002 brake 2012 by fitting the experimental results francis 1976 found the ratio of the average closure pressure to the logarithm of embedment depth remained constant during the elastic embedment so a suggested equation for closure pressure in the elastoplastic region is 6a p eff a 1 a 2 ln δ ep where a 1 and a 2 are fitting coefficients δ ep denotes embedment depth during elastoplastic deformation in view of eq 6a chen et al 2018 proposed an equation to describe the elastoplastic embedment δ ep which is 6b p eff σ y ε e ε p ε e ln δ ep δ e max ln δ p min δ e max in this paper eq 6b is used to characterize the elastoplastic embedment we remark that eqs 6a and 6b are derived based on the assumption that the ratio of p eff to the logarithm of δ ep also remains constant which has not been proved as the experimental results francis 1976 just suggest the ratio of p eff to the logarithm of δ e remains constant eq 6b needs to be modified on basis of the equations stated above the determine equation of embedment depth δ can be summarized as 7a δ δ e 0 δ δ e max δ δ ep δ e max δ p min δ e max p eff ε e σ y ε p ε e σ y δ e max δ δ p min δ δ p δ p min f f δ δ p k p δ δ p min by modifying eq 7a the change in fracture aperture δ can be written as li et al 2015 7b δ δ e 0 δ δ e max δ δ ep δ e max δ δ p min δ δ p δ δ p min where the change in fracture aperture during different deformation stages elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation can be obtained by replacing the item 1 e 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 in eq 7a with 1 e 2 3 2 2 compaction process as stated in the literature weaver et al 2005 2007 terracina et al 2010 one of the most possible packing models for spherical proppants is square packing seen in fig 2 a under this circumstance during proppant compaction process due to the closure pressure body deformation e g proppant contact changes from point contact to surface contact and structural deformation i e arrangement of proppant packs will change of proppant packs will occur fig 2 for body deformation with the increasing of closure pressure fully elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic embedment will occur in sequence however for structural deformation the arrangement of proppant packs i e the contact angle varies with the closure pressure suppose the proppant packs have the identical properties e g particle radii r elastic modulus e p and poisson s ratio v p in view of hertz contact deformation principle contact radius a e and the compaction depth γ e of two adjacent proppants under exerting force f during fully elastic deformation i e closure pressure p eff ε e σ y are gangi 1978 mckee et al 1988 cao and lei 2019 8 a e 3 f 4 r 1 v p 2 e p 3 γ e 9 f 2 2 r 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 assuming the closure pressure is equal in everywhere of the fracture then on basis of eq a9 the average closure pressure in the system p eff is 9 p eff f 4 l 2 r 2 note that the closure pressure p eff in eq 9 also represents the difference of the closure pressure which has subtracted initial closure pressure p eff0 in a similar way the contact radius a e and fully elastic compaction depth γ e can be rewritten as 10a a e 3 l 2 p eff 1 v p 2 e p 3 r γ e 2 a e 2 r 2 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r in general the proppant surface is not fully smooth and proppants are not fully rigid hence eq 10a is modified as 10b γ e 2 ε 2 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r where ε 2 in eq 10b is the correction factor which is larger than or equal to unity for fully smooth fracture surface and proppant surface ε 2 is suggested to be unity mathematically γ e is much less than r chen et al 2017 taking the relevant parameters of well jhw020 in lucaogou tight oil reservoir china for example chen et al 2018 elastic modulus of proppants e p is 41306 mpa poission s ratio of proppants is 0 25 the harmonic average proppant radii r is 0 181 mm assuming the closure pressure is 120 mpa the yield stress of proppants based on eq 10 the γ e is approximately as 1 47 10 2 mm thus compared with r γ e 2 0 0013 γ e 2 16 1 35 10 5 can be neglected and we have r 2 a e 2 r 2 r γ e 2 r γ e 4 2 therefore according to eq 10 half the distance between the centers of two adjacent spherical proppants b e can be given by 11 b e r 2 a e 2 r γ e 4 r ε 2 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 2 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r 0 p eff ε e σ y by substituting p eff ε

and fully plastic deformations will not occur in most of the cases however in this paper to study the proppant compaction more in depth we also discuss the elastoplastic and fully plastic deformations of proppants in the same way during fully plastic deformation we have 13 f k p γ p γ p min f γ γ p where 14a k p 2 π η 1 ε p 1 σ y r av γ p min χ 1 γ e max f δ δ p π ε p 1 σ y r av 2 γ p min γ e max where γ p denotes the fully plastic compaction depth and γ p min denotes the minimum fully plastic compaction depth ε p1 represents the ratio of the onset contact stress of fully plastic embedment to the yield stress note that r av in eq 14 represents the average pore radii of two adjacent spherical proppants which is r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 however as the proppants in the fracture are assumed to have the same size r we have r av r 2 then eq 14a can be further determined as 14b k p π η 2 ε p 1 σ y r γ p min χ 2 γ e max f δ δ p π ε p 1 σ y r γ p min γ e max 2 in eq 14b correction factors η 2 and χ 2 are the functions of petrophysical properties of proppants their accurate values need to be determined from experimental data then based on eq 12 we have 14c γ p min χ 2 γ e max 2 χ 2 3 l 2 ε e σ y 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 r in the same way during plastic embedment the contact radius a p the minimum a p min the closure pressure and the onset closure pressure point of fully plastic deformation p p min can

elastoplastic deformation process i e closure pressure p eff varies from ε e σ y to ε p σ y the following equation can be given in accordance with eq 6b by 17 p eff σ y ε e ε p ε e ln γ ep γ e max ln γ p min γ e max where γ ep denotes the compaction depth of elastoplastic deformation with the determined γ ep the contact radius a ep for elastoplastic deformation ε e σ y p eff ε p σ y is given by 18 a ep r γ ep γ e max 2 eq 18 shows that when γ ep γ e max a ep can be simplified as a ep r γ e max 2 which is in line with eq 10 however when γ ep is equal to γ p min a ep can be simplified as a ep r γ p min γ e max 2 which is in accordance with eq 15 then according to eq 18 the distance b ep is 19 b ep r 2 a ep 2 r 2 r γ ep γ e max 2 on basis of the equations stated above the determine equation of

physically parameter ratio β п represents the changing rate of structural deformation of proppant packs the larger β п is the greater changing rate of structural deformation of proppant packs will be 2 3 conductivity as proppants are assumed to distribute homogeneously in the fracture the flow through fracture with proppants can be regarded as flow through a channel with identical cross sectional size then on basis of hagen poiseuille equation the initial permeability can be expressed as jia et al 2019 23 k φ r 2 8 τ φ 8 π τ 4 b 1 2 sin θ 4 a 1 b 1 π 4 arctan a 1 b 1 r 2 where φ represents porosity of fracture with proppants and τ denotes tortuosity slichter 1899 suggested that the initial porosity φ 0 and the initial tortuosity τ 0 could be written as 24 φ 0 1 π 6 1 cos θ 1 2 cos θ τ 0 1 cos θ 1 2 cos θ sin θ eq 24 reveals that when contact angle θ is π 6 φ 0 and τ 0 are identical to those determined by li et al 2015 as a result the equations in li et al 2015 are special cases of eq 24 then by combing proppant deformation proppant embedment and compaction we have li et al 2015 25 φ φ 0 h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ τ h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 2 τ 0 2 1 h 0 2 1 where h 0 2r is the number of proppant layers then according to the definition of fracture conductivity c f and normalized conductivity c fn we have 26a c f k h φ 8 τ 4 b 1 2 sin θ 4 a 1 b 1 π 4 arctan a 1 b 1 r 2 π h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 26b c fn c f c f p eff 0 eq 26 implies that fracture conductivity or normalized conductivity during pressure loading process is a function of closure pressure rock lithology parameters proppant packs size and proppant packs lithology parameters etc 3 model validation 3 1 proppant packs embedment to verify the derived model in eq 7a the predicted stress dependent embedment depth from the new model is compared with available experimental results e g lacy et al 1997 1998 lu et al 2008 guo et al 2008 alramahi and sundberg 2012 fig 3 shows the proppant packs embedment depth versus the closure pressure for different samples the results suggest that the predictions provide a good match over the entire range of data fig 3 taking fig 3a for example alramahi and sundberg 2012 measured proppant embedment in shales and they found the embedment depth increased with the increasing of clay content in samples the known experimental conditions are r 0 3 mm 20 40 mesh proppants and d 2 7 6 mm as other experimental conditions are not clearly reported in our model e p is assigned as 21 306 gpa v p and v f are both assigned as 0 2 in addition as elastic modulus decreases linearly as clay content increases lei et al 2019 the elastic modulus is determined by e f 1 12 6 5 10 x where x is the clay content and the unit of e f is gpa theoretically the yield point is usually taken to be governed by von mises criterion or tresca s criterion johnson 1985 it should be measured in experiments but was not provided in most of the existing proppant embedment tests usually only the elastic modulus is provided in general the yielding stress can be determined graphically when the pressure depth curve finishes the curvature part elastic region and starts to become straight elastoplastic region in the semi log plot where the indentation is in log scale song and komvopoulos 2013 zhi and elsworth 2020 this process is adopted in our analysis not shown here and we show the cartesian plot instead for a better comparison with the experimental results fig 3a presents that the proposed model can fit well with experimental data for these six samples the results suggest that a higher clay content corresponds to a smaller yield stress in other words compared with a sample with lower clay content the elastoplastic deformation for the sample with higher clay content occurs earlier with the proppant embedment tester lacy et al 1997 conducted experiments to study stress dependent embedment depth for their tests the known conditions are r 0 3175 mm d 2 20 mm v p v f 0 13 and e p 21 306 gpa the main mismatch between the experimental data and the model prediction occurs when the clay content reaches 52 indicating that the high volume of clay significantly affects the mechanical properties of the rock system and this complicated phenomenon is possibly related to heterogeneity and requires further investigation the results shown in fig 3b suggest that the predicted values exhibit excellent agreements with the experimental data in order to further validate our proposed model the experimental data of lu et al 2008 and guo et al 2008 are also applied to validate our proposed model eq 7a based on the experimental conditions the corresponding parameters are summarized in fig 3c and d respectively we can see from fig 3c and d that our predictions are close to the experimental data moreover the results in fig 3d demonstrate that our predicted values are closer to experimental data than the empirical model based on our derived model we can see that for the experiments conducted by guo et al 2008 the onset points of elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation are approximately 20 mpa and 50 mpa respectively which was not revealed in guo s model these values lead to a ratio of the onset of fully plastic region and the yield point at about 50 20 2 5 close to the suggested value of 2 8 in the literature we remark that the experimental data is somehow dubious especially in the middle region specifically the data points near effective stress 28 mpa embedment depth 0 07 mm shows that the embedment depth slightly decreases as the effective stress or closure pressure increases which could be due to measurement error therefore we also analyzed another possible explanation that the embedment depth versus closure pressure is categorized into two regions elastic and elastoplastic in general cases we may just use the two region model if it is good enough for the interpretation of the pressure depth curve otherwise if a third region exists and exhibits clear different behavior from the other regions we may consider the three region model in addition to the basic physical parameters listed in the corresponding figures other parameters especially fitting parameters in each of the verification examples are summarized in table 1 3 2 proppant packs compaction to further verify the derived model the predicted stress dependent compaction depth from the new model is compared with available experimental data lacy et al 1998 conducted experiments on olmos sandstone to study the proppant embedment and proppant compaction with crushing for their tests the known conditions are r 0 3175 mm d 2 20 mm v p v f 0 13 and e p 21 306 gpa in view of their experimental conditions the corresponding parameters are summarized in fig 4 it s clear that our predicted stress dependent embedment depth is close to the experimental data which reveals that the values of the parameters in our model are reasonable then with these determined parameters the theoretical values of compaction depth can be predicted the results suggest that the predictions i e the stress dependent compaction depth provide a good match over the entire range of data fig 4 as we can see from fig 4 under a given closure pressure embedment depth is much larger than compaction depth as a result many scholars only considered proppant embedment but ignored proppant compaction and the available experimental data about compaction depth is limited however even though compaction depth is smaller than embedment depth it still affects proppant deformation 3 3 conductivity and normalized conductivity several experimental results about conductivity and normalized conductivity are applied to further validate our model fig 5 shows the curves of conductivity or normalized conductivity versus closure pressure in these figures the comparison of the measured data by various scholars wen et al 2007 guo et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 alramahi and sundberg 2012 and those predicted by our derived model are presented fig 5 reveals that the proposed model matches the experimental data well guo et al 2008 conducted conductivity tests on steel with relative larger elastic modulus and core slice with relative smaller elastic modulus and they found fracture conductivity decreased as closure pressure increased in their tests steel was applied to simulate the fracture in which proppant embedment depth was relative smaller and core slices were used to simulate the fractures in which proppant embedment depth was relative larger the parameter values known in these cases are given as r 0 3175 mm d 2 19 mm v p v f 0 148 and e p 35 gpa in addition the elastic modulus of core slice is 10 049 gpa note that in general the current practice is to assume the elastic modulus of steel platen to be about 200 gpa for all steel grades mahendran 1996 dehestani and mousavi 2015 mahendran 1996 also suggested that the elastic modulus of steel platen varied with the grade or the thickness of the steel by considering the bond slip effects in the embedded element dehestani and mousavi 2015 modified the elastic modulus of the steel and concluded that the elastic modulus of the steel was related to the strength of materials and geometric specifications of member for instance for the bare steel specimens r f60 d6 a and ur10 with elastic modulus of 200 gpa the modified elastic modulus is 119 77 gpa for the specimen r f60 d6 a and the modified elastic modulus for the specimen ur10 is 117 19 gpa in this paper for the sake of the simplification the elastic modulus of steel platen hereinafter is assumed to be 200 gpa in view of their experimental conditions the corresponding parameters are summarized in fig 5a it s clear that our predicted conductivity is close to the experimental data zhang et al 2008 measured stress dependent fracture conductivities of 10 20 and 20 40 mesh proppants quartz sands in their experiments the average radiuses of 10 20 and 20 40 mesh proppants are 0 55 mm and 0 3175 mm respectively with the parameters summarized in fig 5b the stress dependent fracture conductivity can be predicted quite well over the entire range of data using our proposed model what s more it s clear that under a given closure pressure a larger fracture conductivity corresponds to a greater proppant size when closure pressure is smaller than 20 mpa fracture conductivity curves for 10 20 and 20 40 mesh proppants decrease sharply as closure pressure increases and these two curves differ greatly however when closure pressure exceeds 20 mpa these two fracture conductivity curves change gently and have small difference due to the occurrence of the elastoplastic deformation li et al 2015 stated that as their model neglected proppant crush or elastoplastic deformation there existed a great difference between the experimental data and predicted values when closure pressure exceeded 20 mpa in contrast our proposed model took elastoplastic deformation and plastic deformation into account and provides more accurate predictions furthermore fig 5b also reveals that when closure pressure is lower than 20 mpa proppants with larger size are suggested to be applied in the field to further validate our model the experimental data from wen et al 2007 is applied to calibrate our proposed model fig 5c g in their tests proppants proppant 1 and proppant 2 with different sizes 20 40 mesh or 30 60 mesh were applied moreover steel with large elastic modulus and core slice with relative smaller elastic modulus were used to simulate the fractures for instance the elastic modulus of steel is 200 gpa while the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of dolomitic mudstone are 12 76 gpa and 0 32 additionally the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of siltstone are 22 18 gpa and 0 35 and the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of conglomerate are 19 39 gpa and 0 19 other known conditions are r 0 3175 mm for 20 40 mesh proppant and r 0 2125 mm for 30 60 mesh proppant with the parameters summarized in the corresponding figures the stress dependent conductivity can be modeled as shown in fig 5c g our proposed model can adequately characterize the stress dependent conductivity of fractures alramahi and sundberg 2012 measured stress dependent fracture conductivities and on basis of the proppant embedment depth they developed an analytical normalized conductivity model to explain the results fig 5h presents the comparison of the test data the normalized conductivity the predictions from alramahi and sundberg s model and the predicted normalized conductivity from our proposed model the parameter values known in alramahi and sundberg s experiments are r 0 3 mm and d 2 7 6 mm the values of other parameters are identical to those applied in fig 3a as shown in fig 5h compared with the predicted results from alramahi and sundberg s model our predicted results are closer to the experimental results 4 results and discussions 4 1 conventional fracturing after validation by exhaustive experimental data this derived model is used for sensitivity analysis of different conditions on fracture aperture change compaction depth and normalized conductivity of hydraulic fractures fig 6 shows the influences of different conditions e g proppant radii proppant elastic modulus and fracture elastic modulus on fracture aperture change ratio i e the ratio of fracture aperture change to fracture initial aperture and embedment depth ratio i e the ratio of embedment depth to fracture initial aperture in these cases the yield stress is 80 mpa parameter ε 1 is 10 parameter χ 1 is 2 parameter η 1 is 0 821 fracture initial aperture is 5 times the diameter of proppants and the onset point of plastic deformation is 120 mpa other basic parameters are summarized in the corresponding figures as one can see from fig 6 there exists positive relationship between fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio and closure pressure moreover the rate of change in fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio during elastoplastic deformation or plastic deformation is larger than that during elastic deformation which is as anticipated results fig 6a suggest that under a given closure pressure fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio decreases with the increasing of proppant size as a result under the same conditions compared with larger size proppants one of the problems regarding the use of smaller size proppants is the greater fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio as depicted in fig 6b under a given closure pressure embedment depth ratio increases as proppant elastic modulus increases however a larger fracture aperture change ratio corresponds to a smaller proppant elastic modulus the main reason is that a smaller value of proppant elastic modulus means more deformation of system proppant and fracture and proppant itself as the main controlling factor of conductivity change fracture aperture change ratio monotonically increases with proppant size although embedment depth the different between system deformation and proppant deformation monotonically decreases with proppant size proppants with larger elastic modulus are still suggested to be applied in the field fig 6c reveals that under a given closure pressure fracture aperture change ratio or embedment depth ratio decreases with the increasing of fracture elastic modulus in other words the rocks with lower elastic modulus are easier to be embedded with proppants similar findings have been also reported by various scholars chen et al 2017 lacy et al 1997 1998 zhang et al 2015 fig 7 shows the influences of proppant radius and proppant elastic modulus on compaction depth in these cases the initial closure pressure is 10 mpa the yield stress is 80 mpa parameter ε 2 is 1 parameter χ 2 is 2 parameter η 2 is 0 821 fracture initial aperture is 5 times the diameter of proppants and the onset point of plastic deformation is 120 mpa other basic parameters are summarized in the corresponding figures as one can see from fig 7 compaction depth is positively correlated with closure pressure furthermore the rate of the change in compaction depth during elastoplastic deformation or plastic deformation is larger than that in elastic deformation which is expected fig 7a reveals that under a given closure pressure compaction depth increases with the increasing of proppant size however compaction depth ratio i e the ratio of compaction depth to fracture initial aperture is free from influence of proppant size as depicted in fig 7b under a given closure pressure compaction depth monotonically increases with the decreasing of proppant elastic modulus as a result proppants with larger elastic modulus are suggested to be applied in the field fig 8 a shows the characteristic curves of normalized conductivity in these cases the initial closure pressure is 10 mpa the yield stress of rock is 40 mpa the onset point of rock plastic deformation is 80 mpa the yield stress of proppant is 140 mpa the onset point of proppant plastic deformation is 180 mpa parameter ε 1 is 11 parameter ε 2 is 1 parameters χ 1 and χ 2 are both 2 parameters η 1 and η 2 are both 0 821 fracture initial aperture is 5 times the diameter of proppants and other basic parameters are summarized in the corresponding figures results fig 8a illustrate that the normalized conductivity curves can be characterized by six stages the first stage is elastic embedment and elastic compaction stage in which the conductivity change is dominated by proppant size and elastic deformation parameters e g elastic modulus poisson s ratio correct factors ε 1 and ε 2 the larger rock yield stress is the longer the stage 1 will be the second stage is elastoplastic embedment and elastic compaction stage in which the conductivity change due to embedment is dominated by parameter χ 1 under a given rock yield stress the larger the onset point of plastic embedment is the longer the stage 2 will be the third stage is plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage during which the change of conductivity due to embedment presents a linearity relation to the closure pressure in addition body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs occur due to the closure pressure the length of stage 3 is dominated by parameter ratio β п theoretically the larger parameter ratio β п is the shorter the stage 3 will be the main reason is that a larger β п corresponds to a greater changing rate of structural deformation of proppant packs the fourth stage is also plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage however during this stage due to the closure pressure only the body deformation of proppant packs occurs and the structural deformation of proppant packs does not change anymore in other words the contact angle θ of proppants will not decrease as closure pressure increases the fifth stage is plastic embedment and elastoplastic compaction stage in which the conductivity change due to compaction is dominated by parameter χ 2 in general the larger the proppant yield stress is the longer the stage 5 will be the sixth stage is plastic embedment and plastic compaction stage in which conductivity varies linearly with closure pressure moreover in this case during stages 2 6 conductivity change due to compaction is larger than that due to embedment with the same parameters the influences of different conditions on normalized conductivity curves are presented in fig 8b d results fig 8b suggest that under a given closure pressure normalized conductivity increases with the increase of proppant size as a result one of the notable problems of using small size proppants in the field is the fast decrease of conductivity as depicted in fig 8c conductivity increases as proppant elastic modulus increases accordingly to maintain the conductivity of hydraulic fractures lager elastic modulus proppants are recommended in the field similar findings have also been noted by various scholars lacy et al 1997 1998 zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 fig 8d reveals that under a given closure pressure conductivity increases with the increasing of fracture elastic modulus consequently compared to conductivity change in harder rocks with larger elastic modulus conductivity change more dramatically in softer rocks with lower hardness 4 2 channel fracturing as stated above due to the effects of discontinuous distribution of proppant pillars and the free channel in fracture even if the structure of each proppant pillar is identical the stress deformation characteristic for channel fracturing is distinct from that for conventional fracturing gillard et al 2010 medvedev et al 2013 nguyen et al 2014 xu et al 2018 specifically compared with conventional fracturing channel fracturing has more void space left open to flow thus the closure pressure exerting on proppant packs in channel fracturing is larger than that in conventional fracturing in this paper for channel fracturing the closure pressure can be modified in accordance with the force balance in fracture aperture direction by xu et al 2018 27 p effm p eff a f a p p eff a p a vo a p p eff c where p effm represents the modified closure pressure a f is the total surface area of fracture a p is the area which is supported by proppants a vo is the void area which is unsupported by proppants and parameter c 0 c 1 represents the proppant area fraction which is used to characterize the cover extent physically a larger c value corresponds to a higher cover degree when parameter c is assigned as zero the channel fracturing fracture is simplified as a free channel i e a two parallel wall however when parameter c is set as unity the value of p effm equals to that of p eff which reveals that eq 27 is also suitable for conventional fracturing fracture and the conventional fracturing fracture is a special case of channel fracturing fracture in addition eq 27 implies that the modified closure pressure p effm for channel fracturing is larger than closure pressure p eff for conventional fracturing in general fluid flow along channel fracturing fracture is different with that for conventional fracturing fracture specifically it s not suitable to use darcy s law characterizing the flow in channel fracturing in general compared with permeability of free channel in the fracture permeability of proppant pillars is much lower moreover many scholar gillard et al 2010 medvedev et al 2013 xu et al 2018 found that due to the discontinuous distribution of proppants in channel fracturing flow pattern in channel fracturing would be dominated by navier stokes flow based on the two dimensional navier stokes equations brinkman 1949 vafai and tien 1982 kumar et al 1991 xu et al 2018 the following equation is used to describe the steady state flow through channel fracturing as 28 d p effm dx μ 1 c 2 2 u z z 2 μ k 2 u z where x denotes the direction along the fracture length z denotes the direction along fracture aperture μ is fluid viscosity u represents the average velocity in fracture plane and parameter k 2 is permeability coefficient suppose that the radius of each cylinder proppant pillar is identical to r p then k 2 can be suggested as kumar et al 1991 sangani and acrivos 1982 sangani and yao 1988 xu et al 2018 29 k 2 r p 2 8 c ln c 1 476 2 c 0 5 c 2 c 0 4 k 2 r p 2 3 34 c 1 1 10 c 5 2 0 4 c 0 8 assuming r p remains constant during deformation eq 29 implies that k 2 is independent of closure pressure by solving eq 28 we can determine the velocity u then the average velocity u a along the z direction i e fracture aperture direction can be obtained as 30 u a 1 h 1 2 h 1 2 h udz k 2 μ d p effm dx 1 tanh 1 c h 2 k 2 1 c h 2 k 2 where parameter h is the stress dependent fracture aperture which can be determined by h 0 2 δ by combing eq 30 and darcy s law the stress dependent permeability k of channel fracturing is kumar et al 1991 xu et al 2018 31 k k 2 1 tanh 1 c h 2 k 2 1 c h 2 k 2 by substituting eq 29 into eq 31 the stress dependent permeability k of channel fracturing can be determined then in view of the definition of dimensionless fracture conductivity we have 32 c fd kh k 0 h 0 1 tanh 1 c h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 2 k 2 1 c h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ 2 k 2 1 tanh 1 c h 0 2 k 2 1 c h 0 2 k 2 h 0 2 δ γ h 0 2 r 1 sin θ h 0 to verify the derived model in eq 32 for channel fracturing the predicted conductivity from eq 32 is compared with available experimental data fig 9 hou et al 2017 conducted experiments to study the effect of the proppant distribution on the fracture conductivity of channel fracturing in their tests the known conditions are given as r 0 3175 mm 20 40 mesh r p 16 4 mm and c 0 52 besides these known parameter values other parameter values applied in our calculation are d 2 20 mm v p 0 148 v f 0 25 e p 5 gpa and e f 2 gpa it s clear that our predicted stress dependent conductivity is close to the experimental data which reveals that our model in eq 32 can adequately characterize the stress dependent conductivity of channel fracturing 4 3 model advantages and limitations the analytical model developed in this paper lays theoretical foundations for characterizing the proppant deformation embedment and compaction in hydraulic fractures compared with former models our models take elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and plastic deformation into account moreover we extend our proposed model to study the deformation of channel fracturing as a result our derived model is of great significance in selecting proppants and optimizing parameters during the execution of hydraulic fracturing for instance the modeling results of our derived model suggest that it s better to apply proppants with larger elastic modulus and larger size in the field however it should be noted that the improvement on our model is still required for example some parameters in our derived model are related to lithology parameters which are needed to be further quantified moreover more available data about proppant compaction are needed to further validate our model in recent years proppants with other shapes e g rod shaped proppants have raised considerable interest in many reservoirs e g jia et al 2019 in general compared with spherical proppants rod shaped proppants can help to reduce friction pressure furthermore rod shaped proppants can provide high porosity packing however in this work our derived model is limited to deformation of spherical proppants further researches about deformation behavior of other shaped proppants are needed these findings suggest that we should exercise care in analyzing stress dependent conductivity of fractures as there are so many factors in these complex systems will contribute the errors the deformation of hydraulic fractures is an interesting and challenging topic and the corresponding work is still under processing 5 conclusions in this paper a novel analytical model is derived to investigate proppant embedment compaction and stress dependent conductivity of hydraulic fractures conventional fracturing and channel fracturing in reservoirs e g shale tight sandstone and coal etc in addition the characteristic curves of normalized conductivity are obtained compared with other models our proposed model take elastic deformation elastoplastic deformation and fully plastic deformation into account the derived model is validated by various experimental data and is shown to perform well the derived model is also used to conduct sensitivity analysis of different conditions e g proppant size proppant elastic modulus rock elastic modulus on conductivity change of hydraulic fractures results indicate that the normalized conductivity curves can be characterized by six stages elastic embedment and elastic compaction stage elastoplastic embedment and elastic compaction stage plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage including body deformation and structural deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastic compaction stage only containing body deformation of proppant packs plastic embedment and elastoplastic compaction stage plastic embedment and plastic compaction stage moreover both proppant compaction and proppant embedment are of great significance to predict conductivity change of hydraulic fractures in order to reduce the rate of conductivity change proppants with lager elastic modulus and larger size are recommended in the field in addition to providing theoretical foundations for quantifying permeability change in fractures another advantage of these derived models is that with experimental permeability data it can be utilized to estimate relevant parameters

is proposed based on the classic hertzian contact deformation theory with the assumption that the fracture surface and proppant surface are sufficiently smooth however this assumption neglects topological features of natural fracture surfaces which will lead to the predictions are underestimated in addition the derived eq a12 only considers the deformation of a single rigid spherical proppant packs embedment in hydraulic fractures in other words the effect of effective stress accumulation is neglected thus to make the derived model more reasonable for typical rough fracture surfaces eq a12 can be modified as δ e ε 1 r 3 l 2 p eff 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 1 v f 2 e f 2 3 1 v p 2 e p 2 3 where ε 1 is the correction factor which is larger than or equal to unity for fully smooth fracture surface and proppant surface if the effect of effective stress accumulation is weak ε 1 is suggested to be unity for a single indenter physically due to closure pressure fracture wall thickness will deform then based on hooke s law the change of fracture wall thickness δd is li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 a14 δ d d 2 p eff e f then by combing eqs a13 and a14 the elastic embedment
