17400,wastewater effluent discharges have been considered as one of the main sources of synthetic chemicals entering into the aquatic environment even though they occur at low concentrations pharmaceutically active compounds phacs can have an impact on ecological toxicity that affects aquatic organisms moreover new regulations in development toward preserving water quality reinforces the increasing need to monitor and abate some phacs in wastewater treatment plants wwtps where they are typically only partially eliminated unlike most previous reviews we have focussed on how the main biological and chemical molecular factors impact the biotransformations of key phacs in biological wwtp processes biotransformations have been found to be an important contributor towards the removal of phacs from wwtp effluents this review paper critically assesses these aspects and the recent advances that have been achieved in wastewater treatment processes for biodegradation of 7 phacs namely the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid diclofenac dcf the macrolide antibiotics azithromycin azm erythromycin ery and clarithromycin clr the two natural estrogens estrone e1 and 17β estradiol e2 and the synthetic estrogen 17α ethinylesradiol ee2 these represent the micropollutants of the eu watch list in decision 2015 495 eu that are most relevant to wwtps due to their frequent detection the metabolic pathways transformation products and impact of relevant factors to biological wwtp processes is addressed in this review the biokinetics of phac biodegradation in different engineered bioprocesses is also discussed promising technologies and operational strategies that are likely to have a high impact on controlling phac releases are highlighted and future research needs are also

and surfactants has become a new global water quality challenge due to the potentially serious threats it poses to human health and ecosystems desbiolles et al 2018 ecotoxicological risk and hazard assessment studies have shown that endocrine disrupting compounds edcs can be linked to breast carcinoma cancer in women and prostate cancer in men perturbation in fish physiology and reproductive dysfunction in both domestic and wild animals adeel et al 2017 the presence of antibiotics in the environment is a growing concern related to the promotion of antibiotic resistant bacteria or antimicrobial resistance genes in the environment berendonk et al 2015 furthermore diclofenac has been considered to be the compound with highest acute toxicity of the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids which can exert chronic and acute toxicity impacts on the liver kidney and gills of fish vieno and sillanpää 2014 globally phacs and hormones are not yet commonly subjected to monitoring or regulation in waterways and only a few countries have developed regulations and frameworks for micropollutant management such as the united states the european union australia and some other european countries such as switzerland within the european union a list of 33 prioritized substances was defined identified in annex x of the water frame work directive wfd wrd 2008 105 eu that must be monitored by all member states at specific concentration thresholds in surface waters in 2013 the european union directive 2013 39 eu added a further 12 substances to annex x of the wfd in which three phacs the nsaid diclofenac dcf the synthetic hormone 17 alpha ethinylestradiol ee2 and the natural hormone 17 beta estradiol e2 were included in march 2015 decision 2015 495 eu was implemented which included a watch list adding three macrolide antibiotics azithromycin azm clarithromycin clr and erythromycin ery together with another natural hormone estrone e1 and several pesticides and other compounds barbosa et al 2016 recently there has been an increased focus on antibiotics via the european one health action plan against antimicrobial resistance amr which supports improved knowledge of the occurrence and spread of antimicrobials in the environment where additional antibiotics have been added to the eu watch list in the u s california s state water boards recycled water policy requires the monitoring of e2 and two other phacs while ee2 e2 e1 and other hormones are monitored in drinking water supplies in new york city and other selected states us epa 2017 2016 the australian guidelines for water recycling have also recommended limits of all 7 phacs highlighted above nrmmc 2008 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are often considered as one of the main pathways for the introduction of phacs into the aquatic environment via treated water or into the terrestrial environment by disposal of the sewage sludge biosolids in landfills barbosa et al 2016 however wwtps also serve as a barrier to control discharge of these phacs into the environment there are numerous ways in which wwtps can impact the transformation and removal of these compounds including biotransformation adsorption onto biosolids and advanced oxidation processes biological processes are typically the most applied approaches in wwtps and have been often reported to have an important impact on the removal of many phacs in wwtps joss et al 2005 radjenović et al 2009 suárez et al 2010 torresi et al 2016 several biological processes have been studied for the degradation of phacs from wastewater such as conventional activated sludge treatment cas joss et al 2005 kosma et al 2014 radjenović et al 2009 suárez et al 2010 zupanc et al 2013 membrane bioreactors mbrs hai et al 2011 maeng et al 2013 tadkaew et al 2011 xue et al 2010 moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs escolà casas et al 2015 falås et al 2013 tang et al 2017 torresi et al 2016 and constructed wetlands hijosa valsero et al 2016 reyes contreras et al 2012 rühmland et al 2015 vymazal et al 2017 while several valuable reviews of phacs in wwtps exist ahmed et al 2017 besha et al 2017 kanaujiya et al 2019 liu et al 2015 luo et al 2014 tiwari et al 2017 vieno and sillanpää 2014 a review targeting the impact of different biological processes on the biotransformation extent and kinetics at a molecular level is needed most current reviews cover either occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater systems or the degradation efficiency of various processes including biological the importance of identifying transformation products tps is often disregarded where biotransformation is assumed to be equated with bioremoval despite the fact that tps can be more harmful than the parent compound lambropoulou and nollet 2014 lonappan et al 2016 petrie et al 2015 the metabolic pathways involved in the biodegradation of priority phacs necessitates a comprehensive review as well as its link between biotransformation products conjugated forms and the impact of engineered wwtp bioprocesses on their degradation efficiency this paper provides a critical review of the literature with respect to the molecular transformations of phacs in bioprocesses we emphasise that the impact of technological or operational factors impact the rate or extent of biodegradation or biotransformation rather than removal per se to avoid the implication that potentially harmful by products are fully removed from the system a factor that is typically unknown we looked in depth into the impact of chemical structure on biodegradability the metabolic pathways involved in biodegradation the importance of co metabolism and the biotransformation rates as well as the impact of different bioreactor operating conditions the paper compares and contrasts a broad range of biological processes commonly employed in wwtps focusing on 7 priority phacs found therein these 7 compounds cover the main relevant phacs of the watch list from decision 2015 495 eu where the non phacs included in this list are not typically found in wastewater and were thus considered outside the scope of this review the 7 phacs are the pharmaceuticals dcf an nsaid azm clr ery three antibiotics and e1 e2 and ee2 three hormones we analyse the impact of biological processes on phacs biodegradation with special attention to the generation of biotransformation products the paper concludes with a critical overview of the knowledge gaps still preventing a deeper understanding of the bio chemical processes contributing to the biotransformation and mineralisation of these important compounds from wastewater 2 biotransformation mineralisation of phacs in wwtps phacs can be affected by physical chemical and biological processes occurring in wwtps abiotic transformations through e g volatilisation stripping is typically insignificant for phacs in wwtps including for the selected compounds of this study due to their low henry s constants table s1 si uv photolysis and advanced oxidation processes can have significant impacts but these processes are considered beyond the scope of the present paper sorption absorption or adsorption can be significant for many phacs in wwtps and depends on i the physico chemical properties of the phacs e g hydrophobicity electrostatic interactions dissociation etc ii the characteristics of the sludge e g biomass structure and particle size or iii the operational conditions e g ph ionic strength temperature however insignificant sorption to activated sludge 10 as compared to biodegradation was reported for the selected estrogens andersen et al 2005 zhou et al 2010 while sorption of clr and ery are considered negligible senta et al 2013 terzic et al 2018 and sorption of dcf and azm has been reported to vary between negligible 20 deng et al 2016 terzic et al 2018 suárez et al 2012 ternes et al 2004 thus biodegradation is likely to be of high importance towards the elimination of the selected compounds as sorption does not typically play a substantial role while many studies in literature focus on the apparent biological removal of phacs by measuring the relative concentrations of the parent compounds in the wastewater influent and effluent in many cases these parent compounds are only partially transformed biologically instead of being completely biodegraded i e mineralised to innocuous products such as co2 and water in this paper partial biodegradation will be referred to as biotransformation complete biodegradation as biomineralisation and in cases where the extent of transformation is unknown the removal observed will be referred to as biodegradation 2 1 human metabolites retransformation and apparent negative removal in wwtps after being metabolized in human and animal bodies pharmaceuticals are excreted through urine and faeces in the form of conjugated up to 22 of the human metabolites testa et al 2012 oxidised or otherwise transformed metabolites along with the unchanged parent compounds which then get discharged to wwtps the metabolism of pharmaceuticals in the human body can be divided in two stages i phase i conversion of lipophilic organic molecules to more polar compounds by introduction of reactive functional groups into the compounds which involves hydrolysis hydrolytic cleavages reduction and oxidation alkylations and dealkylations roth 1997 timbrell 2008 and ii phase ii typically involves conjunction of the compounds i e the covalent attachment of small hydrophilic endogenous compounds to enhance solubility and facilitate excretion lambropoulou and nollet 2014 this includes glucuronidation transfer of glucuronic acid to phenols aliphatic hydroxyl carboxyl thiol amine and hydroxylamino groups along with less frequent sulfation glutathione conjugation n acetylation and amino acid conjugation roth 1997 retransformation of the phase ii human metabolites back to the active compounds or its corresponding phase i metabolites has been observed in wwtps daughton and ternes 1999 polesel 2016 for example glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of some natural and synthetic estrogens andersen et al 2003 aris et al 2014 atkinson et al 2012 cai et al 2012 d ascenzo et al 2003 gomes et al 2009 joss et al 2004 nancy et al 2006 antibiotics or dcf plósz et al 2012 vieno and sillanpää 2014 are very likely deconjugated to reform their respective parent compounds in sewage or in wwtps by enzymatic activity e g β glucuronidase and sulfatase or abiotic processes this can likely be an explanation for the apparent negative removal of some pharmaceuticals in wwtps e g ery clr and azm gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 and dcf clara et al 2005b zorita et al 2009 in microbial degradation tests lee et al 2012 found slow biodegradation of 4 hydroxy dcf the major phase i metabolite of dcf and deconjugation of diclofenac β o acyl glucuronide the major phase ii metabolite to form equimolar dcf within 7 d the main human metabolites of the 7 target phacs are presented in table s4 of the si there is still very limited knowledge on the environmental fate and behaviour of those human conjugated metabolites whose determination has been restricted by a lack of available analytical methods and reference standards petrie et al 2015 taking into account the significance of conjugated human metabolites to the overall mass loads of phacs senta et al 2019 attention must be paid to the conjugated forms of pharmaceuticals and their fates in wwtps and in the environment to gain a more comprehensive understanding about their transformation and risk assessment during wastewater treatment avoiding discharge of compounds that could retransform back into their active parent forms in the environment stadler et al 2015 a concerted effort should be made between the identification of human metabolites in clinical studies and their analysis in environmental samples this would imply expanding the range of compounds usually monitored in environmental samples 2 2 metabolism co metabolism and the role of primary substrates biotransformation of organic micropollutants such as phacs during activated sludge processes is known to take place both via primary metabolic or co metabolic mechanisms tran et al 2013 in primary metabolism the phac is taken up and transformed as the source of carbon and energy for cell growth by heterotrophic microorganisms in co metabolism the phac is biologically transformed as a non growth substrate by bacteria heterotrophic or autotrophic in the obligate presence of a separate primary substrate or growth substrate dalton and stirling 1982 to date reports on biotransformations carried out by specific degraders that could use phacs as sources of carbon and energy to maintain cell growth are still limited heterotrophic microbes in the environment are known to be able to degrade a large variety of phacs via their various monooxygenases and or dioxygenases arp et al 2001 khunjar et al 2011 metabolic degradation of phacs as growth substrates by pure cultures or mixed activated sludge has been reported for several compounds de gusseme et al 2011 larcher and yargeau 2011 lindblom et al 2009 murdoch and hay 2005 reis et al 2014 summers et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 but only few have been reported for the targeted compounds in this review such as e1 and e2 bradley et al 2009 iasur kruh et al 2011 layton et al 2000 lee and liu 2002 zhang et al 2019 phacs are typically present in wastewater in concentrations significantly lower than their affinity constant which are probably too low to induce the necessary catabolic genes kolvenbach et al 2014 and thus biotransformation may be mainly dependent on co metabolism a number of studies have demonstrated that the biotransformation of some pharmaceuticals is likely to be due to co metabolism gauthier et al 2010 müller et al 2013 plósz et al 2012 polesel et al 2017 su et al 2015 autotrophs play important roles in co metabolism of phacs via non specific enzymes a correlation between biotransformation of some phacs and nitrification activity of nitrifying activated sludge has been reported alvarino et al 2016b dytczak et al 2008 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 helbling et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 khunjar et al 2011 mcadam et al 2010 men et al 2017 roh et al 2009 shi et al 2004 yi and harper 2007 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are known to possess ammonia monooxygenase amo an enzyme with relatively broad substrate specificity that catalyses nonspecific oxidation of many phacs batt et al 2006 khunjar et al 2011 shi et al 2004 tran et al 2009 which could also be suppressed under high concentrations of ammonia fernandez fontaina et al 2012 in contrast some studies tested the use of amo inhibitors which showed little to no effect on the biotransformation of phacs gaulke et al 2008 khunjar et al 2011 suggesting that other enzymes e g hydroxylamine oxidoreductase or nitrite oxidoreductase that are involved in the ammonia oxidation process could be potentially responsible for the phac biotransformation helbling et al 2012 thus the relative contribution of amo to biotransformation of phacs compared to enzymes from heterotrophs still remains unclear no matter how biotransformations of phacs occur in wwtps i e via metabolic or co metabolic processes the presence of readily biodegradable substrates e g organic carbon or ammonia as primary substrates or biogenic substrates play an important role in the biological transformation of phacs these substrates can induce non specific catabolic enzymes for assimilation or co factors for biodegradation or supply energy that is used for biomass growth and maintenance etc nguyen et al 2017 different bacterial strains that are capable of degrading several organic micropollutants co metabolically in the presence of primary substrates have been reported larcher and yargeau 2011 men et al 2017 zhou et al 2013a alvarino et al 2016b observed enhanced biotransformation rates of the investigated phacs after supplementation of organic matter into the aerobic reactors to increase the heterotrophic activity however the presence of the main substrates for microbial growth has been reported to exert multiple interactions on the transformation of phacs such as enhanced biodegradation nguyen et al 2017 oehmen et al 2013 plósz et al 2012 su et al 2015 tran et al 2013 2009 and also reduced biodegradation plósz et al 2010 sathyamoorthy et al 2013 diauxic or sequential degradation when mixed substrates are present has been observed between the growth and co metabolic substrate as a result of competition for non specific enzymes which lowers the biodegradation rate joss et al 2004 li et al 2008 plósz et al 2010 sathyamoorthy et al 2013 also the composition and concentration of growth substrates have been shown to act as microbial selectors that could affect the structure of the microbial community which may in turn alter the phac degradation via changes in the individual populations present over an extended period of time alidina et al 2014 li et al 2014 in addition the catabolic enzymes expressed by a community are also impacted by the type of growth substrate present thus affecting their metabolic capability this short term effect was observed e g through the increased degradation of a group of phacs under lower concentrations of easily biodegradable dissolved organic carbon and higher humic acid content which was correlated to a higher abundance of cytochrome p450 genes a group of monooxygenases li et al 2014 other studies found that biotransformation of different compounds respond differently to the presence of readily degradable carbon in short term tests su et al 2015 tan et al 2013 under oligotrophic conditions bacterial cells can develop a multivorous strategy to simultaneously metabolize dozens of different carbon substrates metabolic flexibility instead of specialization on a particular substrate and strict metabolic control via mechanisms such as catabolite repression egli 2010 tan et al 2013 observed enhanced estrogen e1 degradation under prolonged biomass starvation conditions over 5 13 days which was attributed to stimulation of multiple substrate utilizing degraders under low substrate levels improved ee2 kinetics in activated sludge treatment was further reported as a result of population selection with growth promoted at low organic substrate concentrations ziels et al 2014 overall while the presence of a biogenic substrate may facilitate the biotransformation of phacs it might be advantageous to keep the concentration of this compound low thereby improving both an adequate microbial selection and stimulating a more diverse less biogenic substrate specific metabolism 2 3 effects of compound structure on phac biodegradation studies have demonstrated that the chemical structure and physicochemical properties are important factors in evaluating the biotransformation potential of phacs from wwtps cirja et al 2008 kimura et al 2005 tadkaew et al 2011 biodegradation processes often involve oxidation reduction reactions therefore the electron availability of the compounds along with the redox potential of the medium play an important role on biodegradability bertelkamp et al 2016 reported a statistically significant relationship between phac biodegradation rates and the functional groups of the molecular structures in an aerobic environment the authors found that phac biodegradation rates increased in the presence of carboxylic acids hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups but decreased in the presence of halogens aliphatic ethers methyl groups and ring structures in the chemical structure of the phacs in general simple aliphatic and monocyclic aromatic compounds are considered to be readily biodegradable while polycyclic structures are likely to be more persistent although the aromatic substituents may increase or decrease biodegradability tadkaew et al 2011 the electrophilic attack by oxygenases is considered to be the limiting step for aerobic biodegradation this is because the presence of electron withdrawing functional groups causes an electron deficiency that reduces the susceptibility of the compound to oxidation whereas electron donating groups have the opposite effect tadkaew et al 2011 conversely the presence of electron withdrawing groups facilitate reductive biotransformation under anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2018a complex structure phacs that contain straight chain hydrocarbons aromatic ethers and aryl ethers are biotransformable aerobically while heterocyclic n aromatic rings chlorine groups or fused aromatic rings are less susceptible to oxidation alvarino et al 2018a this is the case of dcf where the two chlorine atoms in the a ring are likely a reason for the recalcitrance of this compound kimura et al 2005 andreozzi et al 2006 steroid estrogens have a four ring molecular structure one aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group at the c3 position two cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring the hormones e1 e2 and ee2 are generally easily biotransformed under aerobic conditions where one pathway involves co metabolism of these aromatic rings with hydroxyl substituents by amo in aob alvarino et al 2018b chang and criddle 1997 after hydroxylation these rings can undergo open loop cleavage by key degradation enzymes and enter into the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate carbon dioxide and water cajthaml et al 2009 sih et al 1968 however synthetic estrogen ee2 has been reported to be more difficult to be biodegraded than natural estrogens e1 and e2 tiedeken et al 2017 due to the presence of an ethinyl group in the ee2 structure which makes it recalcitrant ternes et al 1999 macrolide biotransformation can be mediated by esterases erea and ereb see below or macrolide phosphotransferases mph which catalyse the cleavage of lactone rings leading to the formation of tp without antimicrobial activity kim et al 2002 noguchi et al 1995 o hara et al 1989 the size of this lactone ring has a direct impact on its degradability through these enzymes macrolides with 14 membered lactone rings e g ery and clr table 1 can be degraded by either erea or ereb while macrolides with 15 membered lactone rings e g azm can be degraded by ereb but not erea morar et al 2012 mph enzyme specificity is related to not only the size of the lactone ring but also the presence of a c3 cladinose moiety characteristic of many macrolides golkar et al 2018 2 4 biodegradation mechanisms of phacs and their transformation products tps many bacteria and fungi can efficiently biodegrade phacs bilal et al 2019a estrada arriaga and mijaylova 2010 grandclément et al 2017 margot et al 2013 krah et al 2016 assessed the biodegradation of several phacs in cell free lysates produced from sludge they found that most of the enzymes detected were hydrolases such as phosphatase β galactosidase β glucuronidase amongst others and oxidoreductases indeed many phacs are degraded by promiscuous i e broad substrate specificity oxidoreductase enzymes that catalyse oxidation and reduction reactions alneyadi et al 2018 khatoon et al 2017 krah et al 2016 martínez et al 2017 two mechanisms have been reported for the biotransformation of macrolides one mechanism is mediated by macrolide esterases ere and another by macrolide phosphotransferases mph fig 1 the ere mediated mechanism is initiated by esterase type i erea and esterase type ii ereb with hydrolysis of the lactone ring ester followed by a condensation reaction kim et al 2002 llorca et al 2016 the ere esterases have broad substrate specificity thus various antibiotics of the macrolide family including ery azm and clr are susceptible to hydrolysis by either erea ereb or both morar et al 2012 the mph mediated mechanism involves a phosphorylation step by macrolide 2 phosphotransferase golkar et al 2018 while it is unclear if the phosphorylated tp is further degraded mineralisation of ery has been observed by microbial cultures from aquaculture sediments displaying ere activity kim et al 2004 this shows that biodegradation can proceed after hydrolysis of the lactone ring until complete mineralisation of the macrolide it should be noted that these enzymatic biotransformation processes evolved as antibiotic resistance mechanisms some of the genes involved in these mechanisms e g erea type 2 and mph a b or c have been found in the mobile genetic elements of bacteria from various genera showing that they can be horizontally transferred between cells golkar et al 2018 kim et al 2004 thus in conventional wwtp processes that are dependent upon the activity of bacterial cells there would be a high risk of increasing and disseminating antibiotic resistance determinants which is clearly undesirable the risk of spreading antibiotic resistance to the environment could be reduced by using cell free lysates or enzyme extracts although this would certainly increase the cost and complexity of the treatment process the biodegradation of dcf can take place through various complex transformation pathways which can be predominantly explained by six reactions hydroxylation of the aromatic rings a and b intramolecular amidation de amidation sulphate conjugation of phenolic hydroxyl groups reductive dechlorination of the aromatic ring a oxidative ring opening of ring b and oxidation by dehydrogenation of phenolic moieties jewel et al 2016 four primary tps fig 2 have been detected in dcf biodegradation by activated sludge treatment processes bouju et al 2016 jewell et al 2016 kosjek et al 2009 via both nitrifying and heterotrophic organisms wu et al 2020 dcf lactam or 1 2 6 dichlorophenyl 1 3 dihydro 2h indol 2 one dcf tp1 table 1 4 hydroxy dcf dcf tp2 5 hydroxy dcf dcf tp3 and dcf benzoic acid dcf tp4 the hydroxylation of dcf can take place in multiple positions of either of the two aromatic rings resulting in other hydroxylated tps apart from dcf tp2 and 3 e g 3 hydroxy dcf dcf tp13 and 4 5 dihydroxy dcf dcf tp14 which were detected from surface water samples by scheurell et al 2009 4 hydroxy dcf has been reported as an unstable tp that further enters the dehydration pathway bouju et al 2016 and it can be followed by reductive dechlorination and amidation as described by jewell et al 2016 see fig 2 to give dcf tp11 table 1 the 5 hydroxy dcf can also be further transformed in ring opening reactions to give various forms of dcf tp12 table 1 apart from the hydroxylation pathway dcf can also form dcf lactam by direct amidation or decarboxylate into dcf benzoic acid some tps were further biodegraded by mixed activated sludge jewell et al 2016 or separate nitrifying and heterotrophic sludge wu et al 2020 but the subsequent tps were either not identified below the detection limit or mineralised glucuronated estrogens were found to be readily deconjugated in domestic wastewater d ascenzo et al 2003 in the majority of the studies assessing the subsequent conversion of estrogens e1 was reported as the primary product of both e2 and ee2 by oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the c17 position to a ketone group lee and liu 2002 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2007 several processes were proposed for the aerobic biotransformation of e1 it was suggested that biodegradation of e1 was initiated in ring d by wastewater sludge lee and liu 2002 with the formation of a labile lactone tp e tp1 table 1 which was cleaved and further degraded via the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway 1 in fig 3 in a study using rhodococcus sp and sphingomonas sp isolated from soil kurisu et al 2010 proposed a different mechanism where the degradation of e1 or e2 starts with the hydroxylation of the a ring at the c4 position pathway 2 in fig 3 based on the detection of the tps 4 oh e1 e pt2 in table 1 and 4 oh e2 e tp3 this step can either generate a dead end product pyridinestrone acid e tp4 or proceed with meta cleavage of the a ring as observed by chen et al 2018 using culture dependent and culture independent methods with activated sludge these metabolites are characteristic of the 4 5 seco pathway which was further elucidated by wu et al 2019 using sphingomonas sp strain kc8 isolated from a wwtp as model organism continuing on pathway 2 in fig 3 the mechanism involves coa where the c 4 of the meta cleavage product is removed via oxidative decarboxylation followed by the cleavage of the b ring through hydrolysis this product is then converted through β oxidation into e tp4 3aα h 4α 3 propanoate 7aβ methylhexahydro 1 5 indanedione or hip found to be a common tp of steroid degradation by bacteria hip degradation follows a central pathway encompassing ring cleavage which is well described horinouchi et al 2018 kurisu et al 2010 also proposed an alternative mechanism consisting of the hydroxylation of the saturated b ring in various positions e tp8 and 9 followed by ring cleavage into e tp10 pathway 3 in fig 3 the catabolic pathway of ee2 after initial conversion to e1 was also found to follow hydroxylation and cleavage of the b ring as described for pathway 3 above in a study using a sphingobacterium sp jcr5 isolated from activated sludge haiyan et al 2007 conversely in nitrifying sludge the ethinyl moiety of ee2 was not ketonised to generate e1 instead ammonia monooxygenase amo extracts were reported to start ee2 degradation by the opposite end through cleavage and hydroxylation of the a ring yi and harper 2007 biotransformation of ee2 by aob and heterotrophic cultures was studied by khunjar et al 2011 four tps were formed in aob chemostats namely 4 nitro ee2 2 nitro ee2 4 hydroxy ee2 and sulfo ee2 ee2 tp1 4 table 1 whereas heterotrophs could mineralise ee2 and most ee2 derived metabolites generated by aobs amongst these metabolites sulfo ee2 was found to be largely resistant to further biodegradation by surrounding heterotrophs these tps were also in agreement with those identified in the studies of gaulke et al 2008 yi and harper 2007 and skotnicka pitak et al 2009 recently efforts have been made to understand how microbial community structure and gene expression patterns determine the biotransformation of certain phacs by combining biotransformation analyses with characterization of the microbial communities using molecular data generated via meta omics methodologies i e metagenomics metatranscriptomics helbling et al 2012 johnson et al 2015 wolff et al 2018 for example in complex microbial communities achermann et al 2019 found proportional relationships between measured rate constants and associated gene transcripts additionally studies have also focused on establishing alternative metabolic routes in pure cultures through metabolic engineering of different strains performing gene knockouts to identify the tps and establish the role of the encoded enzymes in phac biodegradation chen et al 2017 horinouchi et al 2018 morar et al 2012 wu et al 2019 the applicability of such pathways and mechanisms beyond the isolates in which they were identified would be beneficial to establish in the future for e g wwtp sludges 2 5 identification and impact of tps microbial biotransformation of phacs ideally results in complete mineralization to co2 and h2o however in most of the cases phacs are biotransformed to tps which either are more polar less toxic and more easily biodegradable and in some cases can be further assimilated by other microbes present in the mixed activated sludge khunjar et al 2011 yi and harper 2007 or are potentially more hazardous than their parent compounds celiz et al 2009 escher and fenner 2011 thus identification of tps generated during the treatment processes is necessary to comprehensively assess the risk of phacs on aquatic ecosystems as discussed above the assessment of biotransformation products of phacs also provides a useful means to elucidate the biochemical pathway and enzymes involved alvarino et al 2018a quintana et al 2005 however the detection identification of tps remains challenging due to intrinsic difficulties in the analytical methods to detect and identify unknown compounds at such low concentrations lower even than the parent compounds in complex matrices of wastewater also there is a lack of available pure reference analytical standards and fast analytical methods for their detection and quantification in wastewater with the large number of phacs in wastewater a great number of unknown transformation products may be present in the final effluent of wwtps the advent of liquid and gas chromatography coupled with hybrid modern full spectrum acquisition high resolution tandem mass spectrometry hrms techniques such as q tof hrms q orbitrap ms new electrospray qqq fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry qqq ft icr ms or ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry im q tof hrms etc are considered promising advanced analytical techniques for tp characterisation these techniques enable sensitive and untargeted detection of thousands of substances within short time frames creating many opportunities for the identification of unknown tps even when no reference standard is available with the advances in analytical technologies increasing numbers of tps have been described in detail evgenidou et al 2015 gulde et al 2016 helbling et al 2010 jaén gil et al 2018 jewell et al 2016 kern et al 2010 senta et al 2017 terzic et al 2018 yu et al 2019 a summary of the potential transformation products of the 7 target phacs is presented in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 several tps detected during biological treatment of dcf were described as being common amongst several studies e g bouju et al 2016 jewell et al 2016 langenhoff et al 2013 in some cases these tps are proposed rather than identified due to the aforementioned analytical challenges for example a laboratory hybrid mbbr study revealed that up to 20 diclofenac tps were detected jewell et al 2016 but amongst them only 4 tps were identified via analytical reference standards dcf lactam 4 hydroxy dcf 5 hydroxy dcf and dcf benzoic acid whereas 16 tentative structures were proposed based on ms ms fragmentation data similar tps were also found at full scale wwtps as compared to lab scale in this work while it is well established that dcf is toxic to many organisms including aquatic species and even higher organisms such as vultures lonappan et al 2016 the toxicity of its biotransformation products is still poorly understood grabarczyk et al 2020 recently tested the toxicity of one of dcf s primary tps 4 hydroxy dcf using an ecotoxicological test battery of five organisms of different biological organisations and they found that this tp still had a comparable level of toxicity towards some of the aquatic organisms regarding the large variety of tps that have been identified from dcf table 1 more studies are necessary to determine the potential ecotoxicological impact of other tps in receiving water bodies numerous macrolide transformation products have been determined in wwtps including tps of ery azm and clr senta et al 2017 the biotransformation of these three macrolide antibiotics by an enriched activated sludge culture and their toxicity was also studied by terzic et al 2018 in this study macrolide biotransformation was associated with 20 tps of azm 6 tps of ery and 6 tps of clr where the presence of some were later confirmed in a municipal wwtp in this study biodegradation of the investigated macrolides except for azm was mostly associated with a decreased residual antibiotic activity and algal toxicity however residual growth inhibition 15 30 of azm degradation was observed in concomitance with the emergence of some stable azm tps at the end of the experiment many of the tps associated with the estrogens listed in table 1 have been identified in wwtp effluents the a ring of estrogens has been found to be mainly responsible for their estrogenicity anstead et al 1997 thus ring hydroxylation and cleavage can reduce estrogenicity by a factor of 200 500 huber et al 2004 nevertheless some of the hydroxylated tps were reported to increase carcinogenicity as compared to its parent compound getoff et al 2010 turan et al 2004 such as e1 tp2 4 hydroxyestrone in general the tps of phacs remains an understudied topic with only limited understanding of its impact on the risk associated with the environmental release of most tps also many tps were detected but their identification remains unconfirmed due to detection at low concentrations without available reference standards the potentially important role of tps in environmental risk assessment of wastewater effluent should not be understated and further efforts are required to assess their impact 2 6 biodegradation kinetics the kinetics of biodegradation is often the critical parameter that determines the extent of transformation of phacs in biological processes compounds that are biotransformed at a rate that is too slow are likely washed out of the system before transformation effectively takes place a useful measure of this rate is given by the phac biodegradation rate constant or kbio defined by the following pseudo first order equation joss et al 2006 1 d c d t k b i o x s s s where c is the total compound concentration μg l 1 s the soluble compound concentration μg l 1 t the time d k bio the reaction rate constant l gss 1 d 1 and xss the suspended solids concentration gss l 1 according to the derived biotransformation rate constants kbio l gss d phacs have been classified into three groups joss et al 2006 compounds with kbio 0 1 l gss d are not transformed to a significant extent 20 compounds with kbio 10 l gss d are transformed by 90 compounds in between 0 1 l gss d kbio 10l gss d are moderately transformed while this general classification scheme is useful to characterize the biodegradability of phacs the true extent of biotransformation is strongly influenced by the reactor configuration and operational conditions as also highlighted by joss et al 2006 in particular the hydraulic residence time hrt will control the contact time between microorganisms and phac and the solids retention time srt will control the selection of organisms that are able to transform these compounds while other parameters can also impact biotransformation efficiency e g ph temperature etc we will focus mainly on analyzing the impact of hrt and srt on phac biotransformation in wwtps in this review due to their key importance impacting both the fate of phacs and process operation 3 wwtp processes for phac biodegradation the biodegradation of phacs has been evaluated through numerous wwtp technologies with various operational strategies below the relative effectiveness of these different approaches are discussed 3 1 conventional activated sludge cas factors influencing the biodegradation of phacs in cas include the redox conditions imposed or operational parameters such as hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt as discussed below temperature can also affect microbial growth and activity however several studies have focused on the effect of temperature on the biodegradation of phacs göbel et al 2007 hai et al 2011 suárez et al 2005 but no direct relationship has been observed in these studies 3 1 1 effect of redox conditions the impact of redox conditions e g aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions has been extensively studied on the biodegradation of phacs alvarino et al 2016a falas et al 2016 joss et al 2004 stadler et al 2015 suárez et al 2010 it has been shown that the availability of different electron acceptors e g oxygen nitrate or others influences the biotransformation rate of phacs tables s2 and s3 si in general it has been observed that biodegradation rates for phacs under aerobic conditions was faster than anaerobic and anoxic rates joss et al 2004 suárez et al 2010 more specifically the biotransformation rate of endocrine disrupting chemicals e1 e2 ee2 dcf and ery were found to be higher under aerobic nitrification conditions phan et al 2014 suárez et al 2010 natural estrogens e1 and e2 were recalcitrant under anaerobic but highly biodegraded under aerobic and anoxic processes ery and ee2 were found to be highly biodegradable under aerobic conditions and persistent in anoxic conditions fernandez fontaina et al 2012 ma et al 2018 suárez et al 2010 dcf has been shown to be very persistent during treatment under anoxic conditions biodegradation efficiency of 2 but a much higher biodegradation efficiency was observed under aerobic conditions by slow growing nitrifying bacteria after acclimatization 51 80 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 yang et al 2011 suarez et al 2010 others have found dcf to be recalcitrant degradation efficiencies 20 under both aerobic and anoxic conditions zwiener 2000 although as noted below the srt also plays a key role in microbial selection burke et al 2014 found that clr was readily biodegradable under anoxic conditions and recalcitrant aerobically although similar biodegradation rates of clr were observed under anoxic conditions and aerobic conditions by falas et al 2013 the simultaneous influence of multiple operational parameters as well as the resulting differences in the microbial community structure likely play a significant role in relating the effectiveness of phac biotransformation with the electron acceptor condition overall different redox conditions impact the biodegradation of phacs differently as highlighted above for the selected compounds aerobic biodegradation appears to be most effective particularly due to activity by nitrifiers where the presence of anoxic and anaerobic zones that facilitate denitrification and biological phosphorus removal are unlikely to provide substantial benefit to biotransformation 3 1 2 sludge retention time srt numerous studies have stressed the significant impact of srt on phac biotransformation clara et al 2005a petrie et al 2014a stasinakis et al 2010 suárez et al 2012 generally showing that longer srts were of high importance for enriching slow growing organisms such as nitrifiers that are capable of phac biotransformation tables s2 and s3 si in some studies critical srts must be met e g 10 days at 10 c for e1 and e2 for efficient biodegradation clara et al 2005a or 20 days at 19 c for biotransformation of dcf in wwtps plósz et al 2012 or even up to 60 80 days for ery göbel et al 2007 lishman et al 2006 total estrogen biodegradation increased from 70 7 to 94 1 when srt increased from 3 days to 10 days but no improvement was observed when srt was increased from 10 to 27 days petrie et al 2014b fernandez fontaina et al 2012 found a correlation between srt and the dcf biodegradation efficiency which is in agreement with other studies clara et al 2005a lishman et al 2006 the biodegradation of this compound increased from 15 to 70 when srt was increased to above 150 days where supposedly that long residence time facilitated the development of more diverse bacterial communities with ability to carry out the compound biodegradation increases in biodegradation efficiencies of clr and ery up to 90 were also observed at high srt of 60 80 d supposedly due to an increased biodiversity of the active biomass and a broader range of degradation pathways at long srt göbel et al 2007 as mentioned high srts facilitate the enrichment of slow growing bacteria consequently this establishes a more diverse microbial community with broader physiological capabilities e g non constitutive enzyme expression compared to wwtps operating at low srts clara et al 2005a moreover high srts may induce k strategist organisms that are capable of efficiently utilizing scarce resources or mixed substrates at low concentration e g poorly degradable phacs de la torre et al 2015 koh et al 2009 vuono et al 2015 several studies reported that micropollutant biotransformation is favorable under such oligotrophic conditions drewes et al 2014 while an activated sludge system operated at prolonged srts generally correlates with enhanced biodegradation of some phacs göbel et al 2007 kimura et al 2007 kovalova et al 2012 several studies found little or no statistical relationship between biodegradation rates of phacs including natural estrogens and dcf and srt clara et al 2005a falas et al 2016 fernandez fontaina et al 2013 gaulke et al 2009 hashimoto et al 2007 helbling et al 2012 this could be attributed to a similar presence of bacteria capable of biodegrading the selected pharmaceuticals at both short and long srts overall while long srts are generally favourable to the biodegradation of phacs there are clear practical implications limiting the application of excessive srts in most situations it is not feasible to implement srts in cas 30d long srt can negatively impact the selection of organisms important for other macropollutant conversion processes and can also cause unwanted sludge build up and lower biogas generation also prolonged sludge age might even create favourable conditions for the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance to the environment kümmerer et al 2019 extension of srts to a certain extent can favourably impact the microbial selection of the system e g nitrifier abundance but the knowledge generated from cas operation at very high srts tends to underscore the relevance of systems that employ biomass retention e g mbrs biofilm reactors like mbbr that can serve a similar purpose of enriching a slow growing and diverse community of microorganisms 3 1 3 hydraulic residence time hrt the hrt also impacts the biodegradation of phacs tables s2 and s3 si a decrease in biodegradation efficiency of ery from 94 to 57 was observed when hrt decreased from 3 6d to 1d respectively supposedly due to the kinetic limitations at higher loading rates of the compound fernandez fontaina et al 2012 zhou et al 2013a reported biodegradation efficiencies of clr and ery varying from 22 to 68 in plant a and from 64 93 in plant b where a longer aeration time and hrt employed in plant b was suggested to result in higher biodegradation of these macrolides in a pilot scale activated sludge process increased biodegradation of ee2 from 41 to 65 was observed when hrt increased from 8h to 24h respectively petrie et al 2014b improved degradation of phacs in systems with longer hrt has been attributed to i a decrease in food to microorganism f m ratio that led to the selection of k strategist populations under substrate limitation that biodegraded less favourable carbon substrates and ii increased contact time between wastewater contaminants and sludge which may be beneficial for the slowly biodegradable phacs koh et al 2009 petrie et al 2014a it should be pointed out that some studies have not found any correlation between hrt and biodegradation efficiencies statistical correlations linking hrt and phac biodegradation were not established for dcf bernhard et al 2006 or natural estrogens hashimoto et al 2007 gros et al 2010 linked degradation rates with hrt of wwtps in spain and demonstrated that in most cases compounds with high pseudo first order degradation rate constants high kbio and low sludge water distribution coefficient kd values or low tendency to adsorb to sewage sludge are more influenced by hrt where hrt does not influence the biodegradation efficiency of compounds which are poorly biodegradable with low kbio substances that have low kbio and high kd are more influenced by srt due to the impact of adsorption the relatively low biodegradability of dcf as compared to estrogens and the observed higher impact of hrt on estrogens as compared to dcf is consistent with their hypothesis overall the combination of both hrt and srt is of importance to phac degradation not only with respect to adsorption impacts but also microbial selection of phac degraders short hrt implies that more wastewater can be treated per reactor volume unit as compared to long hrt systems thus larger reactors are needed in long hrt operated processes leading to high capital costs recent trends towards the establishment of high rate wastewater treatment processes for reducing or eliminating wwtp energy demands which tend to favour low srt and hrt processes appear to be at odds with strategies to enhance phac biotransformation this suggests that alternative strategies for polishing wastewater effluents e g advanced oxidation processes biofiltration etc may be required for such high rate wwtps if phacs become subject to regulation recently taboada santos et al 2020 has shown lower kbio estimates for dcf ee2 and ery in a high rate process as compared to cas though this was not generally applicable for other phacs studied such as e1 and e2 which were comparable further evaluations of phac biodegradation in high rate activated sludge processes would be beneficial 3 2 membrane bioreactors mbr mbrs have gained attention with respect to phac degradation due to the advantages found for some phacs only partially degraded during cas processes besides physical retention by the membrane adsorption and subsequent biodegradation of the micropollutants have been considered as the main degradation processes in general mbrs are effective for the degradation of hydrophobic and readily biodegradable phacs whilst less effective in degrading hydrophilic and biologically persistent phacs clara et al 2005b nguyen et al 2012 tadkaew et al 2011 hydrophobic phacs can be readily adsorbed in mbrs particularly to the cake layer formed on the membrane sorption capacity is also dependent on the physico chemical characteristics of the membrane used hydrophobic membranes e g polyethersulfone membranes are able to retain lipophilic phacs whereas charged membranes can retain phacs by electrostatic interactions and no significant retention of phacs are found within the hydrophilic and neutrally charged membranes alvarino et al 2018b the degradation efficiency of phacs by mbrs is influenced by i operational conditions such as srt biomass concentration temperature redox conditions ph conductivity ii wastewater constituents iii membrane characteristics and also iv molecular weight hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and complexity of the phacs besha et al 2017 goswami et al 2018 while operation at prolonged srt is facilitated by mbrs the high biomass concentrations can stimulate the utilization of multiple substrates at low concentration kovarova kovar et al 1998 thomas 2015 as a result of the low food to microorganism f m ratio overall mbr have been observed to be superior to cas in several situations particularly for estrogens such as e1 and e2 tables s2 and s3 si this is typically due to the greater sorption in mbrs which can provide increased contact time with microorganisms that can in some cases enhance biodegradation and the long srt that can often be employed in mbrs which enhances the growth of slow growing organisms that can degrade phacs while advantages can be achieved for mbrs vs cas for these reasons significant increases in the kinetic rates of biotransformations for difficult to degrade phacs like dcf fig 4 are unlikely to be realised in mbrs 3 3 biofilm systems attached growth processes in which a microbial community forms on a surface of an inert carrier have also been investigated for the biodegradation of phacs the carriers can be either fixed fixed bed bioreactors or mobilized in suspension e g moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr fluidized bed bioreactors different biofilm systems have been reported as effective tools to biodegrade some recalcitrants such as dcf escolà casas and bester 2015 reungoat et al 2011 trickling filters were reported as a much less efficient process for the removal of dcf and ery compared to cas due to their low biomass generation leading to lower adsorption and biodegradation kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 in contrast amongst biofilm processes mbbr has been proposed as a promising alternative technology to cas due to its ability to degrade a broad spectrum of phacs at higher rates per unit of biomass escolà casas et al 2015 falås et al 2012 torresi et al 2016 zupanc et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 for more readily biodegradable compounds such as e1 and e2 the advantage of mbbrs over cas or mbrs is less see table s2 si indeed the estrogens have presented kbio coefficients substantially higher than dcf or macrolides in cas and mbr systems since relatively high biodegradation efficiencies have been observed for estrogens in cas and mbrs most research has focussed on applying mbbrs to biodegrade more recalcitrant phacs in mbbr systems the use of submerged low density plastic polypropylene carriers allows the development of active slow growing bacteria and a diverse microbial group of microorganisms due to the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones within the biofilm which can potentially promote various phac biotransformation routes under different redox conditions alvarino et al 2018a falås et al 2012 torresi et al 2016 found a strong correlation between biodegradation rate coefficient kbio with biodiversity expressed by shannon and evenness indices which was associated with biofilm thickness for some recalcitrant compounds higher first order rate constants for not only dcf but also azm and clr were observed in mbbrs as compared to cas and mbr fig 4 this highlights how biofilm systems can facilitate the application of lower hrts to achieve similar biodegradation efficiencies göbel et al 2007 joss et al 2005 thus enabling a smaller footprint a concern related to the use of mbbr is the decrease of sludge settleability when treating high strength wastewater which can be overcome by using membrane filtration luo et al 2015 a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor membrane bioreactor mbbr mbr system luo et al 2015 has been developed and exhibited higher biodegradation of estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 though no improvement in dcf biodegradation as compared to a conventional mbr in another study de la torre et al 2015 compared an integrated fixed film activated sludge mbr ifas mbr a moving bed membrane biofilm reactor mb mbr an mbr and a cas system the ifas mbr showed the best overall performance where long srts were found to be critical for the success of the ifas mbr due to better acclimation of the biomass and selection of microorganisms to metabolise the poorly degradable compounds at substrate limiting conditions de la torre et al 2015 in general biofilm processes particularly mbbrs or ifas are considered as a potentially superior technology to cas and mbr for enhancing elimination of a broad spectrum of phacs that usually occur in wwtps escolà casas et al 2015 vieno and sillanpää 2014 zupanc et al 2013 especially for the biodegradation of more recalcitrant compounds such as dcf and some antibiotics hybrid processes based on mbbrs or ifas have the capacity to provide additional advantages though the requirement to couple these systems with mbrs may be a niche application as biomass retention by mbbr or ifas is likely to be sufficient in many cases without the need for the additional costs associated with mbr operation investigations into biodegradation mechanisms can be quite complex in mbbrs or ifas but warrant further study due to the promising nature of the technology 3 4 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cws are a biologically land based engineered wastewater treatment system that consists of shallow ponds beds or trenches that contain floating or rooted wetland vegetation to mimic the natural wetland process within a more controlled environment matamoros and bayona 2008 the system has been commonly used for secondary domestic sewage effluent treatment as a polishing step gorito et al 2017 in the past decade cws has been studied more extensively for the degradation of phacs due to its eco friendliness simplicity in operation and maintenance as a low cost alternative to cas in cw systems the pollutant degradation takes place by the combination of three main processes i e physical chemical and biological degradation amid plants substrate and soil through e g volatilization sorption sedimentation phytodegradation plant uptake accumulation as well as microbial biodegradation song et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 degradation of phacs by constructed wetlands has been reported to be affected by many factors such as the designed configuration soil substrate matrix selection of the plant species etc for example surface flow cws show better performance for compounds susceptible to photodegradation because water can be directly exposed to sunlight or indirect photolysis mediated by photogenerated radicals other than hydroxyl whereas subsurface flow cws have a higher potential to eliminate biodegradable compounds because higher interactions between wastewater soil plants and microorganisms are promoted gorito et al 2017 song et al 2009 examined the effect of sand depth with phragmites australis in a vertical flow wetland as a polishing step of a wwtp for the degradation of estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 the highest degradation efficiency of 67 8 28 0 84 0 15 4 and 75 3 17 6 for e1 e2 and ee2 respectively was achieved by the shallowest wetland amongst the three cws with different filter layer depths i e 7 5 30 and 60 cm the higher degradation of estrogens in the shallow wetland was attributed to the higher oxygenation of a shallow bed and faster biodegradation under aerobic conditions in another study better degradation of dcf was observed i with subsurface vertical flow with a gravel bed average of 47 6 compared to horizontal flow average of 9 6 and ii in cws in the presence of plant genera phragmites 25 9 compared to typha 1 7 rabello et al 2019 different plant species can effectively remove some selectively targeted phacs while hybrids harbouring different species could be more efficient in degrading a wide range of phacs in wastewater rabello et al 2019 by using statistical analyses rabello et al 2019 found that the hrt had a significant positive correlation with the average degradation rate of dcf chen et al 2014 also found that degradation efficiency of estrogens e1 and e2 increased with increasing hrt in general cws showed good performance towards the degradation of the 7 selected phacs the reason could be attributed to the coexistence of different physicochemical conditions and different plant species in the natural systems which allow different biodegradation pathways of phacs hijosa valsero et al 2010 another reason could also be due to a smaller load of phacs when cws are implemented as a tertiary polishing step after a conventional secondary process such as cas the estrogens would appear to be the only case where lower degradation efficiencies are observed qiang et al 2013 although these compounds tend to be highly degraded in cas and are unlikely to be abundant at the tertiary stage this suggests that cws could be a potential alternative biological technology for the degradation of phacs from wastewater especially as a polishing step in a sustainable and low cost manner although they rely on the availability of large land areas in addition conventional treatment plants coupled with cws is considered as a more efficient strategy to remove phacs and reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes as compared to cas alone the main challenge for cws in addition to their footprint appears to be the more inconsistent degradation efficiency potentially leading to reliability challenges table s2 one of the key factors that controls the performance of cws for phac degradation is oxygen transfer limitation enhanced biodegradation of phacs can be achieved in engineered wetlands that employ active aeration rather than those relying solely on diffusive transport of oxygen ilyas and van hullebusch 2020 kahl et al 2017 this also enabled the establishment of various microenvironments with different redox conditions aerobic and anaerobic which facilitated the contribution of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways to biodegradation further studies are required to understand better the transformation mechanism as well as optimized conditions to stabilize the degradation efficiencies of phacs 4 discussion and perspectives the compounds analysed in this review have been identified as the priority phacs for the eu watch list due to their negative effect on human health and wildlife as well as their recalcitrance to biodegradation in natural systems since the majority of wwtps rely in great part on biological processes it is important to develop a deep understanding of the processes that successfully transform them at least to a less toxic form as well as the molecular mechanisms underpinning these processes from the analysis of a large volume of publications in recent years on these topics we identified promising advances and some challenges where research should now focus while there is deep knowledge available on the metabolic pathways and tps including the enzymes involved and encoding genes a lot of this knowledge is based on pure cultures in lab tests the trend in the future should encompass the validation of these findings in full scale mixed culture processes enzyme inhibition co metabolism and substrate competition are also important aspects to investigate further in this context the large advances in chemical analytical techniques in the last decade has enabled the detection of tps at very low concentrations however the lack of analytical standards for many of these tps and the simultaneous occurrence of multiple metabolic pathways from a high number of phacs in real wwtps make the assessment of these compounds highly challenging molecular techniques applying e g labelled substrates or omics technologies are promising approaches to overcome some of the challenges towards a better understanding of the biological mechanisms taking place in wwtp linking these degradation mechanisms with toxicological impacts regarding the tps formed also requires further effort indeed such ecotoxicological effects of phacs and their tps as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance from wastewater effluents are key aspects requiring control to minimise negative environmental impacts further research on phac biodegradation should also include all forms of the targeted compounds conjugates and transformation products to avoid overestimation underestimation of removal efficiencies greater understanding of the flux of phacs and their tps and their link with wwtp process technologies is also needed to minimise overall toxicity of the treated effluent while variations in biodegradation efficiency have been reported for all treatment processes discussed in section 3 in general the proposed technologies mbbr mbr and cws possess several advantages over cas with the potential for comparable or improved phac degradation nevertheless further study directly comparing the efficacy of biodegradation and kbio coefficients of cas mbr mbbr and cw with the same real wastewater would be beneficial to improve our understanding of how wwtp technology influences phac degradation one advantage of mbbr mbr and cw over cas relates to the reduction of excess sludge production this is particularly helpful with respect to phacs as final sludge disposal may not be suitable for agricultural purposes as restrictions towards land application of sludge continue to become more stringent worldwide due to contamination by phacs and other micropollutants mbrs are considered as a superior alternative to cas in phac biodegradation besha et al 2017 dharupaneedi et al 2019 goswami et al 2018 however there are still some phacs that are poorly biotransformed or recalcitrant e g dcf in mbrs beier et al 2011 hai et al 2011 kim et al 2007 quintana et al 2005 tadkaew et al 2010 the main advantages of mbr over cas is the capacity to work with high srt that facilitate the biotransformation of slowly biodegradable phac compared to cas also mbr can produce a high quality treated effluent that meets sensitive discharge standards with less sludge production and small space requirement however the shortcomings of membrane processes are the membrane fouling high investment and operation costs inconsistent degradation of polar and recalcitrant phacs as well as moderately high energy consumption luo et al 2014 for these reasons some have criticised the use of mbrs as an alternative technology to cas for improving phac degradation lesjean et al 2011 overall it appears that mbrs can have a similar or enhanced effectiveness as compared to cas for phac degradation though it is not necessarily the most cost effective option mbbr and hybrid systems incorporating similar biofilm systems tend to yield more efficient biodegradation of some antibiotics and dcf fig 4 mbbr systems could also be potentially implemented as an end of pipe polishing step for the effluent of existing wwtps and operated independently of the secondary treatment process of the main wwtps also the low cod values typically achieved in the effluent of mbbrs make it suitable to be combined with ozonation escolà casas et al 2015 or uv photolysis for further treatment mbbrs also have the potential to be an attractive alternative for new wwtps as a secondary treatment step in addition compared to cas mbbr allows higher effective srt lower hrt lower sludge production are more resilient to toxic shock loads and require a smaller land area for construction the main disadvantage is the difficulty in controlling the biofilm thickness a number of hybrid processes involving mbbrs also appear to be promising for future applications constructed wetlands offer a simple design with cost effective operation and a high buffer capacity for hydraulic and organic load fluctuations they are also advantageous for lowering the threat of spreading antibiotic resistance bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment chen and zhang 2013 chen et al 2019 2016 hijosa valsero et al 2010 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 while not as effective for estrogen biodegradation current wwtps that operate a cas system may find cws effective as a post treatment or polishing step of the wastewater effluent where estrogens are typically not the main problem as they are more effectively degraded in cas however applications of cws requires large space and is normally suitable for decentralised wastewater treatment for small communities ilyas and masih 2017 nevertheless future applications of cws can be extended as a result of good treatment efficiency for a wide range of phacs with cost effective operation as compared to other high cost treatments like mbrs ultrafiltration and advanced oxidation processes etc cost benefit analyses comparing various wastewater polishing strategies would be beneficial where conventional and novel high rate wwtp process designs that appear susceptible to low phac biotransformations would be of interest to examine further in this regard however the question is do we need to replace existing cas by alternative biological processes mbr mbbr hybrid systems etc in order to improve the removal efficiency of phacs and meet new emerging standards the answer to this question is undoubtedly related to the final effluent discharge location and the purpose of any potential reuse applications while there is no best solution for all cases as each phac reacts differently in each treatment process we must prioritise and target the removal of certain compounds we have chosen those emerging contaminants highlighted by the eu directives in this review though clearly this list will change over time when infrastructure is already in place for wwtp it would be costly to recreate treatment train solutions for enhancing phac removal optimisation of operational conditions in cas should still be pursued where hrt srt and combinations of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions are the most frequently studied ways to improve phac degradation it has been suggested that bacterial species and production of their enzymes in wwtp can be selectively optimised to treat phacs through adjustment of conditions such as aeration bains et al 2019 this implies improving phac treatment performance of wwtps by applying environmental stresses to stimulate overproduction of beneficial phac degrading enzymes alternative bioprocess technologies can also be considered for augmenting phac degradation enzymatic treatment technologies e g immobilised enzyme reactors for phac biodegradation have also been proposed laccases and horseradish peroxidases have been found to efficiently catalyse the transformation of a variety of phacs including estrogens and dcf auriol et al 2008 bilal et al 2019b garcía galán et al 2020 lloret et al 2013 alternatively microalgae have also been found to be able to degrade estrogens like e2 and ee2 and could be a beneficial treatment step hom diaz et al 2015 the role of such bioprocesses as potential polishing steps could provide additional alternatives for wwtps while the impact of biological processes on phacs is of high importance their relationship with new and existing primary and tertiary treatment to control the degradation of a wide range of contaminants of emerging concern needs further study in order to comply with high water quality standards for reclamation many physical and chemical treatment processes show effective phac degradation such as adsorption by granular activated carbon gac or advanced oxidation processes aops uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 mf ro these treatments often require a polishing step e g biofiltration to eliminate bioavailable oxidation products and particles eggen et al 2014 reungoat et al 2012 sgroi et al 2017 a multi barrier approach in which advanced tertiary treatment processes are employed in combination with biological processes is promising roccaro 2018 overall in terms of selecting an adequate biotechnology for dealing with phacs the cost environmental impact feasibility reliability operational difficulty and sludge production associated are important considerations that will impact process selection the implementation of hybrid biological technologies should also be considered as an alternative to combine the advantages of multiple processes for example mbbr could be a prospective pretreatment to mbr for micropollutant degradation and membrane fouling minimisation luo et al 2015 the cost of such a process could be more moderate as compared to an additional treatment step such as activated carbon adsorption grandclément et al 2017 the development of decision support tools would be of high benefit for analysing the degradation efficiency of both conventional pollutants and phacs through different treatment solutions and offer a means to evaluate the performance of each solution based on specific user requirements and objectives using multi objective optimisation and multi criteria decision analysis for example visanji et al 2020 analysed the performance of different treatment train solutions of five different regions from north to south of india regarding phac degradation to comply with the indian water quality standards for reuse using a decision support tool the wastewater decision support optimiser wisdom cec was based on different user defined weighting of various criteria including technical environmental social and economic considerations further research on the development of methodologies for decision support tools for selecting optimal wastewater treatment solutions is recommended 5 conclusions this paper has reviewed biological and chemical factors impacting key phac biotransformations in wwtps focussing on compounds highlighted by the eu watch list the impact of compound structure the metabolic pathway and transformation products and the choice of process technology and their operational conditions

metabolic pathways involved in phacs biodegradation integrating meta omics approaches for characterization of the microbial community and their genes enzymes with biotransformation performance will provide insight for understanding the role of bioprocesses in phacs removal from wastewater cost effective strategies that enhance the activity of slow growing organisms including nitrifiers should be

17400,wastewater effluent discharges have been considered as one of the main sources of synthetic chemicals entering into the aquatic environment even though they occur at low concentrations pharmaceutically active compounds phacs can have an impact on ecological toxicity that affects aquatic organisms moreover new regulations in development toward preserving water quality reinforces the increasing need to monitor and abate some phacs in wastewater treatment plants wwtps where they are typically only partially eliminated unlike most previous reviews we have focussed on how the main biological and chemical molecular factors impact the biotransformations of key phacs in biological wwtp processes biotransformations have been found to be an important contributor towards the removal of phacs from wwtp effluents this review paper critically assesses these aspects and the recent advances that have been achieved in wastewater treatment processes for biodegradation of 7 phacs namely the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid diclofenac dcf the macrolide antibiotics azithromycin azm erythromycin ery and clarithromycin clr the two natural estrogens estrone e1 and 17β estradiol e2 and the synthetic estrogen 17α ethinylesradiol ee2 these represent the micropollutants of the eu watch list in decision 2015 495 eu that are most relevant to wwtps due to their frequent detection the metabolic pathways transformation products and impact of relevant factors to biological wwtp processes is addressed in this review the biokinetics of phac biodegradation in different engineered bioprocesses is also discussed promising technologies and operational strategies that are likely to have a high impact on controlling phac releases are highlighted and future research needs are also

drugs nsaids which can exert chronic and acute toxicity impacts on the liver kidney and gills of fish vieno and sillanpää 2014 globally phacs and hormones are not yet commonly subjected to monitoring or regulation in waterways and only a few countries have developed regulations and frameworks for micropollutant management such as the united states the european union australia and some other european countries such as switzerland within the european union a list of 33 prioritized substances was defined identified in annex x of the water frame work directive wfd wrd 2008 105 eu that must be monitored by all member states at specific concentration thresholds in surface waters in 2013 the european union directive 2013 39 eu added a further 12 substances to annex x of the wfd in which three phacs the nsaid diclofenac dcf the synthetic hormone 17 alpha ethinylestradiol ee2 and the natural hormone 17 beta estradiol e2 were included in march 2015 decision 2015 495 eu was implemented which included a watch list adding three macrolide antibiotics azithromycin azm clarithromycin clr and erythromycin ery together with another natural hormone estrone e1 and several pesticides and other compounds barbosa et al 2016 recently there has been an increased focus on antibiotics via the european one health action plan against antimicrobial resistance amr which supports improved knowledge of the occurrence and spread of antimicrobials in the environment where additional antibiotics have been added to the eu watch list in the u s california s state water boards recycled water policy requires the monitoring of e2 and two other phacs while ee2 e2 e1 and other hormones are monitored in drinking water supplies in new york city and other selected states us epa 2017 2016 the australian guidelines for water recycling have also recommended limits of all 7 phacs highlighted above nrmmc 2008 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are often considered as one of the main pathways for the introduction of phacs into the aquatic environment via treated water or into the terrestrial environment by disposal of the sewage sludge biosolids in landfills barbosa et al 2016 however wwtps also serve as a barrier to control discharge of these phacs into the environment there are numerous ways in which wwtps can impact the transformation and removal of these compounds including biotransformation adsorption onto biosolids and advanced oxidation processes biological processes are typically the most applied approaches in wwtps and have been often reported to have an important impact on the removal of many phacs in wwtps joss et al 2005 radjenović et al 2009 suárez et al 2010 torresi et al 2016 several biological processes have been studied for the degradation of phacs from wastewater such as conventional activated sludge treatment cas joss et al 2005 kosma et al 2014 radjenović et al 2009 suárez et al 2010 zupanc et al 2013 membrane bioreactors mbrs hai et al 2011 maeng et al 2013 tadkaew et al 2011 xue et al 2010 moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs escolà casas et al 2015 falås et al 2013 tang et al 2017 torresi et al 2016 and constructed wetlands hijosa valsero et al 2016 reyes contreras et al 2012 rühmland et al 2015 vymazal et al 2017 while several valuable reviews of phacs in wwtps exist ahmed et al 2017 besha et al 2017 kanaujiya et al 2019 liu et al 2015 luo et al 2014 tiwari et al 2017 vieno and sillanpää 2014 a review targeting the impact of different biological processes on the biotransformation extent and kinetics at a molecular level is needed most current reviews cover either occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals in wastewater systems or the degradation efficiency of various processes including biological the importance of identifying transformation products tps is often disregarded where biotransformation is assumed to be equated with bioremoval despite the fact that tps can be more harmful than the parent compound lambropoulou and nollet 2014 lonappan et al 2016 petrie et al 2015 the metabolic pathways involved in the biodegradation of priority phacs necessitates a comprehensive review as well as its link between biotransformation products conjugated forms and the impact of engineered wwtp bioprocesses on their degradation efficiency this paper provides a critical review of the literature with respect to the molecular transformations of phacs in bioprocesses we emphasise that the impact of technological or operational factors impact the rate or extent of biodegradation or biotransformation rather than removal per se to avoid the implication that potentially harmful by products are fully removed from the system a factor that is typically unknown we looked in depth into the impact of chemical structure on biodegradability the metabolic pathways involved in biodegradation the importance of co metabolism and the biotransformation rates as well as the impact of different bioreactor operating conditions the paper compares and contrasts a broad range of biological processes commonly employed in wwtps focusing on 7 priority phacs found therein these 7 compounds cover the main relevant phacs of the watch list from decision 2015 495 eu where the non phacs included in this list are not typically found in wastewater and were thus considered outside the scope of this review the 7 phacs are the pharmaceuticals dcf an nsaid azm clr ery three antibiotics and e1 e2 and ee2 three hormones we analyse the impact of biological processes on phacs biodegradation with special attention to the generation of biotransformation products the paper concludes with a critical overview of the knowledge gaps still preventing a deeper understanding of the bio chemical processes contributing to the biotransformation and mineralisation of these important compounds from wastewater 2 biotransformation mineralisation of phacs in wwtps phacs can be affected by physical chemical and biological processes occurring in wwtps abiotic transformations through e g volatilisation stripping is typically insignificant for phacs in wwtps including for the selected compounds of this study due to their low henry s constants table s1 si uv photolysis and advanced oxidation processes can have significant impacts but these processes are considered beyond the scope of the present paper sorption absorption or adsorption can be significant for many phacs in wwtps and depends on i the physico chemical properties of the phacs e g hydrophobicity electrostatic interactions dissociation etc ii the characteristics of the sludge e g biomass structure and particle size or iii the operational conditions e g ph ionic strength temperature however insignificant sorption to activated sludge 10 as compared to biodegradation was reported for the selected estrogens andersen et al 2005 zhou et al 2010 while sorption of clr and ery are considered negligible senta et al 2013 terzic et al 2018 and sorption of dcf and azm has been reported to vary between negligible 20 deng et al 2016 terzic et al 2018 suárez et al 2012 ternes et al 2004 thus biodegradation is likely to be of high importance towards the elimination of the selected compounds as sorption does not typically play a substantial role while many studies in literature focus on the apparent biological removal of phacs by measuring the relative concentrations of the parent compounds in the wastewater influent and effluent in many cases these parent compounds are only partially transformed biologically instead of being completely biodegraded i e mineralised to innocuous products such as co2 and water in this paper partial biodegradation will be referred to as biotransformation complete biodegradation as biomineralisation and in cases where the extent of transformation is unknown the removal observed will be referred to as biodegradation 2 1 human metabolites retransformation and apparent negative removal in wwtps after being metabolized in human and animal bodies pharmaceuticals are excreted through urine and faeces in the form of conjugated up to 22 of the human metabolites testa et al 2012 oxidised or otherwise transformed metabolites along with the unchanged parent compounds which then get discharged to wwtps the metabolism of pharmaceuticals in the human body can be divided in two stages i phase i conversion of lipophilic organic molecules to more polar compounds by introduction of reactive functional groups into the compounds which involves hydrolysis hydrolytic cleavages reduction and oxidation alkylations and dealkylations roth 1997 timbrell 2008 and ii phase ii typically involves conjunction of the compounds i e the covalent attachment of small hydrophilic endogenous compounds to enhance solubility and facilitate excretion lambropoulou and nollet 2014 this includes glucuronidation transfer of glucuronic acid to phenols aliphatic hydroxyl carboxyl thiol amine and hydroxylamino groups along with less frequent sulfation glutathione conjugation n acetylation and amino acid conjugation roth 1997 retransformation of the phase ii human metabolites back to the active compounds or its corresponding phase i metabolites has been observed in wwtps daughton and ternes 1999 polesel 2016 for example glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of some natural and synthetic estrogens andersen et al 2003 aris et al 2014 atkinson et al 2012 cai et al 2012 d ascenzo et al 2003 gomes et al 2009 joss et al 2004 nancy et al 2006 antibiotics or dcf plósz et al 2012 vieno and sillanpää 2014 are very likely deconjugated to reform their respective parent compounds in sewage or in wwtps by enzymatic activity e g β glucuronidase and sulfatase or abiotic processes this can likely be an explanation for the apparent negative removal of some pharmaceuticals in wwtps e g ery clr and azm gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 and dcf clara et al 2005b zorita et al 2009 in microbial degradation tests lee et al 2012 found slow biodegradation of 4 hydroxy dcf the major phase i metabolite of dcf and deconjugation of diclofenac β o acyl glucuronide the major phase ii metabolite to form equimolar dcf within 7 d the main human metabolites of the 7 target phacs are presented in table s4 of the si there is still very limited knowledge on the environmental fate and behaviour of those human conjugated metabolites whose determination has been restricted by a lack of available analytical methods and reference standards petrie et al 2015 taking into account the significance of conjugated human metabolites to the overall mass loads of phacs senta et al 2019 attention must be paid to the conjugated forms of pharmaceuticals and their fates in wwtps and in the environment to gain a more comprehensive understanding about their transformation and risk assessment during wastewater treatment avoiding discharge of compounds that could retransform back into their active parent forms in the environment stadler et al 2015 a concerted effort should be made between the identification of human metabolites in clinical studies and their analysis in environmental samples this would imply expanding the range of compounds usually monitored in environmental samples 2 2 metabolism co metabolism and the role of primary substrates biotransformation of organic micropollutants such as phacs during activated sludge processes is known to take place both via primary metabolic or co metabolic mechanisms tran et al 2013 in primary metabolism the phac is taken up and transformed as the source of carbon and energy for cell growth by heterotrophic microorganisms in co metabolism the phac is biologically transformed as a non growth substrate by bacteria heterotrophic or autotrophic in the obligate presence of a separate primary substrate or growth substrate dalton and stirling 1982 to date reports on biotransformations carried out by specific degraders that could use phacs as sources of carbon and energy to maintain cell growth are still limited heterotrophic microbes in the environment are known to be able to degrade a large variety of phacs via their various monooxygenases and or dioxygenases arp et al 2001 khunjar et al 2011 metabolic degradation of phacs as growth substrates by pure cultures or mixed activated sludge has been reported for several compounds de gusseme et al 2011 larcher and yargeau 2011 lindblom et al 2009 murdoch and hay 2005 reis et al 2014 summers et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 but only few have been reported for the targeted compounds in this review such as e1 and e2 bradley et al 2009 iasur kruh et al 2011 layton et al 2000 lee and liu 2002 zhang et al 2019 phacs are typically present in wastewater in concentrations significantly lower than their affinity constant which are probably too low to induce the necessary catabolic genes kolvenbach et al 2014 and thus biotransformation may be mainly dependent on co metabolism a number of studies have demonstrated that the biotransformation of some pharmaceuticals is likely to be due to co metabolism gauthier et al 2010 müller et al 2013 plósz et al 2012 polesel et al 2017 su et al 2015 autotrophs play important roles in co metabolism of phacs via non specific enzymes a correlation between biotransformation of some phacs and nitrification activity of nitrifying activated sludge has been reported alvarino et al 2016b dytczak et al 2008 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 helbling et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 khunjar et al 2011 mcadam et al 2010 men et al 2017 roh et al 2009 shi et al 2004 yi and harper 2007 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are known to possess ammonia monooxygenase amo an enzyme with relatively broad substrate specificity that catalyses nonspecific oxidation of many phacs batt et al 2006 khunjar et al 2011 shi et al 2004 tran et al 2009 which could also be suppressed under high concentrations of ammonia fernandez fontaina et al 2012 in contrast some studies tested the use of amo inhibitors which showed little to no effect on the biotransformation of phacs gaulke et al 2008 khunjar et al 2011 suggesting that other enzymes e g hydroxylamine oxidoreductase or nitrite oxidoreductase that are involved in the ammonia oxidation process could be potentially responsible for the phac biotransformation helbling et al 2012 thus the relative contribution of amo to biotransformation of phacs compared to enzymes from heterotrophs still remains unclear no matter how biotransformations of phacs occur in wwtps i e via metabolic or co metabolic processes the presence of readily biodegradable substrates e g organic carbon or ammonia as primary substrates or biogenic substrates play an important role in the biological transformation of phacs these substrates can induce non specific catabolic enzymes for assimilation or co factors for biodegradation or supply energy that is used for biomass growth and maintenance etc nguyen et al 2017 different bacterial strains that are capable of degrading several organic micropollutants co metabolically in the presence of primary substrates have been reported larcher and yargeau 2011 men et al 2017 zhou et al 2013a alvarino et al 2016b observed enhanced biotransformation rates of the investigated phacs after supplementation of organic matter into the aerobic reactors to increase the heterotrophic activity however the presence of the main substrates for microbial growth has been reported to exert multiple interactions on the transformation of phacs such as enhanced biodegradation nguyen et al 2017 oehmen et al 2013 plósz et al 2012 su et al 2015 tran et al 2013 2009 and also reduced biodegradation plósz et al 2010 sathyamoorthy et al 2013 diauxic or sequential degradation when mixed substrates are present has been observed between the growth and co metabolic substrate as a result of competition for non specific enzymes which lowers the biodegradation rate joss et al 2004 li et al 2008 plósz et al 2010 sathyamoorthy et al 2013 also the composition and concentration of growth substrates have been shown to act as microbial selectors that could affect the structure of the microbial community which may in turn alter the phac degradation via changes in the individual populations present over an extended period of time alidina et al 2014 li et al 2014 in addition the catabolic enzymes expressed by a community are also impacted by the type of growth substrate present thus affecting their metabolic capability this short term effect was observed e g through the increased degradation of a group of phacs under lower concentrations of easily biodegradable dissolved organic carbon and higher humic acid content which was correlated to a higher abundance of cytochrome p450 genes a group of monooxygenases li et al 2014 other studies found that biotransformation of different compounds respond differently to the presence of readily degradable carbon in short term tests su et al 2015 tan et al 2013 under oligotrophic conditions bacterial cells can develop a multivorous strategy to simultaneously metabolize dozens of different carbon substrates metabolic flexibility instead of specialization on a particular substrate and strict metabolic control via mechanisms such as catabolite repression egli 2010 tan et al 2013 observed enhanced estrogen e1 degradation under prolonged biomass starvation conditions over 5 13 days which was attributed to stimulation of multiple substrate utilizing degraders under low substrate levels improved ee2 kinetics in activated sludge treatment was further reported as a result of population selection with growth promoted at low organic substrate concentrations ziels et al 2014 overall while the presence of a biogenic substrate may facilitate the biotransformation of phacs it might be advantageous to keep the concentration of this compound low thereby improving both an adequate microbial selection and stimulating a more diverse less biogenic substrate specific metabolism 2 3 effects of compound structure on phac biodegradation studies have demonstrated that the chemical structure and physicochemical properties are important factors in evaluating the biotransformation potential of phacs from wwtps cirja et al 2008 kimura et al 2005 tadkaew et al 2011 biodegradation processes often involve oxidation reduction reactions therefore the electron availability of the compounds along with the redox potential of the medium play an important role on biodegradability bertelkamp et al 2016 reported a statistically significant relationship between phac biodegradation rates and the functional groups of the molecular structures in an aerobic environment the authors found that phac biodegradation rates increased in the presence of carboxylic acids hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups but decreased in the presence of halogens aliphatic ethers methyl groups and ring structures in the chemical structure of the phacs in general simple aliphatic and monocyclic aromatic compounds are considered to be readily biodegradable while polycyclic structures are likely to be more persistent although the aromatic substituents may increase or decrease biodegradability tadkaew et al 2011 the electrophilic attack by oxygenases is considered to be the limiting step for aerobic biodegradation this is because the presence of electron withdrawing functional groups causes an electron deficiency that reduces the susceptibility of the compound to oxidation whereas electron donating groups have the opposite effect tadkaew et al 2011 conversely the presence of electron withdrawing groups facilitate reductive biotransformation under anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2018a complex structure phacs that contain straight chain hydrocarbons aromatic ethers and aryl ethers are biotransformable aerobically while heterocyclic n aromatic rings chlorine groups or fused aromatic rings are less susceptible to oxidation alvarino et al 2018a this is the case of dcf where the two chlorine atoms in the a ring are likely a reason for the recalcitrance of this compound kimura et al 2005 andreozzi et al 2006 steroid estrogens have a four ring molecular structure one aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group at the c3 position two cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring the hormones e1 e2 and ee2 are generally easily biotransformed under aerobic conditions where one pathway involves co metabolism of these aromatic rings with hydroxyl substituents by amo in aob alvarino et al 2018b chang and criddle 1997 after hydroxylation these rings can undergo open loop cleavage by key degradation enzymes and enter into the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate carbon dioxide and water cajthaml et al 2009 sih et al 1968 however synthetic estrogen ee2 has been reported to be more difficult to be biodegraded than natural estrogens e1 and e2 tiedeken et al 2017 due to the presence of an ethinyl group in the ee2 structure which makes it recalcitrant ternes et al 1999 macrolide biotransformation can be mediated by esterases erea and ereb see below or macrolide phosphotransferases mph which catalyse the cleavage of lactone rings leading to the formation of tp without antimicrobial activity kim et al 2002 noguchi et al 1995 o hara et al 1989 the size of this lactone ring has a direct impact on its degradability through these enzymes macrolides with 14 membered lactone rings e g ery and clr table 1 can be degraded by either erea or ereb while macrolides with 15 membered lactone rings e g azm can be degraded by ereb but not erea morar et al 2012 mph enzyme specificity is related to not only the size of the lactone ring but also the presence of a c3 cladinose moiety characteristic of many macrolides golkar et al 2018 2 4 biodegradation mechanisms of phacs and their transformation products tps many bacteria and fungi can efficiently biodegrade phacs bilal et al 2019a estrada arriaga and mijaylova 2010 grandclément et al 2017 margot et al 2013 krah et al 2016 assessed the biodegradation of several phacs in cell free lysates produced from sludge they found that most of the enzymes detected were hydrolases such as phosphatase β galactosidase β glucuronidase amongst others and oxidoreductases indeed many phacs are degraded by promiscuous i e broad substrate specificity oxidoreductase enzymes that catalyse oxidation and reduction reactions alneyadi et al 2018 khatoon et al 2017 krah et al 2016 martínez et al 2017 two mechanisms have been reported for the biotransformation of macrolides one mechanism is mediated by macrolide esterases ere and another by macrolide phosphotransferases mph fig 1 the ere mediated mechanism is initiated by esterase type i erea and esterase type ii ereb with hydrolysis of the lactone ring ester followed by a condensation reaction kim et al 2002 llorca et al 2016 the ere esterases have broad substrate specificity thus various antibiotics of the macrolide family including ery azm and clr are susceptible to hydrolysis by either erea ereb or both morar et al 2012 the mph mediated mechanism involves a phosphorylation step by macrolide 2 phosphotransferase golkar et al 2018 while it is unclear if the phosphorylated tp is further degraded mineralisation of ery has been observed by microbial cultures from aquaculture sediments displaying ere activity kim et al 2004 this shows that biodegradation can proceed after hydrolysis of the lactone ring until complete mineralisation of the macrolide it should be noted that these enzymatic biotransformation processes evolved as antibiotic resistance mechanisms some of the genes involved in these mechanisms e g erea type 2 and mph a b or c have been found in the mobile genetic elements of bacteria from various genera showing that they can be horizontally transferred between cells golkar et al 2018 kim et al 2004 thus in conventional wwtp processes that are dependent upon the activity of bacterial cells there would be a high risk of increasing and disseminating antibiotic resistance determinants which is clearly undesirable the risk of spreading antibiotic resistance to the environment could be reduced by using cell free lysates or enzyme extracts although this would certainly increase the cost and complexity of the treatment process the biodegradation of dcf can take place through various complex transformation pathways which can be predominantly explained by six reactions hydroxylation of the aromatic rings a and b intramolecular amidation de amidation sulphate conjugation of phenolic hydroxyl groups reductive dechlorination of the aromatic ring a oxidative ring opening of ring b and oxidation by dehydrogenation of phenolic moieties jewel et al 2016 four primary tps fig 2 have been detected in dcf biodegradation by activated sludge treatment processes bouju et al 2016 jewell et al 2016 kosjek et al 2009 via both nitrifying and heterotrophic organisms wu et al 2020 dcf lactam or 1 2 6 dichlorophenyl 1 3 dihydro 2h indol 2 one dcf tp1 table 1 4 hydroxy dcf dcf tp2 5 hydroxy dcf dcf tp3 and dcf benzoic acid dcf tp4 the hydroxylation of dcf can take place in multiple positions of either of the two aromatic rings resulting in other hydroxylated tps apart from dcf tp2 and 3 e g 3 hydroxy dcf dcf tp13 and 4 5 dihydroxy dcf dcf tp14 which were detected from surface water samples by scheurell et al 2009 4 hydroxy dcf has been reported as an unstable tp that further enters the dehydration pathway bouju et al 2016 and it can be followed by reductive dechlorination and amidation as described by jewell et al 2016 see fig 2 to give dcf tp11 table 1 the 5 hydroxy dcf can also be further transformed in ring opening reactions to give various forms of dcf tp12 table 1 apart from the hydroxylation pathway dcf can also form dcf lactam by direct amidation or decarboxylate into dcf benzoic acid some tps were further biodegraded by mixed activated sludge jewell et al 2016 or separate nitrifying and heterotrophic sludge wu et al 2020 but the subsequent tps were either not identified below the detection limit or mineralised glucuronated estrogens were found to be readily deconjugated in domestic wastewater d ascenzo et al 2003 in the majority of the studies assessing the subsequent conversion of estrogens e1 was reported as the primary product of both e2 and ee2 by oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the c17 position to a ketone group lee and liu 2002 wang et al 2019 yu et al 2007 several processes were proposed for the aerobic biotransformation of e1 it was suggested that biodegradation of e1 was initiated in ring d by wastewater sludge lee and liu 2002 with the formation of a labile lactone tp e tp1 table 1 which was cleaved and further degraded via the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway 1 in fig 3 in a study using rhodococcus sp and sphingomonas sp isolated from soil kurisu et al 2010 proposed a different mechanism where the degradation of e1 or e2 starts with the hydroxylation of the a ring at the c4 position pathway 2 in fig 3 based on the detection of the tps 4 oh e1 e pt2 in table 1 and 4 oh e2 e tp3 this step can either generate a dead end product pyridinestrone acid e tp4 or proceed with meta cleavage of the a ring as observed by chen et al 2018 using culture dependent and culture independent methods with activated sludge these metabolites are characteristic of the 4 5 seco pathway which was further elucidated by wu et al 2019 using sphingomonas sp strain kc8 isolated from a wwtp as model organism continuing on pathway 2 in fig 3 the mechanism involves coa where the c 4 of the meta cleavage product is removed via oxidative decarboxylation followed by the cleavage of the b ring through hydrolysis this product is then converted through β oxidation into e tp4 3aα h 4α 3 propanoate 7aβ methylhexahydro 1 5 indanedione or hip found to be a common tp of steroid degradation by bacteria hip degradation follows a central pathway encompassing ring cleavage which is well described horinouchi et al 2018 kurisu et al 2010 also proposed an alternative mechanism consisting of the hydroxylation of the saturated b ring in various positions e tp8 and 9 followed by ring cleavage into e tp10 pathway 3 in fig 3 the catabolic pathway of ee2 after initial conversion to e1 was also found to follow hydroxylation and cleavage of the b ring as described for pathway 3 above in a study using a sphingobacterium sp jcr5 isolated from activated sludge haiyan et al 2007 conversely in nitrifying sludge the ethinyl moiety of ee2 was not ketonised to generate e1 instead ammonia monooxygenase amo extracts were reported to start ee2 degradation by the opposite end through cleavage and hydroxylation of the a ring yi and harper 2007 biotransformation of ee2 by aob and heterotrophic cultures was studied by khunjar et al 2011 four tps were formed in aob chemostats namely 4 nitro ee2 2 nitro ee2 4 hydroxy ee2 and sulfo ee2 ee2 tp1 4 table 1 whereas heterotrophs could mineralise ee2 and most ee2 derived metabolites generated by aobs amongst these metabolites sulfo ee2 was found to be largely resistant to further biodegradation by surrounding heterotrophs these tps were also in agreement with those identified in the studies of gaulke et al 2008 yi and harper 2007 and skotnicka pitak et al 2009 recently efforts have been made to understand how microbial community structure and gene expression patterns determine the biotransformation of certain phacs by combining biotransformation analyses with characterization of the microbial communities using molecular data generated via meta omics methodologies i e metagenomics metatranscriptomics helbling et al 2012 johnson et al 2015 wolff et al 2018 for example in complex microbial communities achermann et al 2019 found proportional relationships between measured rate constants and associated gene transcripts additionally studies have also focused on establishing alternative metabolic routes in pure cultures through metabolic engineering of different strains performing gene knockouts to identify the tps and establish the role of the encoded enzymes in phac biodegradation chen et al 2017 horinouchi et al 2018 morar et al 2012 wu et al 2019 the applicability of such pathways and mechanisms beyond the isolates in which they were identified would be beneficial to establish in the future for e g wwtp sludges 2 5 identification and impact of tps microbial biotransformation of phacs ideally results in complete mineralization to co2 and h2o however in most of the cases phacs are biotransformed to tps which either are more polar less toxic and more easily biodegradable and in some cases can be further assimilated by other microbes present in the mixed activated sludge khunjar et al 2011 yi and harper 2007 or are potentially more hazardous than their parent compounds celiz et al 2009 escher and fenner 2011 thus identification of tps generated during the treatment processes is necessary to comprehensively assess the risk of phacs on aquatic ecosystems as discussed above the assessment of biotransformation products of phacs also provides a useful means to elucidate the biochemical pathway and enzymes involved alvarino et al 2018a quintana et al 2005 however the detection identification of tps remains challenging due to intrinsic difficulties in the analytical methods to detect and identify unknown compounds at such low concentrations lower even than the parent compounds in complex matrices of wastewater also there is a lack of available pure reference analytical standards and fast analytical methods for their detection and quantification in wastewater with the large number of phacs in wastewater a great number of unknown transformation products may be present in the final effluent of wwtps the advent of liquid and gas chromatography coupled with hybrid modern full spectrum acquisition high resolution tandem mass spectrometry hrms techniques such as q tof hrms q orbitrap ms new electrospray qqq fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry qqq ft icr ms or ion mobility quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry im q tof hrms etc are considered promising advanced analytical techniques for tp characterisation these techniques enable sensitive and untargeted detection of thousands of substances within short time frames creating many opportunities for the identification of unknown tps even when no reference standard is available with the advances in analytical technologies increasing numbers of tps have been described in detail evgenidou et al 2015 gulde et al 2016 helbling et al 2010 jaén gil et al 2018 jewell et al 2016 kern et al 2010 senta et al 2017 terzic et al 2018 yu et al 2019 a summary of the potential transformation products of the 7 target phacs is presented in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 several tps detected during biological treatment of dcf were described as being common amongst several studies e g bouju et al 2016 jewell et al 2016 langenhoff et al 2013 in some cases these tps are proposed rather than identified due to the aforementioned analytical challenges for example a laboratory hybrid mbbr study revealed that up to 20 diclofenac tps were detected jewell et al 2016 but amongst them only 4 tps were identified via analytical reference standards dcf lactam 4 hydroxy dcf 5 hydroxy dcf and dcf benzoic acid whereas 16 tentative structures were proposed based on ms ms fragmentation data similar tps were also found at full scale wwtps as compared to lab scale in this work while it is well established that dcf is toxic to many organisms including aquatic species and even higher organisms such as vultures lonappan et al 2016 the toxicity of its biotransformation products is still poorly understood grabarczyk et al 2020 recently tested the toxicity of one of dcf s primary tps 4 hydroxy dcf using an ecotoxicological test battery of five organisms of different biological organisations and they found that this tp still had a comparable level of toxicity towards some of the aquatic organisms regarding the large variety of tps that have been identified from dcf table 1 more studies are necessary to determine the potential ecotoxicological impact of other tps in receiving water bodies numerous macrolide transformation products have been determined in wwtps including tps of ery azm and clr senta et al 2017 the biotransformation of these three macrolide antibiotics by an enriched activated sludge culture and their toxicity was also studied by terzic et al 2018 in this study macrolide biotransformation was associated with 20 tps of azm 6 tps of ery and 6 tps of clr where the presence of some were later confirmed in a municipal wwtp in this study biodegradation of the investigated macrolides except for azm was mostly associated with a decreased residual antibiotic activity and algal toxicity however residual growth inhibition 15 30 of azm degradation was observed in concomitance with the emergence of some stable azm tps at the end of the experiment many of the tps associated with the estrogens listed in table 1 have been identified in wwtp effluents the a ring of estrogens has been found to be mainly responsible for their estrogenicity anstead et al 1997 thus ring hydroxylation and cleavage can reduce estrogenicity by a factor of 200 500 huber et al 2004 nevertheless some of the hydroxylated tps were reported to increase carcinogenicity as compared to its parent compound getoff et al 2010 turan et al 2004 such as e1 tp2 4 hydroxyestrone in general the tps of phacs remains an understudied topic with only limited understanding of its impact on the risk associated with the environmental release of most tps also many tps were detected but their identification remains unconfirmed due to detection at low concentrations without available reference standards the potentially important role of tps in environmental risk assessment of wastewater effluent should not be understated and further efforts are required to assess their impact 2 6 biodegradation kinetics the kinetics of biodegradation is often the critical parameter that determines the extent of transformation of phacs in biological processes compounds that are biotransformed at a rate that is too slow are likely washed out of the system before transformation effectively takes place a useful measure of this rate is given by the phac biodegradation rate constant or kbio defined by the following pseudo first order equation joss et al 2006 1 d c d t k b i o x s s s where c is the total compound concentration μg l 1 s the soluble compound concentration μg l 1 t the time d k bio the reaction rate constant l gss 1 d 1 and xss the suspended solids concentration gss l 1 according to the derived biotransformation rate constants kbio l gss d phacs have been classified into three groups joss et al 2006 compounds with kbio 0 1 l gss d are not transformed to a significant extent 20 compounds with kbio 10 l gss d are transformed by 90 compounds in between 0 1 l gss d kbio 10l gss d are moderately transformed while this general classification scheme is useful to characterize the biodegradability of phacs the true extent of biotransformation is strongly influenced by the reactor configuration and operational conditions as also highlighted by joss et al 2006 in particular the hydraulic residence time hrt will control the contact time between microorganisms and phac and the solids retention time srt will control the selection of organisms that are able to transform these compounds while other parameters can also impact biotransformation efficiency e g ph temperature etc we will focus mainly on analyzing the impact of hrt and srt on phac biotransformation in wwtps in this review due to their key importance impacting both the fate of phacs and process operation 3 wwtp processes for phac biodegradation the biodegradation of phacs has been evaluated through numerous wwtp technologies with various operational strategies below the relative effectiveness of these different approaches are discussed 3 1 conventional activated sludge cas factors influencing the biodegradation of phacs in cas include the redox conditions imposed or operational parameters such as hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt as discussed below temperature can also affect microbial growth and activity however several studies have focused on the effect of temperature on the biodegradation of phacs göbel et al 2007 hai et al 2011 suárez et al 2005 but no direct relationship has been observed in these studies 3 1 1 effect of redox conditions the impact of redox conditions e g aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions has been extensively studied on the biodegradation of phacs alvarino et al 2016a falas et al 2016 joss et al 2004 stadler et al 2015 suárez et al 2010 it has been shown that the availability of different electron acceptors e g oxygen nitrate or others influences the biotransformation rate of phacs tables s2 and s3 si in general it has been observed that biodegradation rates for phacs under aerobic conditions was faster than anaerobic and anoxic rates joss et al 2004 suárez et al 2010 more specifically the biotransformation rate of endocrine disrupting chemicals e1 e2 ee2 dcf and ery were found to be higher under aerobic nitrification conditions phan et al 2014 suárez et al 2010 natural estrogens e1 and e2 were recalcitrant under anaerobic but highly biodegraded under aerobic and anoxic processes ery and ee2 were found to be highly biodegradable under aerobic conditions and persistent in anoxic conditions fernandez fontaina et al 2012 ma et al 2018 suárez et al 2010 dcf has been shown to be very persistent during treatment under anoxic conditions biodegradation efficiency of 2 but a much higher biodegradation efficiency was observed under aerobic conditions by slow growing nitrifying bacteria after acclimatization 51 80 fernandez fontaina et al 2012 yang et al 2011 suarez et al 2010 others have found dcf to be recalcitrant degradation efficiencies 20 under both aerobic and anoxic conditions zwiener 2000 although as noted below the srt also plays a key role in microbial selection burke et al 2014 found that clr was readily biodegradable under anoxic conditions and recalcitrant aerobically although similar biodegradation rates of clr were observed under anoxic conditions and aerobic conditions by falas et al 2013 the simultaneous influence of multiple operational parameters as well as the resulting differences in the microbial community structure likely play a significant role in relating the effectiveness of phac biotransformation with the electron acceptor condition overall different redox conditions impact the biodegradation of phacs differently as highlighted above for the selected compounds aerobic biodegradation appears to be most effective particularly due to activity by nitrifiers where the presence of anoxic and anaerobic zones that facilitate denitrification and biological phosphorus removal are unlikely to provide substantial benefit to biotransformation 3 1 2 sludge retention time srt numerous studies have stressed the significant impact of srt on phac biotransformation clara et al 2005a petrie et al 2014a stasinakis et al 2010 suárez et al 2012 generally showing that longer srts were of high importance for enriching slow growing organisms such as nitrifiers that are capable of phac biotransformation tables s2 and s3 si in some studies critical srts must be met e g 10 days at 10 c for e1 and e2 for efficient biodegradation clara et al 2005a or 20 days at 19 c for biotransformation of dcf in wwtps plósz et al 2012 or even up to 60 80 days for ery göbel et al 2007 lishman et al 2006 total estrogen biodegradation increased from 70 7 to 94 1 when srt increased from 3 days to 10 days but no improvement was observed when srt was increased from 10 to 27 days petrie et al 2014b fernandez fontaina et al 2012 found a correlation between srt and the dcf biodegradation efficiency which is in agreement with other studies clara et al 2005a lishman et al 2006 the biodegradation of this compound increased from 15 to 70 when srt was increased to above 150 days where supposedly that long residence time facilitated the development of more diverse bacterial communities with ability to carry out the compound biodegradation increases in biodegradation efficiencies of clr and ery up to 90 were also observed at high srt of 60 80 d supposedly due to an increased biodiversity of the active biomass and a broader range of degradation pathways at long srt göbel et al 2007 as mentioned high srts facilitate the enrichment of slow growing bacteria consequently this establishes a more diverse microbial community with broader physiological capabilities e g non constitutive enzyme expression compared to wwtps operating at low srts clara et al 2005a moreover high srts may induce k strategist organisms that are capable of efficiently utilizing scarce resources or mixed substrates at low concentration e g poorly degradable phacs de la torre et al 2015 koh et al 2009 vuono et al 2015 several studies reported that micropollutant biotransformation is favorable under such oligotrophic conditions drewes et al 2014 while an activated sludge system operated at prolonged srts generally correlates with enhanced biodegradation of some phacs göbel et al 2007 kimura et al 2007 kovalova et al 2012 several studies found little or no statistical relationship between biodegradation rates of phacs including natural estrogens and dcf and srt clara et al 2005a falas et al 2016 fernandez fontaina et al 2013 gaulke et al 2009 hashimoto et al 2007 helbling et al 2012 this could be attributed to a similar presence of bacteria capable of biodegrading the selected pharmaceuticals at both short and long srts overall while long srts are generally favourable to the biodegradation of phacs there are clear practical implications limiting the application of excessive srts in most situations it is not feasible to implement srts in cas 30d long srt can negatively impact the selection of organisms important for other macropollutant conversion processes and can also cause unwanted sludge build up and lower biogas generation also prolonged sludge age might even create favourable conditions for the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance to the environment kümmerer et al 2019 extension of srts to a certain extent can favourably impact the microbial selection of the system e g nitrifier abundance but the knowledge generated from cas operation at very high srts tends to underscore the relevance of systems that employ biomass retention e g mbrs biofilm reactors like mbbr that can serve a similar purpose of enriching a slow growing and diverse community of microorganisms 3 1 3 hydraulic residence time hrt the hrt also impacts the biodegradation of phacs tables s2 and s3 si a decrease in biodegradation efficiency of ery from 94 to 57 was observed when hrt decreased from 3 6d to 1d respectively supposedly due to the kinetic limitations at higher loading rates of the compound fernandez fontaina et al 2012 zhou et al 2013a reported biodegradation efficiencies of clr and ery varying from 22 to 68 in plant a and from 64 93 in plant b where a longer aeration time and hrt employed in plant b was suggested to result in higher biodegradation of these macrolides in a pilot scale activated sludge process increased biodegradation of ee2 from 41 to 65 was observed when hrt increased from 8h to 24h respectively petrie et al 2014b improved degradation of phacs in systems with longer hrt has been attributed to i a decrease in food to microorganism f m ratio that led to the selection of k strategist populations under substrate limitation that biodegraded less favourable carbon substrates and ii increased contact time between wastewater contaminants and sludge which may be beneficial for the slowly biodegradable phacs koh et al 2009 petrie et al 2014a it should be pointed out that some studies have not found any correlation between hrt and biodegradation efficiencies statistical correlations linking hrt and phac biodegradation were not established for dcf bernhard et al 2006 or natural estrogens hashimoto et al 2007 gros et al 2010 linked degradation rates with hrt of wwtps in spain and demonstrated that in most cases compounds with high pseudo first order degradation rate constants high kbio and low sludge water distribution coefficient kd values or low tendency to adsorb to sewage sludge are more influenced by hrt where hrt does not influence the biodegradation efficiency of compounds which are poorly biodegradable with low kbio substances that have low kbio and high kd are more influenced by srt due to the impact of adsorption the relatively low biodegradability of dcf as compared to estrogens and the observed higher impact of hrt on estrogens as compared to dcf is consistent with their hypothesis overall the combination of both hrt and srt is of importance to phac degradation not only with respect to adsorption impacts but also microbial selection of phac degraders short hrt implies that more wastewater can be treated per reactor volume unit as compared to long hrt systems thus larger reactors are needed in long hrt operated processes leading to high capital costs recent trends towards the establishment of high rate wastewater treatment processes for reducing or eliminating wwtp energy demands which tend to favour low srt and hrt processes appear to be at odds with strategies to enhance phac biotransformation this suggests that alternative strategies for polishing wastewater effluents e g advanced oxidation processes biofiltration etc may be required for such high rate wwtps if phacs become subject to regulation recently taboada santos et al 2020 has shown lower kbio estimates for dcf ee2 and ery in a high rate process as compared to cas though this was not generally applicable for other phacs studied such as e1 and e2 which were comparable further evaluations of phac biodegradation in high rate activated sludge processes would be beneficial 3 2 membrane bioreactors mbr mbrs have gained attention with respect to phac degradation due to the advantages found for some phacs only partially degraded during cas processes besides physical retention by the membrane adsorption and subsequent biodegradation of the micropollutants have been considered as the main degradation processes in general mbrs are effective for the degradation of hydrophobic and readily biodegradable phacs whilst less effective in degrading hydrophilic and biologically persistent phacs clara et al 2005b nguyen et al 2012 tadkaew et al 2011 hydrophobic phacs can be readily adsorbed in mbrs particularly to the cake layer formed on the membrane sorption capacity is also dependent on the physico chemical characteristics of the membrane used hydrophobic membranes e g polyethersulfone membranes are able to retain lipophilic phacs whereas charged membranes can retain phacs by electrostatic interactions and no significant retention of phacs are found within the hydrophilic and neutrally charged membranes alvarino et al 2018b the degradation efficiency of phacs by mbrs is influenced by i operational conditions such as srt biomass concentration temperature redox conditions ph conductivity ii wastewater constituents iii membrane characteristics and also iv molecular weight hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and complexity of the phacs besha et al 2017 goswami et al 2018 while operation at prolonged srt is facilitated by mbrs the high biomass concentrations can stimulate the utilization of multiple substrates at low concentration kovarova kovar et al 1998 thomas 2015 as a result of the low food to microorganism f m ratio overall mbr have been observed to be superior to cas in several situations particularly for estrogens such as e1 and e2 tables s2 and s3 si this is typically due to the greater sorption in mbrs which can provide increased contact time with microorganisms that can in some cases enhance biodegradation and the long srt that can often be employed in mbrs which enhances the growth of slow growing organisms that can degrade phacs while advantages can be achieved for mbrs vs cas for these reasons significant increases in the kinetic rates of biotransformations for difficult to degrade phacs like dcf fig 4 are unlikely to be realised in mbrs 3 3 biofilm systems attached growth processes in which a microbial community forms on a surface of an inert carrier have also been investigated for the biodegradation of phacs the carriers can be either fixed fixed bed bioreactors or mobilized in suspension e g moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr fluidized bed bioreactors different biofilm systems have been reported as effective tools to biodegrade some recalcitrants such as dcf escolà casas and bester 2015 reungoat et al 2011 trickling filters were reported as a much less efficient process for the removal of dcf and ery compared to cas due to their low biomass generation leading to lower adsorption and biodegradation kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 in contrast amongst biofilm processes mbbr has been proposed as a promising alternative technology to cas due to its ability to degrade a broad spectrum of phacs at higher rates per unit of biomass escolà casas et al 2015 falås et al 2012 torresi et al 2016 zupanc et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 for more readily biodegradable compounds such as e1 and e2 the advantage of mbbrs over cas or mbrs is less see table s2 si indeed the estrogens have presented kbio coefficients substantially higher than dcf or macrolides in cas and mbr systems since relatively high biodegradation efficiencies have been observed for estrogens in cas and mbrs most research has focussed on applying mbbrs to biodegrade more recalcitrant phacs in mbbr systems the use of submerged low density plastic polypropylene carriers allows the development of active slow growing bacteria and a diverse microbial group of microorganisms due to the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones within the biofilm which can potentially promote various phac biotransformation routes under different redox conditions alvarino et al 2018a falås et al 2012 torresi et al 2016 found a strong correlation between biodegradation rate coefficient kbio with biodiversity expressed by shannon and evenness indices which was associated with biofilm thickness for some recalcitrant compounds higher first order rate constants for not only dcf but also azm and clr were observed in mbbrs as compared to cas and mbr fig 4 this highlights how biofilm systems can facilitate the application of lower hrts to achieve similar biodegradation efficiencies göbel et al 2007 joss et al 2005 thus enabling a smaller footprint a concern related to the use of mbbr is the decrease of sludge settleability when treating high strength wastewater which can be overcome by using membrane filtration luo et al 2015 a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor membrane bioreactor mbbr mbr system luo et al 2015 has been developed and exhibited higher biodegradation of estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 though no improvement in dcf biodegradation as compared to a conventional mbr in another study de la torre et al 2015 compared an integrated fixed film activated sludge mbr ifas mbr a moving bed membrane biofilm reactor mb mbr an mbr and a cas system the ifas mbr showed the best overall performance where long srts were found to be critical for the success of the ifas mbr due to better acclimation of the biomass and selection of microorganisms to metabolise the poorly degradable compounds at substrate limiting conditions de la torre et al 2015 in general biofilm processes particularly mbbrs or ifas are considered as a potentially superior technology to cas and mbr for enhancing elimination of a broad spectrum of phacs that usually occur in wwtps escolà casas et al 2015 vieno and sillanpää 2014 zupanc et al 2013 especially for the biodegradation of more recalcitrant compounds such as dcf and some antibiotics hybrid processes based on mbbrs or ifas have the capacity to provide additional advantages though the requirement to couple these systems with mbrs may be a niche application as biomass retention by mbbr or ifas is likely to be sufficient in many cases without the need for the additional costs associated with mbr operation investigations into biodegradation mechanisms can be quite complex in mbbrs or ifas but warrant further study due to the promising nature of the technology 3 4 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cws are a biologically land based engineered wastewater treatment system that consists of shallow ponds beds or trenches that contain floating or rooted wetland vegetation to mimic the natural wetland process within a more controlled environment matamoros and bayona 2008 the system has been commonly used for secondary domestic sewage effluent treatment as a polishing step gorito et al 2017 in the past decade cws has been studied more extensively for the degradation of phacs due to its eco friendliness simplicity in operation and maintenance as a low cost alternative to cas in cw systems the pollutant degradation takes place by the combination of three main processes i e physical chemical and biological degradation amid plants substrate and soil through e g volatilization sorption sedimentation phytodegradation plant uptake accumulation as well as microbial biodegradation song et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 degradation of phacs by constructed wetlands has been reported to be affected by many factors such as the designed configuration soil substrate matrix selection of the plant species etc for example surface flow cws show better performance for compounds susceptible to photodegradation because water can be directly exposed to sunlight or indirect photolysis mediated by photogenerated radicals other than hydroxyl whereas subsurface flow cws have a higher potential to eliminate biodegradable compounds because higher interactions between wastewater soil plants and microorganisms are promoted gorito et al 2017 song et al 2009 examined the effect of sand depth with phragmites australis in a vertical flow wetland as a polishing step of a wwtp for the degradation of estrogens e1 e2 and ee2 the highest degradation efficiency of 67 8 28 0 84 0 15 4 and 75 3 17 6 for e1 e2 and ee2 respectively was achieved by the shallowest wetland amongst the three cws with different filter layer depths i e 7 5 30 and 60 cm the higher degradation of estrogens in the shallow wetland was attributed to the higher oxygenation of a shallow bed and faster biodegradation under aerobic conditions in another study better degradation of dcf was observed i with subsurface vertical flow with a gravel bed average of 47 6 compared to horizontal flow average of 9 6 and ii in cws in the presence of plant genera phragmites 25 9 compared to typha 1 7 rabello et al 2019 different plant species can effectively remove some selectively targeted phacs while hybrids harbouring different species could be more efficient in degrading a wide range of phacs in wastewater rabello et al 2019 by using statistical analyses rabello et al 2019 found that the hrt had a significant positive correlation with the average degradation rate of dcf chen et al 2014 also found that degradation efficiency of estrogens e1 and e2 increased with increasing hrt in general cws showed good performance towards the degradation of the 7 selected phacs the reason could be attributed to the coexistence of different physicochemical conditions and different plant species in the natural systems which allow different biodegradation pathways of phacs hijosa valsero et al 2010 another reason could also be due to a smaller load of phacs when cws are implemented as a tertiary polishing step after a conventional secondary process such as cas the estrogens would appear to be the only case where lower degradation efficiencies are observed qiang et al 2013 although these compounds tend to be highly degraded in cas and are unlikely to be abundant at the tertiary stage this suggests that cws could be a potential alternative biological technology for the degradation of phacs from wastewater especially as a polishing step in a sustainable and low cost manner although they rely on the availability of large land areas in addition conventional treatment plants coupled with cws is considered as a more efficient strategy to remove phacs and reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes as compared to cas alone the main challenge for cws in addition to their footprint appears to be the more inconsistent degradation efficiency potentially leading to reliability challenges table s2 one of the key factors that controls the performance of cws for phac degradation is oxygen transfer limitation enhanced biodegradation of phacs can be achieved in engineered wetlands that employ active aeration rather than those relying solely on diffusive transport of oxygen ilyas and van hullebusch 2020 kahl et al 2017 this also enabled the establishment of various microenvironments with different redox conditions aerobic and anaerobic which facilitated the contribution of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways to biodegradation further studies are required to understand better the transformation mechanism as well as optimized conditions to stabilize the degradation efficiencies of phacs 4 discussion and perspectives the compounds analysed in this review have been identified as the priority phacs for the eu watch list due to their negative effect on human health and wildlife as well as their recalcitrance to biodegradation in natural systems since the majority of wwtps rely in great part on biological processes it is important to develop a deep understanding of the processes that successfully transform them at least to a less toxic form as well as the molecular mechanisms underpinning these processes from the analysis of a large volume of publications in recent years on these topics we identified promising advances and some challenges where research should now focus while there is deep knowledge available on the metabolic pathways and tps including the enzymes involved and encoding genes a lot of this knowledge is based on pure cultures in lab tests the trend in the future should encompass the validation of these findings in full scale mixed culture processes enzyme inhibition co metabolism and substrate competition are also important aspects to investigate further in this context the large advances in chemical analytical techniques in the last decade has enabled the detection of tps at very low concentrations however the lack of analytical standards for many of these tps and the simultaneous occurrence of multiple metabolic pathways from a high number of phacs in real wwtps make the assessment of these compounds highly challenging molecular techniques applying e g labelled substrates or omics technologies are promising approaches to overcome some of the challenges towards a better understanding of the biological mechanisms taking place in wwtp linking these degradation mechanisms with toxicological impacts regarding the tps formed also requires further effort indeed such ecotoxicological effects of phacs and their tps as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance from wastewater effluents are key aspects requiring control to minimise negative environmental impacts further research on phac biodegradation should also include all forms of the targeted compounds conjugates and transformation products to avoid overestimation underestimation of removal efficiencies greater understanding of the flux of phacs and their tps and their link with wwtp process technologies is also needed to minimise overall toxicity of the treated effluent while variations in biodegradation efficiency have been reported for all treatment processes discussed in section 3 in general the proposed technologies mbbr mbr and cws possess several advantages over cas with the potential for comparable or improved phac degradation nevertheless further study directly comparing the efficacy of biodegradation and kbio coefficients of cas mbr mbbr and cw with the same real wastewater would be beneficial to improve our understanding of how wwtp technology influences phac degradation one advantage of mbbr mbr and cw over cas relates to the reduction of excess sludge production this is particularly helpful with respect to phacs as final sludge disposal may not be suitable for agricultural purposes as restrictions towards land application of sludge continue to become more stringent worldwide due to contamination by phacs and other micropollutants mbrs are considered as a superior alternative to cas in phac biodegradation besha et al 2017 dharupaneedi et al 2019 goswami et al 2018 however there are still some phacs that are poorly biotransformed or recalcitrant e g dcf in mbrs beier et al 2011 hai et al 2011 kim et al 2007 quintana et al 2005 tadkaew et al 2010 the main advantages of mbr over cas is the capacity to work with high srt that facilitate the biotransformation of slowly biodegradable phac compared to cas also mbr can produce a high quality treated effluent that meets sensitive discharge standards with less sludge production and small space requirement however the shortcomings of membrane processes are the membrane fouling high investment and operation costs inconsistent degradation of polar and recalcitrant phacs as well as moderately high energy consumption luo et al 2014 for these reasons some have criticised the use of mbrs as an alternative technology to cas for improving phac degradation lesjean et al 2011 overall it appears that mbrs can have a similar or enhanced effectiveness as compared to cas for phac degradation though it is not necessarily the most cost effective option mbbr and hybrid systems incorporating similar biofilm systems tend to yield more efficient biodegradation of some antibiotics and dcf fig 4 mbbr systems could also be potentially implemented as an end of pipe polishing step for the effluent of existing wwtps and operated independently of the secondary treatment process of the main wwtps also the low cod values typically achieved in the effluent of mbbrs make it suitable to be combined with ozonation escolà casas et al 2015 or uv photolysis for further treatment mbbrs also have the potential to be an attractive alternative for new wwtps as a secondary treatment step in addition compared to cas mbbr allows higher effective srt lower hrt lower sludge production are more resilient to toxic shock loads and require a smaller land area for construction the main disadvantage is the difficulty in controlling the biofilm thickness a number of hybrid processes involving mbbrs also appear to be promising for future applications constructed wetlands offer a simple design with cost effective operation and a high buffer capacity for hydraulic and organic load fluctuations they are also advantageous for lowering the threat of spreading antibiotic resistance bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment chen and zhang 2013 chen et al 2019 2016 hijosa valsero et al 2010 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 while not as effective for estrogen biodegradation current wwtps that operate a cas system may find cws effective as a post treatment or polishing step of the wastewater effluent where estrogens are typically not the main problem as they are more effectively degraded in cas however applications of cws requires large space and is normally suitable for decentralised wastewater treatment for small communities ilyas and masih 2017 nevertheless future applications of cws can be extended as a result of good treatment efficiency for a wide range of phacs with cost effective operation as compared to other high cost treatments like mbrs ultrafiltration and advanced oxidation processes etc cost benefit analyses comparing various wastewater polishing strategies would be beneficial where conventional and novel high rate wwtp process designs that appear susceptible to low phac biotransformations would be of interest to examine further in this regard however the question is do we need to replace existing cas by alternative biological processes mbr mbbr hybrid systems etc in order to improve the removal efficiency of phacs and meet new emerging standards the answer to this question is undoubtedly related to the final effluent discharge location and the purpose of any potential reuse applications while there is no best solution for all cases as each phac reacts differently in each treatment process we must prioritise and target the removal of certain compounds we have chosen those emerging contaminants highlighted by the eu directives in this review though clearly this list will change over time when infrastructure is already in place for wwtp it would be costly to recreate treatment train solutions for enhancing phac removal optimisation of operational conditions in cas should still be pursued where hrt srt and combinations of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions are the most frequently studied ways to improve phac degradation it has been suggested that bacterial species and production of their enzymes in wwtp can be selectively optimised to treat phacs through adjustment of conditions such as aeration bains et al 2019 this implies improving phac treatment performance of wwtps by applying environmental stresses to stimulate overproduction of beneficial phac degrading enzymes alternative bioprocess technologies can also be considered for augmenting phac degradation enzymatic treatment technologies e g immobilised enzyme reactors for phac biodegradation have also been proposed laccases and horseradish peroxidases have been found to efficiently catalyse the transformation of a variety of phacs including estrogens and dcf auriol et al 2008 bilal et al 2019b garcía galán et al 2020 lloret et al 2013 alternatively microalgae have also been found to be able to degrade estrogens like e2 and ee2 and could be a beneficial treatment step hom diaz et al 2015 the role of such bioprocesses as potential polishing steps could provide additional alternatives for wwtps while the impact of biological processes on phacs is of high importance their relationship with new and existing primary and tertiary treatment to control the degradation of a wide range of contaminants of emerging concern needs further study in order to comply with high water quality standards for reclamation many physical and chemical treatment processes show effective phac degradation such as adsorption by granular activated carbon gac or advanced oxidation processes aops uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 mf ro these treatments often require a polishing step e g biofiltration to eliminate bioavailable oxidation products and particles eggen et al 2014 reungoat et al 2012 sgroi et al 2017 a multi barrier approach in which advanced tertiary treatment processes are employed in combination with biological processes is promising roccaro 2018 overall in terms of selecting an adequate biotechnology for dealing with phacs the cost environmental impact feasibility reliability operational difficulty and sludge production associated are important considerations that will impact process selection the implementation of hybrid biological technologies should also be considered as an alternative to combine the advantages of multiple processes for

an additional treatment step such as activated carbon adsorption grandclément et al 2017 the development of decision support tools would be of high benefit for analysing the degradation efficiency of both conventional pollutants and phacs through different treatment solutions and offer a means to evaluate the performance of each solution based on specific user requirements and objectives using

17401,the efficiency of multi strain planktonic flocs of bacteria as biocatalytic agents in aqueous media depends to a considerable extent on their three dimensional aggregation patterns yet numerical methodologies for full characterization of such heterogeneous biomass structures are largely missing in this work we present a descriptive methodology for quantitatively portraying and identifying suspended cell clumps formed by planktonic bacteria in order to benchmark the procedure we tackled the behavior of cells of the environmental and biotechnologically robust species pseudomonas putida whose surfaces were decorated with genetically encoded adhesins upon induction such adhesins promoted specific inter bacterial attachment leading to controllable and tractable floc formation in suspension microscopy and flow cytometry data were then gathered and further analyzed by means of a distinct metric set applying these parameters permitted creating comparable clumping footprints for every sample at both single cell and population level the hereby described approach provides a rigorous frame for following the assembly and organization of complex microbial communities as planktonic

introduction exploitation of bacterial consortia as biocatalytic agents for industrial applications and environmental cleanup is gaining relevance as a preferred strategy to cope with the increasing complexity of these processes brenner et al 2008 mee and wang 2012 song et al 2014 metabolically active communities often avoid biological bottlenecks such as biochemical burdening or intracellular toxicity and adjust catalytic output by modifying their relative composition zhou et al 2015 the main characteristic of interest of a microbial consortium is in fact the division of labor among the different microorganisms involved to perform a complex biochemical transformation yet in many cases the success of a consortium depends not only of the composition of the partnership itself but also of the relative spatial arrangement that their components exhibit bernstein et al 2012 tecon and or 2017 the physical chemical balance established between the consortium and the environment i e mass transport and chemical reactions lead not to an arbitrary but a specific physical arrangement of the individuals lindemann et al 2016 oliveira et al 2015 xavier et al 2009 these equilibrium points are in many cases neither optimal nor interesting configurations from an engineering point of view because the poor flexibility and or stability offered by them do not allow a fine control on the system under this scenario artificially decoupling spatial arrangement from cell fitness appear as a promising alternative to overcome such limitations in fact the problem of controlling the assembly of a microbial community at microscopic level following a designed pattern has recently gained considerable attention lindemann et al 2016 mccarty et al 2019 theoretical dzianach et al 2019 and experimental mccarty et al 2019 approaches are rapidly being developed to gain a high degree of control in biofilm modulation for high technological applications such as the development of bio abiotic hybrid materials wang et al 2018 the use of a 3d printing approach to create structures a la carte with customized disposition of the consortium components is currently under development connell et al 2013 haagensen et al 2015 also modification of surfaces to limit bacterial allocation expands the tools for engineering microbial consortia feng et al 2015 in this sense various strategies have been proposed in recent years to purposely redesign the attachment properties of individual cells in microbial cultures for the sake of enhancing their capacity to catalyze chemical transformations jia et al 2016 these include chemical bonding adhesin libraries to control local interactions glass and riedel kruse 2018 outer signaling to externally gaining control of the attachment e g light switches chen and wegner 2017 and metabolite restriction complementation to generate strain patterns lindemann et al 2016 although these contributions provide many tools for community assembly and helped to understand the dynamics of bacterial aggregation they are also afflicted by a dearth of metrics to characterize physical features of the formed aggregates fig 1 shows one example of the morphological fig 1a and strain combination fig 1b variability that can be originated during floc generation although similar in terms of biomass content number of cells their differences in geometric assembly and composition may have an effect in the physical properties of flocs such as diffusivity settling velocity or stability fig 1c in sum whether naturally occurring or resulting from genetic engineering a rigorous quantitative description of the 3d structure of bacterial aggregates in suspension is virtually missing this work tries to fill this gap by developing a rigorous numerical metrics to accurately characterize the aggregation of bacterial flocs in aqueous suspension to this end we adopted an experimental system that allows controllable formation of inter cell aggregates rather than spontaneous formation of bacterial groups specifically we rely on an improved engineered platform strain pseudomonas putida em371 that was purposely modified for serving as an optimized chassis for surface display of artificial adhesins this was made by removing many non essential bulky structures associated to the outer membrane and leaving a smooth cell envelope well suited for presentation of genetically encoded adhesins martínez garcía et al 2020 as shown below flocs of different strains of e coli and p putida em371 ectopically displaying matching pairs of fos jun leucine zippers veiga et al 2003 as artificial adhesins were analyzed with various optical and cytometric methods the data was then processed to obtain information about the aggregate variability exhibited by every sample thereby solving rigorously assembly structure relationships of the bacterial flocs the presented methodology thus provides a reliable charter to characterize aggregation of planktonic bacteria 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains plasmids and culture media the list of bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are shown in supplementary table 1 bacteria were grown overnight in either lb medium 10 g l tryptone 5 g l yeast extract and 5 g l nacl for sample dilution and preparation m9 minimal media without carbon source was used p putida cells were incubated at 30 c while e coli at 37 c the following chemicals were added when required 5 µg ml gentamicin 25 µg ml kanamycin 40 µg ml chloramphenicol 0 5 mm iptg or 1 mm 3 methyl benzoate 3 mb 2 2 experimental set up of aggregation tests to analyze cellular aggregation we performed two types of experiments see fig 2 in the first case early stationary overnight cultures grown in 10 ml test tubes with 3 ml of lb with the appropriate antibiotics were adjusted to an optical density od600 of 0 35 in 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml of the same culture medium the production of the recombinant adhesins was induced with the addition of 3 mb or iptg for p putida or e coli respectively then cells were incubated during 4 h at 30 c p putida and 37 c e coli next cultures were diluted with m9 minimal medium without carbon source and blended with the cognate pair when appropriate in round tissue culture dishes 35 10 mm falcon reaching a final volume of 4 ml in every sample with od600 values of 1 then culture dishes were incubated without stirring for 30 min at room temperature after that samples were collected by using 1 ml head cut tips to minimize perturbation of aggregates finally 200 µl of the suspension was used for the flow cytometer while 500 µl for the microscope analysis for the second type of experiment late stationary cells were grown overnight in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml of lb then cultures were diluted to an od600 of 0 1 in 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml of lb and let them grow for 5 h at either 30 c p putida and 37 c e coli cells were next induced with 3 mb or iptg for p putida or e coli respectively and incubated overnight at same temperature that the one used during induction step thus cultures mixed with the cognate pair when appropriate were diluted to get an od600 of 1 in 4 ml of m9 minimal medium without carbon source in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks then bacterial cultures were incubated for 30 min at 30 c and shaken at 160 rpm finally samples were collected and analyzed as indicated previously for the first protocol 2 3 flow cytometry and analyses collected samples from the aggregation experiments were first diluted with m9 minimal medium without carbon source into a 2 ml eppendorf tube to obtain an od600 0 1 then samples were processed using a macsquant vyb flow cytometer miltenyi biotech before processing samples the voltage gains of forward scatter fsc and side scatter ssc channels of the cytometer were adjusted by using a flow cytometer size calibration kit f13838 thermofisher to fit the area based forward scatter signal fsca within the measurable range of the particles included in the calibration kit 2 15 µm of diameter the maximum upper value for the evolving diameter of any processed floc did not exceed 100 µm in any case due to technical limitations of the measuring device the uptake volume of flow cytometer was set to 100 µl and samples processed at a flow rate of 25 µl min also we included a rinsing step by injecting 4875 µl of washing buffer thermofisher between each measurement to ensure a proper cleaning of the cytometer fluidic circuit each experiment was performed by measuring a total of three biological replicates the fsca and ssca data was stored as csv format using flowjo flowjo v 10 llc and further imported to matlab the mathworks for consequent analysis 2 4 microscopy and image analysis to visualize cellular aggregation the 500 µl sample obtained as described in the 2 2 section was carefully mixed with 500 µl of 2 w v tempered m9 agarose 50 ⁰c without carbon source into a test tube and a 250 µl aliquot was immediately transferred into a 35 mm µ dish ibidi and to let it solidify at room temperature then samples were inspected using a confocal multispectral leica tcs sp8 system with a 100 0 5x oil immersion objective using 488 and 561 nm laser lines to detect gfp and mcherry fluorescent signals respectively images were captured using a 3x amplification factor with a z step of 0 5 µm using an 8 bit resolution and a frequency rate of 600 hz a minimum number of 2 biological repetitions with at least 500 individual aggregates per experiment were processed to obtain statistical information virtual reconstruction of bacterial aggregates was performed using imaris software v 10 bitplane by applying manual thresholding to obtained image stacks in order to obtain for every detected cell its mass center position spatial orientation axial direction and total length this data was imported as comma separated value csv files to be finally loaded in matlab for deep geometrical analysis i e color ratio connectivity radius of gyration number of particles 2 5 computational scripts matlab based scripts used to process data and retrieve proposed metrics together with small data samples both fc and cslm pretreated data are freely available under mit license and can be downloaded from the following link https github com drespeso flocsampler 3 results the aim of this work was to quantitatively characterize bacterial aggregation and to identify a set of metrics that describe that process this phenomenon typically comprises the rearrangement of bacterial biomass from an individual planktonic state into a cluster shaped organization such a process contains relevant structural information at two different scales the features of the formed aggregates as individual entities and the characteristics of the resulting clumped state as a whole population in that way a set of experiments were planned to acquire details about them using flow cytometry fc and confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm measurements respectively experimental protocols followed to perform the aggregation assays and the subsequent data processing to retrieve information about clustering patterns in bacteria are schematically represented in figs 2 3 and 5 and detailed in the materials and method section 3 1 deep characterization of aggregating patterns by flow cytometry assay flow cytometry is frequently used to gather information related with individual cell morphology and inner granularity by measuring the forward scatter area fsca and side scatter area ssca parameters respectively kerker 1983 these parameters are sensible enough to detect subtle changes in light scattering patterns produced by morphologically different type of cells when targeted with a laser beam nevertheless measurements performed in cultures containing cellular aggregates should result in fluctuations over single cell cultures of the fsca and ssca distribution mainly caused by the structural variability of the flocs present in the sample previous works beloin et al 2008 mclean et al 2008 tomich and mohr 2003 had already worked around this idea but to a certain extent here we aim to further exploit the analytical capabilities of flow cytometry to characterize cell aggregation within samples to do that a set of experiments were performed to obtain multiple fsca ssca distributions to detect different levels of aggregation the potential measurement errors derived from the intrinsic intracellular heterogeneity and non linearity of the scattering patterns which may lead to multiple lectures of a unique floc geometry were bounded by performing all the measurements with the same cytometer thus homogenizing the error in all samples to make them comparable the analysis of such distributions allowed us to identify a set of metrics that work as reliable proxy of the morphological complexity of the sample at stake the section below explains the proposed metrics 3 1 1 parameter definition the underlying idea behind this analysis was to indirectly characterize structural variability of flocs by parametrizing their flow cytometer fsca ssca dispersion patterns gathered by fc the parameters used as descriptors should describe such sample heterogeneity and organization in a robust fashion to do this two kind of analysis were performed to the obtained fsca ssca sample charts illustrated in fig 3 related to different aspect of these distributions i dispersion and ii clustering of the data the first analyses characterize the dispersion of the overall population through the parametric space this feature was exploited by performing a change of reference frame from the regular fsca ssca to a shifted one s t fig 3a which is aligned with the event dispersion pattern found when plotting data in linear scale a curved conical shape orange t direction blue is aligned with the cone axis whereas s direction pink follows an orthogonal direction to t at any point of it the dispersion of the population ω was characterized by measuring the standard deviation values in radial s and axial t directions σs and σt respectively termed here as axial ad and radial dispersion rd 1 a d σ t ω 2 r d σ s ω ad would explain the tendency of a sample to generate aggregates with morphologies able to scatter more light in all directions these would include aggregates of large size and or morphotypes with a certain degree of symmetry a population with a large rd would contain clumps exhibiting aberrant light scattering patterns with high or low fsca ssca signal ratios i e asymmetric structures like chains or fractal like clumps the second analyses allowed us to know more about the clusterization of the events in the parametric space fig 3b this trait aimed at defining the morphological heterogeneity of the sample whether variability is homogeneously sparse focused in concentrated regions of the chart presence of outliers etc to do that the fsca ssca chart was discretized into a grid of tiles with a specific unit area for details about the tile size selection see the supplementary text the proposed metric md explains the morphological diversity as the number of tiles nω containing events within the fsca ssca chart 3 m d n ω the larger the md value the more structural diversity a population exhibits then the dispersion of such diversity was targeted by measuring two variables i the outlier parameter op and ii geometric sparsity sp the first variable op is a measurement of the existence of morphological outliers within the studied population it was calculated by computing the fraction of tiles occupied by only one event 4 o p n o u t l i e r high op values indicates a larger tendency of the analyzed sample to generate out of normal morphologies in terms of size structure etc the geometric sparsity sp parameter is defined as the number of detected events in the sample nω per occupied tile in the fsca ssca chart 5 s p n ω n ω sp quantifies the average density of occupation of the data the larger the value the greater the degree of clusterization of the sample also the number of tiles forming the largest continuously covered region using an 8 connectivity criterium gray 2003 was used to measure the degree of clusterization of the morphological spectrum around the most frequently observed morphologies defined as the main correlated variability cv 6 c v n c o m p a c t these six metrics were presented using a multiparametric radar chart for comparison purposes fig 4 they were rescaled using normalization factors d n and ρ for a better visualization of the results 7 a d a d d r d r d d m d n ω n o p o p n s p s p ρ c v c v n formal details about the definition and calculation of these parameters are included in supplementary text and supplementary figures s1 s2 and s3 3 1 2 experimental evaluation tests of the proposed metrics two physiological conditions were essayed using two bacterial species with the ability of deploying artificial adhesins e coli and the deeply engineered p putida chassis strain em371 optimized for surface display martínez garcía et al 2020 the artificial adhesin system used here in both strains corresponds to a modified autotransporter protein igaβ fused to the transcriptional leucine zippers fos or jun veiga et al 2003 briefly fos and jun proteins have the natural ability to dimerize through the coiled coil domains forming heterodimers fos jun or homodimers jun jun abate et al 1990 to control for specific aggregation a negative control with a poly histidine tag fused to the modified autotransporter heb was used veiga et al 2003 hereafter the three variants with the modified autotransporter are named f j and h therefore cells exposing hybrid proteins with the leucine zippers on its surface were expected to adhere with their cognate partner f j or j j forming multicellular aggregates of different morphology while cells exposing poly histidine construct on the surface should not form aggregates all samples were analyzed with flow cytometry as described in the material and methods section and the six described metrics calculated for each strain e coli and p putida em371 were set as negative control strains of aggregation ø respect to their plasmid carrying variants in a general way the radar plots revealed interesting trends when comparing aggregation by i species e coli vs p putida em371 ii with and without adhesins and iii with different growth conditions early stationary vs overnight cells related to i an analysis of early stationary conditions revealed that negative control strains generated small but different footprints compared with all analyzed strains figs 4a b unexpectedly cells expressing the h construction showed a different aggregation profile than their wild type counterparts while e coli showed an expansion with increased morphological variability and density p putida em371 presented a lower variability but the axial dispersion and the generation of outliers increased figs 4a b this could indicate the existence of unknown interactions between the poly histidine tags expressed in h variants and other surface proteins more aggregation for e coli while lower aggregation for p putida em371 when focusing in the second comparison ii the expression of the different adhesins led to a sharp change in the aggregation profile in both species figs 4c d interestingly all strains exhibited a three peaked star morphology but with differences in their enclosed area the peaks were located in morphological diversity md radial dispersion rd and the correlated variability cv variables suggesting that the presence of the adhesins boosted the variability of the samples overall in early stationary e coli derivatives performed better than p putida em371 in terms of generating variability nevertheless a change in the culturing conditions iii produced dissimilar effects in the observed patterns negative control samples and h variants contours rearranged their shapes being this change more intense in the case of e coli figs 4e f when the presence of adhesins was considered an evident shift of polygonal shape was detected respect to early stationary conditions but two differentiated behaviors were observed e coli profile shift was preferentially detected towards an overall reduction of variability m d and generation of large aggregates leading to high scattering values r d and a d values this change was unequal for different adhesin combinations fig 4h oppositely p putida em371 profiles increased the overall population variability while experiencing as detected in e coli an increase in axial and radial dispersion in fact the detected change resembled self similar patterns for all adhesin combinations in summary these results allowed pointing three key facts first the selected growing conditions have a profound impact in observed aggregation patterns fig 4 therefore it is recommended to perform previous tests i e physiological state incubation time aeration etc to identify the optimal one for their application of interest second the aggregating behavior of the surface naked p putida em371 variant was more robust than the observed for e coli although both strains shifted their profiles only p putida em371 showed enhanced variability for all tested adhesin combinations finally the appearance of a quasi self similarity pattern in the aggregation profiles when using adhesins for both e coli and p putida em371 suggests an underneath relationship between the aggregation pattern generated by the adhesion system and the shape of the obtained radar chart plot however a more extensive study is required to confirm this hypothesis 3 2 resolving structural characterization of samples with high sensitivity cslm based analysis results shown in the previous section confirmed that the use of flow cytometry allows to characterize aggregation within bacterial cultures by using the fsca ssca distribution as proxies of macro scale morphology although flow cytometry experiments assert information about population trends they fail to provide specific details of aggregates at microscale level in that respect gathering real geometric data i e cell connectivity from samples seemed necessary to increase the level of detail of specific aggregates for certain biotechnological applications in the following section we describe a specific approach to solve that issue 3 2 1 parameter definition for this purpose a methodology combining confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm technique with an ad hoc image processing algorithm an upgraded version of the one described in martínez garcía et al 2020 and graphically depicted in fig 5 and supplementary fig s4 and s5 was applied to obtain three dimensional reconstructions of scanned aggregates by computational analysis briefly z stack images showing aggregates fig 5 1 were gathered and further inspected with imaris software to detected individual cell position and orientation a grouping algorithm detected cell connectivity and labeled in different groups aggregates using a distance criterium fig 5 2 finally overall aggregate structure was targeted by calculating a set of basic geometric descriptors that were further exploited by using a two step procedure fig 5 3 first a biplot principal component analysis pca to detect distribution patterns and find the most relevant variables affecting aggregate variability then general aggregation metrics regarding size distribution and expected population shape cell cell connectivity and strain combination were computed to know more about such variability sources detailed information regarding the process of image analysis parameter definition and applied algorithms to process raw data can be found in material and methods and supplementary information 3 2 2 experimental evaluation tests as described by martínez garcía et al 2020 the multiple deletions of p putida em371 resulted on a spontaneous tendency to form unspecific clumps under certain physiological conditions on the other hand results observed by analyzing flow cytometry data section 3 1 2 indicated that deploying the p putida em371 engineered strain with adhesins f and j contributed to increase the structural complexity of aggregates an analysis of aggregates at microscale level would enrich the metrics to clearly differentiate between non specific autoaggregation vs specific assembly of flocs adhesins therefore we performed aggregation experiments with p putida em371 with and without adhesins and explore the nature of aggregates at microscale level in that way after collecting data of the different descriptors at cell aggregate and sample level provided by the microscopy images we did pca analysis to obtain information about the contribution of the different monitored variables in the observed variability the evaluation was performed using a divide and conquer heuristic cormen et al 2003 that is summarized in the recursive application of these steps i include and or exclude variables of the dataset ii apply pca transformation and iii look for shifts in two indicators related to sample variability the first indicator was the appearance of non random spatial patterns when data was plotted in a three dimensional chart using as reference frame the three first principal components of pca c1 c2 c3 suggesting that principal components contains one or more variable of relevance that impose a strong ordering in the displayed data the second indicator was the percentage of explained variability combined with the relative alignment of principal components respect to every tested variable represented as a biplot chart and it would specify which are the dominant variables in the initial study over the whole dataset obtained data distribution indicated that structural variables i e evolving diameter radius of gyration number of particles were responsible of most of the variability exhibited by the sample figs 6 a and 6b illustrates this observation by showing orthogonal views of analyzed sample in principal component reference system c1 c2 c3 p putida em371 blue and p putida em371 f j red aggregates were clustered in discrete planes according with the number of cells present in the events in c2 c3 plane see fig 6a when observing the distribution of one of these planes in orthogonal direction c1 c2 see fig 6b events were observed to cluster as bands mainly aligned with c1 direction a positive correlation was observed between the values of c1 and the structural size of the aggregate represented mainly in the dataset by its evolving diameter these bands become more diffuse as the selected plane contained aggregates with a larger number of cells present in the event probably because the increment in the number of possible morphological combination and the reduction in the number of analyzed aggregates of larger sizes no evident clustering pattern was found between analyzed samples suggesting that general morphology parameters did not provided any significant difference to determine alternative variability sources not directly related with morphology a second stage in this approach was to exclude morphology related parameters and apply pca to connectivity related parameters i e cell cell distance connectivity index etc pca projection of samples suggested that the mean distance among cell types inside an aggregate f f j j f j were the most significative parameters contributing to the observed variability fig 6c showed only fuzzy signs of sample segregation in the c1 c2 plane however a detailed counting of data points using a bivariate histogram in this plane confirmed that p putida em371 f j aggregates covered a larger fraction of the plane fig 6d right in contrast with the concentrated profile performed by autoaggregated p putida em371 clumps fig 6d left the presence of adhesins in p putida em371 cells f j seemed to be responsible of producing a detectable increase in the sample diversity respect to the autoaggregated one which was in agreement with the conclusion obtained by flow cytometry figs 4f and 4h to complement the previous pca analysis and perform a structural sketch of aggregates a set of geometric descriptors a priori considered as relevant i e size structure cell cell connectivity strain combination etc were computed and compared fig 7 the idea behind this approach was to remark physical differences between aggregates the distribution of aggregates by cell number indicated that f j aggregates were larger on average with a greater dispersion in the observed sizes fig 7a and 7b fractal exponent and lacunarity parameters figs 7c and 7d revealed that f j aggregates tended to be more compact and porous than those observed in p putida em371 samples the degree of mixing between cell types given by the entropy value fig 7e was larger in the case of f j cells than in the case of self aggregation all these data were consistent with f j cell cell connectivity results increments in the appearance frequency of pole body contacts fig 7f and in the number of bonds per cell fig 7g were detected the average cell cell distance was larger among cells forming each clump fig 7h these results support the statement that the artificial adhesins in p putida em371 chassis foster the number of bonds between cells leading to a broader diversity of clump morphologies with larger size but less densely packed than in the case of self aggregated flocs 3 3 unified profiling of aggregating data samples fc and cslm based analyses provided independent feedback about the nature and structure of clumps formed in liquid cultures nevertheless the nature of such information is complementary whereas fc depicts diversity of a culture based on massive aggregate readings using proxy variables cslm image analysis provides detailed microscale resolution information of clump morphology from a small sample of the original population a quantitative criterium to combine and evaluate all this information using a unified score may help researchers to perform overall comparisons among samples in many contexts i e quantifying the effect of genetic devices to control adhesion dynamics an option to visualize and compare sets of multidimensional data is using an andrews plot this method projects any point defined into a multidimensional dataset of arbitrary size n x x 1 x n r n into a common discrete fourier base by means of the dot product operator andrews 1972 8 f x t x 1 2 x 2 sin t x 3 cos t x 4 sin 2 t x 5 cos 2 t where t is a dummy variable bounded within the range π t π the transformation not only enable a regular 2d representation plot but also permits establishing comparison among samples because distances between points are preserved in the projected basis fig 8 shows the application of andrews mapping of fc and cslm data in the previously analyzed case of p putida chassis em371 with and without adhesins median values obtained from generated metrics were gathered into a multidimensional array which was further projected to create the curves showed in fig 8a as observed p putida em371 and kt2440 profiles resemble each other their curves are more similar and are closer in the chart when compared with p putida em371 f j whose shape seems to be different this fact indicates that adhesins have a differential impact on aggregate data of displayed data furthermore the proximity respect to negative control kt2440 was quantified using the l2 norm fig 8b results confirmed that p putida em371 is more similar 7 times to the wild type strain kt2440 than p putida em371 f j 4 discussion the presented experimental procedure offers a powerful and straightforward approach to characterize aggregation processes in bacterial flocs by combining and exploiting data gathered by using two different technologies fc and cslm it allows the delivering of detailed information about the output of aggregation processes on the other hand this benefit came at a cost of being more labor intensive and time consuming when compared to other available technical alternatives together with regular methods used to characterized microbial autoaggregates such as sedimentation tests phase contrast microscopy or transmission microscopy trunk et al 2018 there are other general methods such as coulter counting lui et al 2013 dynamic image analysis kayser et al 2019 dynamic light scattering vargas et al 2017 or sieve analysis blaud et al 2017 typically used to characterize particles in suspension these methods provide accurate information about particle sizing and geometry of the studied sample i e feret diameters aspect ratio total volume roundness fractal dimension etc in a relatively small amount of time nevertheless the dimensionality of such data is much lower these parameters are explicit and presented in shape of distribution histograms or average values oppositely the combination of fc and cslm works in a complementary fashion whereas fsca ssca obtained from fc is derived from the study of the implicit geometry of their bidimensional data spreading pattern cslm provides not only the actual three dimensional structures generated during the aggregation process but the spatial distribution of the different strains if more than one is used a tradeoff between the degree of knowledge required by the researcher and the desired amount of time to invest should decide the convenience of using the approach proposed in this manuscript the analysis of fc and cslm data led to the creation of quantitative aggregation profiles for each strain at selected culturing condition such profiling has spotted few issues about the biology involved in the aggregation processes first obtained cytometer profiles in early stationary conditions are consistent with results reported in veiga et al 2003 and martínez garcía et al 2020 where a large aggregate generation was detected when using adhesins in both e coli and p putida em371 strains however the generated floc morphology pattern dramatically changed when culturing conditions were modified this warns the researcher about the reductionist temptation of stating the good or bad aggregating behavior based in the belief that there is a unique and biunivocal relationship with floc precipitation in fact using such analysis criterium is incomplete and sever relevant information about the complexity involved in an aggregation process and floc variability fig 1 second the observed behavior of p putida em371 aggregation patterns under the different experimental conditions when expressing adhesins comparing with e coli evinces the importance of applying deep genetic engineering in the aim of creating an experimental chassis for the study and development of microbial self assembly engineering the appearance of similar profiles in the geometrical sense for different adhesins at fixed culturing conditions was observed in both strains but only resembled for both conditions by p putida em371 this is suggesting that natural wild type sticky agenda is interfering with the tested synthetic adhesion mechanism on the contrary p putida em371 profiles showed shifted patterns among conditions but profile similarity using different adhesin combination and always enhanced variability respect to negative control indicates absence of such disruption we hypothesize that the completely absence of outer membrane appendages of p putida em371 may be responsible of such observation finally the use of profiles to characterize the aggregation patterns of samples also advise the researcher against establishing absolute qualitative comparisons qualifying samples as best or worst depends of the researcher priorities unified profiling using andrews plot establish a way to evaluate the degree of similarity of aggregative profiles respect a reference negative control using all available sources of data fc and cslm which are formed by a priori independent dimensions this type of reductionist scoring can be convenient in applications where data may be aggregated into a unique quantitative piece of data to allow an easy compare i e creation of fitness scores for computational applications in iterative search algorithms nevertheless such functions should always be designed and weighed according to researcher needs in order to align the generated scores with desired experimental outputs overall this analysis frame offers a versatile approach to characterize and evaluate the performance of biotechnological applications based on promoting the aggregation of cells for example a multidimensional quantitative testing of novel adhesion systems may help to compare the utility of different genetic tools for a certain purpose in a straightforward fashion with more degree of detail than single trait based trials such as sedimentation tests additionally the use of this expanded set of metrics may not only serve to evaluate biological constructions but to search for operational conditions under which the performance of a specific target aggregation trait is optimized and by utilizing specific metrics that directly spot cellular arrangement in multicellular systems such as local spatial segregation or isolation may also help identifying emerging patterning process in engineered consortia such as differential adhesion phase separation or coaggregation bridging 5 conclusions the development of effective biocatalysts based in the use of living bacteria is a promising endeavor for the sake of industrial and environmental biotechnology the capacities of naturally occurring communities to deliver complex pathways can be repurposed and strengthened with the growing repertoire of genetic tools for controlling cellular attachment in this context the development of experimental frameworks able to characterize the morphological variability generated by such assemblies of strains is essential to understand their behavior and modify its function at will this work tried to substantiate this notion by designing and testing an assessment methodology to promote and characterize the bacterial self assembly of cells displaying artificial adhesins the workflow combining experimental tests at single cell level cslm and population level fc was complemented with the definition of specific metrics evaluating the morphological patterns of aggregates in sum we believe that the approach presented above provides a valuable methodology for gaining control over the self assembly of bacterial

17401,the efficiency of multi strain planktonic flocs of bacteria as biocatalytic agents in aqueous media depends to a considerable extent on their three dimensional aggregation patterns yet numerical methodologies for full characterization of such heterogeneous biomass structures are largely missing in this work we present a descriptive methodology for quantitatively portraying and identifying suspended cell clumps formed by planktonic bacteria in order to benchmark the procedure we tackled the behavior of cells of the environmental and biotechnologically robust species pseudomonas putida whose surfaces were decorated with genetically encoded adhesins upon induction such adhesins promoted specific inter bacterial attachment leading to controllable and tractable floc formation in suspension microscopy and flow cytometry data were then gathered and further analyzed by means of a distinct metric set applying these parameters permitted creating comparable clumping footprints for every sample at both single cell and population level the hereby described approach provides a rigorous frame for following the assembly and organization of complex microbial communities as planktonic

introduction exploitation of bacterial consortia as biocatalytic agents for industrial applications and environmental cleanup is gaining relevance as a preferred strategy to cope with the increasing complexity of these processes brenner et al 2008 mee and wang 2012 song et al 2014 metabolically active communities often avoid biological bottlenecks such as biochemical burdening or intracellular toxicity and adjust catalytic output by modifying their relative composition zhou et al 2015 the main characteristic of interest of a microbial consortium is in fact the division of labor among the different microorganisms involved to perform a complex biochemical transformation yet in many cases the success of a consortium depends not only of the composition of the partnership itself but also of the relative spatial arrangement that their components exhibit bernstein et al 2012 tecon and or 2017 the physical chemical balance established between the consortium and the environment i e mass transport and chemical reactions lead not to an arbitrary but a specific physical arrangement of the individuals lindemann et al 2016 oliveira et al 2015 xavier et al 2009 these equilibrium points are in many cases neither optimal nor interesting configurations from an engineering point of view because the poor flexibility and or stability offered by them do not allow a fine control on the system under this scenario artificially decoupling spatial arrangement from cell fitness appear as a promising alternative to overcome such limitations in fact the problem of controlling the assembly of a microbial community at microscopic level following a designed pattern has recently gained considerable attention lindemann et al 2016 mccarty et al 2019 theoretical dzianach et al 2019 and experimental mccarty et al 2019 approaches are rapidly being developed to gain a high degree of control in biofilm modulation for high technological applications such as the development of bio abiotic hybrid materials wang et al 2018 the use of a 3d printing approach to create structures a la carte with customized disposition of the consortium components is currently under development connell et al 2013 haagensen et al 2015 also modification of surfaces to limit bacterial allocation expands the tools for engineering microbial consortia feng et al 2015 in this sense various strategies have been proposed in recent years to purposely redesign the attachment properties of individual cells in microbial cultures for the sake of enhancing their capacity to catalyze chemical transformations jia et al 2016 these include chemical bonding adhesin libraries to control local interactions glass and riedel kruse 2018 outer signaling to externally gaining control of the attachment e g light switches chen and wegner 2017 and metabolite restriction complementation to generate strain patterns lindemann et al 2016 although these contributions provide many tools for community assembly and helped to understand the dynamics of bacterial aggregation they are also afflicted by a dearth of metrics to characterize physical features of the formed aggregates fig 1 shows one example of the morphological fig 1a and strain combination fig 1b variability that can be originated during floc generation although similar in terms of biomass content number of cells their differences in geometric assembly and composition may have an effect in the physical properties of flocs such as diffusivity settling velocity or stability fig 1c in sum whether naturally occurring or resulting from genetic engineering a rigorous quantitative description of the 3d structure of bacterial aggregates in suspension is virtually missing this work tries to fill this gap by developing a rigorous numerical metrics to accurately characterize the aggregation of bacterial flocs in aqueous suspension to this end we adopted an experimental system that allows controllable formation of inter cell aggregates rather than spontaneous formation of bacterial groups specifically we rely on an improved engineered platform strain pseudomonas putida em371 that was purposely modified for serving as an optimized chassis for surface display of artificial adhesins this was made by removing many non essential bulky structures associated to the outer membrane and leaving a smooth cell envelope well suited for presentation of genetically encoded adhesins martínez garcía et al 2020 as shown below flocs of different strains of e coli and p putida em371 ectopically displaying matching pairs of fos jun leucine zippers veiga et al 2003 as artificial adhesins were analyzed with various optical and cytometric methods the data was then processed to obtain information about the aggregate variability exhibited by every sample thereby solving rigorously assembly structure relationships of the bacterial flocs the presented methodology thus provides a reliable charter to characterize aggregation of planktonic bacteria 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains plasmids and culture media the list of bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are shown in supplementary table 1 bacteria were grown overnight in either lb medium 10 g l tryptone 5 g l yeast extract and 5 g l nacl for sample dilution and preparation m9 minimal media without carbon source was used p putida cells were incubated at 30 c while e coli at 37 c the following chemicals were added when required 5 µg ml gentamicin 25 µg ml kanamycin 40 µg ml chloramphenicol 0 5 mm iptg or 1 mm 3 methyl benzoate 3 mb 2 2 experimental set up of aggregation tests to analyze cellular aggregation we performed two types of experiments see fig 2 in the first case early stationary overnight cultures grown in 10 ml test tubes with 3 ml of lb with the appropriate antibiotics were adjusted to an optical density od600 of 0 35 in 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml of the same culture medium the production of the recombinant adhesins was induced with the addition of 3 mb or iptg for p putida or e coli respectively then cells were incubated during 4 h at 30 c p putida and 37 c e coli next cultures were diluted with m9 minimal medium without carbon source and blended with the cognate pair when appropriate in round tissue culture dishes 35 10 mm falcon reaching a final volume of 4 ml in every sample with od600 values of 1 then culture dishes were incubated without stirring for 30 min at room temperature after that samples were collected by using 1 ml head cut tips to minimize perturbation of aggregates finally 200 µl of the suspension was used for the flow cytometer while 500 µl for the microscope analysis for the second type of experiment late stationary cells were grown overnight in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 ml of lb then cultures were diluted to an od600 of 0 1 in 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml of lb and let them grow for 5 h at either 30 c p putida and 37 c e coli cells were next induced with 3 mb or iptg for p putida or e coli respectively and incubated overnight at same temperature that the one used during induction step thus cultures mixed with the cognate pair when appropriate were diluted to get an od600 of 1 in 4 ml of m9 minimal medium without carbon source in 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks then bacterial cultures were incubated for 30 min at 30 c and shaken at 160 rpm finally samples were collected and analyzed as indicated previously for the first protocol 2 3 flow cytometry and analyses collected samples from the aggregation experiments were first diluted with m9 minimal medium without carbon source into a 2 ml eppendorf tube to obtain an od600 0 1 then samples were processed using a macsquant vyb flow cytometer miltenyi biotech before processing samples the voltage gains of forward scatter fsc and side scatter ssc channels of the cytometer were adjusted by using a flow cytometer size calibration kit f13838 thermofisher to fit the area based forward scatter signal fsca within the measurable range of the particles included in the calibration kit 2 15 µm of diameter the maximum upper value for the evolving diameter of any processed floc did not exceed 100 µm in any case due to technical limitations of the measuring device the uptake volume of flow cytometer was set to 100 µl and samples processed at a flow rate of 25 µl min also we included a rinsing step by injecting 4875 µl of washing buffer thermofisher between each measurement to ensure a proper cleaning of the cytometer fluidic circuit each experiment was performed by measuring a total of three biological replicates the fsca and ssca data was stored as csv format using flowjo flowjo v 10 llc and further imported to matlab the mathworks for consequent analysis 2 4 microscopy and image analysis to visualize cellular aggregation the 500 µl sample obtained as described in the 2 2 section was carefully mixed with 500 µl of 2 w v tempered m9 agarose 50 ⁰c without carbon source into a test tube and a 250 µl aliquot was immediately transferred into a 35 mm µ dish ibidi and to let it solidify at room temperature then samples were inspected using a confocal multispectral leica tcs sp8 system with a 100 0 5x oil immersion objective using 488 and 561 nm laser lines to detect gfp and mcherry fluorescent signals respectively images were captured using a 3x amplification factor with a z step of 0 5 µm using an 8 bit resolution and a frequency rate of 600 hz a minimum number of 2 biological repetitions with at least 500 individual aggregates per experiment were processed to obtain statistical information virtual reconstruction of bacterial aggregates was performed using imaris software v 10 bitplane by applying manual thresholding to obtained image stacks in order to obtain for every detected cell its mass center position spatial orientation axial direction and total length this data was imported as comma separated value csv files to be finally loaded in matlab for deep geometrical analysis i e color ratio connectivity radius of gyration number of particles 2 5 computational scripts matlab based scripts used to process data and retrieve proposed metrics together with small data samples both fc and cslm pretreated data are freely available under mit license and can be downloaded from the following link https github com drespeso flocsampler 3 results the aim of this work was to quantitatively characterize bacterial aggregation and to identify a set of metrics that describe that process this phenomenon typically comprises the rearrangement of bacterial biomass from an individual planktonic state into a cluster shaped organization such a process contains relevant structural information at two different scales the features of the formed aggregates as individual entities and the characteristics of the resulting clumped state as a whole population in that way a set of experiments were planned to acquire details about them using flow cytometry fc and confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm measurements respectively experimental protocols followed to perform the aggregation assays and the subsequent data processing to retrieve information about clustering patterns in bacteria are schematically represented in figs 2 3 and 5 and detailed in the materials and method section 3 1 deep characterization of aggregating patterns by flow cytometry assay flow cytometry is frequently used to gather information related with individual cell morphology and inner granularity by measuring the forward scatter area fsca and side scatter area ssca parameters respectively kerker 1983 these parameters are sensible enough to detect subtle changes in light scattering patterns produced by morphologically different type of cells when targeted with a laser beam nevertheless measurements performed in cultures containing cellular aggregates should result in fluctuations over single cell cultures of the fsca and ssca distribution mainly caused by the structural variability of the flocs present in the sample previous works beloin et al 2008 mclean et al 2008 tomich and mohr 2003 had already worked around this idea but to a certain extent here we aim to further exploit the analytical capabilities of flow cytometry to characterize cell aggregation within samples to do that a set of experiments were performed to obtain multiple fsca ssca distributions to detect different levels of aggregation the potential measurement errors derived from the intrinsic intracellular heterogeneity and non linearity of the scattering patterns which may lead to multiple lectures of a unique floc geometry were bounded by performing all the measurements with the same cytometer thus homogenizing the error in all samples to make them comparable the analysis of such distributions allowed us to identify a set of metrics that work as reliable proxy of the morphological complexity of the sample at stake the section below explains the proposed metrics 3 1 1 parameter definition the underlying idea behind this analysis was to indirectly characterize structural variability of flocs by parametrizing their flow cytometer fsca ssca dispersion patterns gathered by fc the parameters used as descriptors should describe such sample heterogeneity and organization in a robust fashion to do this two kind of analysis were performed to the obtained fsca ssca sample charts illustrated in fig 3 related to different aspect of these distributions i dispersion and ii clustering of the data the first analyses characterize the dispersion of the overall population through the parametric space this feature was exploited by performing a change of reference frame from the regular fsca ssca to a shifted one s t fig 3a which is aligned with the event dispersion pattern found when plotting data in linear scale a curved conical shape orange t direction blue is aligned with the cone axis whereas s direction pink follows an orthogonal direction to t at any point of it the dispersion of the population ω was characterized by measuring the standard deviation values in radial s and axial t directions σs and σt respectively termed here as axial ad and radial dispersion rd 1 a d σ t ω 2 r d σ s ω ad would explain the tendency of a sample to generate aggregates with morphologies able to scatter more light in all directions these would include aggregates of large size and or morphotypes with a certain degree of symmetry a population with a large rd would contain clumps exhibiting aberrant light scattering patterns with high or low fsca ssca signal ratios i e asymmetric structures like chains or fractal like clumps the second analyses allowed us to know more about the clusterization of the events in the parametric space fig 3b this trait aimed at defining the morphological heterogeneity of the sample whether variability is homogeneously sparse focused in concentrated regions of the chart presence of outliers etc to do that the fsca ssca chart was discretized into a grid of tiles with a specific unit area for details about the tile size selection see the supplementary text the proposed metric md explains the morphological diversity as the number of tiles nω containing events within the fsca ssca chart 3 m d n ω the larger the md value the more structural diversity a population exhibits then the dispersion of such diversity was targeted by measuring two variables i the outlier parameter op and ii geometric sparsity sp the first variable op is a measurement of the existence of morphological outliers within the studied population it was calculated by computing the fraction of tiles occupied by only one event 4 o p n o u t l i e r high op values indicates a larger tendency of the analyzed sample to generate out of normal morphologies in terms of size structure etc the geometric sparsity sp parameter is defined as the number of detected events in the sample nω per occupied tile in the fsca ssca chart 5 s p n ω n ω sp quantifies the average density of occupation of the data the larger the value the greater the degree of clusterization of the sample also the number of tiles forming the largest continuously covered region using an 8 connectivity criterium gray 2003 was used to measure the degree of clusterization of the morphological spectrum around the most frequently observed morphologies defined as the main correlated variability cv 6 c v n c o m p a c t these six metrics were presented using a multiparametric radar chart for comparison purposes fig 4 they were rescaled using normalization factors d n and ρ for a better visualization of the results 7 a d a d d r d r d d m d n ω n o p o p n s p s p ρ c v c v n formal details about the definition and calculation of these parameters are included in supplementary text and supplementary figures s1 s2 and s3 3 1 2 experimental evaluation tests of the proposed metrics two physiological conditions were essayed using two bacterial species with the ability of deploying artificial adhesins e coli and the deeply engineered p putida chassis strain em371 optimized for surface display martínez garcía et al 2020 the artificial adhesin system used here in both strains corresponds to a modified autotransporter protein igaβ fused to the transcriptional leucine zippers fos or jun veiga et al 2003 briefly fos and jun proteins have the natural ability to dimerize through the coiled coil domains forming heterodimers fos jun or homodimers jun jun abate et al 1990 to control for specific aggregation a negative control with a poly histidine tag fused to the modified autotransporter heb was used veiga et al 2003 hereafter the three variants with the modified autotransporter are named f j and h therefore cells exposing hybrid proteins with the leucine zippers on its surface were expected to adhere with their cognate partner f j or j j forming multicellular aggregates of different morphology while cells exposing poly histidine construct on the surface should not form aggregates all samples were analyzed with flow cytometry as described in the material and methods section and the six described metrics calculated for each strain e coli and p putida em371 were set as negative control strains of aggregation ø respect to their plasmid carrying variants in a general way the radar plots revealed interesting trends when comparing aggregation by i species e coli vs p putida em371 ii with and without adhesins and iii with different growth conditions early stationary vs overnight cells related to i an analysis of early stationary conditions revealed that negative control strains generated small but different footprints compared with all analyzed strains figs 4a b unexpectedly cells expressing the h construction showed a different aggregation profile than their wild type counterparts while e coli showed an expansion with increased morphological variability and density p putida em371 presented a lower variability but the axial dispersion and the generation of outliers increased figs 4a b this could indicate the existence of unknown interactions between the poly histidine tags expressed in h variants and other surface proteins more aggregation for e coli while lower aggregation for p putida em371 when focusing in the second comparison ii the expression of the different adhesins led to a sharp change in the aggregation profile in both species figs 4c d interestingly all strains exhibited a three peaked star morphology but with differences in their enclosed area the peaks were located in morphological diversity md radial dispersion rd and the correlated variability cv variables suggesting that the presence of the adhesins boosted the variability of the samples overall in early stationary e coli derivatives performed better than p putida em371 in terms of generating variability nevertheless a change in the culturing conditions iii produced dissimilar effects in the observed patterns negative control samples and h variants contours rearranged their shapes being this change more intense in the case of e coli figs 4e f when the presence of adhesins was considered an evident shift of polygonal shape was detected respect to early stationary conditions but two differentiated behaviors were observed e coli profile shift was preferentially detected towards an overall reduction of variability m d and generation of large aggregates leading to high scattering values r d and a d values this change was unequal for different adhesin combinations fig 4h oppositely p putida em371 profiles increased the overall population variability while experiencing as detected in e coli an increase in axial and radial dispersion in fact the detected change resembled self similar patterns for all adhesin combinations in summary these results allowed pointing three key facts first the selected growing conditions have a profound impact in observed aggregation patterns fig 4 therefore it is recommended to perform previous tests i e physiological state incubation time aeration etc to identify the optimal one for their application of interest second the aggregating behavior of the surface naked p putida em371 variant was more robust than the observed for e coli although both strains shifted their profiles only p putida em371 showed enhanced variability for all tested adhesin combinations finally the appearance of a quasi self similarity pattern in the aggregation profiles when using adhesins for both e coli and p putida em371 suggests an underneath relationship between the aggregation pattern generated by the adhesion system and the shape of the obtained radar chart plot however a more extensive study is required to confirm this hypothesis 3 2 resolving structural characterization of samples with high sensitivity cslm based analysis results shown in the previous section confirmed that the use of flow cytometry allows to characterize aggregation within bacterial cultures by using the fsca ssca distribution as proxies of macro scale morphology although flow cytometry experiments assert information about population trends they fail to provide specific details of aggregates at microscale level in that respect gathering real geometric data i e cell connectivity from samples seemed necessary to increase the level of detail of specific aggregates for certain biotechnological applications in the following section we describe a specific approach to solve that issue 3 2 1 parameter definition for this purpose a methodology combining confocal scanning laser microscopy cslm technique with an ad hoc image processing algorithm an upgraded version of the one described in martínez garcía et al 2020 and graphically depicted in fig 5 and supplementary fig s4 and s5 was applied to obtain three dimensional reconstructions of scanned aggregates by computational analysis briefly z stack images showing aggregates fig 5 1 were gathered and further inspected with imaris software to detected individual cell position and orientation a grouping algorithm detected cell connectivity and labeled in different groups aggregates using a distance criterium fig 5 2 finally overall aggregate structure was targeted by calculating a set of basic geometric descriptors that were further exploited by using a two step procedure fig 5 3 first a biplot principal component analysis pca to detect distribution patterns and find the most relevant variables affecting aggregate variability then general aggregation metrics regarding size distribution and expected population shape cell cell connectivity and strain combination were computed to know more about such variability sources detailed information regarding the process of image analysis parameter definition and applied algorithms to process raw data can be found in material and methods and supplementary information 3 2 2 experimental evaluation tests as described by martínez garcía et al 2020 the multiple deletions of p putida em371 resulted on a spontaneous tendency to form unspecific clumps under certain physiological conditions on the other hand results observed by analyzing flow cytometry data section 3 1 2 indicated that deploying the p putida em371 engineered strain with adhesins f and j contributed to increase the structural complexity of aggregates an analysis of aggregates at microscale level would enrich the metrics to clearly differentiate between non specific autoaggregation vs specific assembly of flocs adhesins therefore we performed aggregation experiments with p putida em371 with and without adhesins and explore the nature of aggregates at microscale level in that way after collecting data of the different descriptors at cell aggregate and sample level provided by the microscopy images we did pca analysis to obtain information about the contribution of the different monitored variables in the observed variability the evaluation was performed using a divide and conquer heuristic cormen et al 2003 that is summarized in the recursive application of these steps i include and or exclude variables of the dataset ii apply pca transformation and iii look for shifts in two indicators related to sample variability the first indicator was the appearance of non random spatial patterns when data was plotted in a three dimensional chart using as reference frame the three first principal components of pca c1 c2 c3 suggesting that principal components contains one or more variable of relevance that impose a strong ordering in the displayed data the second indicator was the percentage of explained variability combined with the relative alignment of principal components respect to every tested variable represented as a biplot chart and it would specify which are the dominant variables in the initial study over the whole dataset obtained data distribution indicated that structural variables i e evolving diameter radius of gyration number of particles were responsible of most of the variability exhibited by the sample figs 6 a and 6b illustrates this observation by showing orthogonal views of analyzed sample in principal component reference system c1 c2 c3 p putida em371 blue and p putida em371 f j red aggregates were clustered in discrete planes according with the number of cells present in the events in c2 c3 plane see fig 6a when observing the distribution of one of these planes in orthogonal direction c1 c2 see fig 6b events were observed to cluster as bands mainly aligned with c1 direction a positive correlation was observed between the values of c1 and the structural size of the aggregate represented mainly in the dataset by its evolving diameter these bands become more diffuse as the selected plane contained aggregates with a larger number of cells present in the event probably because the increment in the number of possible morphological combination and the reduction in the number of analyzed aggregates of larger sizes no evident clustering pattern was found between analyzed samples suggesting that general morphology parameters did not provided any significant difference to determine alternative variability sources not directly related with morphology a second stage in this approach was to exclude morphology related parameters and apply pca to connectivity related parameters i e cell cell distance connectivity index etc pca projection of samples suggested that the mean distance among cell types inside an aggregate f f j j f j were the most significative parameters contributing to the observed variability fig 6c showed only fuzzy signs of sample segregation in the c1 c2 plane however a detailed counting of data points using a bivariate histogram in this plane confirmed that p putida em371 f j aggregates covered a larger fraction of the plane fig 6d right in contrast with the concentrated profile performed by autoaggregated p putida em371 clumps fig 6d left the presence of adhesins in p putida em371 cells f j seemed to be responsible of producing a detectable increase in the sample diversity respect to the autoaggregated one which was in agreement with the conclusion obtained by flow cytometry figs 4f and 4h to complement the previous pca analysis and perform a structural sketch of aggregates a set of geometric descriptors a priori considered as relevant i e size structure cell cell connectivity strain combination etc were computed and compared fig 7 the idea behind this approach was to remark physical differences between aggregates the distribution of aggregates by cell number indicated that f j aggregates were larger on average with a greater dispersion in the observed sizes fig 7a and 7b fractal exponent and lacunarity parameters figs 7c and 7d revealed that f j aggregates tended to be more compact and porous than those observed in p putida em371 samples the degree of mixing between cell types given by the entropy value fig 7e was larger in the case of f j cells than in the case of self aggregation all these data were consistent with f j cell cell connectivity results increments in the appearance frequency of pole body contacts fig 7f and in the number of bonds per cell fig 7g were detected the average cell cell distance was larger among cells forming each clump fig 7h these results support the statement that the artificial adhesins in p putida em371 chassis foster the number of bonds between cells leading to a broader diversity of clump morphologies with larger size but less densely packed than in the case of self aggregated flocs 3 3 unified profiling of aggregating data samples fc and cslm based analyses provided independent feedback about the nature and structure of clumps formed in liquid cultures nevertheless the nature of such information is complementary whereas fc depicts diversity of a culture based on massive aggregate readings using proxy variables cslm image analysis provides detailed microscale resolution information of clump morphology from a small sample of the original population a quantitative criterium to combine and evaluate all this information using a unified score may help researchers to perform overall comparisons among samples in many contexts i e quantifying the effect of genetic devices to control adhesion dynamics an option to visualize and compare sets of multidimensional data is using an andrews plot this method projects any point defined into a multidimensional dataset of arbitrary size n x x 1 x n r n into a common discrete fourier base by means of the dot product operator andrews 1972 8 f x t x 1 2 x 2 sin t x 3 cos t x 4 sin 2 t x 5 cos 2 t where t is a dummy variable bounded within the range π t π the transformation not only enable a regular 2d representation plot but also permits establishing comparison among samples because distances between points are preserved in the projected basis fig 8 shows the application of andrews mapping of fc and cslm data in the previously analyzed case of p putida chassis em371 with and without adhesins median values obtained from generated metrics were gathered into a multidimensional array which was further projected to create the curves showed in fig 8a as observed p putida em371 and kt2440 profiles resemble each other their curves are more similar and are closer in the chart when compared with p putida em371 f j whose shape seems to be different this fact indicates that adhesins have a differential impact on aggregate data of displayed data furthermore the proximity respect to negative control kt2440 was quantified using the l2 norm fig 8b results confirmed that p putida em371 is more similar 7 times to the wild type strain kt2440 than p putida em371 f j 4 discussion the presented experimental procedure offers a powerful and straightforward approach to characterize aggregation processes in bacterial flocs by combining and exploiting data gathered by using two different technologies fc and cslm it allows the delivering of detailed information about the output of aggregation processes on the other hand this benefit came at a cost of being more labor intensive and time consuming when compared to other available technical alternatives together with regular methods used to characterized microbial autoaggregates such as sedimentation tests phase contrast microscopy or transmission microscopy trunk et al 2018 there are other general methods such as coulter counting lui et al 2013 dynamic image analysis kayser et al 2019 dynamic light scattering vargas et al 2017 or sieve analysis blaud et al 2017 typically used to characterize particles in suspension these methods provide accurate information about particle sizing and geometry of the studied sample i e feret diameters aspect ratio total volume roundness fractal dimension etc in a relatively small amount of time nevertheless the dimensionality of such data is much lower these parameters are explicit and presented in shape of distribution histograms or average values oppositely the combination of fc and cslm works in a complementary fashion whereas fsca ssca obtained from fc is derived from the study of the implicit geometry of their bidimensional data spreading pattern cslm provides not only the actual three dimensional structures generated during the aggregation process but the spatial distribution of the different strains if more than one is used a tradeoff between the degree of knowledge required by the researcher and the desired amount of time to invest should decide the convenience of using the approach proposed in this manuscript the analysis of fc and cslm data led to the creation of quantitative aggregation profiles for each strain at selected culturing condition such profiling has spotted few issues about the biology involved in the aggregation processes first obtained cytometer profiles in early stationary conditions are consistent with results reported in veiga et al 2003 and martínez garcía et al 2020 where a large aggregate generation was detected when using adhesins in both e coli and p putida em371 strains however the generated floc morphology pattern dramatically changed when culturing conditions were modified this warns the researcher about the reductionist temptation of stating the good or bad aggregating behavior based in the belief that there is a unique and biunivocal relationship with floc precipitation in fact using such analysis criterium is incomplete and sever relevant information about the complexity involved in an aggregation process and floc variability fig 1 second the observed behavior of p putida em371 aggregation patterns under the different experimental conditions when expressing adhesins comparing with e coli evinces the importance of applying deep genetic engineering in the aim of creating an experimental chassis for the study and development of microbial self assembly engineering the appearance of similar profiles in the geometrical sense for different adhesins at fixed culturing conditions was observed in both strains but only resembled for both conditions by p putida em371 this is suggesting that natural wild type sticky agenda is interfering with the tested synthetic adhesion mechanism on the contrary p putida em371 profiles showed shifted patterns among conditions but profile similarity using different adhesin combination and always enhanced variability respect to negative control indicates absence of such disruption we hypothesize that the completely absence of outer membrane appendages of p putida em371 may be responsible of such observation finally the use of profiles to characterize the aggregation patterns of samples also advise the researcher against establishing absolute qualitative comparisons qualifying samples as best or worst depends of the researcher priorities unified profiling using andrews plot establish a way to evaluate the degree of similarity of aggregative profiles respect a reference negative control using all available sources of data fc and cslm which are formed by a priori independent dimensions this type of reductionist scoring can be convenient in applications where data may be aggregated into a unique quantitative piece of data to allow an easy compare i e creation of fitness scores for computational applications in iterative search algorithms nevertheless such functions should always be designed and weighed according to researcher needs in order to align the generated scores with desired experimental outputs overall this analysis frame offers a versatile approach to characterize and evaluate the performance of biotechnological applications based on promoting the aggregation of cells for example a multidimensional quantitative testing of novel adhesion systems may help to compare the utility of different genetic tools for a certain purpose in a straightforward fashion with more degree of detail than single trait based trials such as sedimentation tests additionally the use of this expanded set of metrics may not only serve to evaluate biological constructions but to search for operational conditions under which the performance of a specific target aggregation trait is optimized and by utilizing specific metrics that directly spot cellular arrangement in multicellular systems such as local spatial segregation or isolation may also help identifying emerging patterning process in engineered consortia such as differential adhesion phase separation or coaggregation bridging 5 conclusions the development of effective biocatalysts based in the use of living bacteria is a promising endeavor for the sake of industrial and environmental biotechnology the capacities of naturally occurring communities to deliver complex pathways can be repurposed and strengthened with the growing repertoire of genetic tools for controlling cellular attachment in this context the development of experimental frameworks able to characterize the morphological variability generated by such assemblies of strains is essential to understand their behavior and modify its function at will this work tried to substantiate this notion by designing and testing an assessment methodology to promote and characterize the bacterial self assembly of cells displaying artificial adhesins the workflow combining experimental tests at single cell level cslm and population level fc was complemented with the definition of specific metrics evaluating the morphological patterns of aggregates in sum we believe that the approach presented above provides a valuable methodology for gaining control over the self assembly of bacterial

17402,sand biofilters sbfs are commonly used to remove manganese mn ii from drinking water mn ii load variation frequently occurs in sbfs due to fluctuating influent mn ii concentrations or flow rates therefore it is important to understand the responses of microbial biofilms in sbfs to environmental disturbances and how they affect mn ii oxidation efficiency here the responses of microbial ecological networks and mn ii removal in sbfs to increasing mn ii load were investigated the mn ii removal efficiency in two sbfs remained at 99 8 despite an increase in influent mn ii from 2 mg l to 4 mg l but significantly deteriorated 50 1 58 5 upon increasing the filtration rate a canonical correlation analysis of the microbial communities indicated that the local mn ii concentration and biofilter depth impacted community compositions of biofilms the dominant species within the biofilms exhibited clear stratification with simple associations in the upper layer of the sbfs and more complex interspecies interactions in the bottom layers putative manganese oxidizing bacteria hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium dominated the microbiomes in different layers of sbfs and changed relatively little in abundance when mn ii and filtration rate increased the community networks showed that biofilm microbiomes in sbfs were resilient to the disturbance of mn ii load primarily via regulating microbial interactions high manganese loads negatively affected the functional modules for mn ii removal furthermore the relatively rare species candidatus entotheonella palauensis was identified as a module hub implying taxa with low abundances can have important roles in ecosystem function these results shed new light on the ecological rules guiding responses of microbiomes in sand biofilters to environmental stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water sand biofiltration biofilm microbiome manganese oxidation community network 1 introduction manganese is a trace mineral required by many living organisms for growth and survival and accounts for about 0 1 of the total mass of the earth sujith and bharathi 2011 however dissolved manganese mn ii has become one of the most common surface water and groundwater metal pollutants mcmahon et al 2019 wang et al 2010 sand biofiltration is commonly utilized to oxidize mn ii and remove it from drinking water cheng et al 2017 vandenabeele 1992 vries et al 2017 the biological oxidation of mn ii mainly relies on manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob which belong to several phyla including firmicutes actinobacteria and proteobacteria marcus et al 2017 tebo et al 2005 some mnob directly oxidize mn ii with multicopper oxidase or heme containing manganese peroxidases mnps as catalysts anderson et al 2009 corstjens et al 1997 francis and tebo 2001 indirect biological oxidation pathways have also been observed as mnob can increase ph or generate reactive oxygen species which lead to mn ii oxidation andeer et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 several mnob have even exhibited the ability to oxidize mn ii at levels that compete with chemical oxidation however few genera e g leptothrix pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium have been identified as putative mnob in sand biofilters sbfs gülay et al 2016 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 this is likely because known mnob isolates are generally cultured using a nutrient rich medium while biofilms in sbfs develop under oligotrophic conditions therefore the contributions by the majority of dominant populations in the biofilms in the sbfs to mn ii removal is still unclear previous studies have shown that the composition of the bacterial community in sbfs varied over both temporal and spatial scales li et al 2013 nitzsche et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 environmental parameters in sbfs such as ph temperature nutrient availability and filter medium can affect bacterial community structure in biofilms and the mn ii oxidation level hoyland et al 2014 vignola et al 2018 furthermore biofilm community diversity was positively correlated with performance in slow sand filters haig et al 2015 the chemistry of water sources often varies and a sudden change in inflow water mn ii concentration or hydraulic loading rate may affect the biofilm microbiome and mn ii removal efficiencies hoyland et al 2014 a strong link was found between groundwater chemistry such as mn fe nh4 and ch4 content and microbial diversity in sbfs albers et al 2015 co culture and co occurrence network analyses have shown that interspecies interactions play an important role in determining mn ii oxidation ability liang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 heterotrophic mnob for example may rely on the soluble microbial products produced by nitrifiers and methane oxidizing bacteria for survival in an oligotrophic environment cao et al 2015 matsushita et al 2018 therefore the community network formed by interspecific interactions within biofilms is of great importance to sbf mn ii oxidation efficiency but how these communities respond to environmental disturbance remains largely unknown previous studies on bacterial communities in sbfs have focused on describing the community structures of biofilms albers et al 2015 hope and bott 2004 vignola et al 2018 the dominant species which represent a minority of the total diversity have commonly been identified as the putative mnob in the sbfs while the functions of most rare species have not usually been considered gülay et al 2016 studies have shown that low abundance species often have disproportionately strong impacts on the ecological function and stability of biofilms dick et al 2008 lyons and schwartz 2001 microbiome network analyses have been used to explore the complex interactions within biofilms and identify putative keystone taxa berry and widder 2014 by documenting co occurrence patterns across complex communities microbial niches and their functional roles in engineered and natural environments can be deciphered barberán et al 2011 chaffron et al 2010 ruan et al 2006 accordingly this study aimed to elucidate the following i how the biofilm microbiome responds to mn ii load fluctuations ii whether the microbial community structure is associated with functional shifts and iii what are the keystone microorganisms contributing to the ecological stability and mn ii oxidation in sbfs 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor construction and water sampling two duplicate lab scale sand biofilters named sbf1 and sbf2 with inner diameters of 6 cm and heights of 130 cm were used in this study these were filled with manganese sand of the size fraction 1 2 mm both columns were seeded with activated sludge which was collected from the wenchang municipal sewage treatment plant harbin china for microbial enrichment there were five sand sampling ports in the sbf wall for sampling different depths a simple schematic of sand filter used in this study is illustrated in fig 1 two sbfs were pre operated for 150 d under 0 8 mg l of influent mn ii and a 5 m h filtration rate and their mn ii removal reached stable after this 150 day period mn ii load fluctuation experiments were initiated the following progression was divided into four phases phase 1 1st 17th day phase 2 18th 27th day phase 3 28th 38th day and phase 4 39th 51st day the concentration of mn ii in drinking water resources in developing countries is normally in the 2 4 mg l range buschmann et al 2007 guibai and chao 1989 thus this range of influent mn ii concentration was used in this study from phase 1 to phase 3 the concentration of influent mn ii was increased from 2 mg l to 4 mg l while the filtration rate remained steady at 5 m h in phase 4 the filtration rate was increased to 7 m h while the mn ii concentration was held at 4 mg l each phase with its specific conditions lasted about 10 d to allow biofilm microbiomes to stabilize the synthetic influent was composed of mn ii mnso4 h2o dissolved in tap water to make the final experimental concentrations the details of influent water characteristics are shown in table 1 water samples were collected before and after passing through the biofilter all samples were filtered through a syringe membrane with a 0 22 μm pore size samples were digested with acid with 0 2 hno3 before mn ii concentrations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 5300dv perkinelmer inc usa 2 2 biofilm collection and dna extraction to evaluate the effects of mn ii load on bacterial community structure in the sbfs biofilm samples from the two sand biofilters were collected from four filter depths 5 25 45 and 65 cm deep at the end of each phase on the 17th 27th 38th and 51st days making a total of 32 samples each sample comprised about 2 g sand and was stored at 80 c until further analysis all of tools and tubes used were autoclaved for 30 min prior to use dna extraction was carried out using a fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals irvine ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions raw manganese sand was used as a negative control during dna extraction the quality and purity of the extracted dna were assessed using a nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 2 3 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons dna samples were amplified using the following universal primers for bacterial 16s rrna genes 515f 5ʹ gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3ʹ and 907r 5ʹ ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3ʹ which target the variable regions v4 v5 of the 16s rrna gene 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced using the illumina hiseq pe250 platform paired end amplicon reads were merged using flash to create raw tags and high quality clean tags were filtered using qiime caporaso et al 2010 chimeras were detected and discarded using the uchime algorithm sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity threshold of 97 representative sequences were aligned and further filtered using uparse edgar 2013 the final set of otus were assigned to taxonomic groups using the bayesian classifier tool of the ribosomal database project rdp with a 0 8 1 threshold value species richness chao1 and ace estimators diversity shannon and simpson indices peilou evenness and phylogenetic diversity were calculated using qiime detrended correspondence analysis dca canonical correlation analysis cca variation partitioning analysis vpa and the mantel test were performed using the r software to test for correlations between the key environmental variables and the bacterial community structure after mn ii load fluctuations langenheder and székely 2011 zhou et al 2013 three non parametric multivariate permutation tests based on bray curtis and jaccard distance including the multi response permutation procedure mrpp analysis of similarities anosim and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova were performed to assess the dissimilarity among the communities from the four phases using the vegan package v 2 5 6 in r v 3 5 1 2 4 network construction and analysis to elucidate how microbial interactions changed when subjected to increases in mn ii load the molecular ecological networks and statistical analysis were conducted using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi deng et al 2012 the network of each of the four phases as well as the entire process were constructed independently using random matrix theory rmt only otus that occurred in more than half of all samples were retained for the spearman correlation matrix analysis to compare the network topologies of the four phases the 0 95 threshold was set for the network generations 100 randomly rewired networks were generated for each empirical network and a randomized network index was calculated student s t test was used to check for significant differences in indices between the observed network and random networks cytoscape 3 7 1 and gephi 0 9 2 were used to visualize the networks bastian et al 2009 shannon et al 2003 2 5 module detection and identification of keystone microorganisms modularity is a notable characteristic of ecological networks alon 2003 a module in a network is a group of otus that are highly connected within the group but rarely connected outside the group greedy modularity optimization was used to separate modules in addition every node within an ecological network can be assigned a role based on its topological properties guimerà et al 2007 i e within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi the roles of the nodes generally fell into four categories as previously defined deng et al 2012 i peripheral nodes zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 ii connectors zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 iii module hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 and iv network hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 after individual modules were defined eigengene analysis was conducted following a previous study langfelder and horvath 2007 the correlations between module eigengenes and mn ii concentrations were calculated to reveal the response of individual modules to mn ii load fluctuations 2 6 nucleotide sequence accession numbers the 16s rrna gene sequencing raw reads were deposited in the sequence read archive of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi accession number prjna611893 3 results 3 1 mn ii load on mn ii removal to investigate the effect of increased mn ii load on mn ii removal two duplicate lab scale sand biofilters i e sbf1 and sbf2 were operated mn ii removal efficiencies of 93 8 98 1 were obtained during the first 5 days more than 99 0 of mn ii was removed when the mn ii concentration of the influent was between 1 mg l and 4 mg l fig 2 a with a filtration rate of 5 m h the mn ii concentration of the bsf effluents were under 0 05 mg l and the absolute mn ii removal rate increased to 53 2 mg h as the influent mn ii concentration increased fig 2b the highest removal rates of mn ii reached 76 3 mg h and 73 7 mg h in sbf1 and sbf2 respectively after the filtration rate was increased from 5 m h to 7 m h in phase 4 the mn ii removal of the two sbfs decreased linearly from 99 8 99 9 to 50 1 58 5 the effluent mn ii concentration increased to 1 63 mg l in sbf1 and 1 96 mg l in sbf2 there was no significant difference in the effluent manganese concentration between sbf1 and sbf2 during the operating period p 0 05 these results indicated that filtration rate rather than mn ii concentration significantly influenced the mn ii removal efficiency 3 2 filter depth and mn ii load on biodiversity a total 1627 1955 otus were determined based on the effective sequence tags of 63 603 83 446 for each sample fig s1 the rarefaction curve and coverages 99 5 99 7 indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture most populations in the biofilms fig s1 table s1 rank abundance curves showed that the biofilm samples had species richness ranging from 1029 to 1034 taxa exhibiting both high species richness and evenness fig s2 bacterial diversity was analyzed by comparing both individual samples table s1 and merged groups fig 3 statistical analysis of merged groups examined underlying trends in the of biofilms community diversity at different filter depths and operational phases the shannon and simpson diversity indices pielou evenness chao1 and ace richness estimators and phylogenetic diversity calculations showed that the biofilm microbiomes collected at 5 cm depth were significantly less complex than at other depths p 0 05 fig 3a d and fig s3a b diversity indices and species richness estimators did not significantly change over the four phases with increased mn ii load and increased filtration rate fig 3e h and fig s3c d however a slight increase in the chao1 richness estimator was observed at phase 2 the three dissimilarity tests mrpp anosim and permanova indicated that the overall microbial community structure significantly shifted under mn ii load fluctuations p 0 01 table s2 while there was no significant difference between the duplicate sand biofilters during each phase table s3 dca showed that the biofilm microbiome at phase 4 was distinct from the others fig 4 a moreover the microbial communities in sbfs at 25 45 and 65 cm depths during phases 1 2 and 3 were clustered closely and were distinct from those at 5 cm depth additionally adonis analysis based on bray curtis revealed significant differences between each pair of clusters p 0 05 fig 4 and table s4 cca indicated that depth mn ii concentration and filtration rate were influential environmental factors in determining microbial community structure fig 4b depth showed a strong positive correlation while mn ii concentration and filtration rate were negatively related with the first axis filtration rate had a strong positive correlation with the second axis the vpa results showed that 34 62 of variation in community could be explained by local mn ii concentration and filter depth fig 4c filtration rate explained 6 8 of the total variance in the microbiome these three factors together explained 45 74 of microbiome shift 3 3 microbiome compositions and dominant populations of biofilms the most dominant phyla proteobacteria had relative abundances ranging from 60 23 to 75 43 fig 5 a and was most abundant at 5 cm depth in the sbfs acidobacteria 12 64 18 77 cyanobacteria 0 56 6 44 and chloroflexi 2 39 6 19 composed the subdominant phyla these four phyla made up 86 53 94 79 of bacteria detected within the 32 samples no significant differences in the relative abundances of acidobacteria and chloroflexi were found between the different phases the relative abundance of cyanobacteria did not significantly change from phase 1 to phase 3 but decreased during phase 4 after the filtration rate had been increased from 5 m h to 7 m h the mantel test confirmed that the otus of cyanobacteria were highly related to the change in filtration rate r 0 99 p 0 05 the genera massilia lysobacter nocardioides terrabacter methylibium acidovorax and pedomicrobium dominated the biofilms in the sbfs at 5 cm depth fig 5b hyphomicrobium as a well known mnob tyler 1970 dominated across all the depths of the sbfs and it s relative abundance 3 3 12 7 increased slightly with increases of the mn ii concentration and filtration rate all these dominant populations were negatively related with filter depth fig 5c in contrast burkholderia anaeromyxobacter unidentified nitrosomonadaceae bacillariophyta unidentified rhizobiales and variibacter were enriched in the biofilms at 65 cm depth and were positively associated with filter depth the relative abundance of massilia increased from 0 75 to 7 26 at phase 3 and from 1 96 to 13 68 after filtration rate increased to 7 m h this positive correlation between massilia and filtration rate was confirmed by spearson correlations analysis p 0 05 at phase 4 the average abundance of lysobacter 0 5 6 2 and bacillariophyta 0 3 2 6 had declined to half their phase 1 abundances 1 14 8 and 0 66 5 47 respectively the relative abundances of nocardioides and acidovorax decreased from 2 55 and 1 57 at phase 1 to 2 04 and 1 04 at phase 4 respectively gaiella bacillariophyta and nordella were positively associated with mn ii removal 3 4 mn ii concentration on molecular ecological networks interspecies interactions within the microbial biofilms of the sand filters were analyzed the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks had different topological properties of microbiome networks during different phases fig 6 and table s5 all connectivity distributions followed the power law model r2 of power law from 0 797 to 0 919 indicating that relatively few nodes had many connections and most had few connections the modularity values for all ecological networks ranged from 0 401 to 0 763 significantly higher than the values of the randomized networks indicating that the community assembly of the sbfs was non random p 0 05 the community interactions of sbf biofilms were more stable with the most complex network avgk 4 829 and lowest negative connections 30 7 at phase 1 fig s4 the biggest changes were observed after the increase of mn ii concentration at phase 2 the network with the smallest average connectivity value 3 906 was observed after the mn ii concentration was increased to 3 mg l the community networks at phase 3 increased in similarity with those at phase 1 avgk 4 611 but the connections were slightly reduced again avgk 4 466 at phase 4 similarly the portion of negative connections reached to 38 7 after mn ii was increased to 3 mg l but then gradually decreased further reaching 34 4 at phase 4 3 5 identification of putative keystone species the possible topological roles of nodes in the sand biofilters were determined by their within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi most nodes were classified as peripherals with most of their connections made within their own modules fig 7 while there were no detected network hubs in the microbial ecological networks one node assigned to candidatus entotheonella palauensis was categorized as a module hub the community interactions of this module hub bacteria during different phases were further investigated and revealed that interaction patterns changed as mn ii load increased candidatus entotheonella palauensis had 42 connections at phase 1 but that decreased to 24 at phase 2 fig s5 the number of connections with the module hub then increased to 40 before dropping again to 28 at phases 3 and 4 respectively seven nodes were identified as connectors being highly connected to several modules one of the connectors belonged to the mnob hyphomicrobium otu1519 table s6 while the other connectors were affiliated with proteobacteria actinobacteria planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes and chloroflexi table s6 all these module hubs and connectors had low relative abundances 0 5 3 6 mn ii load on module structure by focusing on modules with more than five nodes a total of 25 28 23 and 23 modules were constructed for each of the four phases respectively fig s6 additionally the number of nodes within each module varied from 6 to 96 at phase 1 6 to 85 at phase 2 6 to 107 at phase 3 and 6 to 89 at phase 4 fig s7 the number of microbial interactions at phase 1 1943 links was comparable to that at phase 3 1866 links both of which were more than those at phase 2 1513 links and 4 1637 links fig s8 all modules were more isolated with fewer connections 9 4 between them at phase 2 than at phase 1 11 4 and phase 3 11 3 fig s8 corresponding to the increase of mn ii load the fewest inter module connections was found at phase 4 7 3 the correlations between module eigengenes and local mn ii concentrations were calculated to characterize the responses of individual modules to mn ii load fluctuations nine of the submodules had strong negative relationships with mn ii but one submodule had a positive correlation with mn ii at phase 1 and phase 2 fig 8 there were ten submodules negatively related and two positively related to mn ii at phase 3 however the numbers of submodules that were negatively correlated with mn ii decreased to six at phase 4 which was consistent with the changes in the microbial community as shown by dca analysis these results indicated that increasing the filtration rate reduced the microbial modules related with influent mn ii concentration following affected the mn ii removal rates 4 discussion 4 1 spatial differences in biofilm microbiomes in this study the phylogenetic diversity and species richness of biofilms in the sbfs were significantly lower at the 5 cm depth than at other depths it is likely that this was because nutrient availability decreased along a depth gradient in the sand filters gülay et al 2014 perujo et al 2017 the variation of mn ii profiles along depth gradients in sbfs has been previously studied cheng et al 2017 nitzsche et al 2015 tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 2007 and clear differences between biofilm microbial communities at different depths have been commonly observed however the differences in ecological functions of biofilms at different depths of sbfs remain poor understanding and further investigation using multi omics tools would be highly informative interestingly the spatial difference also existed in interspecies relationship the relative abundances of dominant genera including hyphomicrobium acidovorax methylibium lysobacter nocardioides terrabacter massilia and pedomicrobium decreased with the depth in the sbfs fig 4b the entire ecological network showed that these dominant microbial taxa in the top layer 5 cm depth exhibited only simple microbial interactions and had limited connections indicating that direct ecological relationships were not important fig s9 in contrast the dominant populations in the bottom layer had a more complex interaction networks with a high proportion of positive connections indicative of cross feeding interactions or niche overlaps which are important under oligotrophic conditions faust and raes 2012 for example gaiella which was dominant in the bottom layer was positively related to mn ii removal and highly connected with other species apart from these nordella which was less related with depth was positively correlated with mn ii removal had relatively few connections with other populations which was consistent with a previous study zhao et al 2020 4 2 mn ii load and shifts in community structure disturbances are ubiquitous in natural environments and have great influence on the structures and functions of microbial communities how a microbiome responds to environmental disturbance depends on the type intensity and frequency of the perturbation as well as the tolerance limits of the microbial population sousa 1984 similarly this study examined the succession of co occurrence networks of biofilm microbiomes in sbfs in response to increased mn ii load the sbf community responded to the increases in mn ii load in phase 2 with changes in its diversity and community networks species richness chao1 and ace estimates increased with the increase of mn ii concentration from phase 1 to phase 2 fig 2 and fig s3 meanwhile the network became less complex by phase 2 and the portion of negative connections had increased fig 5 and fig s4 these changes occurred in the sbfs after increases in mn ii concentration appearing to compensate and maintain stable mn ii removal at phase 3 the ace and chao1 indices decreased slightly and the connectivity of the microbial networks increased to levels similar with those at phase 1 suggesting the biofilm microbiome in the sbfs was able to recover to the previous steady state previous studies have shown that biofilter biofilms can withstand increases in mn ii concentration for 24 h hoyland et al 2014 this study demonstrated the functional resilience of mn ii oxidation by microbiomes in sbfs for ten days under mn ii load increases moreover the dynamics of bacterial diversity fit with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis which predicts that the highest community diversity will occur when there is intermediate disturbance intensity connell 1978 gibbons et al 2016 kim et al 2013 4 3 filtration rate and microbial community response the elevated filtration rate resulted in an obvious shift in biofilm community structure and a dramatic decline in mn ii removal fig 1a previous studies have observed positive links between evenness and the function of sand filtration haig et al 2015 which contrasted with this study where the decline in mn ii removal was not accompanied by changes in microbial community evenness modules in a gene regulation network are considered to be functional units with several fundamental genes that perform an identifiable task luo et al 2006 this study observed that the filtration rate increase clearly reduced the number of module eigengenes which were correlated with mn ii concentration likely by altering the complex interspecific interactions on which mn ii oxidation depends generally high filtration rates can lead to loss of cell biomass via shear stress as water flow increases which could alter the microbial community structure and hinder its function however the dominant species were not transported downward fig 5 so shear force was not the cause of the microbiome changes vpa showed that filtration rate could explained 10 8 of total variance in the biofilm microbiome of which 4 coincided with the local mn ii concentration and the biofilter depth fig 4c therefore filtration rate might influence the microbial community assembly by changing the local mn ii concentration further studies are needed to assess the long term stability of these structural shifts in the microbial communities if mn ii stress persists 4 4 keystone microorganisms and niches contributing to mn ii oxidation generally dominant populations in environmental microbiomes have been regarded as having functionally important roles in a community loreau et al 2001 and minor species have often been neglected delong 2009 however when a sudden disturbance occurs functionally equivalent minor species can substitute for dominant species in abundance demonstrating their importance in maintaining ecosystem function walker et al 1999 one module hub microorganism that was identified when analyzing the entire ecological network only had a relative abundance of 0 39 table s6 the dynamic network constructed by the module hub exhibited a similar pattern with microbial networks from all four phases fig s5 indicating that they had a central role in the resilience of the community with respect to mn ii load the most abundant species among the seven identified connectors pandoraea sputorum had a relative abundance of 0 42 this shows that although they were not the dominant populations in the microbiomes of the sbfs they played a key role in the microbial communities in addition hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium which are commonly enriched in sand filters gülay et al 2016 li et al 2013 mouchet 1992 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2014 exhibited relatively simple microbial interactions in the co occurrence network fig s9 furthermore while no exogenous nitrogen source was added to the synthetic influent the presence of a number of nitrogen transforming bacteria implied that nitrogen fixing populations such as lysobacter and bradyrhizobium iwata et al 2010 polcyn and luciński 2003 might play an important role making nitrogen available to other species such as hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium in the sbfs 5 conclusions by analyzing the community networks within the biofilm microbiomes of sand biofilters and investigating how they respond to increased mn ii load this study has provided novel insight into mnob communities the increase in mn ii did not significantly alter the microbial community structure or affect mn ii removal but it did induce a decrease in links between nodes and inter module connections of the microbial networks at the same time high species richness appeared to enable the stable mn ii removal despite fluctuating mn ii concentrations demonstrating the microbiomes resilience in the face of short term increases in mn ii load the biofilm microbiomes tended to recover to previous stable states further demonstrating the functional resilience of the microbial communities the dominant hyphomicrobium was able persist despite the fluctuating conditions however its abundance was not necessarily related with effective mn ii removal gaiella bacillariophyta and nordella were all positively associated with mn ii removal furthermore the keystone microorganisms were affiliated with these low abundance species highlighting the importance of low abundance species and their interactions in biofilms finally the microbial community structure of the biofilms was significantly affected by filtration rate despite maintaining strong stratification with distinct interspecies interaction in the sbfs these findings showed that the biofilm microbiomes in sand biofilters respond to short term fluctuations in influent mn ii by changing the community diversity and the complex ecological network declaration of competing

17402,sand biofilters sbfs are commonly used to remove manganese mn ii from drinking water mn ii load variation frequently occurs in sbfs due to fluctuating influent mn ii concentrations or flow rates therefore it is important to understand the responses of microbial biofilms in sbfs to environmental disturbances and how they affect mn ii oxidation efficiency here the responses of microbial ecological networks and mn ii removal in sbfs to increasing mn ii load were investigated the mn ii removal efficiency in two sbfs remained at 99 8 despite an increase in influent mn ii from 2 mg l to 4 mg l but significantly deteriorated 50 1 58 5 upon increasing the filtration rate a canonical correlation analysis of the microbial communities indicated that the local mn ii concentration and biofilter depth impacted community compositions of biofilms the dominant species within the biofilms exhibited clear stratification with simple associations in the upper layer of the sbfs and more complex interspecies interactions in the bottom layers putative manganese oxidizing bacteria hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium dominated the microbiomes in different layers of sbfs and changed relatively little in abundance when mn ii and filtration rate increased the community networks showed that biofilm microbiomes in sbfs were resilient to the disturbance of mn ii load primarily via regulating microbial interactions high manganese loads negatively affected the functional modules for mn ii removal furthermore the relatively rare species candidatus entotheonella palauensis was identified as a module hub implying taxa with low abundances can have important roles in ecosystem function these results shed new light on the ecological rules guiding responses of microbiomes in sand biofilters to environmental stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water sand biofiltration biofilm microbiome manganese oxidation community network 1 introduction manganese is a trace mineral required by many living organisms for growth and survival and accounts for about 0 1 of the total mass of the earth sujith and bharathi 2011 however dissolved manganese mn ii has become one of the most common surface water and groundwater metal pollutants mcmahon et al 2019 wang et al 2010 sand biofiltration is commonly utilized to oxidize mn ii and remove it from drinking water cheng et al 2017 vandenabeele 1992 vries et al 2017 the biological oxidation of mn ii mainly relies on manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob which belong to several phyla including firmicutes actinobacteria and proteobacteria marcus et al 2017 tebo et al 2005 some mnob directly oxidize mn ii with multicopper oxidase or heme containing manganese peroxidases mnps as catalysts anderson et al 2009 corstjens et al 1997 francis and tebo 2001 indirect biological oxidation pathways have also been observed as mnob can increase ph or generate reactive oxygen species which lead to mn ii oxidation andeer et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 several mnob have even exhibited the ability to oxidize mn ii at levels that compete with chemical oxidation however few genera e g leptothrix pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium have been identified as putative mnob in sand biofilters sbfs gülay et al 2016 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 this is likely because known mnob isolates are generally cultured using a nutrient rich medium while biofilms in sbfs develop under oligotrophic conditions therefore the contributions by the majority of dominant populations in the biofilms in the sbfs to mn ii removal is still unclear previous studies have shown that the composition of the bacterial community in sbfs varied over both temporal and spatial scales li et al 2013 nitzsche et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 environmental parameters in sbfs such as ph temperature nutrient availability and filter medium can affect bacterial community structure in biofilms and the mn ii oxidation level hoyland et al 2014 vignola et al 2018 furthermore biofilm community diversity was positively correlated with performance in slow sand filters haig et al 2015 the chemistry of water sources often varies and a sudden change in inflow water mn ii concentration or hydraulic loading rate may affect the biofilm microbiome and mn ii removal efficiencies hoyland et al 2014 a strong link was found between groundwater chemistry such as mn fe nh4 and ch4 content and microbial diversity in sbfs albers et al 2015 co culture and co occurrence network analyses have shown that interspecies interactions play an important role in determining mn ii oxidation ability liang et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 heterotrophic mnob for example may rely on the soluble microbial products produced by nitrifiers and methane oxidizing bacteria for survival in an oligotrophic environment cao et al 2015 matsushita et al 2018 therefore the community network formed by interspecific interactions within biofilms is of great importance to sbf mn ii oxidation efficiency but how these communities respond to environmental disturbance remains largely unknown previous studies on bacterial communities in sbfs have focused on describing the community structures of biofilms albers et al 2015 hope and bott 2004 vignola et al 2018 the dominant species which represent a minority of the total diversity have commonly been identified as the putative mnob in the sbfs while the functions of most rare species have not usually been considered gülay et al 2016 studies have shown that low abundance species often have disproportionately strong impacts on the ecological function and stability of biofilms dick et al 2008 lyons and schwartz 2001 microbiome network analyses have been used to explore the complex interactions within biofilms and identify putative keystone taxa berry and widder 2014 by documenting co occurrence patterns across complex communities microbial niches and their functional roles in engineered and natural environments can be deciphered barberán et al 2011 chaffron et al 2010 ruan et al 2006 accordingly this study aimed to elucidate the following i how the biofilm microbiome responds to mn ii load fluctuations ii whether the microbial community structure is associated with functional shifts and iii what are the keystone microorganisms contributing to the ecological stability and mn ii oxidation in sbfs 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor construction and water sampling two duplicate lab scale sand biofilters named sbf1 and sbf2 with inner diameters of 6 cm and heights of 130 cm were used in this study these were filled with manganese sand of the size fraction 1 2 mm both columns were seeded with activated sludge which was collected from the wenchang municipal sewage treatment plant harbin china for microbial enrichment there were five sand sampling ports in the sbf wall for sampling different depths a simple schematic of sand filter used in this study is illustrated in fig 1 two sbfs were pre operated for 150 d under 0 8 mg l of influent mn ii and a 5 m h filtration rate and their mn ii removal reached stable after this 150 day period mn ii load fluctuation experiments were initiated the following progression was divided into four phases phase 1 1st 17th day phase 2 18th 27th day phase 3 28th 38th day and phase 4 39th 51st day the concentration of mn ii in drinking water resources in developing countries is normally in the 2 4 mg l range buschmann et al 2007 guibai and chao 1989 thus this range of influent mn ii concentration was used in this study from phase 1 to phase 3 the concentration of influent mn ii was increased from 2 mg l to 4 mg l while the filtration rate remained steady at 5 m h in phase 4 the filtration rate was increased to 7 m h while the mn ii concentration was held at 4 mg l each phase with its specific conditions lasted about 10 d to allow biofilm microbiomes to stabilize the synthetic influent was composed of mn ii mnso4 h2o dissolved in tap water to make the final experimental concentrations the details of influent water characteristics are shown in table 1 water samples were collected before and after passing through the biofilter all samples were filtered through a syringe membrane with a 0 22 μm pore size samples were digested with acid with 0 2 hno3 before mn ii concentrations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 5300dv perkinelmer inc usa 2 2 biofilm collection and dna extraction to evaluate the effects of mn ii load on bacterial community structure in the sbfs biofilm samples from the two sand biofilters were collected from four filter depths 5 25 45 and 65 cm deep at the end of each phase on the 17th 27th 38th and 51st days making a total of 32 samples each sample comprised about 2 g sand and was stored at 80 c until further analysis all of tools and tubes used were autoclaved for 30 min prior to use dna extraction was carried out using a fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals irvine ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions raw manganese sand was used as a negative control during dna extraction the quality and purity of the extracted dna were assessed using a nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa 2 3 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons dna samples were amplified using the following universal primers for bacterial 16s rrna genes 515f 5ʹ gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3ʹ and 907r 5ʹ ccgtcaattcctttgagttt 3ʹ which target the variable regions v4 v5 of the 16s rrna gene 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced using the illumina hiseq pe250 platform paired end amplicon reads were merged using flash to create raw tags and high quality clean tags were filtered using qiime caporaso et al 2010 chimeras were detected and discarded using the uchime algorithm sequences were then clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity threshold of 97 representative sequences were aligned and further filtered using uparse edgar 2013 the final set of otus were assigned to taxonomic groups using the bayesian classifier tool of the ribosomal database project rdp with a 0 8 1 threshold value species richness chao1 and ace estimators diversity shannon and simpson indices peilou evenness and phylogenetic diversity were calculated using qiime detrended correspondence analysis dca canonical correlation analysis cca variation partitioning analysis vpa and the mantel test were performed using the r software to test for correlations between the key environmental variables and the bacterial community structure after mn ii load fluctuations langenheder and székely 2011 zhou et al 2013 three non parametric multivariate permutation tests based on bray curtis and jaccard distance including the multi response permutation procedure mrpp analysis of similarities anosim and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova were performed to assess the dissimilarity among the communities from the four phases using the vegan package v 2 5 6 in r v 3 5 1 2 4 network construction and analysis to elucidate how microbial interactions changed when subjected to increases in mn ii load the molecular ecological networks and statistical analysis were conducted using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi deng et al 2012 the network of each of the four phases as well as the entire process were constructed independently using random matrix theory rmt only otus that occurred in more than half of all samples were retained for the spearman correlation matrix analysis to compare the network topologies of the four phases the 0 95 threshold was set for the network generations 100 randomly rewired networks were generated for each empirical network and a randomized network index was calculated student s t test was used to check for significant differences in indices between the observed network and random networks cytoscape 3 7 1 and gephi 0 9 2 were used to visualize the networks bastian et al 2009 shannon et al 2003 2 5 module detection and identification of keystone microorganisms modularity is a notable characteristic of ecological networks alon 2003 a module in a network is a group of otus that are highly connected within the group but rarely connected outside the group greedy modularity optimization was used to separate modules in addition every node within an ecological network can be assigned a role based on its topological properties guimerà et al 2007 i e within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi the roles of the nodes generally fell into four categories as previously defined deng et al 2012 i peripheral nodes zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 ii connectors zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 iii module hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 and iv network hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 after individual modules were defined eigengene analysis was conducted following a previous study langfelder and horvath 2007 the correlations between module eigengenes and mn ii concentrations were calculated to reveal the response of individual modules to mn ii load fluctuations 2 6 nucleotide sequence accession numbers the 16s rrna gene sequencing raw reads were deposited in the sequence read archive of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi accession number prjna611893 3 results 3 1 mn ii load on mn ii removal to investigate the effect of increased mn ii load on mn ii removal two duplicate lab scale sand biofilters i e sbf1 and sbf2 were operated mn ii removal efficiencies of 93 8 98 1 were obtained during the first 5 days more than 99 0 of mn ii was removed when the mn ii concentration of the influent was between 1 mg l and 4 mg l fig 2 a with a filtration rate of 5 m h the mn ii concentration of the bsf effluents were under 0 05 mg l and the absolute mn ii removal rate increased to 53 2 mg h as the influent mn ii concentration increased fig 2b the highest removal rates of mn ii reached 76 3 mg h and 73 7 mg h in sbf1 and sbf2 respectively after the filtration rate was increased from 5 m h to 7 m h in phase 4 the mn ii removal of the two sbfs decreased linearly from 99 8 99 9 to 50 1 58 5 the effluent mn ii concentration increased to 1 63 mg l in sbf1 and 1 96 mg l in sbf2 there was no significant difference in the effluent manganese concentration between sbf1 and sbf2 during the operating period p 0 05 these results indicated that filtration rate rather than mn ii concentration significantly influenced the mn ii removal efficiency 3 2 filter depth and mn ii load on biodiversity a total 1627 1955 otus were determined based on the effective sequence tags of 63 603 83 446 for each sample fig s1 the rarefaction curve and coverages 99 5 99 7 indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture most populations in the biofilms fig s1 table s1 rank abundance curves showed that the biofilm samples had species richness ranging from 1029 to 1034 taxa exhibiting both high species richness and evenness fig s2 bacterial diversity was analyzed by comparing both individual samples table s1 and merged groups fig 3 statistical analysis of merged groups examined underlying trends in the of biofilms community diversity at different filter depths and operational phases the shannon and simpson diversity indices pielou evenness chao1 and ace richness estimators and phylogenetic diversity calculations showed that the biofilm microbiomes collected at 5 cm depth were significantly less complex than at other depths p 0 05 fig 3a d and fig s3a b diversity indices and species richness estimators did not significantly change over the four phases with increased mn ii load and increased filtration rate fig 3e h and fig s3c d however a slight increase in the chao1 richness estimator was observed at phase 2 the three dissimilarity tests mrpp anosim and permanova indicated that the overall microbial community structure significantly shifted under mn ii load fluctuations p 0 01 table s2 while there was no significant difference between the duplicate sand biofilters during each phase table s3 dca showed that the biofilm microbiome at phase 4 was distinct from the others fig 4 a moreover the microbial communities in sbfs at 25 45 and 65 cm depths during phases 1 2 and 3 were clustered closely and were distinct from those at 5 cm depth additionally adonis analysis based on bray curtis revealed significant differences between each pair of clusters p 0 05 fig 4 and table s4 cca indicated that depth mn ii concentration and filtration rate were influential environmental factors in determining microbial community structure fig 4b depth showed a strong positive correlation while mn ii concentration and filtration rate were negatively related with the first axis filtration rate had a strong positive correlation with the second axis the vpa results showed that 34 62 of variation in community could be explained by local mn ii concentration and filter depth fig 4c filtration rate explained 6 8 of the total variance in the microbiome these three factors together explained 45 74 of microbiome shift 3 3 microbiome compositions and dominant populations of biofilms the most dominant phyla proteobacteria had relative abundances ranging from 60 23 to 75 43 fig 5 a and was most abundant at 5 cm depth in the sbfs acidobacteria 12 64 18 77 cyanobacteria 0 56 6 44 and chloroflexi 2 39 6 19 composed the subdominant phyla these four phyla made up 86 53 94 79 of bacteria detected within the 32 samples no significant differences in the relative abundances of acidobacteria and chloroflexi were found between the different phases the relative abundance of cyanobacteria did not significantly change from phase 1 to phase 3 but decreased during phase 4 after the filtration rate had been increased from 5 m h to 7 m h the mantel test confirmed that the otus of cyanobacteria were highly related to the change in filtration rate r 0 99 p 0 05 the genera massilia lysobacter nocardioides terrabacter methylibium acidovorax and pedomicrobium dominated the biofilms in the sbfs at 5 cm depth fig 5b hyphomicrobium as a well known mnob tyler 1970 dominated across all the depths of the sbfs and it s relative abundance 3 3 12 7 increased slightly with increases of the mn ii concentration and filtration rate all these dominant populations were negatively related with filter depth fig 5c in contrast burkholderia anaeromyxobacter unidentified nitrosomonadaceae bacillariophyta unidentified rhizobiales and variibacter were enriched in the biofilms at 65 cm depth and were positively associated with filter depth the relative abundance of massilia increased from 0 75 to 7 26 at phase 3 and from 1 96 to 13 68 after filtration rate increased to 7 m h this positive correlation between massilia and filtration rate was confirmed by spearson correlations analysis p 0 05 at phase 4 the average abundance of lysobacter 0 5 6 2 and bacillariophyta 0 3 2 6 had declined to half their phase 1 abundances 1 14 8 and 0 66 5 47 respectively the relative abundances of nocardioides and acidovorax decreased from 2 55 and 1 57 at phase 1 to 2 04 and 1 04 at phase 4 respectively gaiella bacillariophyta and nordella were positively associated with mn ii removal 3 4 mn ii concentration on molecular ecological networks interspecies interactions within the microbial biofilms of the sand filters were analyzed the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks had different topological properties of microbiome networks during different phases fig 6 and table s5 all connectivity distributions followed the power law model r2 of power law from 0 797 to 0 919 indicating that relatively few nodes had many connections and most had few connections the modularity values for all ecological networks ranged from 0 401 to 0 763 significantly higher than the values of the randomized networks indicating that the community assembly of the sbfs was non random p 0 05 the community interactions of sbf biofilms were more stable with the most complex network avgk 4 829 and lowest negative connections 30 7 at phase 1 fig s4 the biggest changes were observed after the increase of mn ii concentration at phase 2 the network with the smallest average connectivity value 3 906 was observed after the mn ii concentration was increased to 3 mg l the community networks at phase 3 increased in similarity with those at phase 1 avgk 4 611 but the connections were slightly reduced again avgk 4 466 at phase 4 similarly the portion of negative connections reached to 38 7 after mn ii was increased to 3 mg l but then gradually decreased further reaching 34 4 at phase 4 3 5 identification of putative keystone species the possible topological roles of nodes in the sand biofilters were determined by their within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi most nodes were classified as peripherals with most of their connections made within their own modules fig 7 while there were no detected network hubs in the microbial ecological networks one node assigned to candidatus entotheonella palauensis was categorized as a module hub the community interactions of this module hub bacteria during different phases were further investigated and revealed that interaction patterns changed as mn ii load increased candidatus entotheonella palauensis had 42 connections at phase 1 but that decreased to 24 at phase 2 fig s5 the number of connections with the module hub then increased to 40 before dropping again to 28 at phases 3 and 4 respectively seven nodes were identified as connectors being highly connected to several modules one of the connectors belonged to the mnob hyphomicrobium otu1519 table s6 while the other connectors were affiliated with proteobacteria actinobacteria planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes and chloroflexi table s6 all these module hubs and connectors had low relative abundances 0 5 3 6 mn ii load on module structure by focusing on modules with more than five nodes a total of 25 28 23 and 23 modules were constructed for each of the four phases respectively fig s6 additionally the number of nodes within each module varied from 6 to 96 at phase 1 6 to 85 at phase 2 6 to 107 at phase 3 and 6 to 89 at phase 4 fig s7 the number of microbial interactions at phase 1 1943 links was comparable to that at phase 3 1866 links both of which were more than those at phase 2 1513 links and 4 1637 links fig s8 all modules were more isolated with fewer connections 9 4 between them at phase 2 than at phase 1 11 4 and phase 3 11 3 fig s8 corresponding to the increase of mn ii load the fewest inter module connections was found at phase 4 7 3 the correlations between module eigengenes and local mn ii concentrations were calculated to characterize the responses of individual modules to mn ii load fluctuations nine of the submodules had strong negative relationships with mn ii but one submodule had a positive correlation with mn ii at phase 1 and phase 2 fig 8 there were ten submodules negatively related and two positively related to mn ii at phase 3 however the numbers of submodules that were negatively correlated with mn ii decreased to six at phase 4 which was consistent with the changes in the microbial community as shown by dca analysis these results indicated that increasing the filtration rate reduced the microbial modules related with influent mn ii concentration following affected the mn ii removal rates 4 discussion 4 1 spatial differences in biofilm microbiomes in this study the phylogenetic diversity and species richness of biofilms in the sbfs were significantly lower at the 5 cm depth than at other depths it is likely that this was because nutrient availability decreased along a depth gradient in the sand filters gülay et al 2014 perujo et al 2017 the variation of mn ii profiles along depth gradients in sbfs has been previously studied cheng et al 2017 nitzsche et al 2015 tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 2007 and clear differences between biofilm microbial communities at different depths have been commonly observed however the differences in ecological functions of biofilms at different depths of sbfs remain poor understanding and further investigation using multi omics tools would be highly informative interestingly the spatial difference also existed in interspecies relationship the relative abundances of dominant genera including hyphomicrobium acidovorax methylibium lysobacter nocardioides terrabacter massilia and pedomicrobium decreased with the depth in the sbfs fig 4b the entire ecological network showed that these dominant microbial taxa in the top layer 5 cm depth exhibited only simple microbial interactions and had limited connections indicating that direct ecological relationships were not important fig s9 in contrast the dominant populations in the bottom layer had a more complex interaction networks with a high proportion of positive connections indicative of cross feeding interactions or niche overlaps which are important under oligotrophic conditions faust and raes 2012 for example gaiella which was dominant in the bottom layer was positively related to mn ii removal and highly connected with other species apart from these nordella which was less related with depth was positively correlated with mn ii removal had relatively few connections with other populations which was consistent with a previous study zhao et al 2020 4 2 mn ii load and shifts in community structure disturbances are ubiquitous in natural environments and have great influence on the structures and functions of microbial communities how a microbiome responds to environmental disturbance depends on the type intensity and frequency of the perturbation as well as the tolerance limits of the microbial population sousa 1984 similarly this study examined the succession of co occurrence networks of biofilm microbiomes in sbfs in response to increased mn ii load the sbf community responded to the increases in mn ii load in phase 2 with changes in its diversity and community networks species richness chao1 and ace estimates increased with the increase of mn ii concentration from phase 1 to phase 2 fig 2 and fig s3 meanwhile the network became less complex by phase 2 and the portion of negative connections had increased fig 5 and fig s4 these changes occurred in the sbfs after increases in mn ii concentration appearing to compensate and maintain stable mn ii removal at phase 3 the ace and chao1 indices decreased slightly and the connectivity of the microbial networks increased to levels similar with those at phase 1 suggesting the biofilm microbiome in the sbfs was able to recover to the previous steady state previous studies have shown that biofilter biofilms can withstand increases in mn ii concentration for 24 h hoyland et al 2014 this study demonstrated the functional resilience of mn ii oxidation by microbiomes in sbfs for ten days under mn ii load increases moreover the dynamics of bacterial diversity fit with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis which predicts that the highest community diversity will occur when there is intermediate disturbance intensity connell 1978 gibbons et al 2016 kim et al 2013 4 3 filtration rate and microbial community response the elevated filtration rate resulted in an obvious shift in biofilm community structure and a dramatic decline in mn ii removal fig 1a previous studies have observed positive links between evenness and the function of sand filtration haig et al 2015 which contrasted with this study where the decline in mn ii removal was not accompanied by changes in microbial community evenness modules in a gene regulation network are considered to be functional units with several fundamental genes that perform an identifiable task luo et al 2006 this study observed that the filtration rate increase clearly reduced the number of module eigengenes which were correlated with mn ii concentration likely by altering the complex interspecific interactions on which mn ii oxidation depends generally high filtration rates can lead to loss of cell biomass via shear stress as water flow increases which could alter the microbial community structure and hinder its function however the dominant species were not transported downward fig 5 so shear force was not the cause of the microbiome changes vpa showed that filtration rate could explained 10 8 of total variance in the biofilm microbiome of which 4 coincided with the local mn ii concentration and the biofilter depth fig 4c therefore filtration rate might influence the microbial community assembly by changing the local mn ii concentration further studies are needed to assess the long term stability of these structural shifts in the microbial communities if mn ii stress persists 4 4 keystone microorganisms and niches contributing to mn ii oxidation generally dominant populations in environmental microbiomes have been regarded as having functionally important roles in a community loreau et al 2001 and minor species have often been neglected delong 2009 however when a sudden disturbance occurs functionally equivalent minor species can substitute for dominant species in abundance demonstrating their importance in maintaining ecosystem function walker et al 1999 one module hub microorganism that was identified when analyzing the entire ecological network only had a relative abundance of 0 39 table s6 the dynamic network constructed by the module hub exhibited a similar pattern with microbial networks from all four phases fig s5 indicating that they had a central role in the resilience of the community with respect to mn ii load the most abundant species among the seven identified connectors pandoraea sputorum had a relative abundance of 0 42 this shows that although they were not the dominant populations in the microbiomes of the sbfs they played a key role in the microbial communities in addition hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium which are commonly enriched in sand filters gülay et al 2016 li et al 2013 mouchet 1992 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2014 exhibited relatively simple microbial interactions in the co occurrence network fig s9 furthermore while no exogenous nitrogen source was added to the synthetic influent the presence of a number of nitrogen transforming bacteria implied that nitrogen fixing populations such as lysobacter and bradyrhizobium iwata et al 2010 polcyn and luciński 2003 might play an important role making nitrogen available to other species such as hyphomicrobium and pedomicrobium in the sbfs 5 conclusions by analyzing the community networks within the biofilm microbiomes of sand biofilters and investigating how they respond to increased mn ii load this study has provided novel insight into mnob communities the increase in mn ii did not significantly alter the microbial community structure or affect mn ii removal but it did induce a decrease in links between nodes and inter module connections of the microbial networks at the same time high species richness appeared to enable the stable mn ii removal despite fluctuating mn ii concentrations demonstrating the microbiomes resilience in the face of short term increases in mn ii load the biofilm microbiomes tended to recover to previous stable states further demonstrating the functional resilience of the microbial communities the dominant hyphomicrobium was able persist despite the fluctuating conditions however its abundance was not necessarily related with effective mn ii removal gaiella bacillariophyta and nordella were all positively associated with mn ii removal furthermore the keystone microorganisms were affiliated with these low abundance species highlighting the importance of low abundance species and their interactions in biofilms finally the microbial community structure of the biofilms was significantly affected by filtration rate despite maintaining strong stratification with distinct interspecies interaction in the sbfs these findings showed that the biofilm microbiomes in sand biofilters respond to short term fluctuations in influent mn ii by changing the community diversity and the complex ecological network declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this

17403,sediments have been found to be one of the most important reservoirs for microplastics providing abundant indigenous microbes the processes involved in the distribution and degradation behavior of microplastics are complex this study investigated the vertical distribution of microplastics with the size 5 mm and the bacterial community assemblages colonizing microplastics in urban river sediments at a depth from 0 to 50 cm the results showed that both microplastics and associated microbial communities presented vertical profiles in river sediments the mean concentration of microplastics increased from the shallow layers to the deep layers of sediments and smaller microplastic particles were dominant in deeper layers a greater degradation of microplastics in deeper layers was confirmed by contact angle measurements scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance analyses unlike the surrounding sediments the whole bacterial communities on microplastics exhibited higher frequency of positive correlations in the bacterial co occurrence network which indicated a less stability of bacterial communities on microplastics the indicative plastic degrading bacteria with an average abundance of 4 33 was found in the surrounding sediments while on the microplastics 21 37 was found from shallow layers to deep layers the indicative plastic degrading bacteria significantly increased both in the abundance and in their betweenness centrality in the co occurrence network which suggested a potentially primary role of these bacteria in the degradation of microplastics in deep layers this study provides new insight into the vertical distribution and the potential microbial degrading characteristics of microplastics in urban river sediments which expanded our understanding of the fate of microplastics in aquatic environments the observed results implied a great risk that microplastics might become smaller and more in deepened sediments and finally migrate into groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vertical sediment microplastic size biodegradation stability contact angle measurement 1 introduction in recent years numerous reports have highlighted the worsening microplastic pollution in oceans and rivers this topic has attracted great attention from various fields auta et al 2017 horton et al 2017 it was estimated that 8 300 million metric tons mt of plastic have been produced by mid 2017 and the amount of plastic waste in aquatic ecosystems was forecasted to reach 12 000 mt by the end of 2050 geyer et al 2017 microplastics a kind of small plastic particles 5 mm diameter is an important vector of various pollutants such as heavy metals antibiotics and other organic contaminants hodson et al 2017 he et al 2018 microplastics can be easily ingested by aquatic organisms resulting in physical obstructions and entanglements of their digestive systems as well as chronic toxicity due to the adsorbed chemical contaminants frydkjaer et al 2017 this has posed great threats to organisms and resulted in the damage of aquatic ecosystems gutow et al 2016 unlike other degradable substances microplastics are persistent not easily biodegraded and quite stable in the environment which causes long term damage to ecosystems lusher et al 2014 therefore understanding the distribution and degradation behavior of microplastics is important tasks for the remediation of microplastic pollution in aquatic environments environmental behavior of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems refers to temporal and spatial processes attributed to crushing and degradation by physicochemical and biological processes such as light radiation heat radiation and microbial degradation cole et al 2011 li et al 2018 roager and sonnenschein 2019 recent research on marine microplastic pollution indicates the presence of large amounts of microplastics in the surface water of rivers qu et al 2017 it is generally believed that microplastics do not exist independently in the water because of the colonization of biofilms on microplastics and the heteropolymerization of microplastics with other impurities which would promote the sinking of microplastics li et al 2019 studies confirm the presence of microplastics in surface water and top sediments with the depth of 0 10 cm wang et al 2018 fu and wang 2019 dong et al 2020 some research explored the vertical distribution of microplastics within the lake sediments with the depth of 0 60 cm and further discussed the possibility of using microplastics as an indicator of the anthropocene lewis and maslin 2015 martin et al 2017 some microplastics have also been detected in drinking water from groundwater sources panno et al 2019 river sediment or hyporheic zone is an important pathway for the exchange of microplastics between surface water and groundwater frei et al 2019 panno et al 2019 to date information on the vertical profile of microplastics and the microplastic behavior in deep urban river sediments with the depth more than 10 cm remains unknown which is crucial to clarify the environmental behavior and fate of microplastics in aquatic environments microplastics are generally considered as persistent organic substances and provide a huge ecological niche for the colonization of microbial communities kooi et al 2017 rummel et al 2017 a number of studies have been conducted to study the interactions between microplastics and microorganisms colonizing microplastics which would affect the environmental behavior of microplastics by changing the physical or chemical characteristics of microplastic particles rummel et al 2017 roager and sonnenschein 2019 oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 however there was no consensus on whether these microorganisms specifically choose plastics to colonize some studies suggested that the microbial communities on plastics are not substrate selective oberbeckmann et al 2016 for example the difference in the microbial community compositions between floating microplastics and other substrates such as stones and sediments was explained by the longevity and relative mobility of microplastics in the water column zettler et al 2013 fazey and ryan 2016 however multiple investigations showed that the microbial communities also differed between deposited microplastics and the surrounding sediments yet the result was suggested to be due to the limitation of nutrients or microplastics kirstein et al 2019 research in other areas revealed that the types of carbon sources largely drive the turnovers of microbial community compositions goldford et al 2018 though microplastics cannot be widely utilized by microorganisms they can also be potential carbon sources for some particular plastic degrading microorganisms aravinthan et al 2016 green et al 2016 which supported the selective potentiality of specific microorganisms to microplastics in addition some microorganisms also prefer colonizing on hydrophobic surface of microplastics and interact with the substances krasowska and sigler 2014 based on the above we assume that the properties of microplastics to some extent influence the structure of microbial communities closely colonizing microplastics thus to get insight into the interaction between microplastics and the attached microorganism it was necessary to better understand the characteristics of microbial communities colonizing microplastics such as the community structure stability and the community assembly mechanism based on stochastic and deterministic models stegen et al 2015 de vries et al 2018 however the relevant information of microbial communities colonizing microplastics remains very limited in both water and sediments the microplastic degradation in natural environments is generally conducted by three processes including physical degradation chemical degradation and biodegradation shah et al 2008 ter halle et al 2017 ariza tarazona et al 2018 light and oxygen could cause the abiotic degradation of microplastics and enhance the microbial availability through photodegradation thermooxidative degradation and hydrolysis andrady 2011 actually light and oxygen become limited in deep sediments and redox condition becomes a key environmental factor for microplastic degradation in sediments which requires further study rogers et al 2020 redox condition is closely related with microbial community composition in sediment communities and plays a strong role in the metabolic processes of communities jørgensen 2019 under anoxic or anaerobic conditions microorganisms found on microplastics utilize either plastics or other organic matters surrounding microplastics as electron donors rogers et al 2020 in any case further research is needed to constrain the impacts of anoxic environments on microplastic degradation to date multiple anaerobic and facultative anaerobic plastic degrading bacterial strains have been successfully isolated from plastics via culture experiments kathiresan et al 2003 auta et al 2017 which might suggest the possible biodegradation of microplastics in anoxic sediments in anoxic zones organic matter is generally decomposed via fermentation denitrification sulfate reduction and methanotrophy wurzbacher et al 2017 tagg et al 2019 found higher abundance of the sulfate reducer on the plastic surface than that in the surrounding sediments which supported the possibility of plastic degradation in anaerobic processes environmental conditions varied vertically in sediments which might affect the microbial community assemblage and the biodegradation process of microplastics rogers et al 2020 however our knowledge about how microplastics are preserved or degraded by microbial communities in anoxic sediments is still not fully understood understanding the occurrence of microplastics and the colonization of microbial communities on microplastics in vertical profiles of river sediments are of great significance to identify the fate processes of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems thus the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the size distribution of microplastics in the vertical profile of river sediments 2 to investigate the difference in bacterial community assemblages colonizing microplastics and sediments by revealing the occurrence of indicative plastic degrading microbes and 3 to explore the potential biodegradation characteristics of microplastics in vertical sediment profiles 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection qinhuai river a tributary of the yangtze river is the largest urban river in nanjing city 32 03 n 118 46 e and is highly susceptible to microplastic pollutions due to high population densities and plastic containing wastewater discharge in qinhuai river the annual average velocity is about 0 22 m s the average flow is about 71 m3 s and the average sediment load is about 0 2 kg m3 zhang et al 2019 the sediment depth of qinghuai river is on average more than 50 cm the sediment was dredged almost every five years the sediment is mainly composed by silt while its color darkens gradually from 0 to 50 cm depth of sediments fifteen sampling sites a o were collected along the upstream and downstream of qinhuai river and have not been dredged from 2015 fig 1 six vertically parallel cores of sediments were sampled in april 2019 at each site using perspex tubes inner diameter 6 cm length 50 cm containing pistons and gravity corers ebs 442 hubei china wurzbacher et al 2017 the perspex tubes were washed three times with surface water in situ to remove the sediment attached on the tube each vertical core was sliced directly into five 10 cm thickness layers using a sterile knife in situ then was immediately stored at 4 c before the further measure of environmental characteristics and extraction of microplastics the vertical sediments from sites a d were also sampled to determine the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics and surrounding sediments all core samples were placed in glass containers and were taken to the laboratory for subsequent analyses 2 2 environmental characteristics of the sediments the ph and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and total organic carbon toc of sediments were assessed for each layer table 1 sediment water extract imitates the material composition of the sediment solution the ph of water extract of sediments was detected with a ph meter mettler toledo fe 28 zurich switzerland rzetala et al 2019 do was tested using the microelectrode before the slicing of vertical sediments unisense denmark the nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of sediments were determined using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa after extraction with potassium chloride solution 1 mol l zhang et al 2019 toc was analyzed with a toc analyzer multi n c3100 jena germany 2 3 extraction microplastics and enumeration of microplastics from the sediments sediment samples from two of the six vertically parallel cores in sites a d were sieved using laminated metal mesh screens 0 3 5 0 mm aperture to directly collect microplastics without any treatments the microplastics that could be visually identified were collected with sterilized metal tweezers under a stereo microscope some of microplastics were conducted using scanning electron microscopy sem analysis and some microplastics were stored at 20 c for bacterial dna extraction the classical method was used to screen microplastics from sediments masura and baker 2015 the remaining sediment samples from sites a o were treated to determine the microplastic concentrations the sediments were weighed after drying at 90 c for 24 h followed by adding a 0 05 mol l fe ii solution and 30 h2o2 to digest the organic matter the digested samples were dried again at 75 c for 24 h mixed with 300 ml of saturated nacl solution 5 mol l and stirred thoroughly with a sterile glass rod to separate the microplastics from sediments after settling for 24 h the water solution above the sediment layer was filtrated through a whatman gf b glass microfiber filter pore size 1 0 μm under vacuum filtration all beakers were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water until all plastic particles were transferred to the glass fiber filters microplastics 0 3 mm 5 mm were isolated and grouped according to the color size shape and texture of particles under a stereo microscope hk xtl2400 beijing china the representative particles 1 mm from each group were identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance ftir atr none of the instruments and experimental supplies was made of plastic such as the containers used in the experiment the metal tweezers glass bottles water and reagents used to treat the samples were sterile and plastic free all plastic particles were classified into six size categories including 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 3 mm 3 4 mm 4 5 mm and 5 mm 2 4 contact angle analysis the hydrophilicity of the microplastics was determined by measuring the microplastic contact angle which is affected by the type of functional groups and the roughness of the microplastic surfaces kolahchi et al 2015 for hydrophobic materials with the contact angle 90 the rougher the surface the larger the contact angle is in contrast for hydrophilic materials with that 90 the contact angle decreases with the increase in the roughness in this study the contact angles of polyethylene pe microplastic samples obtained at different depths were measured and the surface roughness was determined the samples were cleaned by ultrasonic wave in sterile water and anhydrous ethanol for three times separately and were dried naturally in a sterile operation box the dried microplastic particle was covered by a drop of water and then the contact angle between the edge of the water droplet and the surface of the microplastic was measured by the contact angle meter jy 82b nanjing china zhang et al 1999 2 5 sem analysis of microplastics and biofilms the morphology of microplastics and biofilms attached to the surface of the microplastics was characterized by sem sterile water was prepared by the autoclaving of ultrapure water microplastics covered by sediments were firstly washed using sterile water to remove the attached sediments and then were fixed with 2 5 freshly prepared glutaraldehyde for 8 h followed by a phosphoric acid buffer wash 3 10 min next samples fixed were dehydrated via a graded ethanol series 15 min each in 50 70 80 90 followed by 3 30 min in 100 ethanol and then were replaced with the tertiary butyl alcohol 3 30 min before the final samples were observed they were pre frozen at 20 c for 30 min and then freeze dried in vacuum for 60 min at last samples were coated with 30 nm of gold palladium using a hummer 6 2 sputter coater scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed with a su 3500 instrument tokyo japan 2 6 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy the chemical compositions of the microplastics were identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance ftir atr analysis nicolet is 10 wisconsin usa kupka et al 2018 the microplastics were dried at 50 c for 24 h and were placed on the automatic scanning table of the spectrometer with a spectrum range of 600 4000 µm the microplastic types were identified by comparing the obtained microplastic spectra to standard spectra of plastics such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the degree of weathering and degradation of the microplastics was determined by the relative content of the hydroxyl groups with a specific absorption peak at 1900 1600 cm 1 sathish et al 2019 2 7 dna extraction and sequencing the untreated microplastics from the same layer of two parallel cores were combined for sites a d separately before dna extraction all of the collected microplastics were washed with sterile water to remove the sediments bacterial dna was extracted from the biofilm colonizing microplastics and the surrounding sediments using the fastdna spin kit for soil mpbiomedicals solon oh usa a blank control a sterile water sample was design for dna extraction the dna quality was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis primers 341f and 806r were used to amplify the v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq platform by shanghai biozeron bio pharm technology co ltd 170 shanghai china sequences were processed using mothur v 1 37 0 http www mothur org as previously described schloss et al 2009 sequence data were sub sampled from the filtered data to reduce the biases arising from different sequencing depths across samples the remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity cutoff kumari et al 2017 the sequences were aligned using the silva compatible alignment reference database available in the mothur tool all sequence data obtained in this study were deposited in the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession number prjna594762 2 8 indicative plastic degrading bacteria screening the identified plastic degrading bacteria genera or species from other publications were summarized in this study table s1 according to the homologous theory the species of the same genus have more potentially close phylogenetic relationships and more similar metabolic properties vos et al 2009 mela et al 2012 due to the difficulties associated with the accurate identification of true plastic degrading bacterial communities by high throughput sequencing methods bukin et al 2019 we assumed that the bacterial genera containing plastic degrading bacteria reported in other studies have more potentially diverse species to degrade microplastics thus these summarized plastic degrading genera were screened from the bacterial data of microplastics and surrounding sediments and were defined as the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera of the true plastic degrading bacterial communities in this study however there remain some drawbacks about the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera firstly though intragenus species are prone to have similar functions of basic metabolisms ruiz et al 1999 ronkvist et al 2009 novotný et al 2015 the xenobiotic degrading property was not universally contained across the intragenus species lang et al 2010 thus the abundance of true plastic degrading bacteria on microplastics in urban river sediments was possibly overstated in this study nevertheless since the research on the isolation and identification of plastic degrading bacteria was relatively few in previous decades the number of published plastic degrading bacterial genera remains limited up to now hussein et al 2015 aravinthan et al 2016 if so the summarized reference database of plastic degrading bacterial genera might in contrast hinder the extent identification of indicative plastic degrading bacteria therefore the number of plastic degrading bacterial genera might also be underestimated in this study in total some specific technologies need to be conducted to accurately determine the plastic degrading bacterial communities e g the dna stable isotope probing technology roager and sonnenschein 2019 instead of the traditional isolation method 2 9 statistical analysis the chao 1 and evenness indices of the otus were calculated for each sample using past3 https folk uio no ohammer past picrust was used to predict the functions based on 16s rrna langille et al 2013 the statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp tool and a two sided welch s t test were used to explain the differences in energy metabolism between the bacterial communities of the two substrates the non parametric kruskal wallis h test and jonckheere terpstra test in spss 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa were used to determine the differences in the microplastic concentrations and bacterial alpha diversity indices between different sediment layers as well as the significance levels principal component analysis pca was used to assess the beta diversity of the samples permutational multivariate analysis permanova was performed to test the similarity of the bacterial communities at different depths canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed to evaluate the relationship between the environmental parameters and the bacterial community compositions using canoco 5 with 999 permutations http www canoco5 com the vegan ape and picante tools in the r package were used to calculate the assembly mechanism of bacterial communities based on the weighted beta nearest taxon index β nti and the bray curtis based raup crick metric rcbray li et al 2019 the co occurrence networks of the bacterial communities were determined by calculating the spearman s correlation coefficient between the otus li et al 2019 the bacterial co occurrence networks were calculated for the microplastics with 17 bacterial samples and the sediments with 20 bacterial communities respectively only otus that occurred in at least 4 communities were used in the networks and the significant correlations p values 0 001 rho values 0 8 between the otus were used to determine the co occurrence networks the software gephi 0 9 1 http gephi guthub io was used the spearman s correlation coefficients between the genera and environmental factors were calculated with the r package vegan 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical distribution characteristics of microplastics in urban river sediments microplastics were observed in all the five layers of the 15 sample sites a q in the qinhuai river fig 2 a table 2 similar to other studies pe average 48 and pp average 32 were the predominant types of microplastics followed by polymethyl methacrylate pmma 11 and polyurethane pu 5 in this study zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the average proportion of transparent microplastics was 35 9 across samples followed by green microplastics of 20 5 the mostly distributed shape of microplastics was fragments average 51 3 followed by fibers 45 5 the popularly distributed microplastics in qinhuai river were consistent in texture color and shape with those from other rivers such as suzhou river luo et al 2019 which indicated the microplastic composition and structure observed here might be a common characteristic of microplastic pollution in urban rivers at the number and size scales microplastics presented regular vertical profiles in the sediments of the qinhuai river the total concentration of microplastics in each layer of sediment cores was in the range of 163 563 items kg 1 wet sediments the mean standard error se concentration of microplastics in each layer across 15 sites increased with the increasing depth jonckheere terpstra p 0 001 fig 2b there were 20 42 9 38 25 92 9 19 30 50 6 08 41 17 9 91 and 46 92 13 34 items kg 1 in the 1st layer 0 10 cm 2nd layer 11 20 cm 3rd layer 21 30 cm 4th layer 31 40 cm and 5th layer 41 50 cm respectively the deeper the sampling layers the smaller the dominant size of microplastics was fig 2c among the five layers large microplastics 4 5 mm and 5 mm account for the highest proportion 40 5 in the 1st layer intermediate microplastics 2 4 mm present the highest proportion 41 9 of in the 3rd layer and small microplastics 2 0 mm have the highest proportion 63 5 in the 5th layer the average number of the smallest microplastics increased gradually from the 1st layer shallow layers to the 5th layer deep layers in contrast the number of largest microplastics decreased with the increasing depth it was reported that low numbers of microplastics have been detected in drinking water from groundwater sources panno et al 2019 mintenig et al 2019 the results observed in this study suggest that river sediments might be an important pathway to transport microplastics from surface water into groundwater the smaller microplastics in deep sediments pose a large risk to groundwater security and human health most microplastics discharged into rivers eventually sink into the sediments kaiser et al 2017 wang et al 2019 amounts of recent studies confirmed the occurrence as well as spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in top sediments 0 10 cm martin et al 2017 wang et al 2018 this study for the first time revealed the vertical distribution profile of microplastics with smaller size and larger number of microplastics in deeper urban river sediments 0 50 cm due to the low temperature and light intensity in sediments it is difficult for external physiochemical factors to contribute to the degradation of microplastics in sediments thus we try to discucss the possible reasons behind the phenomenon with three variables including resuspension bioturbation and biodegradation näkki et al 2017 xue et al 2020 in the top sediments resuspension may promote the upward transport of deposited microplastics due to the smaller density of microplastics than that of sediments quinn et al 2017 this maybe the reason that the number of microplastics decreases from 0 cm to 10 cm depth in south yellow sea sediments wang et al 2019 though the general abundance of microplastics increased with the five deepen sediment layers 0 50 cm fig 2 in this study the distribution characteristics of microplastics in the scale of the top sediments of rivers remain unknown the hydrodynamic disturbance caused by water flow and seasonal rains could result in the resuspension of the top sediments of rivers rather than the deep sediments rennie et al 2004 reardon et al 2014 naqshband et al 2014 thus the distribution characteristics of microplastics in the top sediments of rivers maybe different from that in the deep sediments and need to be investigated particularly it was considered that the bioturbation might be responsible for the vertical transport of microplastics in coastal fishing area sediments xue et al 2020 since the activity of benthic animals can make the sediments loose and potentially lead to the sinking of smaller particles through the gaps among large particles näkki et al 2017 generally 95 benthic animals especially invertebrates live in the top 10 cm sediments while the activity of benthic animals can pose disturbance to the shallow layers of sediments ye et al 2017 therefore bioturbation should be one of the influening factors for the transport of microplastics in shallow layers of sediments but not the main factor in deep layers due to the rare migration of benthic organisms there in recent years more and more plastic degrading bacterial strains were isolated from different kinds of environments including insect intestines activated sludge marine sediments and so on nauendorf et al 2015 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the potential of microplastic degradation by bacteria has been confirmed in laboratory tests moharir and kumar 2019 most of the plastic degrading bacteria can secrete extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and hydrolyze the macromolecules of plastics into small molecules that can be extensively absorbed and metabolized by cells shah et al 2008 in this study sem identified the existence of bacteria colonizing on the surface and cracks of pe and pp in deep sediments figure s1 which implied the indispensable role of microorganisms in the generation of cracks in the surface of microplastics pe particles collected from different sediment layers were further characterized via contact angle measure sem and ftir atr analyses to confirm the biodegradation of microplastics for hydrophobic materials e g microplastics the larger the contact angle the rougher the surface is and the greater the number of hydrophobic functional groups is karim et al 2018 the average contact angles of microplastics increased from 87 3 to 99 5 with the increased depth fig 3 a which indicated the rougher surface and more hydrophobic functional groups in deep layers the sem images confirmed that the surfaces of the microplastics were rougher in the deeper layers than in the shallower layers studies suggested that the rough fragments on the microplastic surface were produced under the action of microorganisms fig 3b syranidou et al 2017 the results of ftir atr also confirmed the presence of carbonyl groups hydrophobic functional groups which indicated the degradation of the microplastics paco et al 2017 the average transmittance of characteristic peaks of carbonyl group at wavelengths of 1900 1600 cm 1 increased from 2 8 in the 1st layer to 4 9 in the 5th layer fig 3c from the above we assumed that the concentration and size variations of microplastics in the vertical river sediments were possibly associated with the microbial degradation of microplastics 3 2 bacterial community and functional assemblages associated with microplastics and surrounding sediments except microplastic samples in c3 d1 and d3 microbial communities were detected from the remaining microplastic and sediment samples of five layers at four sites a d a total of 13857 and 19284 otus were detected in the microplastic and sediment samples respectively the bacterial α diversity of the microplastics was lower than that of the surrounding sediments the mean se evenness indices of the bacterial communities were 0 15 0 08 in the microplastics and 0 21 0 04 in the sediments and the mean se chao 1 indices were 5340 84 2523 92 in the microplastics and 7586 45 1337 33 in the sediments figure s2 and s3 the α diversity of the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics was not significantly different between the different layers but was significantly different between the microplastics and the sediments and the significance level increased with the increasing depth multiple function differences between bacterial communities on microplastics and those in sediments were observed at the level 2 and level 3 of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthology at the level 2 the xenobiotic biodegradation function of the microbial communities colonizing microplastics showed the highest difference to surrounding sediments with the mean proportion of 3 38 p values 0 05 fig 4 a xenobiotic substances indicate any foreign substances or exogenous chemicals such as benzoate styrene chloroalkane chloroalkene and microplastics fig 4b vargas suarez et al 2019 suggested that polymers such as polyacrylic acid and polyurethane could be xenobiotics for microbial communities unlike the complex and diverse xenobiotics in sediments microplastics are the main xenobiotic that could be metabolized by microbes colonizing microplastics besides the membrane transport function of the bacterial community on microplastics in the level 2 was significant stronger than that in sediments the secretion of extracellular hydrolase enzymes by microorganisms was involved in membrane transport function chen et al 2020 which implied that the microbes on microplastics secreted more hydrolytic enzymes to degrade microplastics than that in sediments thus our results indicated that microbes on the microplastics showed stronger potential to degrade microplastics than that in sediments thirty three indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera such as pseudomonas flavobacterium nocardia and so on were summarized here based on previous studies table s1 and their degrading ability has also been confirmed by laboratory culture experiments moharir and kumar 2019 in this study the difference of bacterial community compositions between microplastics and sediments was identified by these indicative plastic degrading bacteria fig 5 a the average relative abundance of the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera colonizing microplastics was 21 37 but only 4 33 in sediments all of the top abundance genera on microplastics such as pseudomonas halomonas ralstonia and flavobacterium were the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera fig 5b pca based on indicative plastic degrading bacteria showed that microplastic samples and sediment samples were separately clustered into different groups on the first principal component axis fig 5c which indicated that the compositions and structures of the indicative plastic degrading bacterial communities from microplastics and sediments were significantly distinct the obvious enrichment on microplastics further demonstrated the selectivity of plastic degrading bacteria to microplastics co occurrence network analysis was conducted to display the interactions among bacterial otus of microbial communities by analyzing the correlation between microorganisms barberán et al 2012 analyses of the co occurrence networks of bacterial communities on the microplastics and sediments were performed separately to determine the interactions between bacteria fig 6 otu nodes of microplastic network 2256 and sediment network 3405 were selected based on the spearman s correlations p values 0 001 rho values 0 8 the number of the nodes associated with indicative plastic degrading bacteria was higher in the co occurrence network of the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics than that in the sediments whatever the range of degree screened was fig 6a 6c and s4 the standard betweenness centrality represented the connection of a single microbe with functional modules the statistical analyses indicated that the standard betweenness centrality of the indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics was much larger than that colonizing in sediments fig 6g this result suggested that the indicative plastic degrading bacteria played a dominant role in the co occurrence network of microbial communities on the microplastics the positive negative correlations and average clustering coefficient within the bacterial network were calculated to characterize the cooperative and competitive interactions in the bacterial communities coyte et al 2015 it s verified that the strong cooperation and the weak competition could result in an unstable community de vries et al 2018 there was stronger frequency distribution of positive correlations in the co occurrence network of bacterial communities on the microplastics than that in the sediments fig 6e and 6f the results suggested stronger cooperative interaction in the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics the average clustering coefficient of the bacterial network on the microplastic was 0 141 whereas that in the sediments was 0 100 indicating closer cooperation in the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics besides the modularity index of bacterial network on the microplastics 0 632 was lower than that of the sediments 0 712 table 3 indicating less functional differentiation in bacterial communities on microplastics the higher modularity index in the bacterial community on the sediment bacterial network demonstrated greater stability and better resistance to changes in the environment barberán et al 2012 li et al 2019 the strong cooperation and weak functional differentiation in the bacterial communities on the microplastics indicated an unstable relationship of the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics and greater susceptibility to changes in environmental conditions based on the stochastic and deterministic models the assemblage mechanism of bacterial communities was further explored using weighted β nti in combination with rcbray stegen et al 2012 unlike in the sediments the homogeneous selection 57 3 was the dominant factor driving the assembly of bacterial communities colonizing microplastics fig 7 a which suggested that the related environmental conditions or stresses on microorganisms colonizing microplastics tend to be similar across microplastic samples stegen et al 2015 due to the different metabolic capacities of microorganisms to different carbon sources there would be obvious differences in the microbial communities using different carbon sources goldford et al 2018 unlike the complex heterogeneous substrates in the sediments the microplastics provided carbon sources with similar compositions for bacteria which resulted in the greater homogeneous selection to bacterial communities on microplastics 3 3 potential bacterial degradation of microplastics in vertical sediments in this study the indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics were screened in each sediment layer of qinhuai river the average abundance of indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics increased significantly with the deepened layers from 9 38 to 43 8 fig 5a the standard betweenness centrality of the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera was also higher in the deeper layers than that in the shallow layers fig 6h the betweenness centrality is a widely used measure index that reveals the important role of nodes in the information transfer between modules of the network booth et al 2019 thus these results implied that the indicative plastic degrading bacteria played more important roles in the microbial network on microplastics in the deeper layers than that in the shallow layers the influencing environmental factors on the distribution of indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics in river sediments were explored in this study canonical correspondence analysis showed that toc contributed the highest explanation 10 8 to the variation of indicative plastic degrading bacterial community compositions followed by do 8 0 toc primarily accounted for the different bacterial compositions between upstream sites a and b and downstream sites c and d since much lower toc and nh4 n concentrations in upstream sites than those in downstream sites ibekwe et al 2016 table 1 while do mainly explained the difference of indicative plastic degrading bacterial compositions among different layers fig 7b spearman s correlations suggested that the abundance of indicative plastic degrading bacteria on microplastics was mainly correlated with do average correlation coefficient of 0 6160 p 0 05 fig 7c nauendorf et al 2015 found that the do condition could affect the microbial mass colonizing different kinds of plastics this study further suggested that do was an important environmental factor influencing the structure of indicative plastic degrading bacterial communities as well as the abundance of indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics in vertical sediment environments in recent years more and more plastic degrading bacterial strains were isolated and cultured from anoxic and anaerobic environments including insect intestines activated sludge marine sediments and so on wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 nauendorf et al 2015 this study also found that as the do concentration declined from shallow to deep layers the anaerobic and facultative anaerobic indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics increased in abundance but not aerobic bacteria fig 7d and figure s5 halomonas was the most dominant anaerobic indicative plastic degrading bacteria in downstream sites of qinhuai river and the average abundance increased from 1 4 to 26 0 with the increased depth though halomonas was usually found in salty environments and endorheic lakes luque et al 2012 it was also found in urban river sediments and played roles in the processes of denitrification and hydrocarbon degradation oren 2010 zhang et al 2019 porter et al 2018 revealed that halomonas can secrete cytochrome p450 monooxygenases and are able to catalyse hydroxylation and demethylation which processes are important for the degradation of plastics as the most dominant indicative plastic degrading bacteria in upstream sites fig 7d pseudomonas can also secrete diverse hydrolases such as esterases lipases and cutinases which are instrumental in plastic degradation ruiz et al 1999 ronkvist et al 2009 novotný et al 2015 kathiresan et al 2003 demonstrated that pseudomonas sp was able to degrade polyethylene by 20 54 within one month incubation anaerobically besides other anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria serratia bacillus paraburkholderia rahnella and staphylococcus were also demonstrated the ability of degrading plastics priyanka et al 2011 nowak et al 2011 azeko et al 2015 acevedo et al 2018 lee et al 2019 these results above suggested that the anaerobic and facultative anaerobic indicative plastic degrading bacteria accumulated on microplastics contribute to the biodegradation of microplastics in deep sediments in total the results of this study suggested that the degradation of microplastics was potentially enhanced by microbial communities on microplastics especially in the deep sediment layers 4 conclusions in the river ecosystem the fate of microplastics is complex and unclear both abiotic and biotic processes can cause the changes of microplastics in the spatial distribution and properties in rivers näkki et al 2017 xue et al 2020 this study revealed the distribution of microplastics in deep river sediments and demonstrated the plastic degrading bacteria played an important role in microbial community assemblages and microbial network structure on microplastics providing new insight into the difference between microbial communities colonizing microplastics and other substrates the highest proportion of small microplastic particles were found in the deep sediment layers the increased abundance and the standard betweenness centrality of plastic degrading bacteria on the microplastics and the characterization of microplastics via contact angle measure sem and ftir atr confirmed the deeper sediment layers benefited the biodegradation of microplastics moreover the plastic degrading microbial communities colonizing microplastics significantly correlated with toc and do this suggested the plastic degrading bacteria were the crucial factor for the degradation of microplastics and the deeper sediment conditions may promote the biodegradation of microplastics however the degradation mechanism of microplastics in the environment are rarely known this study provides a way to elucidate that mechanism by revealing the occurrence of degrading bacteria and exploring the interaction between microorganisms and microplastics as well as microorganisms and environmental conditions

17403,sediments have been found to be one of the most important reservoirs for microplastics providing abundant indigenous microbes the processes involved in the distribution and degradation behavior of microplastics are complex this study investigated the vertical distribution of microplastics with the size 5 mm and the bacterial community assemblages colonizing microplastics in urban river sediments at a depth from 0 to 50 cm the results showed that both microplastics and associated microbial communities presented vertical profiles in river sediments the mean concentration of microplastics increased from the shallow layers to the deep layers of sediments and smaller microplastic particles were dominant in deeper layers a greater degradation of microplastics in deeper layers was confirmed by contact angle measurements scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance analyses unlike the surrounding sediments the whole bacterial communities on microplastics exhibited higher frequency of positive correlations in the bacterial co occurrence network which indicated a less stability of bacterial communities on microplastics the indicative plastic degrading bacteria with an average abundance of 4 33 was found in the surrounding sediments while on the microplastics 21 37 was found from shallow layers to deep layers the indicative plastic degrading bacteria significantly increased both in the abundance and in their betweenness centrality in the co occurrence network which suggested a potentially primary role of these bacteria in the degradation of microplastics in deep layers this study provides new insight into the vertical distribution and the potential microbial degrading characteristics of microplastics in urban river sediments which expanded our understanding of the fate of microplastics in aquatic environments the observed results implied a great risk that microplastics might become smaller and more in deepened sediments and finally migrate into groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vertical sediment microplastic size biodegradation stability contact angle measurement 1 introduction in recent years numerous reports have highlighted the worsening microplastic pollution in oceans and rivers this topic has attracted great attention from various fields auta et al 2017 horton et al 2017 it was estimated that 8 300 million metric tons mt of plastic have been produced by mid 2017 and the amount of plastic waste in aquatic ecosystems was forecasted to reach 12 000 mt by the end of 2050 geyer et al 2017 microplastics a kind of small plastic particles 5 mm diameter is an important vector of various pollutants such as heavy metals antibiotics and other organic contaminants hodson et al 2017 he et al 2018 microplastics can be easily ingested by aquatic organisms resulting in physical obstructions and entanglements of their digestive systems as well as chronic toxicity due to the adsorbed chemical contaminants frydkjaer et al 2017 this has posed great threats to organisms and resulted in the damage of aquatic ecosystems gutow et al 2016 unlike other degradable substances microplastics are persistent not easily biodegraded and quite stable in the environment which causes long term damage to ecosystems lusher et al 2014 therefore understanding the distribution and degradation behavior of microplastics is important tasks for the remediation of microplastic pollution in aquatic environments environmental behavior of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems refers to temporal and spatial processes attributed to crushing and degradation by physicochemical and biological processes such as light radiation heat radiation and microbial degradation cole et al 2011 li et al 2018 roager and sonnenschein 2019 recent research on marine microplastic pollution indicates the presence of large amounts of microplastics in the surface water of rivers qu et al 2017 it is generally believed that microplastics do not exist independently in the water because of the colonization of biofilms on microplastics and the heteropolymerization of microplastics with other impurities which would promote the sinking of microplastics li et al 2019 studies confirm the presence of microplastics in surface water and top sediments with the depth of 0 10 cm wang et al 2018 fu and wang 2019 dong et al 2020 some research explored the vertical distribution of microplastics within the lake sediments with the depth of 0 60 cm and further discussed the possibility of using microplastics as an indicator of the anthropocene lewis and maslin 2015 martin et al 2017 some microplastics have also been detected in drinking water from groundwater sources panno et al 2019 river sediment or hyporheic zone is an important pathway for the exchange of microplastics between surface water and groundwater frei et al 2019 panno et al 2019 to date information on the vertical profile of microplastics and the microplastic behavior in deep urban river sediments with the depth more than 10 cm remains unknown which is crucial to clarify the environmental behavior and fate of microplastics in aquatic environments microplastics are generally considered as persistent organic substances and provide a huge ecological niche for the colonization of microbial communities kooi et al 2017 rummel et al 2017 a number of studies have been conducted to study the interactions between microplastics and microorganisms colonizing microplastics which would affect the environmental behavior of microplastics by changing the physical or chemical characteristics of microplastic particles rummel et al 2017 roager and sonnenschein 2019 oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 however there was no consensus on whether these microorganisms specifically choose plastics to colonize some studies suggested that the microbial communities on plastics are not substrate selective oberbeckmann et al 2016 for example the difference in the microbial community compositions between floating microplastics and other substrates such as stones and sediments was explained by the longevity and relative mobility of microplastics in the water column zettler et al 2013 fazey and ryan 2016 however multiple investigations showed that the microbial communities also differed between deposited microplastics and the surrounding sediments yet the result was suggested to be due to the limitation of nutrients or microplastics kirstein et al 2019 research in other areas revealed that the types of carbon sources largely drive the turnovers of microbial community compositions goldford et al 2018 though microplastics cannot be widely utilized by microorganisms they can also be potential carbon sources for some particular plastic degrading microorganisms aravinthan et al 2016 green et al 2016 which supported the selective potentiality of specific microorganisms to microplastics in addition some microorganisms also prefer colonizing on hydrophobic surface of microplastics and interact with the substances krasowska and sigler 2014 based on the above we assume that the properties of microplastics to some extent influence the structure of microbial communities closely colonizing microplastics thus to get insight into the interaction between microplastics and the attached microorganism it was necessary to better understand the characteristics of microbial communities colonizing microplastics such as the community structure stability and the community assembly mechanism based on stochastic and deterministic models stegen et al 2015 de vries et al 2018 however the relevant information of microbial communities colonizing microplastics remains very limited in both water and sediments the microplastic degradation in natural environments is generally conducted by three processes including physical degradation chemical degradation and biodegradation shah et al 2008 ter halle et al 2017 ariza tarazona et al 2018 light and oxygen could cause the abiotic degradation of microplastics and enhance the microbial availability through photodegradation thermooxidative degradation and hydrolysis andrady 2011 actually light and oxygen become limited in deep sediments and redox condition becomes a key environmental factor for microplastic degradation in sediments which requires further study rogers et al 2020 redox condition is closely related with microbial community composition in sediment communities and plays a strong role in the metabolic processes of communities jørgensen 2019 under anoxic or anaerobic conditions microorganisms found on microplastics utilize either plastics or other organic matters surrounding microplastics as electron donors rogers et al 2020 in any case further research is needed to constrain the impacts of anoxic environments on microplastic degradation to date multiple anaerobic and facultative anaerobic plastic degrading bacterial strains have been successfully isolated from plastics via culture experiments kathiresan et al 2003 auta et al 2017 which might suggest the possible biodegradation of microplastics in anoxic sediments in anoxic zones organic matter is generally decomposed via fermentation denitrification sulfate reduction and methanotrophy wurzbacher et al 2017 tagg et al 2019 found higher abundance of the sulfate reducer on the plastic surface than that in the surrounding sediments which supported the possibility of plastic degradation in anaerobic processes environmental conditions varied vertically in sediments which might affect the microbial community assemblage and the biodegradation process of microplastics rogers et al 2020 however our knowledge about how microplastics are preserved or degraded by microbial communities in anoxic sediments is still not fully understood understanding the occurrence of microplastics and the colonization of microbial communities on microplastics in vertical profiles of river sediments are of great significance to identify the fate processes of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems thus the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the size distribution of microplastics in the vertical profile of river sediments 2 to investigate the difference in bacterial community assemblages colonizing microplastics and sediments by revealing the occurrence of indicative plastic degrading microbes and 3 to explore the potential biodegradation characteristics of microplastics in vertical sediment profiles 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection qinhuai river a tributary of the yangtze river is the largest urban river in nanjing city 32 03 n 118 46 e and is highly susceptible to microplastic pollutions due to high population densities and plastic containing wastewater discharge in qinhuai river the annual average velocity is about 0 22 m s the average flow is about 71 m3 s and the average sediment load is about 0 2 kg m3 zhang et al 2019 the sediment depth of qinghuai river is on average more than 50 cm the sediment was dredged almost every five years the sediment is mainly composed by silt while its color darkens gradually from 0 to 50 cm depth of sediments fifteen sampling sites a o were collected along the upstream and downstream of qinhuai river and have not been dredged from 2015 fig 1 six vertically parallel cores of sediments were sampled in april 2019 at each site using perspex tubes inner diameter 6 cm length 50 cm containing pistons and gravity corers ebs 442 hubei china wurzbacher et al 2017 the perspex tubes were washed three times with surface water in situ to remove the sediment attached on the tube each vertical core was sliced directly into five 10 cm thickness layers using a sterile knife in situ then was immediately stored at 4 c before the further measure of environmental characteristics and extraction of microplastics the vertical sediments from sites a d were also sampled to determine the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics and surrounding sediments all core samples were placed in glass containers and were taken to the laboratory for subsequent analyses 2 2 environmental characteristics of the sediments the ph and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and total organic carbon toc of sediments were assessed for each layer table 1 sediment water extract imitates the material composition of

slicing of vertical sediments unisense denmark the nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations of sediments were determined using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa after extraction with potassium chloride solution 1 mol l zhang et al 2019 toc was analyzed with a toc analyzer multi n c3100 jena germany 2 3 extraction microplastics and enumeration of microplastics from the sediments sediment samples from two of the six vertically parallel cores in sites a d were sieved using laminated metal mesh screens 0 3 5 0 mm aperture to directly collect microplastics without any treatments the microplastics that could be visually identified were collected with sterilized metal tweezers under a stereo microscope some of microplastics were conducted using scanning electron microscopy sem analysis and some microplastics were stored at 20 c for bacterial dna extraction the classical method was used to screen microplastics from sediments masura and baker 2015 the remaining sediment samples from sites a o were treated to determine the microplastic concentrations the sediments were weighed after drying at 90 c for 24 h followed by adding a 0 05 mol l fe ii solution and 30 h2o2 to digest the organic matter the digested samples were dried again at 75 c for 24 h mixed with 300 ml of saturated nacl solution 5 mol l and stirred thoroughly with a sterile glass rod to separate the microplastics from sediments after settling for 24 h the water solution above the sediment layer was filtrated through a whatman gf b glass microfiber filter pore size 1 0 μm under vacuum filtration all beakers were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water until all plastic particles were transferred to the glass fiber filters microplastics 0 3 mm 5 mm were isolated and grouped according to the color size shape and texture of particles under a stereo microscope hk xtl2400 beijing china the representative particles 1 mm from each group were identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance ftir atr none of the instruments and experimental supplies was made of plastic such as the containers used in the experiment the metal tweezers glass bottles water and reagents used to treat the samples were sterile and plastic free all plastic particles were classified into six size categories including 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 3 mm 3 4 mm 4 5 mm and 5 mm 2 4 contact angle analysis the hydrophilicity of the microplastics was determined by measuring the microplastic contact angle which is affected by the type of functional groups and the roughness of the microplastic surfaces kolahchi et al 2015 for hydrophobic materials with the contact angle 90 the rougher the surface the larger the contact angle is in contrast for hydrophilic materials with that 90 the contact angle decreases with the increase in the roughness in this study the contact angles of polyethylene pe microplastic samples obtained at different depths were measured and the surface roughness was determined the samples were cleaned by ultrasonic wave in sterile water and anhydrous ethanol for three times separately and were dried naturally in a sterile operation box the dried microplastic particle was covered by a drop of water and then the contact angle between the edge of the water droplet and the surface of the microplastic was measured by the contact angle meter jy 82b nanjing china zhang et al 1999 2 5 sem analysis of microplastics and biofilms the morphology of microplastics and biofilms attached to the surface of the microplastics was characterized by sem sterile water was prepared by the autoclaving of ultrapure water microplastics covered by sediments were firstly washed using sterile water to remove the attached sediments and then were fixed with 2 5 freshly prepared glutaraldehyde for 8 h followed by a phosphoric acid buffer wash 3 10 min next samples fixed were dehydrated via a graded ethanol series 15 min each in 50 70 80 90 followed by 3 30 min in 100 ethanol and then were replaced with the tertiary butyl alcohol 3 30 min before the final samples were observed they were pre frozen at 20 c for 30 min and then freeze dried in vacuum for 60 min at last samples were coated with 30 nm of gold palladium using a hummer 6 2 sputter coater scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed with a su 3500 instrument tokyo japan 2 6 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy the chemical compositions of the microplastics were identified using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance ftir atr analysis nicolet is 10 wisconsin usa kupka et al 2018 the microplastics were dried at 50 c for 24 h and were placed on the automatic scanning table of the spectrometer with a spectrum range of 600 4000 µm the microplastic types were identified by comparing the obtained microplastic spectra to standard spectra of plastics such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp the degree of weathering and degradation of the microplastics was determined by the relative content of the hydroxyl groups with a specific absorption peak at 1900 1600 cm 1 sathish et al 2019 2 7 dna extraction and sequencing the untreated microplastics from the same layer of two parallel cores were combined for sites a d separately before dna extraction all of the collected microplastics were washed with sterile water to remove the sediments bacterial dna was extracted from the biofilm colonizing microplastics and the surrounding sediments using the fastdna spin kit for soil mpbiomedicals solon oh usa a blank control a sterile water sample was design for dna extraction the dna quality was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis primers 341f and 806r were used to amplify the v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq platform by shanghai biozeron bio pharm technology co ltd 170 shanghai china sequences were processed using mothur v 1 37 0 http www mothur org as previously described schloss et al 2009 sequence data were sub sampled from the filtered data to reduce the biases arising from different sequencing depths across samples the remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on a 97 similarity cutoff kumari et al 2017 the sequences were aligned using the silva compatible alignment reference database available in the mothur tool all sequence data obtained in this study were deposited in the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession number prjna594762 2 8 indicative plastic degrading bacteria screening the identified plastic degrading bacteria genera or species from other publications were summarized in this study table s1 according to the homologous theory the species of the same genus have more potentially close phylogenetic relationships and more similar metabolic properties vos et al 2009 mela et al 2012 due to the difficulties associated with the accurate identification of true plastic degrading bacterial communities by high throughput sequencing methods bukin et al 2019 we assumed that the bacterial genera containing plastic degrading bacteria reported in other studies have more potentially diverse species to degrade microplastics thus these summarized plastic degrading genera were screened from the bacterial data of microplastics and surrounding sediments and were defined as the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera of the true plastic degrading bacterial communities in this study however there remain some drawbacks about the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera firstly though intragenus species are prone to have similar functions of basic metabolisms ruiz et al 1999 ronkvist et al 2009 novotný et al 2015 the xenobiotic degrading property was not universally contained across the intragenus species lang et al 2010 thus the abundance of true plastic degrading bacteria on microplastics in urban river sediments was possibly overstated in this study nevertheless since the research on the isolation and identification of plastic degrading bacteria was relatively few in previous decades the number of published plastic degrading bacterial genera remains limited up to now hussein et al 2015 aravinthan et al 2016 if so the summarized reference database of plastic degrading bacterial genera might in contrast hinder the extent identification of indicative plastic degrading bacteria therefore the number of plastic degrading bacterial genera might also be underestimated in this study in total some specific technologies need to be conducted to accurately determine the plastic degrading bacterial communities e g the dna stable isotope probing technology roager and sonnenschein 2019 instead of the traditional isolation method 2 9 statistical analysis the chao 1 and evenness indices of the otus were calculated for each sample using past3 https folk uio no ohammer past picrust was used to predict the functions based on 16s rrna langille et al 2013 the statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp tool and a two sided welch s t test were used to explain the differences in energy metabolism between the bacterial communities of the two substrates the non parametric kruskal wallis h test and jonckheere terpstra test in spss 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa were used to determine the differences in the microplastic concentrations and bacterial alpha diversity indices between different sediment layers as well as the significance levels principal component analysis pca was used to assess the beta diversity of the samples permutational multivariate analysis permanova was performed to test the similarity of the bacterial communities at different depths canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed to evaluate the relationship between the environmental parameters and the bacterial community compositions using canoco 5 with 999 permutations http www canoco5 com the vegan ape and picante tools in the r package were used to calculate the assembly mechanism of bacterial communities based on the weighted beta nearest taxon index β nti and the bray curtis based raup crick metric rcbray li et al 2019 the co occurrence networks of the bacterial communities were determined by calculating the spearman s correlation coefficient between the otus li et al 2019 the bacterial co occurrence networks were calculated for the microplastics with 17 bacterial samples and the sediments with 20 bacterial communities respectively only otus that occurred in at least 4 communities were used in the networks and the significant correlations p values 0 001 rho values 0 8 between the otus were used to determine the co occurrence networks the software gephi 0 9 1 http gephi guthub io was used the spearman s correlation coefficients between the genera and environmental factors were calculated with the r package vegan 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical distribution characteristics of microplastics in urban river sediments microplastics were observed in all the five layers of the 15 sample sites a q in the qinhuai river fig 2 a table 2 similar to other studies pe average 48 and pp average 32 were the predominant types of microplastics followed by polymethyl methacrylate pmma 11 and polyurethane pu 5 in this study zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the average proportion of transparent microplastics was 35 9 across samples followed by green microplastics of 20 5 the mostly distributed shape of microplastics was fragments average 51 3 followed by fibers 45 5 the popularly distributed microplastics in qinhuai river were consistent in texture color and shape with those from other rivers such as suzhou river luo et al 2019 which indicated the microplastic composition and structure observed here might be a common characteristic of microplastic pollution in urban rivers at the number and size scales microplastics presented regular vertical profiles in the sediments of the qinhuai river the total concentration of microplastics in each layer of sediment cores was in the range of 163 563 items kg 1 wet sediments the mean standard error se concentration of microplastics in each layer across 15 sites increased with the increasing depth jonckheere terpstra p 0 001 fig 2b there were 20 42 9 38 25 92 9 19 30 50 6 08 41 17 9 91 and 46 92 13 34 items kg 1 in the 1st layer 0 10 cm 2nd layer 11 20 cm 3rd layer 21 30 cm 4th layer 31 40 cm and 5th layer 41 50 cm respectively the deeper the sampling layers the smaller the dominant size of microplastics was fig 2c among the five layers large microplastics 4 5 mm and 5 mm account for the highest proportion 40 5 in the 1st layer intermediate microplastics 2 4 mm present the highest proportion 41 9 of in the 3rd layer and small microplastics 2 0 mm have the highest proportion 63 5 in the 5th layer the average number of the smallest microplastics increased gradually from the 1st layer shallow layers to the 5th layer deep layers in contrast the number of largest microplastics decreased with the increasing depth it was reported that low numbers of microplastics have been detected in drinking water from groundwater sources panno et al 2019 mintenig et al 2019 the results observed in this study suggest that river sediments might be an important pathway to transport microplastics from surface water into groundwater the smaller microplastics in deep sediments pose a large risk to groundwater security and human health most microplastics discharged into rivers eventually sink into the sediments kaiser et al 2017 wang et al 2019 amounts of recent studies confirmed the occurrence as well as spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in top sediments 0 10 cm martin et al 2017 wang et al 2018 this study for the first time revealed the vertical distribution profile of microplastics with smaller size and larger number of microplastics in deeper urban river sediments 0 50 cm due to the low temperature and light intensity in sediments it is difficult for external physiochemical factors to contribute to the degradation of microplastics in sediments thus we try to discucss the possible reasons behind the phenomenon with three variables including resuspension bioturbation and biodegradation näkki et al 2017 xue et al 2020 in the top sediments resuspension may promote the upward transport of deposited microplastics due to the smaller density of microplastics than that of sediments quinn et al 2017 this maybe the reason that the number of microplastics decreases from 0 cm to 10 cm depth in south yellow sea sediments wang et al 2019 though the general abundance of microplastics increased with the five deepen sediment layers 0 50 cm fig 2 in this study the distribution characteristics of microplastics in the scale of the top sediments of rivers remain unknown the hydrodynamic disturbance caused by water flow and seasonal rains could result in the resuspension of the top sediments of rivers rather than the deep sediments rennie et al 2004 reardon et al 2014 naqshband et al 2014 thus the distribution characteristics of microplastics in the top sediments of rivers maybe different from that in the deep sediments and need to be investigated particularly it was considered that the bioturbation might be responsible for the vertical transport of microplastics in coastal fishing area sediments xue et al 2020 since the activity of benthic animals can make the sediments loose and potentially lead to the sinking of smaller particles through the gaps among large particles näkki et al 2017 generally 95 benthic animals especially invertebrates live in the top 10 cm sediments while the activity of benthic animals can pose disturbance to the shallow layers of sediments ye et al 2017 therefore bioturbation should be one of the influening factors for the transport of microplastics in shallow layers of sediments but not the main factor in deep layers due to the rare migration of benthic organisms there in recent years more and more plastic degrading bacterial strains were isolated from different kinds of environments including insect intestines activated sludge marine sediments and so on nauendorf et al 2015 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the potential of microplastic degradation by bacteria has been confirmed in laboratory tests moharir and kumar 2019 most of the plastic degrading bacteria can secrete extracellular hydrolytic enzymes and hydrolyze the macromolecules of plastics into small molecules that can be extensively absorbed and metabolized by cells shah et al 2008 in this study sem identified the existence of bacteria colonizing on the surface and cracks of pe and pp in deep sediments figure s1 which implied the indispensable role of microorganisms in the generation of cracks in the surface of microplastics pe particles collected from different sediment layers were further characterized via contact angle measure sem and ftir atr analyses to confirm the biodegradation of microplastics for hydrophobic materials e g microplastics the larger the contact angle the rougher the surface is and the greater the number of hydrophobic functional groups is karim et al 2018 the average contact angles of microplastics increased from 87 3 to 99 5 with the increased depth fig 3 a which indicated the rougher surface and more hydrophobic functional groups in deep layers the sem images confirmed that the surfaces of the microplastics were rougher in the deeper layers than in the shallower layers studies suggested that the rough fragments on the microplastic surface were produced under the action of microorganisms fig 3b syranidou et al 2017 the results of ftir atr also confirmed the presence of carbonyl groups hydrophobic functional groups which indicated the degradation of the microplastics paco et al 2017 the average transmittance of characteristic peaks of carbonyl group at wavelengths of 1900 1600 cm 1 increased from 2 8 in the 1st layer to 4 9 in the 5th layer fig 3c from the above we assumed that the concentration and size variations of microplastics in the vertical river sediments were possibly associated with the microbial degradation of microplastics 3 2 bacterial community and functional assemblages associated with microplastics and surrounding sediments except microplastic samples in c3 d1 and d3 microbial communities were detected from the remaining microplastic and sediment samples of five layers at four sites a d a total of 13857 and 19284 otus were detected in the microplastic and sediment samples respectively the bacterial α diversity of the microplastics was lower than that of the surrounding sediments the mean se evenness indices of the bacterial communities were 0 15 0 08 in the microplastics and 0 21 0 04 in the sediments and the mean se chao 1 indices were 5340 84 2523 92 in the microplastics and 7586 45 1337 33 in the sediments figure s2 and s3 the α diversity of the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics was not significantly different between the different layers but was significantly different between the microplastics and the sediments and the significance level increased with the increasing depth multiple function differences between bacterial communities on microplastics and those in sediments were observed at the level 2 and level 3 of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthology at the level 2 the xenobiotic biodegradation function of the microbial communities colonizing microplastics showed the highest difference to surrounding sediments with the mean proportion of 3 38 p values 0 05 fig 4 a xenobiotic substances indicate any foreign substances or exogenous chemicals such as benzoate styrene chloroalkane chloroalkene and microplastics fig 4b vargas suarez et al 2019 suggested that polymers such as polyacrylic acid and polyurethane could be xenobiotics for microbial communities unlike the complex and diverse xenobiotics in sediments microplastics are the main xenobiotic that could be metabolized by microbes colonizing microplastics besides the membrane transport function of the bacterial community on microplastics in the level 2 was significant stronger than that in sediments the secretion of extracellular hydrolase enzymes by microorganisms was involved in membrane transport function chen et al 2020 which implied that the microbes on microplastics secreted more hydrolytic enzymes to degrade microplastics than that in sediments thus our results indicated that microbes on the microplastics showed stronger potential to degrade microplastics than that in sediments thirty three indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera such as pseudomonas flavobacterium nocardia and so on were summarized here based on previous studies table s1 and their degrading ability has also been confirmed by laboratory culture experiments moharir and kumar 2019 in this study the difference of bacterial community compositions between microplastics and sediments was identified by these indicative plastic degrading bacteria fig 5 a the average relative abundance of the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera colonizing microplastics was 21 37 but only 4 33 in sediments all of the top abundance genera on microplastics such as pseudomonas halomonas ralstonia and flavobacterium were the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera fig 5b pca based on indicative plastic degrading bacteria showed that microplastic samples and sediment samples were separately clustered into different groups on the first principal component axis fig 5c which indicated that the compositions and structures of the indicative plastic degrading bacterial communities from microplastics and sediments were significantly distinct the obvious enrichment on microplastics further demonstrated the selectivity of plastic degrading bacteria to microplastics co occurrence network analysis was conducted to display the interactions among bacterial otus of microbial communities by analyzing the correlation between microorganisms barberán et al 2012 analyses of the co occurrence networks of bacterial communities on the microplastics and sediments were performed separately to determine the interactions between bacteria fig 6 otu nodes of microplastic network 2256 and sediment network 3405 were selected based on the spearman s correlations p values 0 001 rho values 0 8 the number of the nodes associated with indicative plastic degrading bacteria was higher in the co occurrence network of the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics than that in the sediments whatever the range of degree screened was fig 6a 6c and s4 the standard betweenness centrality represented the connection of a single microbe with functional modules the statistical analyses indicated that the standard betweenness centrality of the indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics was much larger than that colonizing in sediments fig 6g this result suggested that the indicative plastic degrading bacteria played a dominant role in the co occurrence network of microbial communities on the microplastics the positive negative correlations and average clustering coefficient within the bacterial network were calculated to characterize the cooperative and competitive interactions in the bacterial communities coyte et al 2015 it s verified that the strong cooperation and the weak competition could result in an unstable community de vries et al 2018 there was stronger frequency distribution of positive correlations in the co occurrence network of bacterial communities on the microplastics than that in the sediments fig 6e and 6f the results suggested stronger cooperative interaction in the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics the average clustering coefficient of the bacterial network on the microplastic was 0 141 whereas that in the sediments was 0 100 indicating closer cooperation in the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics besides the modularity index of bacterial network on the microplastics 0 632 was lower than that of the sediments 0 712 table 3 indicating less functional differentiation in bacterial communities on microplastics the higher modularity index in the bacterial community on the sediment bacterial network demonstrated greater stability and better resistance to changes in the environment barberán et al 2012 li et al 2019 the strong cooperation and weak functional differentiation in the bacterial communities on the microplastics indicated an unstable relationship of the bacterial communities colonizing microplastics and greater susceptibility to changes in environmental conditions based on the stochastic and deterministic models the assemblage mechanism of bacterial communities was further explored using weighted β nti in combination with rcbray stegen et al 2012 unlike in the sediments the homogeneous selection 57 3 was the dominant factor driving the assembly of bacterial communities colonizing microplastics fig 7 a which suggested that the related environmental conditions or stresses on microorganisms colonizing microplastics tend to be similar across microplastic samples stegen et al 2015 due to the different metabolic capacities of microorganisms to different carbon sources there would be obvious differences in the microbial communities using different carbon sources goldford et al 2018 unlike the complex heterogeneous substrates in the sediments the microplastics provided carbon sources with similar compositions for bacteria which resulted in the greater homogeneous selection to bacterial communities on microplastics 3 3 potential bacterial degradation of microplastics in vertical sediments in this study the indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics were screened in each sediment layer of qinhuai river the average abundance of indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics increased significantly with the deepened layers from 9 38 to 43 8 fig 5a the standard betweenness centrality of the indicative plastic degrading bacterial genera was also higher in the deeper layers than that in the shallow layers fig 6h the betweenness centrality is a widely used measure index that reveals the important role of nodes in the information transfer between modules of the network booth et al 2019 thus these results implied that the indicative plastic degrading bacteria played more important roles in the microbial network on microplastics in the deeper layers than that in the shallow layers the influencing environmental factors on the distribution of indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics in river sediments were explored in this study canonical correspondence analysis showed that toc contributed the highest explanation 10 8 to the variation of indicative plastic degrading bacterial community compositions followed by do 8 0 toc primarily accounted for the different bacterial compositions between upstream sites a and b and downstream sites c and d since much lower toc and nh4 n concentrations in upstream sites than those in downstream sites ibekwe et al 2016 table 1 while do mainly explained the difference of indicative plastic degrading bacterial compositions among different layers fig 7b spearman s correlations suggested that the abundance of indicative plastic degrading bacteria on microplastics was mainly correlated with do average correlation coefficient of 0 6160 p 0 05 fig 7c nauendorf et al 2015 found that the do condition could affect the microbial mass colonizing different kinds of plastics this study further suggested that do was an important environmental factor influencing the structure of indicative plastic degrading bacterial communities as well as the abundance of indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics in vertical sediment environments in recent years more and more plastic degrading bacterial strains were isolated and cultured from anoxic and anaerobic environments including insect intestines activated sludge marine sediments and so on wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 nauendorf et al 2015 this study also found that as the do concentration declined from shallow to deep layers the anaerobic and facultative anaerobic indicative plastic degrading bacteria colonizing microplastics increased in abundance but not aerobic bacteria fig 7d and figure s5 halomonas was the most dominant anaerobic indicative plastic degrading bacteria in downstream sites of qinhuai river and the average abundance increased from 1 4 to 26 0 with the increased depth though halomonas was usually found in salty environments and endorheic lakes luque et al 2012 it was also found in urban river sediments and played roles in the processes of denitrification and hydrocarbon degradation oren 2010 zhang et al 2019 porter et al 2018 revealed that halomonas can secrete cytochrome p450 monooxygenases and are able to catalyse hydroxylation and demethylation which processes are important for the degradation of plastics as the most dominant indicative plastic degrading bacteria in upstream sites fig 7d pseudomonas can also secrete diverse hydrolases such as esterases lipases and cutinases which are instrumental in plastic degradation ruiz et al 1999 ronkvist et al 2009 novotný et al 2015 kathiresan et al 2003 demonstrated that pseudomonas sp was able to degrade polyethylene by 20 54 within one month incubation anaerobically besides other anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria serratia bacillus paraburkholderia rahnella and staphylococcus were also demonstrated the ability of degrading plastics priyanka et al 2011 nowak et al 2011 azeko et al 2015 acevedo et al 2018 lee et al 2019 these results above suggested that the anaerobic and facultative anaerobic indicative plastic degrading bacteria accumulated on microplastics contribute to the biodegradation of microplastics in deep sediments in total the results of this study suggested that the degradation of microplastics was potentially enhanced by microbial communities on microplastics especially in the deep sediment layers 4 conclusions in the river ecosystem the fate of microplastics is complex and unclear both abiotic and biotic processes can cause the changes of microplastics in the spatial distribution and properties in rivers näkki et al 2017 xue et al 2020 this study revealed the distribution of microplastics in deep river sediments and demonstrated the plastic degrading bacteria played an important role in microbial community assemblages and microbial network structure on microplastics providing new insight into the difference between microbial communities colonizing microplastics and other substrates the highest proportion of small microplastic particles were found in the deep sediment layers the increased abundance and the standard betweenness centrality of plastic degrading bacteria on the microplastics and the characterization of microplastics via contact angle measure sem and ftir atr confirmed the deeper sediment layers benefited the biodegradation of microplastics moreover the plastic degrading microbial communities colonizing microplastics significantly correlated with toc and do this suggested the plastic degrading bacteria were the crucial factor for the degradation of microplastics and the deeper sediment conditions may promote the biodegradation of microplastics however the degradation mechanism of microplastics in the environment are rarely known this study provides a way to elucidate that mechanism by revealing the occurrence of degrading bacteria and exploring the interaction between microorganisms and microplastics as well as microorganisms and environmental conditions

17404,understanding the temporal and spatial roles of nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth is necessary for developing successful management strategies chesapeake bay has well documented seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation but it remains unknown whether these patterns of nutrient limitation have changed in response to nutrient management efforts we analyzed historical data from nutrient bioassay experiments 1992 2002 and data from long term fixed site water quality monitoring program 1990 2017 to develop empirical approaches for predicting nutrient limitation in the surface waters of the mainstem bay results from classification and regression trees cart matched the seasonal and spatial patterns of bioassay based nutrient limitation in the 1992 2002 period much better than two simpler non statistical approaches an ensemble approach of three selected cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based results classification rate 99 this empirical approach can be used to characterize nutrient limitation from long term water quality monitoring data on much broader geographic and temporal scales than would be feasible using bioassays providing a new tool for informing water quality management results from our application of the approach to 21 tidal monitoring stations for the period of 2007 2017 showed modest changes in nutrient limitation patterns with expanded areas of nitrogen limitation and contracted areas of nutrient saturation i e not limited by nitrogen or phosphorus these changes imply that long term reductions in nitrogen load have led to expanded areas with nutrient limited phytoplankton growth in the bay reflecting long term water quality improvements in the context of nutrient enrichment however nutrient limitation patterns remain unchanged in the majority of the mainstem suggesting that nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve a less nutrient saturated ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient limitation phytoplankton bioassay water quality long term monitoring nutrient management 1 introduction nutrient enrichment has become a major issue in many coastal ecosystems around the world boesch et al 2001 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 boesch 2019 malone and newton 2020 chesapeake bay the largest estuary in north america has a long history of cultural eutrophication accompanied by excessive algal growth and seasonal hypoxia boesch et al 2001 hagy et al 2004 kemp et al 2005 such symptoms have been attributed in part to excessive nutrient and sediment loads from the watershed ator et al 2020 hagy et al 2004 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2011 noe et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 as seen in many other coastal systems boesch 2019 consequently coordinated management efforts among the bay state jurisdictions began in the 1980s to reduce nutrient and sediment loads from the watershed furthermore the chesapeake bay total maximum daily load tmdl was established in 2010 to enforce load reductions in order to improve habitat health that can fully support living resource survival growth and reproduction u s environmental protection agency 2010 the tmdl is designed to ensure that all pollution control measures needed to fully restore the bay and its tidal tributaries are in place by 2025 to control algal growth in aquatic ecosystems it is critical to understand growth limiting factors which may be nitrogen n phosphorus p light l silicon si temperature or others cloern et al 2014 conley 1999 elser et al 2007 hecky and kilham 1988 in general fresh waters are often considered to be p limited due to a high n p ratio in riverine sources e g fennel and testa 2019 and n fixation hecky and kilham 1988 schindler 1974 whereas marine waters are often considered to be primarily n limited due to sediment release of p slow n fixation and high denitrification hecky and kilham 1988 paerl 2018 estuaries are in the transitional zones between freshwater and marine systems thereby often exhibiting more complicated patterns in nutrient limitation cloern et al 2014 elser et al 2007 for example tidal waters of chesapeake bay have shown occurrences of n p l and si limitation that vary in space and time conley and malone 1992 fisher et al 1999 1992 malone et al 1996 to understand the seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation in chesapeake bay bioassay experiments were conducted from a set of locations fig 1 a between 1992 and 2002 under controlled near surface light conditions fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 the results were synthesized in kemp et al 2005 to illustrate the seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation in that period fig 1b such patterns demonstrate the necessity of a dual nutrient management strategy u s environmental protection agency 2010 and have informed the development of the chesapeake bay estuary model cerco and noel 2017 in the chesapeake bay watershed large scale dual nutrient reduction goals have been in place for decades leading to an overall long term reduction in total n tn load to the bay ator et al 2019 chanat et al 2016 chanat and yang 2018 hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a 2015 total p tp load to the bay declined in the 1980s to early 1990s due to improved wastewater treatment and phosphate detergent bans however tp load increased dramatically since the mid 1990s largely due to reduced sediment trapping as sediment storage has neared full capacity in conowingo reservoir on the susquehanna river the largest tributary to the bay hirsch 2012 langland 2015 zhang et al 2013 2016b while the n load reduction is primarily associated with nitrate the p load increase from the susquehanna river is primarily associated with particulate p although dissolved orthophosphate load from the susquehanna has also increased substantially in recent years fanelli et al 2019 this contrast in the direction of n and p trends and the form specific differences suggests that there have been changes in the ratios of nutrients for phytoplankton growth and thus changes in nutrient limitation on a bay wide scale unfortunately bioassay experiments have not been conducted since 2005 to characterize recent conditions of nutrient limitation our main objective was to test the above hypothesis through an analysis of historical data from nutrient bioassay experiments 1992 2002 and surface collected data from the chesapeake bay program cbp long term fixed site water quality monitoring network 1990 2017 the specific goals are as follows 1 to develop empirical approaches to predict bioassay based measures of nutrient limitation response variable using tidal water quality monitoring data in the concurrent period of 1992 2002 goal 1 and 2 to apply the selected approach to tidal water quality monitoring data in more recent periods without bioassay data to predict nutrient limitation and explore potential changes in response to altered nutrient loading goal 2 this research provides updated information specific to chesapeake bay management and research communities regarding the spatial and seasonal patterns in nutrient limitation more broadly we propose that this approach can be applied in any estuary with similar long term monitoring data to address similar questions 2 data 2 1 bioassays bioassay experiments were conducted between 1992 and 2002 to characterize the response of algal growth or biomass accumulation to nutrient additions at six mainstem stations fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 these stations namely cb2 1 cb3 3c cb4 3c cb5 2 cb6 1 and cb6 4 had 18 245 264 265 13 and 13 bioassay samples respectively kemp et al 2005 synthesized these bioassay data to characterize the nutrient limitation class for each station month combination for the period of 1992 2002 fig 1b this data set of nutrient limitation has 72 records i e 6 stations x 12 months 72 records among the limitation classes n and p limitations were defined as increases in phytoplankton productivity pp and biomass pb with n and p additions respectively normalized to controls np limitation was defined as increases in pp and pb only with simultaneous additions of n and p l limitation was defined as no differential growth response between the controls and np treatments although all grew equally well when held at 60 light due to high ambient n and p concentrations to be more precise we changed the term l limitation to nor i e no significant response to nutrient additions this category contains but is not limited to l limitation although other limitation factors e g trace metals and si were unlikely hereafter the response categories reported are nor n limitation p limitation and np limitation 2 2 water quality monitoring data the cbp partnership maintains a long term tidal water quality monitoring program fig 1a at 100 stations distributed along the mainstem bay and its tidal tributaries tango and batiuk 2016 u s environmental protection agency 2010 these stations have been sampled consistently since 1985 the field and laboratory methods and quality control protocols are documented in chesapeake bay program 2017 we downloaded tidal water quality monitoring data for the period of 1990 2017 from the cbp water quality database https datahub chesapeakebay net which consists of more than three million values of various physical chemical and biological parameters these downloaded data as well as subsequently processed data are archived in zhang 2020 the availability of initially selected parameters at the mainstem stations is summarized in figure s1 downloaded data in the period of 1992 2002 were processed to produce an aggregated data set for each station month combination i e 6 stations x 12 months 72 records see data manipulation in supplementary materials for details this data set and the bioassay based data set both having 72 records were used in our empirical approach development goal 1 similarly downloaded data in the period of 2007 2017 were processed to produce an aggregated data set for analysis for goal 2 this period was chosen because it has an average annual flow 77 850 m3 s 1 comparable to 1992 2002 77 570 m3 s 1 thereby allowing for a fair comparison between the two periods regarding nutrient limitation given the strong association of river flow and nutrient availability moreover the above data manipulations for both periods were expanded to a larger suite of stations n 21 including the six stations that had bioassay data fig 1a 3 methods for goal 1 three empirical approaches were developed to relate tidal monitoring data collected during the period from 1992 to 2002 to bioassay based nutrient limitation classes at the six mainstem stations developed using bioassay data from the same period sections 3 1 3 3 we considered two non statistical approaches a1 and a2 that used only dissolved inorganic n din and dissolved inorganic p dip data and one statistical approach a3 that used din dip and other monitored variables see fig 2 for an overview of these approaches and associated analyses for goal 2 the selected approach was applied to tidal monitoring data from 2007 to 2017 to explore potential changes in nutrient limitation section 3 4 3 1 probability based approach a1 the first approach is a probability based approach a1 for each of the 72 station month pairs all din and dip concentration data from 1992 to 2002 were extracted from the originally downloaded data these concentrations were compared with the bloom limiting thresholds for din 0 07 mg l 1 and dip 0 007 mg l 1 respectively to compute the probabilities of below threshold din and dip for each station and month 1 probability of below threshold din count of din values less than 0 07 mg l 1 count of all din values 2 probability of below threshold dip count of dip values less than 0 007 mg l 1 count of all dip values it was previously documented that concentrations above these thresholds are associated with a lack of response to nutrient additions buchanan et al 2005 fisher and gustafson 2003 these thresholds were derived from bioassays as general reference values for algal response but they may not lead to accurate predictions of nutrient limitation at all locations or in all months due to spatial and temporal variability in controls of nutrient limitation the computed probabilities were then converted to nutrient limitation classes as follows 1 if the probability of below threshold din i e din 0 07 mg l 1 50 class n 2 if the probability of below threshold dip i e dip 0 007 mg l 1 50 class p 3 if both probabilities 40 class np 4 else class nor these probability based classes were compared with the bioassay based classes n 72 to compute the classification rate i e number of matched cases 72 x 100 which is served as a quantitative measure of the performance of approach a1 3 2 index based approach a2 the second approach is an index based approach a2 like a1 for each of the 72 station month pairs all din and dip concentration data from 1992 to 2002 were extracted from the originally downloaded data these concentrations were compared with the bloom limiting thresholds to compute n and p indices as follows 1 if din 0 07 mg l 1 n index 1 and p index 0 2 if dip 0 007 mg l 1 n index 0 and p index 1 3 if both conditions are met n index 0 5 and p index 0 5 4 if neither condition is met n index 0 and p index 0 for each station month pair the relevant indices were averaged over the period of record to compute the aggregated indices which were converted to nutrient limitation classes as follows 1 if n index 0 5 class n 2 if p index 0 5 class p 3 if both indices 0 4 class np 4 else class nor these index based classes were compared with the bioassay based classes n 72 to compute the classification rate of approach a2 3 3 tree based approach a3 the third approach is a statistical approach a3 which is centered on the classification and regression tree cart cart has three unique advantages 1 it is a well established machine learning method for classification breiman 1984 loh 2014 and has been widely used in hydrological and marine studies e g testa et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 2 it can consider multiple independent variables simultaneously and thus utilize information beyond din and dip concentrations or indices e g water temperature and 3 it allows more flexibility in relating the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes our response variable to the independent variables including multiple cutoffs and interactions e g a variable can appear multiple times on the tree with different splitting thresholds we also considered more advanced tree approaches namely random forest rf and boosted trees bt rf builds multiple trees and glues them together to get a potentially more stable prediction by contrast bt grows trees sequentially i e each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees our results showed that rf and bt did not have higher classification rates than cart figure s3 thus cart was chosen as a3 for its ability to illustrate decision trees 3 3 1 model forms all monitored parameters in the processed data set section 2 2 were evaluated for collinearity and relative importance correspondingly ten model forms were proposed with increasing levels of complexity i e covariates were added sequentially table 1 in model 10 full model the covariates are above mentioned n index indexn and p index indexp water temperature wtemp c tn tp molar ratio tntp ratio dip concentration dip mg l 1 salinity salinity ppt secchi disk depth secchi m chlorophyll a chla μg l 1 dissolved silicate sif mg l 1 january may average streamflow from the susquehanna river q15 m3 s 1 where q flow 1 january and 5 may and season we excluded other variables e g din tn tp din dip and dissolved oxygen because they had a low variable importance b high correlations i e spearman correlation 0 85 with one or more of the variables already included or c large presence of below detection limit values in the case of din figure s2 note that wtemp is a numerical variable that accounts for seasonal changes in water temperature whereas season is a categorical i e discrete variable for calendar month that characterizes features of the annual cycle affecting nutrient limitation e g day length and daylight 3 3 2 model parameterization the cart tree includes the top node which is at the top of the tree containing all data records terminal nodes which are at the bottom of the tree and intermediate nodes at every node except the terminal nodes cart evaluates all possible split points for each predictor variable and selects the predictor variable and split point that leads to two most dissimilar subgroups the selected variable and split point correspond to the splitting variable and the splitting rule respectively ideal cart trees should not be too large over fit or too small poorly fit and should have informative splitting rules and pure terminal nodes because our data set has only 72 records 6 stations x 12 months we set the cart parameter minsplit to six and maxdepth to five minsplit defines the minimum number of observations that must exist in a tree node in order for a split to be attempted maxdepth defines the maximum depth of any node of the final tree root node depth zero we set the complexity parameter cp to its default value 0 01 this means that only splits that decreased the overall lack of fit by a factor of 0 01 or more were attempted cart analyses were conducted using the rpart package therneau and atkinson 2019 3 3 3 cross validation to quantify the performance of the proposed model forms k fold cross validation analysis was conducted which can give insights on how well the model generalizes to a new data set k defines the number of subgroups that the entire data set is split into 1 k 72 leave 1 of 72 out each time essentially the leave one out cross validation loocv approach in each iteration one data record was left out and treated as new data the remaining 71 data records were used to build a model and that model was used to make the prediction for the left out data in total 72 models were built from each of the 72 models prediction was made for the left out case resulting in a vector of 72 predicted nutrient limitation classes 2 k 24 leave 3 of 72 out each time 24 models were built 3 k 12 leave 6 of 72 out each time 12 models were built 4 k 6 leave 12 of 72 out each time 6 models were built for each k predictions were compared with the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes n 72 to compute the classification rate for each model form to determine the best model forms for cart 3 3 4 ensemble of cart models the selected cart model forms have different decision trees and different best performing zones locations and months thus an ensemble approach was developed to combine the strengths of the candidate models essentially this approach compares predictions of nutrient limitation for each station month pair from each candidate model and selects the predicted nutrient limitation class that has the highest probability for cases where predictions from the three candidate models are identical it reports that prediction for cases where model predictions diverge it extracts the probabilities of each model s prediction and reports the prediction with the highest probability 3 3 5 uncertainty analysis to quantify the uncertainties associated with the predictions of each cart model form as well as the ensemble model predictions from the loocv approach were utilized specifically each set of predictions from each of the 72 loocv models was considered one realization the likelihood of the predicted nutrient limitation class was computed as count of occurrence 72 x 100 if all 72 loocv models predict the same class the likelihood would be 72 72 x 100 100 in this work a predicted nutrient limitation class is considered uncertain if its likelihood is less than 70 3 4 application to new periods the ensemble approach of cart was applied to new periods and locations to predict nutrient limitations specifically 2007 2017 for the six stations that had bioassay data this period was chosen because it has an average annual freshwater flow entering the bay 77 850 m3 s 1 comparable to 1992 2002 77 570 m3 s 1 according to the annual mean freshwater flow entering the bay https www usgs gov centers cba science freshwater flow chesapeake bay 2007 2017 for the full set of mainstem stations n 21 fig 1a in addition both hydrologic conditions and temporal periods are expected to affect nutrient availability thereby leading to changes in nutrient limitation in the bay to isolate these effects we conducted two controlled experiments with subsets of the monitoring data representative of different conditions in the first experiment we fixed the period to 2003 2017 and varied the hydrologic condition each year in 2003 2017 was classified as wet dry or average depending on the annual mean freshwater flow entering the bay https www usgs gov centers cba science freshwater flow chesapeake bay average years have annual flows falling between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the entire record in the second experiment we fixed the hydrologic condition by selecting four 2 year periods that had similar annual mean freshwater flows to the bay namely 1990 1991 79 800 m3 s 1 1998 1999 75 800 m3 s 1 2007 2008 76 900 m3 s 1 and 2013 2014 78 650 m3 s 1 finally the cart predicted nutrient limitation classes from these analyses were converted to nutrient limitation maps using a rectangular grid approach that is illustrated in figure s4 4 results 4 1 performances of a1 and a2 goal 1 the probability based approach a1 showed a classification rate of 43 where 31 predictions based on tidal monitoring data matched bioassay based limitation classes out of 72 cases fig 3 a this approach matched most of the bioassay based classes at the six stations in january through may but matched very poorly in july through november the index based approach a2 showed a classification rate of 57 i e 41 matches fig 3b while a2 had a higher classification rate than a1 it also showed widespread mismatches in july through november 4 2 selection of tree models goal 1 cart model forms were selected based on the cross validation analyses models 4 and 7 both had the highest classification rate 85 based on loocv figure s3 other k fold cross validation analyses showed that models 4 7 and 10 were generally better than or comparable to the other model forms figure s5 thus these three models were selected as our candidate models for cart the candidate models for cart showed much improved performance compared to a1 and a2 with loocv models 4 7 and 10 showed a classification rate of 85 85 and 82 respectively figure s6 mismatches tended to be on the edges of the diagram i e colder months and salinity extremes and associated with the inability to discern nor from p limitation or np limitation from single nutrient limitation model 10 matched with bioassay based classes better than model 4 and model 7 at cb6 1 and cb6 4 the two southernmost stations but worse at cb2 1 the most upstream station with the full data set models 4 7 and 10 showed a classification rate of 96 94 and 97 with only three four and two mismatches respectively figure s7 4 3 tree plots of selected models goal 1 tree plots were produced to split the entire data set to more pure subsets for model 4 fig 4 tntp ratio is the top splitting variable with wtemp indexn and dip as additional splitting variables at the top node cases are split to n limitation node 2 if tntp ratio 51 and p limitation node 3 if tntp ratio 51 node 2 is split by wtemp with warmer months 12 c classified as n limitation node 4 and colder months 12 c as np limitation node 5 at node 5 cases are split to p limitation node 11 if indexn 0 35 and np limitation node 10 if indexn 0 35 at node 3 cases are split to three classes when wtemp 7 5 c depending on dip specifically these classes are nor if dip 0 0062 mg l 1 np limitation dip 0 0018 mg l 1 and p limitation dip 0 0018 and 0 0062 mg l 1 at the bottom there are seven terminal nodes and five of them are pure with a unique limitation class for model 7 figure s8 tntp ratio is also the top splitting variable with wtemp indexp dip and chla as additional splitting variables like model 4 node 2 is split by wtemp with warmer months 12 c classified as n limitation and colder months 12 c as np limitation this tree has eight terminal nodes and six of them are pure for model 10 figure s9 tntp ratio is again the top splitting variable with season indexn dip and chla as additional splitting variables in general this tree is similar to model 7 and also has eight terminal nodes one key difference is that wtemp is replaced by season as a splitting variable 4 4 the ensemble approach goal 1 given that the three candidate models have different decision trees and different best performing zones locations and months figures s6 s7 the ensemble approach can combine the strengths of the candidate models the ensemble approach achieved a classification rate of 89 with loocv 8 mismatches and 99 with the full data set 1 mismatch both of which were higher than any of the candidate models fig 5 consequently predictions from the ensemble approach resulted in nutrient limitation maps that closely matched the bioassay based limitation map for the period of 1992 2002 fig 6 4 5 comparison of decadal periods goal 2 for the six stations that had bioassay data 10 of the 72 station month pairs showed changes in nutrient limitation table 2 figure s10 including switches from nor to p limitation n 2 upper bay in winter spring p limitation to n limitation n 4 upper and middle bay in summer fall np limitation to p limitation n 2 lower bay in winter spring and n limitation to np limitation n 2 lower bay in winter spring these cases all have high likelihoods based on the uncertainty analysis table 2 overall nutrient limitation showed expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 fig 7 in our extended analysis to the 21 tidal monitoring stations including the six stations that had bioassay data 30 pairs 12 of the 252 station month pairs showed changes in nutrient limitation these changes are generally similar in directions to those reported above i e from nor to p limitation p limitation to n limitation np limitation to p limitation and n limitation to np limitation moreover these cases all have high likelihoods based on the uncertainty analysis the resulting maps figure s11 like fig 7 showed expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 4 6 comparison of different conditions goal 2 two controlled experiments were conducted to investigate changes in nutrient limitation as a function of hydrology or temporal periods in the first experiment we fixed the analysis period to 2003 2017 and varied the hydrologic condition fig 8 compared with wet years dry years expanded the areas of np limitation additional 10 out of 252 cases 4 and n limitation 12 and reduced the areas of nor 6 and p limitation 10 specifically a majority of nor in wet years switched to p limitation dry years in the upper bay in winter months december february n limitation extended from the july september window wet years further into november before shifting back to p limitation in december dry years along most of the bay s axis moreover additional cases of np limitation dry years occurred primarily in locations and months that were p limited wet years in the second experiment we fixed the hydrologic condition by selecting four 2 year periods that had similar annual freshwater flows to the bay fig 9 compared with 1990 1991 the latter periods all showed contracted areas of p limitation 9 and expanded areas of np limitation 6 to 10 with the latter occurring primarily in locations and months that had previously been p limited 5 discussion large scale nutrient reduction goals have been in place for decades as targets to restore water quality and habitat health in chesapeake bay and many other estuaries worldwide boesch et al 2001 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 boesch 2019 malone and newton 2020 management actions resulting in reductions of nutrient loads may have led to increases in nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth in the estuary we demonstrate that cart can be used to characterize nutrient limitation from long term water quality monitoring data on much broader geographic and temporal scales than would be feasible using bioassays providing a new tool for informing water quality management the cart approach can be adapted to other waterbodies where long term bioassays and water quality monitoring data sets are available although the selection of water quality variables and model forms may vary based on data availability in specific systems below we provide a discussion on the validity of the cart ensemble approach and the applications of the approach specific to chesapeake bay 5 1 cart was selected as the empirical approach to relate tidal water quality data to bioassay based measures of nutrient limitation goal 1 din and dip concentrations a1 or their indices a2 alone cannot satisfactorily reproduce the bioassay based nutrient limitation patterns fig 3 although the improved performance by a2 over a1 implies that nutrient indices are better predictors than nutrient concentrations both approaches failed to match the bioassay based results in july through november this may reflect the effects of temperature and light availability on phytoplankton growth or reveal that the low nutrient concentrations in summer and fall are less reflective of nutrient availability in these seasons with high turnover rates associated with biogeochemical cycling of nutrients e g water column regeneration sediment release of p denitrification conley 1999 testa and kemp 2012 testa et al 2018 compared with a1 and a2 tree based approaches a3 showed substantially improved performance in matching the bioassay based patterns because of their ability to incorporate additional variables related to phytoplankton growth figures s6 s7 the tree plots of the three selected cart models figs 4 s8 and s9 illustrated how the original full data were split to more homogeneous subsets and these trees had several consistencies first each tree has seven or eight terminal nodes and only two of them are not pure demonstrating the effectiveness of cart for classifying the response variable i e nutrient limitation class second tntp ratio is always the top splitting variable on the trees and cases with smaller tntp ratio values are classified as n limitation while cases with larger tntp ratio values are classified as p limitation this splitting rule makes sense because a larger tntp ratio indicates more n relative to p leading to a high potential for p limitation and low potential for n limitation although the splitting threshold n p 51 1 is much larger than the redfield ratio n p 16 1 redfield 1958 the discrepancy may reflect the contributions of particulate n and p to tn and tp in regions where external inputs of nutrients are substantial although tntp ratio is always the first splitting variable on the trees it alone cannot satisfactorily explain the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient limitation in this regard a third consistency is the inclusion of seasonality as represented by either wtemp numerical or season categorical this indicates the importance of seasonal shifts in features that directly or indirectly influence phytoplankton growth these features may include temperature effect on maximum phytoplankton growth rates day length and daylight available to support photosynthesis seasonal changes in stratification and vertical mixing seasonal shifts in plankton community composition enhanced grazing at higher temperatures and seasonal alterations of the light field droop 1983 fisher et al 1999 1992 harding et al 2016 kemp et al 2005 malone et al 1996 the ensemble approach effectively combined the strengths of the candidate models and had a classification rate higher than any of the candidate models figs 5 6 it is not surprising that mismatches were not eliminated with the ensemble approach fig 5a which is inevitably constrained by the precision of bioassay experiments the inherent variability in water samples and the sample size of each limitation class the mismatches are located on the edges of the limitation diagram colder months and salinity extremes generally in transition zones between more consistently defined limitation factors two mismatches are related to p limitation versus nor which are often difficult to distinguish in the bioassays fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 four mismatches are related to np limitation which persisted from the candidate models to the ensemble approach probably because np limitation is the least frequent in the bioassay data 6 out of 72 cases and np limitation cases are associated with cb6 1 and cb6 4 which have very limited bioassay samples 13 each compared to 200 samples at cb3 3c cb4 3c and cb5 2 moreover cb6 1 and cb6 4 are most influenced by both riverine and atlantic ocean water inputs and the np limitation mismatches occur at the boundaries of seasonal transitions from p to n limitation this research demonstrates that cart when combined with long term water monitoring data can be used as an assessment tool for nutrient limitation while direct bioassays are the gold standard they are time intensive and much more costly than water quality monitoring programs can sustain instead cart can be used to estimate nutrient limitation from parameters routinely part of water quality monitoring protocols greatly expanding the geographic and temporal extent of these assessments to guide water quality management however we emphasize that cart should be used to fill in the gaps given limited funding resources for bioassays rather than replace bioassays an underlying assumption of cart is the stationarity in the derived relationships between nutrient limitation and explanatory variables this caveat can inadvertently force predictions for new periods to strictly follow a particular splitting rule to fall into a fixed terminal node at the bottom of the tree regardless of any changes in variables irrelevant to that splitting rule thereby reducing the likelihood of detecting changes in nutrient limitation furthermore variables selected by the tree may change over time e g wtemp which can confound the accuracy of predictions for new periods in these regards new bioassay experiments can be particularly useful for re calibrating and updating the cart models 5 2 application of the cart ensemble approach to new periods provided insights on changes in nutrient limitation patterns and effects of nutrient reductions goal 2 predictions from the ensemble approach showed modest changes 10 out of 72 cases in nutrient limitation patterns at the six stations that had bioassay data figure s10 table 2 our extended analysis of the 21 tidal stations showed similar changes figure s11 adding further confidence to these results we emphasize that these patterns should be viewed as the overall behavior of nutrient limitation for the specified periods and these patterns can change between different hydrologic conditions or temporal periods these estimated changes in nutrient limitation were further compared with estimated changes in monitored nutrient concentrations between the 1992 2002 period and the 2007 2017 period δ as computed with generalized additive models murphy et al 2019 table 2 for example the switch from p limitation to n limitation at cb2 1 in september is consistent with its declining din concentration δ 0 080 mg l 1 p 0 01 and increasing dip concentration δ 0 003 mg l 1 p 0 066 similarly the switch from nor to p limitation at cb3 3c in both january and december is consistent with its declining dip concentration δ 0 003 mg l 1 p 0 053 these consistencies add further confidence to the estimated changes in nutrient limitation although nutrient concentrations alone do not always explain the estimated changes in nutrient limitation nutrient limitation maps showed expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 fig 7 these changes imply that some parts of the bay have become less nutrient saturated consistent with other observed water quality improvements that have been linked to nutrient reductions harding et al 2016 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2011 testa et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 this implication is also consistent with the expected impacts of management efforts intended to improve water quality by reducing the human impact on the landscape and addressing legacy pollution as well as pressures from steady population growth in the watershed chesapeake bay program 2020 these efforts have been pursued through the implementation of wastewater agricultural atmospheric and urban stormwater source controls to address the pollutant reduction goals outlined in the chesapeake bay partnership agreements chesapeake executive council 1983 1987 2000 2014 and the chesapeake bay tmdl u s environmental protection agency 2010 in response to management actions such as wastewater treatment plant upgrades boynton et al 2008 reductions in fertilizer applications keisman et al 2018 and reductions in n emissions under the clean air act eshleman et al 2013 n load has decreased across the bay watershed over the last three decades ator et al 2019 chanat et al 2016 chanat and yang 2018 hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a 2015 which may have led to expanded areas of n limitation in the bay especially in seasons of low freshwater input a strength of the cart approach is its ability to predict nutrient limitation for different hydrologic conditions or temporal periods our results showed that for the same temporal period 2003 2017 dry years had expanded areas of np limitation and n limitation and contracted areas of nor and p limitation compared to wet years fig 8 a majority of nor in wet years switched to p limitation dry years in the upper bay in winter months december february moreover additional cases of np limitation dry years occurred primarily in locations and months that were p limited wet years these changes reflect the fact that dry conditions are associated with lower nutrient delivery to the bay boynton and kemp 2000 thereby creating more opportunities for nutrient limitation to occur such an effect of hydrologic condition has been previously observed in bioassay experiments by fisher et al 1999 and fisher and gustafson 2005 our results also showed that under similar hydrologic conditions more recent periods had expanded areas of np limitation and contracted areas of p limitation compared to the earliest period 1990 1991 fig 9 the expansion of np limitation occurred primarily in locations and months that had previously been p limited this indicates that n concentrations have been reduced to its limiting level in those cases likely due to reductions in n load the reduction in p limited areas is consistent with the observations that 1 tp load to the bay has increased since the mid 1990s largely due to reduced trapping of sediment and associated p by conowingo reservoir as it neared its sediment storage capacity hirsch 2012 langland 2015 zhang et al 2013 2016b and that 2 dissolved orthophosphate to the bay has increased substantially recently fanelli et al 2019 despite these changes the overall seasonal and spatial patterns of nutrient limitation in chesapeake bay remain similar to the 1992 2002 period kemp et al 2005 nor is common in the upper bay during winter when daylight is short and where salinity is low water is colder and more turbid and ambient nutrient concentrations are high for example our data at cb2 1 show that winter din and dip concentrations are roughly 14 times and 2 times higher than the bloom limitation thresholds respectively algal growth in winter does not appear to be fast enough to reduce the high nutrient concentrations to bloom limiting levels in either the experimental controls or the np treatments in the bioassays leading to no differential growth response between the controls and treatments p limitation is common in spring when temperature increases and din dip ratios are high in river flows under these conditions algae are growing faster and taking up more nutrients bringing p concentrations to limiting levels n limitation is common throughout the bay in summer and early fall due to depletion of din from surface waters and high release rates of dip from the bottom anoxic sediments np limitation only occurs in the high salinity oceanic influenced lower bay when din and dip concentrations are both below their limiting levels and hence algal growth is responsive to both n and p additions overall these patterns in nutrient limitation reinforce a dual nutrient management strategy for controlling nutrient enrichment in chesapeake bay the implications of uneven nutrient management have been seen in the north sea where it is reported that a more effective reduction of p than n load has led to a large imbalance in the n p stoichiometry of coastal waters resulting in an offshore gradient from p to n limitation burson et al 2016 although estuaries often exhibit strong seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation detection of shifts in nutrient limitation can provide important indicators of estuarine response to nutrient reductions for example it is predicted that p limited areas at the continental shelf of the northern gulf of mexico would extend by over 50 in may and july if dip concentration in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers is reduced by half laurent et al 2012 while some of the estimated changes in nutrient limitation in chesapeake bay may be an early indication on the impact of nutrient reductions further reductions are likely needed to reduce nutrient concentrations to limiting levels to achieve a less nutrient saturated ecosystem 6 conclusions we analyzed historical data from nutrient bioassays and data from the cbp long term water quality monitoring network to develop empirical approaches for predicting nutrient limitation cart reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation patterns in 1992 2002 much better than two non statistical approaches a1 and a2 because it can utilize relevant variables beyond din and dip the ensemble approach of the three selected cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based results classification rate 99 predictions from the ensemble approach showed modest changes in nutrient limitation with expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 these changes imply that long term reductions in nitrogen load have led to expanded areas with nutrient limited phytoplankton growth reflecting long term water quality improvements in the context of nutrient enrichment however nutrient limitation patterns remain unchanged in the majority of the mainstem suggesting that nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve a less nutrient saturated ecosystem these insights can help inform management strategies called for in the chesapeake bay tmdl explain changes in tidal water quality and facilitate future refinements of chesapeake bay estuarine models these results also indicate the need for conducting additional bioassay experiments for model validation and enhancement more broadly this research highlights the value of maintaining a long term water quality monitoring network and provides an example on how tidal monitoring data can be assessed in other

17404,understanding the temporal and spatial roles of nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth is necessary for developing successful management strategies chesapeake bay has well documented seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation but it remains unknown whether these patterns of nutrient limitation have changed in response to nutrient management efforts we analyzed historical data from nutrient bioassay experiments 1992 2002 and data from long term fixed site water quality monitoring program 1990 2017 to develop empirical approaches for predicting nutrient limitation in the surface waters of the mainstem bay results from classification and regression trees cart matched the seasonal and spatial patterns of bioassay based nutrient limitation in the 1992 2002 period much better than two simpler non statistical approaches an ensemble approach of three selected cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based results classification rate 99 this empirical approach can be used to characterize nutrient limitation from long term water quality monitoring data on much broader geographic and temporal scales than would be feasible using bioassays providing a new tool for informing water quality management results from our application of the approach to 21 tidal monitoring stations for the period of 2007 2017 showed modest changes in nutrient limitation patterns with expanded areas of nitrogen limitation and contracted areas of nutrient saturation i e not limited by nitrogen or phosphorus these changes imply that long term reductions in nitrogen load have led to expanded areas with nutrient limited phytoplankton growth in the bay reflecting long term water quality improvements in the context of nutrient enrichment however nutrient limitation patterns remain unchanged in the majority of the mainstem suggesting that nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve a less nutrient saturated ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient limitation phytoplankton bioassay water quality long term monitoring nutrient management 1 introduction nutrient enrichment has become a major issue in many coastal ecosystems around the world boesch et al 2001 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 boesch 2019 malone and newton 2020 chesapeake bay the largest estuary in north america has a long history of cultural eutrophication accompanied by excessive algal growth and seasonal hypoxia boesch et al 2001 hagy et al 2004 kemp et al 2005 such symptoms have been attributed in part to excessive nutrient and sediment loads from the watershed ator et al 2020 hagy et al 2004 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2011 noe et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 as seen in many other coastal systems boesch 2019 consequently coordinated management efforts among the bay state jurisdictions began in the 1980s to reduce nutrient and sediment loads from the watershed furthermore the chesapeake bay total maximum daily load tmdl was established in 2010 to enforce load reductions in order to improve habitat health that can fully support living resource survival growth and reproduction u s environmental protection agency 2010 the tmdl is designed to ensure that all pollution control measures needed to fully restore the bay and its tidal tributaries are in place by 2025 to control algal growth in aquatic ecosystems it is critical to understand growth limiting factors which may be nitrogen n phosphorus p light l silicon si temperature or others cloern et al 2014 conley 1999 elser et al 2007 hecky and kilham 1988 in general fresh waters are often considered to be p limited due to a high n p ratio in riverine sources e g fennel and testa 2019 and n fixation hecky and kilham 1988 schindler 1974 whereas marine waters are often considered to be primarily n limited due to sediment release of p slow n fixation and high denitrification hecky and kilham 1988 paerl 2018 estuaries are in the transitional zones between freshwater and marine systems thereby often exhibiting more complicated patterns in nutrient limitation cloern et al 2014 elser et al 2007 for example tidal waters of chesapeake bay have shown occurrences of n p l and si limitation that vary in space and time conley and malone 1992 fisher et al 1999 1992 malone et al 1996 to understand the seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation in chesapeake bay bioassay experiments were conducted from a set of locations fig 1 a between 1992 and 2002 under controlled near surface light conditions fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 the results were synthesized in kemp et al 2005 to illustrate the seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation in that period fig 1b such patterns demonstrate the necessity of a dual nutrient management strategy u s environmental protection agency 2010 and have informed the development of the chesapeake bay estuary model cerco and noel 2017 in the chesapeake bay watershed large scale dual nutrient reduction goals have been in place for decades leading to an overall long term reduction in total n tn load to the bay ator et al 2019 chanat et al 2016 chanat and yang 2018 hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a 2015 total p tp load to the bay declined in the 1980s to early 1990s due to improved wastewater treatment and phosphate detergent bans however tp load increased dramatically since the mid 1990s largely due to reduced sediment trapping as sediment storage has neared full capacity in conowingo reservoir on the susquehanna river the largest tributary to the bay hirsch 2012 langland 2015 zhang et al 2013 2016b while the n load reduction is primarily associated with nitrate the p load increase from the susquehanna river is primarily associated with particulate p although dissolved orthophosphate load from the susquehanna has also increased substantially in recent years fanelli et al 2019 this contrast in the direction of n and p trends and the form specific differences suggests that there have been changes in the ratios of nutrients for phytoplankton growth and thus changes in nutrient limitation on a bay wide scale unfortunately bioassay experiments have not been conducted since 2005 to characterize recent conditions of nutrient limitation our main objective was to test the above hypothesis through an analysis of historical data from nutrient bioassay experiments 1992 2002 and surface collected data from the chesapeake bay program cbp long term fixed site water quality monitoring network 1990 2017 the specific goals are as follows 1 to develop empirical approaches to predict bioassay based measures of nutrient limitation response variable using tidal water quality monitoring data in the concurrent period of 1992 2002 goal 1 and 2 to apply the selected approach to tidal water quality monitoring data in more recent periods without bioassay data to predict nutrient limitation and explore potential changes in response to altered nutrient loading goal 2 this research provides updated information specific to chesapeake bay management and research communities regarding the spatial and seasonal patterns in nutrient limitation more broadly we propose that this approach can be applied in any estuary with similar long term monitoring data to address similar questions 2 data 2 1 bioassays bioassay experiments were conducted between 1992 and 2002 to characterize the response of algal growth or biomass accumulation to nutrient additions at six mainstem stations fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 fisher et al 1999 these stations namely cb2 1 cb3 3c cb4 3c cb5 2 cb6 1 and cb6 4 had 18 245 264 265 13 and 13 bioassay samples respectively kemp et al 2005 synthesized these bioassay data to characterize the nutrient limitation class for each station month combination for the period of 1992 2002 fig 1b this data set of nutrient limitation has 72 records i e 6 stations x 12 months 72 records among the limitation classes n and p limitations were defined as increases in phytoplankton productivity pp and biomass pb with n and p additions respectively normalized to controls np limitation was defined as increases in pp and pb only with simultaneous additions of n and p l limitation was defined as no differential growth response between the controls and np treatments although all grew equally well when held at 60 light due to high ambient n and p concentrations to be more precise we changed the term l limitation to nor i e no significant response to nutrient additions this category contains but is not limited to l limitation although other limitation factors e g trace metals and si were unlikely hereafter the response categories reported are nor n limitation p limitation and np limitation 2 2 water quality monitoring data the cbp partnership maintains a long term tidal water quality monitoring program fig 1a at 100 stations distributed along the mainstem bay and its tidal tributaries tango and batiuk 2016 u s environmental protection agency 2010 these stations have been sampled consistently since 1985 the field and laboratory methods and quality control protocols are documented in chesapeake bay program 2017 we downloaded tidal water quality monitoring data for the period of 1990 2017 from the cbp water quality database https datahub chesapeakebay net which consists of more than three million values of various physical chemical and biological parameters these downloaded data as well as subsequently processed data are archived in zhang 2020 the availability of initially selected parameters at the mainstem stations is summarized in figure s1 downloaded data in the period of 1992 2002 were processed to produce an aggregated data set for each station month combination i e 6 stations x 12 months 72 records see data manipulation in supplementary materials for details this data set and the bioassay based data set both having 72 records were used in our empirical approach development goal 1 similarly downloaded data in the period of 2007 2017 were processed to produce an aggregated data set for analysis for goal 2 this period was chosen because it has an average annual flow 77 850 m3 s 1 comparable to 1992 2002 77 570 m3 s 1 thereby allowing for a fair comparison between the two periods regarding nutrient limitation given the strong association of river flow and nutrient availability moreover the above data manipulations for both periods were expanded to a larger suite of stations n 21 including the six stations that had bioassay data fig 1a 3 methods for goal 1 three empirical approaches were developed to relate tidal monitoring data collected during the period from 1992 to 2002 to bioassay based nutrient limitation classes at the six mainstem stations developed using bioassay data from the same period sections 3 1 3 3 we considered two non statistical approaches a1 and a2 that used only dissolved inorganic n din and dissolved inorganic p dip data and one statistical approach a3 that used din dip and other monitored variables see fig 2 for an overview of these approaches and associated analyses for goal 2 the selected approach was applied to tidal monitoring data from 2007 to 2017 to explore potential changes in nutrient limitation section 3 4 3 1 probability based approach a1 the first approach is a probability based approach a1 for each of the 72 station month pairs all din and dip concentration data from 1992 to 2002 were extracted from the originally downloaded data these concentrations were compared with the bloom limiting thresholds for din 0 07 mg l 1 and dip 0 007 mg l 1 respectively to compute the probabilities of below threshold din and dip for each station and month 1 probability of below threshold din count of din values less than 0 07 mg l 1 count of all din values 2 probability of below threshold dip count of dip values less than 0 007 mg l 1 count of all dip values it was previously documented that concentrations above these thresholds are associated with a lack of response to nutrient additions buchanan et al 2005 fisher and gustafson 2003 these thresholds were derived from bioassays as general reference values for algal response but they may not lead to accurate predictions of nutrient limitation at all locations or in all months due to spatial and temporal variability in controls of nutrient limitation the computed probabilities were then converted to nutrient limitation classes as follows 1 if the probability of below threshold din i e din 0 07 mg l 1 50 class n 2 if the probability of below threshold dip i e dip 0 007 mg l 1 50 class p 3 if both probabilities 40 class np 4 else class nor these probability based classes were compared with the bioassay based classes n 72 to compute the classification rate i e number of matched cases 72 x 100 which is served as a quantitative measure of the performance of approach a1 3 2 index based approach a2 the second approach is an index based approach a2 like a1 for each of the 72 station month pairs all din and dip concentration data from 1992 to 2002 were extracted from the originally downloaded data these concentrations were compared with the bloom limiting thresholds to compute n and p indices as follows 1 if din 0 07 mg l 1 n index 1 and p index 0 2 if dip 0 007 mg l 1 n index 0 and p index 1 3 if both conditions are met n index 0 5 and p index 0 5 4 if neither condition is met n index 0 and p index 0 for each station month pair the relevant indices were averaged over the period of record to compute the aggregated indices which were converted to nutrient limitation classes as follows 1 if n index 0 5 class n 2 if p index 0 5 class p 3 if both indices 0 4 class np 4 else class nor these index based classes were compared with the bioassay based classes n 72 to compute the classification rate of approach a2 3 3 tree based approach a3 the third approach is a statistical approach a3 which is centered on the classification and regression tree cart cart has three unique advantages 1 it is a well established machine learning method for classification breiman 1984 loh 2014 and has been widely used in hydrological and marine studies e g testa et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 2 it can consider multiple independent variables simultaneously and thus utilize information beyond din and dip concentrations or indices e g water temperature and 3 it allows more flexibility in relating the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes our response variable to the independent variables including multiple cutoffs and interactions e g a variable can appear multiple times on the tree with different splitting thresholds we also considered more advanced tree approaches namely random forest rf and boosted trees bt rf builds multiple trees and glues them together to get a potentially more stable prediction by contrast bt grows trees sequentially i e each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees our results showed that rf and bt did not have higher classification rates than cart figure s3 thus cart was chosen as a3 for its ability to illustrate decision trees 3 3 1 model forms all monitored parameters in the processed data set section 2 2 were evaluated for collinearity and relative importance correspondingly ten model forms were proposed with increasing levels of complexity i e covariates were added sequentially table 1 in model 10 full model the covariates are above mentioned n index indexn and p index indexp water temperature wtemp c tn

numerical variable that accounts for seasonal changes in water temperature whereas season is a categorical i e discrete variable for calendar month that characterizes features of the annual cycle affecting nutrient limitation e g day length and daylight 3 3 2 model parameterization the cart tree includes the top node which is at the top of the tree containing all data records terminal nodes which are at the bottom of the tree and intermediate nodes at every node except the terminal nodes cart evaluates all possible split points for each predictor variable and selects the predictor variable and split point that leads to two most dissimilar subgroups the selected variable and split point correspond to the splitting variable and the splitting rule respectively ideal cart trees should not be too large over fit or too small poorly fit and should have informative splitting rules and pure terminal nodes because our data set has only 72 records 6 stations x 12 months we set the cart parameter minsplit to six and maxdepth to five minsplit defines the minimum number of observations that must exist in a tree node in order for a split to be attempted maxdepth defines the maximum depth of any node of the final tree root node depth zero we set the complexity parameter cp to its default value 0 01 this means that only splits that decreased the overall lack of fit by a factor of 0 01 or more were attempted cart analyses were conducted using the rpart package therneau and atkinson 2019 3 3 3 cross validation to quantify the performance of the proposed model forms k fold cross validation analysis was conducted which can give insights on how well the model generalizes to a new data set k defines the number of subgroups that the entire data set is split into 1 k 72 leave 1 of 72 out each time essentially the leave one out cross validation loocv approach in each iteration one data record was left out and treated as new data the remaining 71 data records were used to build a model and that model was used to make the prediction for the left out data in total 72 models were built from each of the 72 models prediction was made for the left out case resulting in a vector of 72 predicted nutrient limitation classes 2 k 24 leave 3 of 72 out each time 24 models were built 3 k 12 leave 6 of 72 out each time 12 models were built 4 k 6 leave 12 of 72 out each time 6 models were built for each k predictions were compared with the bioassay based nutrient limitation classes n 72 to compute the classification rate for each model form to determine the best model forms for cart 3 3 4 ensemble of cart models the selected cart model forms have different decision trees and different best performing zones locations and months thus an ensemble approach was developed to combine the strengths of the candidate models essentially this approach compares predictions of nutrient limitation for each station month pair from each candidate model and selects the predicted nutrient limitation class that has the highest probability for cases where predictions from the three candidate models are identical it reports that prediction for cases where model predictions diverge it extracts the probabilities of each model s prediction and reports the prediction with the highest probability 3 3 5 uncertainty analysis to quantify the uncertainties associated with the predictions of each cart model form as well as the ensemble model predictions from the loocv approach were utilized specifically each set of predictions from each of the 72 loocv models was considered one realization the likelihood of the predicted nutrient limitation class was computed as count of occurrence 72 x 100 if all 72 loocv models predict the same class the likelihood would be 72 72 x 100 100 in this work a predicted nutrient limitation class is considered uncertain if its likelihood is less than 70 3 4 application to new periods the ensemble approach of cart was applied to new periods and locations to predict nutrient limitations specifically 2007 2017 for the six stations that had bioassay data this period was chosen because it has an average annual freshwater flow entering the bay 77 850 m3 s 1 comparable to 1992 2002 77 570 m3 s 1 according to the annual mean freshwater flow entering the bay https www usgs gov centers cba science freshwater flow chesapeake bay 2007 2017 for the full set of mainstem stations n 21 fig 1a in addition both hydrologic conditions and temporal periods are expected to affect nutrient availability thereby leading to changes in nutrient limitation in the bay to isolate these effects we conducted two controlled experiments with subsets of the monitoring data representative of different conditions in the first experiment we fixed the period to 2003 2017 and varied the hydrologic condition each year in 2003 2017 was classified as wet dry or average depending on the annual mean freshwater flow entering the bay https www usgs gov centers cba science freshwater flow chesapeake bay average years have annual flows falling between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the entire record in the second experiment we fixed the hydrologic condition by selecting four 2 year periods that had similar annual mean freshwater flows to the bay namely 1990 1991 79 800 m3 s 1 1998 1999 75 800 m3 s 1 2007 2008 76 900 m3 s 1 and 2013 2014 78 650 m3 s 1 finally the cart predicted nutrient limitation classes from these analyses were converted to nutrient limitation maps using a rectangular grid approach that is illustrated in figure s4 4 results 4 1 performances of a1 and a2 goal 1 the probability based approach a1 showed a classification rate of 43 where 31 predictions based on tidal monitoring data matched bioassay based limitation classes out of 72 cases fig 3 a this approach matched most of the bioassay based classes at the six stations in january through may but matched very poorly in july through november the index based approach a2 showed a classification rate of 57 i e 41 matches fig 3b while a2 had a higher classification rate than a1 it also showed widespread mismatches in july through november 4 2 selection of tree models goal 1 cart model forms were selected based on the cross validation analyses models 4 and 7 both had the highest classification rate 85 based on loocv figure s3 other k fold cross validation analyses showed that models 4 7 and 10 were generally better than or comparable to the other model forms figure s5 thus these three models were selected as our candidate models for cart the candidate models for cart showed much improved performance compared to a1 and a2 with loocv models 4 7 and 10 showed a classification rate of 85 85 and 82 respectively figure s6 mismatches tended to be on the edges of the diagram i e colder months and salinity extremes and associated with the inability to discern nor from p limitation or np limitation from single nutrient limitation model 10 matched with bioassay based classes better than model 4 and model 7 at cb6 1 and cb6 4 the two southernmost stations but worse at cb2 1 the most upstream station with the full data set models 4 7 and 10 showed a classification rate of 96 94 and 97 with only three four and two mismatches respectively figure s7 4 3 tree plots of selected models goal 1 tree plots were produced to split the entire data set to more pure subsets for model 4 fig 4 tntp ratio is the top splitting variable with wtemp indexn and dip as additional splitting variables at the top node cases are split to n limitation node 2 if tntp ratio 51 and p limitation node 3 if tntp ratio 51 node 2 is split by wtemp with warmer months 12 c classified as n limitation node 4 and colder months 12 c as np limitation node 5 at node 5 cases are split to p limitation node 11 if indexn 0 35 and np limitation node 10 if indexn 0 35 at node 3 cases are split to three classes when wtemp 7 5 c depending on dip specifically these classes are nor if dip 0 0062 mg l 1 np limitation dip 0 0018 mg l 1 and p limitation dip 0 0018 and 0 0062 mg l 1 at the bottom there are seven terminal nodes and five of them are pure with a unique limitation class for model 7 figure s8 tntp ratio is also the top splitting variable with wtemp indexp dip and chla as additional splitting variables like model 4 node 2 is split by wtemp with warmer months 12 c classified as n limitation and colder months 12 c as np limitation this tree has eight terminal nodes and six of them are pure for model 10 figure s9 tntp ratio is again the top splitting variable with season indexn dip and chla as additional splitting variables in general this tree is similar to model 7 and also has eight terminal nodes one key difference is that wtemp is replaced by season as a splitting variable 4 4 the ensemble approach goal 1 given that the three candidate models have different decision trees and different best performing zones locations and months figures s6 s7 the ensemble approach can combine the strengths of the candidate models the ensemble approach achieved a classification rate of 89 with loocv 8 mismatches and 99 with the full data set 1 mismatch both of which were higher than any of the candidate models fig 5 consequently predictions from the ensemble approach resulted in nutrient limitation maps that closely matched the bioassay based limitation map for the period of 1992 2002 fig 6 4 5 comparison of decadal periods goal 2 for the six stations that had bioassay data 10 of the 72 station month pairs showed changes in nutrient limitation table 2 figure s10 including switches from nor to p limitation n 2 upper bay in winter spring p limitation to n limitation n 4 upper and middle bay in summer fall np limitation to p limitation n 2 lower bay in winter spring and n limitation to np limitation n 2 lower bay in winter spring these cases all have high likelihoods based on the uncertainty analysis table 2 overall nutrient limitation showed expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 fig 7 in our extended analysis to the 21 tidal monitoring stations including the six stations that had bioassay data 30 pairs 12 of the 252 station month pairs showed changes in nutrient limitation these changes are generally similar in directions to those reported above i e from nor to p limitation p limitation to n limitation np limitation to p limitation and n limitation to np limitation moreover these cases all have high likelihoods based on the uncertainty analysis the resulting maps figure s11 like fig 7 showed expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 4 6 comparison of different conditions goal 2 two controlled experiments were conducted to investigate changes in nutrient limitation as a function of hydrology or temporal periods in the first experiment we fixed the analysis period to 2003 2017 and varied the hydrologic condition fig 8 compared with wet years dry years expanded the areas of np limitation additional 10 out of 252 cases 4 and n limitation 12 and reduced the areas of nor 6 and p limitation 10 specifically a majority of nor in wet years switched to p limitation dry years in the upper bay in winter months december february n limitation extended from the july september window wet years further into november before shifting back to p limitation in december dry years along most of the bay s axis moreover additional cases of np limitation dry years occurred primarily in locations and months that were p limited wet years in the second experiment we fixed the hydrologic condition by selecting four 2 year periods that had similar annual freshwater flows to the bay fig 9 compared with 1990 1991 the latter periods all showed contracted areas of p limitation 9 and expanded areas of np limitation 6 to 10 with the latter occurring primarily in locations and months that had previously been p limited 5 discussion large scale nutrient reduction goals have been in place for decades as targets to restore water quality and habitat health in chesapeake bay and many other estuaries worldwide boesch et al 2001 cloern 2001 kemp et al 2009 boesch 2019 malone and newton 2020 management actions resulting in reductions of nutrient loads may have led to increases in nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth in the estuary we demonstrate that cart can be used to characterize nutrient limitation from long term water quality monitoring data on much broader geographic and temporal scales than would be feasible using bioassays providing a new tool for informing water quality management the cart approach can be adapted to other waterbodies where long term bioassays and water quality monitoring data sets are available although the selection of water quality variables and model forms may vary based on data availability in specific systems below we provide a discussion on the validity of the cart ensemble approach and the applications of the approach specific to chesapeake bay 5 1 cart was selected as the empirical approach to relate tidal water quality data to bioassay based measures of nutrient limitation goal 1 din and dip concentrations a1 or their indices a2 alone cannot satisfactorily reproduce the bioassay based nutrient limitation patterns fig 3 although the improved performance by a2 over a1 implies that nutrient indices are better predictors than nutrient concentrations both approaches failed to match the bioassay based results in july through november this may reflect the effects of temperature and light availability on phytoplankton growth or reveal that the low nutrient concentrations in summer and fall are less reflective of nutrient availability in these seasons with high turnover rates associated with biogeochemical cycling of nutrients e g water column regeneration sediment release of p denitrification conley 1999 testa and kemp 2012 testa et al 2018 compared with a1 and a2 tree based approaches a3 showed substantially improved performance in matching the bioassay based patterns because of their ability to incorporate additional variables related to phytoplankton growth figures s6 s7 the tree plots of the three selected cart models figs 4 s8 and s9 illustrated how the original full data were split to more homogeneous subsets and these trees had several consistencies first each tree has seven or eight terminal nodes and only two of them are not pure demonstrating the effectiveness of cart for classifying the response variable i e nutrient limitation class second tntp ratio is always the top splitting variable on the trees and cases with smaller tntp ratio values are classified as n limitation while cases with larger tntp ratio values are classified as p limitation this splitting rule makes sense because a larger tntp ratio indicates more n relative to p leading to a high potential for p limitation and low potential for n limitation although the splitting threshold n p 51 1 is much larger than the redfield ratio n p 16 1 redfield 1958 the discrepancy may reflect the contributions of particulate n and p to tn and tp in regions where external inputs of nutrients are substantial although tntp ratio is always the first splitting variable on the trees it alone cannot satisfactorily explain the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient limitation in this regard a third consistency is the inclusion of seasonality as represented by either wtemp numerical or season categorical this indicates the importance of seasonal shifts in features that directly or indirectly influence phytoplankton growth these features may include temperature effect on maximum phytoplankton growth rates day length and daylight available to support photosynthesis seasonal changes in stratification and vertical mixing seasonal shifts in plankton community composition enhanced grazing at higher temperatures and seasonal alterations of the light field droop 1983 fisher et al 1999 1992 harding et al 2016 kemp et al 2005 malone et al 1996 the ensemble approach effectively combined the strengths of the candidate models and had a classification rate higher than any of the candidate models figs 5 6 it is not surprising that mismatches were not eliminated with the ensemble approach fig 5a which is inevitably constrained by the precision of bioassay experiments the inherent variability in water samples and the sample size of each limitation class the mismatches are located on the edges of the limitation diagram colder months and salinity extremes generally in transition zones between more consistently defined limitation factors two mismatches are related to p limitation versus nor which are often difficult to distinguish in the bioassays fisher and gustafson 2003 2005 four mismatches are related to np limitation which persisted from the candidate models to the ensemble approach probably because np limitation is the least frequent in the bioassay data 6 out of 72 cases and np limitation cases are associated with cb6 1 and cb6 4 which have very limited bioassay samples 13 each compared to 200 samples at cb3 3c cb4 3c and cb5 2 moreover cb6 1 and cb6 4 are most influenced by both riverine and atlantic ocean water inputs and the np limitation mismatches occur at the boundaries of seasonal transitions from p to n limitation this research demonstrates that cart when combined with long term water monitoring data can be used as an assessment tool for nutrient limitation while direct bioassays are the gold standard they are time intensive and much more costly than water quality monitoring programs can sustain instead cart can be used to estimate nutrient limitation from parameters routinely part of water quality monitoring protocols greatly expanding the geographic and temporal extent of these assessments to guide water quality management however we emphasize that cart should be used to fill in the gaps given limited funding resources for bioassays rather than replace bioassays an underlying assumption of cart is the stationarity in the derived relationships between nutrient limitation and explanatory variables this caveat can inadvertently force predictions for new periods to strictly follow a particular splitting rule to fall into a fixed terminal node at the bottom of the tree regardless of any changes in variables irrelevant to that splitting rule thereby reducing the likelihood of detecting changes in nutrient limitation furthermore variables selected by the tree may change over time e g wtemp which can confound the accuracy of predictions for new periods in these regards new bioassay experiments can be particularly useful for re calibrating and updating the cart models 5 2 application of the cart ensemble approach to new periods provided insights on changes in nutrient limitation patterns and effects of nutrient reductions goal 2 predictions from the ensemble approach showed modest changes 10 out of 72 cases in nutrient limitation patterns at the six stations that had bioassay data figure s10 table 2 our extended analysis of the 21 tidal stations showed similar changes figure s11 adding further confidence to these results we emphasize that these patterns should be viewed as the overall behavior of nutrient limitation for the specified periods and these patterns can change between different hydrologic conditions or temporal periods these estimated changes in nutrient limitation were further compared with estimated changes in monitored nutrient concentrations between the 1992 2002 period and the 2007 2017 period δ as computed with generalized additive models murphy et al 2019 table 2 for example the switch from p limitation to n limitation at cb2 1 in september is consistent with its declining din concentration δ 0 080 mg l 1 p 0 01 and increasing dip concentration δ 0 003 mg l 1 p 0 066 similarly the switch from nor to p limitation at cb3 3c in both january and december is consistent with its declining dip concentration δ 0 003 mg l 1 p 0 053 these consistencies add further confidence to the estimated changes in nutrient limitation although nutrient concentrations alone do not always explain the estimated changes in nutrient limitation nutrient limitation maps showed expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 fig 7 these changes imply that some parts of the bay have become less nutrient saturated consistent with other observed water quality improvements that have been linked to nutrient reductions harding et al 2016 lefcheck et al 2018 murphy et al 2011 testa et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 this implication is also consistent with the expected impacts of management efforts intended to improve water quality by reducing the human impact on the landscape and addressing legacy pollution as well as pressures from steady population growth in the watershed chesapeake bay program 2020 these efforts have been pursued through the implementation of wastewater agricultural atmospheric and urban stormwater source controls to address the pollutant reduction goals outlined in the chesapeake bay partnership agreements chesapeake executive council 1983 1987 2000 2014 and the chesapeake bay tmdl u s environmental protection agency 2010 in response to management actions such as wastewater treatment plant upgrades boynton et al 2008 reductions in fertilizer applications keisman et al 2018 and reductions in n emissions under the clean air act eshleman et al 2013 n load has decreased across the bay watershed over the last three decades ator et al 2019 chanat et al 2016 chanat and yang 2018 hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a 2015 which may have led to expanded areas of n limitation in the bay especially in seasons of low freshwater input a strength of the cart approach is its ability to predict nutrient limitation for different hydrologic conditions or temporal periods our results showed that for the same temporal period 2003 2017 dry years had expanded areas of np limitation and n limitation and contracted areas of nor and p limitation compared to wet years fig 8 a majority of nor in wet years switched to p limitation dry years in the upper bay in winter months december february moreover additional cases of np limitation dry years occurred primarily in locations and months that were p limited wet years these changes reflect the fact that dry conditions are associated with lower nutrient delivery to the bay boynton and kemp 2000 thereby creating more opportunities for nutrient limitation to occur such an effect of hydrologic condition has been previously observed in bioassay experiments by fisher et al 1999 and fisher and gustafson 2005 our results also showed that under similar hydrologic conditions more recent periods had expanded areas of np limitation and contracted areas of p limitation compared to the earliest period 1990 1991 fig 9 the expansion of np limitation occurred primarily in locations and months that had previously been p limited this indicates that n concentrations have been reduced to its limiting level in those cases likely due to reductions in n load the reduction in p limited areas is consistent with the observations that 1 tp load to the bay has increased since the mid 1990s largely due to reduced trapping of sediment and associated p by conowingo reservoir as it neared its sediment storage capacity hirsch 2012 langland 2015 zhang et al 2013 2016b and that 2 dissolved orthophosphate to the bay has increased substantially recently fanelli et al 2019 despite these changes the overall seasonal and spatial patterns of nutrient limitation in chesapeake bay remain similar to the 1992 2002 period kemp et al 2005 nor is common in the upper bay during winter when daylight is short and where salinity is low water is colder and more turbid and ambient nutrient concentrations are high for example our data at cb2 1 show that winter din and dip concentrations are roughly 14 times and 2 times higher than the bloom limitation thresholds respectively algal growth in winter does not appear to be fast enough to reduce the high nutrient concentrations to bloom limiting levels in either the experimental controls or the np treatments in the bioassays leading to no differential growth response between the controls and treatments p limitation is common in spring when temperature increases and din dip ratios are high in river flows under these conditions algae are growing faster and taking up more nutrients bringing p concentrations to limiting levels n limitation is common throughout the bay in summer and early fall due to depletion of din from surface waters and high release rates of dip from the bottom anoxic sediments np limitation only occurs in the high salinity oceanic influenced lower bay when din and dip concentrations are both below their limiting levels and hence algal growth is responsive to both n and p additions overall these patterns in nutrient limitation reinforce a dual nutrient management strategy for controlling nutrient enrichment in chesapeake bay the implications of uneven nutrient management have been seen in the north sea where it is reported that a more effective reduction of p than n load has led to a large imbalance in the n p stoichiometry of coastal waters resulting in an offshore gradient from p to n limitation burson et al 2016 although estuaries often exhibit strong seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient limitation detection of shifts in nutrient limitation can provide important indicators of estuarine response to nutrient reductions for example it is predicted that p limited areas at the continental shelf of the northern gulf of mexico would extend by over 50 in may and july if dip concentration in the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers is reduced by half laurent et al 2012 while some of the estimated changes in nutrient limitation in chesapeake bay may be an early indication on the impact of nutrient reductions further reductions are likely needed to reduce nutrient concentrations to limiting levels to achieve a less nutrient saturated ecosystem 6 conclusions we analyzed historical data from nutrient bioassays and data from the cbp long term water quality monitoring network to develop empirical approaches for predicting nutrient limitation cart reproduced the bioassay based nutrient limitation patterns in 1992 2002 much better than two non statistical approaches a1 and a2 because it can utilize relevant variables beyond din and dip the ensemble approach of the three selected cart models satisfactorily reproduced the bioassay based results classification rate 99 predictions from the ensemble approach showed modest changes in nutrient limitation with expanded areas of n limitation and contracted areas of nor in 2007 2017 compared to 1992 2002 these changes imply that long term reductions in nitrogen load have led to expanded areas with nutrient limited phytoplankton growth reflecting long term water quality improvements in the context of nutrient enrichment however nutrient limitation patterns remain unchanged in the majority of the mainstem suggesting that nutrient loads should be further reduced to achieve a less nutrient saturated ecosystem these insights can help inform management strategies called for in the chesapeake bay tmdl explain changes in tidal water quality and facilitate future refinements of chesapeake bay estuarine models these results also indicate the need for conducting additional bioassay experiments for model validation and enhancement more broadly this research highlights the value of maintaining a long term water quality monitoring network and provides an example on how tidal monitoring data can be assessed in other
