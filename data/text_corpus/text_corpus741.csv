3705,complementary equations have been widely applied to evaporation e estimation in poorly monitored areas and under changing conditions it is essential to determine a priori the key parameter called the asymmetric parameter or land surface parameter in the sigmoid equation b for predictive application of complementary equations a previous study wang et al 2020a suggested ecosystem mean b values at the global scale which however exhibit significant variation for specific ecosystem types especially for grasslands this brings a challenge for accurate estimation of e in this study taking the alpine grassland ecosystem on the tibetan plateau tp as an example eddy covariance data from 10 ec monitoring sites across tp were used to investigate b and its control factors our results show that 1 b ranges from 0 48 to 2 56 with a mean value of 1 52 0 65 mean standard deviation in alpine grasslands of the tp and b is significantly correlated r2 0 97 p value 0 01 with the mean annual surface soil water content which results in an empirical formula to determine b 2 the sigmoid generalized complementary equation aided by the estimated b exhibits a high efficiency of evaporation calculation with a mean nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 88 on the tp and 3 a small perturbation in b could cause a high bias in the e estimation especially in areas of low soil moisture the proposed empirical formula to estimate b lays the foundation for accurate evaporation prediction on the tp under fast changing conditions keywords evaporation sigmoid generalized complementary equation tibetan plateau soil water content asymmetric parameter 1 introduction terrestrial evaporation e incorporating soil evaporation canopy interception and plant transpiration is the key variable that connects the water energy balances among the soil vegetation and atmosphere jackson et al 2001 katul et al 2012 williams et al 2012 it is essential to determine the amount of evaporation to identify the dominant process concept grayson and blöschl 2000 blöschl and montanari 2010 in hydrology which represents a set of the most important processes and reduces the uncertainty in hydrological analysis under the background of global climate change a deep understanding of the evaporation process is also important for agricultural management hydrologic forecasting and sustainable water resource management allen et al 1998 bastiaanssen et al 2005 fisher et al 2017 the complementary relation first proposed by bouchet 1963 is an important method for estimating evaporation by using this method evaporation can be calculated with standard meteorological data net radiation temperature wind speed and humidity without complicated underlying landscape properties such as canopy resistance in the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 at first the complementary relation among actual evaporation e potential evaporation e po and apparent potential evaporation e pa was assumed to be a symmetric linear form bouchet 1963 brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 e corresponds to an extensive surface under natural conditions and e po corresponds to the same surface of e but with unlimited evaporating water while e pa takes place from a small saturated surface inside the large surface brutsaert 2015 later the complementary relation was developed to the asymmetric linear form brutsaert and parlange 1998 pettijohn and salvucci 2006 szilagyi 2007 by introducing an asymmetric parameter to date a few nonlinear complementary equations have been proposed including the sigmoid equation han et al 2012 han and tian 2018 polynomial equation brutsaert 2015 and exponential equation gao and xu 2021 among the different forms of generalized complementary equations the sigmoid equation shows the highest accuracy in estimating e han and tian 2018 ma et al 2015b yang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 the asymmetric parameter is a key parameter in the complementary relations and determines the magnitude of the evaporation demand response to the areal evaporation change in the linear complementary approach szilagyi 2007 considered the asymmetric parameter to be an aridity index which can be determined by surface temperature in the sigmoid generalized equation han and tian 2018 the asymmetric parameter is inherited and the meaning is extended to reflect the asymmetric property in the quasilinear central portion and the shape of the sigmoid function wang et al 2020a showed that the asymmetric parameter in the sigmoid equation reflects the land surface moisture property we specify the asymmetric parameter as the land surface parameter b in this study to distinguish the asymmetric parameter in the sigmoid equation from the original one in the linear equation brutsaert and parlange 1998 under certain inputs net radiation temperature wind speed and humidity the amount of predicted evaporation is determined by the value of b thus it is essential to determine a priori b for predictive application a previous study wang et al 2020a provided ecosystem mean b values at the global scale however the results exhibit significant variation for specific ecosystem types especially for grasslands han and tian 2018 wang et al 2021 this brings a challenge for accurate estimation of e which calls for a solution of b based on readily available observations a deep understanding of environmental influence on b may provide important references and help predict b values as an increasing number of remote sensing technologies are available to provide sound estimations of surface information such as soil moisture and vegetation conditions introducing surface information in the complementary approach is a suitable choice for e estimation han and tian 2020 the tibetan plateau tp is called the asian water tower and the third pole of the world more than two thirds of its total area is occupied by grassland cui and graf 2009 the tp has important impacts on regional and even global climate systems because of the strong interactions among the hydrosphere atmosphere biosphere and cryosphere wu et al 2015 yao et al 2015 typical processes of the hydrosphere such as evaporation are sophisticated on the tp due to strong solar radiation and the complex climate and terrain chen et al 2013 qiu 2013 wu et al 2012 yao et al 2015 there were sparse observation sites on the tp and the distribution of existing sites was uneven due to the high elevation and harsh climate conditions xue et al 2017 yang et al 2011 this resulted in a lack of a general understanding of the evaporation processes previous studies based on in situ measurements have focused mainly on evaporation processes within a single site e g ma et al 2015a zhang et al 2018 in recent years long term in situ observations of energy and water have been launched on the tp and in neighboring regions some programs such as the tibetan observation and research platform torp ma et al 2008a new integrated observational system over the tibetan plateau niost xu et al 2008 and heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater li et al 2013 have started to share their observations across the tp which provide a good opportunity to investigate the evaporation process for the region there are two major motivations for this research first wang et al 2020a found that the ecosystem mean b values are highly correlated with the surface moisture condition at the global scale however it is not clear whether such a correlation exists within a specific ecosystem type if a relationship between the site specific b and the site mean surface soil water content swc can be established within an ecosystem type the accuracy of evaporation estimation will be improved for the grassland the variation of b values is high this variation could cause high uncertainties when the ecosystem mean b value is used in the evaporation estimation in addition grasslands provide a good opportunity to investigate the correlation between b and the site mean swc because each term has a wide range this is the reason that we choose grasslands as our objective in this study although 37 grassland sites were investigated in wang et al 2020 no obvious correlation was found between b and site mean swc because these sites are scattered around the world and many factors related to geolocation may affect the results thus we choose to achieve the goal in a particular area at the regional scale second although many efforts have been made to estimate e on the tp the magnitudes and even trends of estimated e are divergent among different studies yin et al 2013 song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 han et al 2021 it is necessary to provide an elaborate analysis considering the differences within ecosystem types especially for grasslands future studies could provide a comprehensive dataset of evaporation using the results in this study after including the analysis of other ecosystem types in this study taking the alpine grassland ecosystem on tp as an example we collected eddy covariance ec data from 10 monitoring sites and simulated evaporation with a sigmoid generalized complementary sgc equation the land surface parameter b and its possible determinants were investigated the objective of this study is to establish the relationships between site specific b and environmental factors which can be used in accurate e estimation in grasslands on the tp this study is an important application of the work in wang et al 2020 and it deepens and expands the previous generalized complementary studies han and tian 2018 wang et al 2020 this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the sgc equation used to estimate the actual e and the data sources and processing section 3 describes and discusses the variation of b values for the region the determination of b values the accuracy of the sgc equation in estimating evaporation e and the sensitivity of the estimated e to b the main findings are summarized in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 sgc equation based on previous studies bouchet 1963 brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert and parlange 1998 han et al 2012 proposed the generalized complementary equation which expresses e e pen as a sigmoid equation sgc of e rad e pen y e e pen 1 1 m x max x x x min n 1 x e rad e pen in eq 1 xmax and xmin respectively correspond to specific maximum or minimum values of x under extremely wet or arid conditions for relatively dry areas xmax and xmin can be set as 1 and 0 respectively wang et al 2020a the e pen term is defined by penman s equation penman 1948 which can be expressed as 2 e pen e rad e aero δ r n g δ γ ρ c p δ γ κ 2 u z ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e a e a where e rad δ r n g δ γ is the

measurement height table 1 d0 m is the displacement height and z0m m and z0v m are the roughness lengths for momentum and water vapor respectively the last three parameters are estimated from the canopy height hc in m table 1 as d 0 0 67 h c z 0 m 0 123 h c and z 0 v 0 1 z 0 m allen et al 1998 the two parameters m and n of eq 1 can be determined by the priestley taylor coefficient α and the land surface parameter b han and tian 2018 3 n 4 α 1 b 1 x 0 5 1 x 0 5 m x 0 5 1 x 0 5 n where x 0 5 0 5 b 1 α 1 b 1 is a variable that corresponds to y 0 5 in this study α was calculated by the mean value of e e rad wherever e e pen was larger than 0 9 kahler and brutsaert 2006 ma et al 2015b when all e e pen values were 0 9 α was set as the default value of 1 26 priestley and taylor 1972 brutsaert and stricker 1979 the parameter b was calibrated by an optimization algorithm with the objective function as minimization of the mean absolute error mae between the e est estimated by eq 1 and e w m 2 observed at the monthly scale a trial and error optimization routine aided by an automatic iterative algorithm szilagyi 2007 was utilized for b to reach e est e m i n the objective function was selected following the instructions of legates and mccabe 1999 and han and tian 2018 2 2 data sources and data processing the eddy flux data analyzed in the present study were obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc https data tpdc ac cn en observations from 10 sites across the tp fig 1 were analyzed all sites were grasslands three sites located in haibei hbs hbw and hbg have different species compositions for example site hbg is a typical alpine grassland site hbs has more shrubs and site hbw is a marshy meadow other detailed information on the 10 sites can be found in table 1 daily data including net radiation ground heat flux sensible heat flux latent heat flux in all in w m 2 air temperature c air pressure kg m 3 wind speed m s 1 relative humidity swc at the first layer 0 5 cm and total precipitation mm were acquired from the tpdc the measurement heights of all variables are listed in table 1 except that the ground heat flux and swc were measured at 0 5 cm underground the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data are from the noaa climate data record cdr of avhrr ndvi which contains gridded daily ndvi derived from the noaa avhrr surface reflectance product all the daily data were converted to monthly data the monthly timestep was chosen to complete the analysis in this study to obtain the best performance of the generalized complementary equation wang et al 2021 in the quality control processes we constrained the sensible heat latent heat and available energy r n g to values above 0 the residual term of the energy balance was attributed to the latent heat as the energy residual er closure correction which has been widely adopted in studies on complementary principles e g ershadi et al 2014 han and tian 2018 the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse was used to evaluate the efficiency of estimating e by the sgc equation legates and mccabe 1999 4 n s e 1 e e est 2 e e 2 where e est is the estimated daily evaporation according to eq 1 and e is the averaged value of e w m 2 a leave one out strategy was adopted to improve the credibility of the prediction results in this strategy the predicted b at the validation site was determined based on the linear regression model with the other 9b values as input 3 results and discussion 3 1 asymmetric parameter b in the grasslands the b values of the 10 grassland sites on the tp are shown in fig 1 and table 2 the minimum value is 0 48 for site qoms this site is located near the qomolangma base camp with the lowest mean evaporation and swc 3 the maximum value is 2 56 for site hbw this site is a marshy meadow in haibei with the highest mean evaporation and swc 45 among the ten sites the b values are lower than 1 at the three sites located in the southern tp five sites have b values in the range of 1 2 and the other two sites in the northeastern tp have b values higher than 2 the mean value is 1 52 0 65 mean standard deviation the mean b value of these sites is smaller than those of grasslands in other regions wang et al 2021 found that the mean b value of 11 grasslands in europe and america from fluxnet was 6 29 1 63 at monthly scale according to a previous study wang et al 2020a the b values are controlled mainly by land surface moisture conditions the relatively low b values on the tp are related to the specific climatological background field and relatively dry conditions compared with the regions at the same latitude or nearby lowland areas ma et al 2015b found that m and n eq 1 substitutions of b in an alpine steppe in the central tp were 2 54 and 1 53 respectively the study site of ma et al 2015b is geologically close to site naqu with coordinates of approximately 32 n and 90 e the results in ma et al 2015b are indeed similar to our results for site naqu m 2 49 n 1 94 with a corresponding b value of 1 32 which indicates that the results in this study are consistent with those of previous studies on the tp 3 2 determination of b the differences in the b values may potentially reflect the background energy input atmospheric conditions and surface water conditions at different sites the mean annual values and standard deviations of environmental factors net radiation r n air temperature t a wind speed u z relative humidity rh swc precipitation ppt and ndvi were shown in table 3 these environmental factors were chosen because they are associated mainly with evaporation processes the linear relationships provided in fig 2 were based on the mean annual results at the 10 sites the results indicate that the mean annual net radiation r2 0 01 p value 0 91 fig 2a and air temperature r2 0 09 p value 0 39 fig 2b have limited impacts on b the wind speed has a negative relationship with b and r2 is 0 48 p value 0 03 fig 2c the relationship between b and the rh is positive with an r2 value of 0 30 p value 0 1 fig 2d theoretically the net radiation and air temperature affect evaporation through e rad and they have substantial influences on the temporal variation of e the wind speed and relative humidity affect the evaporation estimation through e aero however these factors only influence x in eq 1 which represents the atmospheric wetness han and tian 2020 according to the generalized complementary principle b represents the wetness condition of the underlying surface instead of the atmosphere han and tian 2020 wang et al 2020a specifically we found that b exhibits high dependence on the surface swc r2 0 97 p value 0 01 fig 2e and the relationship can be described as 5 b 0 046 s w c 0 495 r 2 0 97 this means that swc can explain most of the variation of b in the grasslands on the tp a previous study wang et al 2020a found that the b values of different ecosystems increase as the land surface wetness increases the ecosystem mean b values are positively correlated with swc and the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 69 wang et al 2020a however this finding was based on only the ecosystem mean results which reflected the control of ecosystem type on b that study provided the impetus for the determination of varying b using surface moisture information at individual sites in this study it was further found that the relationship between b and swc was significant p value 0 01 within the same ecosystem type grassland in a specific plateau region the pearson correlation coefficient reached 0 98 which is even higher than that for ecosystem mean values 0 66 this empirical formula eq 5 p value 0 01 makes it feasible to predict b from swc and lays the foundation for accurate evaporation prediction on the tp in future studies in addition we found that swc has high correlations with u z r2 0 56 and rh r2 0 21 which provides explanations for the pseudo relevance between b and the two meteorological variables for precipitation the correlation is positive with an r2 value of 0 33 the results scatter along the regression line p value 0 08 fig 2f some studies e g liu et al 2018 brutsaert et al 2020 emphasized the importance of precipitation in determining the key parameter of the complementary equations in estimating e however our results did not support that precipitation is more vital than swc we inferred that the inherent surface wetness condition can be better and more directly represented by swc instead of ppt the magnitudes of swc and ppt are out of sync and the two variables show a weak coupling relationship r2 0 33 the probable reason for this difference is that ppt is not the only source of surface moisture for example the marshy meadow in haibei hbw has high swc but moderate ppt in the mountain area on the tp the water availability is determined not only by precipitation but also by glacier meltwater yang et al 2011 ye et al 2007 the thawing of frozen soil guo et al 2011 yang et al 2007 and the replenishment of groundwater cheng and jin 2013 zhang et al 2017 thus the representation of ppt on land surface moisture conditions in this alpine region is not as good as those in other regions liu et al 2018 brutsaert et al 2020 the ndvi is another important land surface variable that provides a measurement of surface vegetation coverage activity this factor is related to the vegetation transpiration process and may affect the value of b the regression relationship between b and the site mean ndvi is shown in fig 2g this result indicates that b and the ndvi have a positive correlation with an r2 of 0 58 p value 0 01 this r2 value is higher than those for the other environmental factors except for swc which indicates that this land surface variable also has an important influence on b however compared with the strong relationship between b and swc the correlation between b and the ndvi is not accurate enough to be used to predict b in addition the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 7 between the swc and ndvi which indicates that the two factors are not independent swc can be used to reflect the synthesized land surface characteristics including soil moisture and vegetation conditions a stepwise regression was established based on the relationship between b and environmental factors r n t a u z rh swc ppt and ndvi and the results show that retaining only swc minimizes the akaike information criterion aic this indicates that the ndvi and the other factors cannot provide additional help for predicting b 3 3 estimation of evaporation based on b the sgc equation shows a high accuracy in estimating the actual evaporation on the tp the simulated results for site hbg and site qoms are shown in fig 3 as examples for the northeastern and southwestern regions on the tp respectively which have substantially different surface moisture conditions generally the observed results black dots in fig 3 cluster tightly around the sigmoid curves red lines in fig 3 which represent the estimations of sgc when b is high the sigmoid line is close to the p t boundary line blue line in fig 3a which is the theoretical upper boundary of evaporation the dashed purple lines fig 3 represent the estimations of the linear advection aridity approach aa brutsaert and stricker 1979 kahler and brutsaert 2006 when e rad e pen is low the results are close to the sigmoid lines but deviate from the aa lines which indicates that the sigmoid equation performs better than the linear aa approach in e estimation we suggest that there is no universal sigmoid shape for all sites which means that a fixed sigmoid curve can simulate e at one site but that the curve should change according to the long term surface moisture conditions at another site for example site qoms swc 3 and site arou swc 34 5 have the same annual mean 0 59 but different y 0 34 for qoms 0 59 for arou obviously one curve cannot fit the results at both of the two sites fig 4 shows the regression relationships between evaporation estimated by the sgc equation and the actual evaporation each dot represents the monthly result generally most of the results lie along the regression lines and all the slopes are close to 1 with high r2 the regression slopes range from 0 84 arou to 1 17 ali with a mean value of 0 96 0 09 seven of the ten sites have slopes between 0 9 and 1 1 the lowest intercept is 7 96 w m 2 for site ali and the highest intercept is 14 59 w m 2 for site namors site setors has a regression slope equal to 1 and an intercept 0 52 closest to 0 the evaluation metrics including the nse r2 root mean square error rmse and mae are shown in table 2 the mean nse value is 0 88 0 10 except for site namors 0 68 the other sites have nse values higher than 0 7 with a mean value of 0 90 0 08 the high nse values satisfy the accuracy requirement of the discharge simulation in hydrological models on the tp tong et al 2014 xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2021 provided the overall performance of the sgc equation in grasslands across the world which has a mean nse value of 0 71 at the monthly scale compared with this global mean level the results mean nse 0 88 indicate that the sgc equation performs fairly well at these sites across the tp r2 ranges from 0 75 to 0 97 with a mean value of 0 91 0 08 site hbg has the highest nse 0 97 and r2 0 97 values the mean rmse and mae values of the ten sites are 11 50 4 40 w m 2 and 8 84 3 44 w m 2 respectively site hbg has the lowest rmse of 6 29 w m 2 and mae of 4 44 w m 2 while site hbw has the highest rmse of 18 37 w m 2 and mae of 15 34 w m 2 most of the sites have rmses and maes lower than 10 w m 2 song et al 2017 estimated evaporation on the tp based on the penman monteith pm algorithm and they reported rmse values ranging from 15 8 w m 2 to 25 7 w m 2 and r2 values ranging from 0 36 to 0 76 when the estimated evaporation was evaluated for site hbg and site dangxiong wang et al 2020b reported rmse values ranging from 11 3 w m 2 to 15 0 w m 2 and r2 values ranging from 0 87 to 0 93 when they used the polynomial complementary equation to estimate e in the central tp the evaluation metrics for e estimation based on the predicted parameter b according to eq 5 are shown in table 4 generally the efficiency of the sgc equation with predicted b is similar to that with calibrated b the maes in table 4 are only slightly higher than those in table 2 the mean mae based on the predicted b is 8 88 3 43 w m 2 which is approximately 0 04 w m 2 higher than that based on the calibrated b value the maximum difference is 0 16 w m 2 for site namors and most of the sites have equal maes the mean rmse is 11 51 4 33 w m 2 which is close to that based on the calibrated b value 11 50 4 40 w m 2 the nses in table 2 and table 4 are similar with the same mean value 0 88 0 10 which indicates that the prognostic model has the same accuracy as the diagnostic model when the leave one out strategy was used to determine the predicted b value the evaluation metrics had no detectable changes table 4 as the obtained b values were close to those estimated by eq 5 under the assumption of the sgc model the key parameter b represents the general land surface wetness condition it is considered a site specific parameter and remains fixed during the study period to validate this assumption in this study we added interannual and seasonal july to september in the summer analyses for dangxiong the results are shown in table 5 from 2006 to 2010 b ranges from 0 68 to 0 97 with a mean value of 0 85 when we used the data for the summer only the calibrated b value equaled 1 10 these values are close to the site mean result of 0 96 because both b 0 68 0 97 and surface soil moisture 9 25 10 73 are within a narrow range the regression relationship cannot be established at one site if we used the interannual b values of all 10 sites the additional scatters would surround the original site mean results this cannot affect the linear correlation between b and swc and only slightly increases the random error because of the noise generally the above results indicate a high efficiency of the sgc equation for e estimation our results are consistent with those of previous studies ma et al 2015b zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2020b which also found that the complementary relationship is substantial and can be applied for high accuracy evaporation estimation on the tp 3 4 sensitivity analysis of estimated evaporation to b to assess how sensitive the estimated evaporation is to parameter b we performed a sensitivity analysis at each site according to timmermans et al 2007 and long et al 2011 we changed the b value from the optimum value at a 10 perturbation within the 50 range the variation of the estimated evaporation var e is calculated by 6 var e e e 0 e 0 100 where e is the estimated e based on the perturbed b values and e 0 is the estimated e based on the optimum b values listed in table 2 the mean values of var e for the 10 sites are shown in fig 5 a all the biases change from negative to positive as the parameter is perturbed from 50 to 50 for the average a 50 decrease in b causes a nearly 15 2 decrease in estimated e and a 50 increase in b causes a 24 10 increase in estimated e fig 5a the sensitivities of estimated evaporation to b vary at different sites taking the moderate site ali as an example a 50 decrease in b could cause a nearly 24 decrease in estimated e and a 50 increase in b could cause a 33 increase in estimated e fig 5b the difference in the magnitude is due to the nonlinear form of the complementary equation for the driest site qoms with the lowest b a 50 decrease in b could cause a nearly 44 decrease in estimated e and a 50 increase in b could cause a 100 increase in estimated e additionally a 10 decrease in b could cause a nearly 12 decrease in estimated e and a 10 increase in b could cause a 14 increase in estimated e fig 5c this indicates that a small perturbation in b could cause a high bias in e estimation at this site for the wettest site hbw with the highest b a 50 decrease in b causes only a 1 5 decrease in the estimated e and a 50 increase in b causes a 1 6 increase in estimated e fig 5d these results indicate that estimated e is sensitive to parameter b especially in low soil moisture areas in other words high biases in the e estimation occur in regions with low surface swcs which is true for most parts of the tp thus the adequate determination of b is vital to the estimation of evaporation in this region and similar arid areas universal b for the whole tp results in a risk of high uncertainties in e estimation it is necessary to determine b with accessible surface information to reduce the uncertainties and improve the accuracy of e estimation in this study the mean annual swc which is a key index of the land surface property shows great potential for this purpose the advantage is that the mean annual swc is stable and easily available with the help of new techniques e g remote sensing compared with other indexes such as ppt and the aridity index the swc can better reflect the surface wetness condition and water usability ma et al 2015b evaluated the sensitivity of the sigmoid equation to m and n eq 1 in a grassland on the tp the swc is approximately 10 at this site the results show that var e is equally sensitive to m and n when m and n decrease by 50 var e increases by approximately 23 and decreases by approximately 26 respectively which is close to our result at moderate sites such as ali both m and n can be expressed as equations of b eq 3 thus the sensitivity analysis for b is more intrinsic and straightforward compared with ma et al 2015b our results have a wide moisture condition range 3 45 thus the variation of the sensitivities at these sites with different soil moisture conditions can be analyzed accounting for limiting dry conditions brutsaert 2015 used adjustable parameter c in the polynomial equation to reflect the surface aridity although he suggested that c should be introduced in unusual situations only later brutsaert et al 2020 used the site specific parameter α c with c 0 for global e estimation and found that α c can be predicted by the mean annual aridity index zhou et al 2021 analyzed the polynomial function at the annual scale and found that α c is highly correlated with precipitation and the aridity index li et al 2021 further found that α c is determined not only by the aridity index but also by the ndvi crago et al 2016 proposed the rescaling complementary approach with a self adjusting independent variable y x x x min 1 x min which is an enormous contribution to express the complementary approach in calibration free form ma and szilagyi 2019 pointed out that the rescaling term for x can be considered an index of aridity compared with this method it is more direct to link the wetness condition with b in this study liu et al 2020 suggested that the complementary approach proposed by crago et al 2016 is intrinsically a linear asymmetric complementary equation with parameter b as a variable b 1 x min x min and x min varies at an individual site thus y x actually represents a cluster of curves in essence brutsaert et al 2020 and crago et al 2016 also considered the limiting conditions however by other means which are different from ours 4 conclusions in this study the sgc equation was used to simulate the actual evaporation with observations from 10 grasslands across the tp the determination of the land surface parameter b was investigated with the expectation of predicting this key parameter the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the parameter b ranges from 0 48 to 2 56 with a mean value of 1 52 0 65 in the grasslands of the tp there is a significant linear relationship p value 0 01 r2 0 97 between b and the surface swc and this relationship can be used to predict b and therefore evaporation on the tp in future studies the high correlation indicates that b represents the land surface moisture property and this parameter could be the key point to combine the advantages of the complementary approach and the budyko or penman type methods which emphasize the usability of surface information in e estimation a deep comprehension of b and land surface water supply capacity will be the development direction of the generalized complementary approach in the future 2 the sgc equation in conjunction with the estimated b value exhibits a high efficiency of evaporation calculation on the tp with high nse 0 88 and low bias in both diagnostic mae 8 84 w m 2 and prognostic mae 8 88 w m 2 models these results are consistent with those of previous studies ma et al 2015b zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2020b which suggests that the complementary relationship is substantial on the tp 3 the estimated e value is sensitive to parameter b and a small perturbation in b can cause a high bias in the e estimation especially in low soil moisture areas further efforts should be made to determine b with high accuracy on the tp where most areas suffer from cold and dry conditions in this study we focus mainly on grasslands which occupy two thirds of the total area of the tp the grasslands including the alpine meadow alpine steppe and temperate steppe show higher variations in physiological properties than the other land cover types e g water body it is necessary to provide an elaborate analysis considering the differences within this ecosystem type in addition it is acknowledged that b differs in different ecosystem types thus more analysis for other ecosystem types such as wetlands and forests also needs to be done before

3705,complementary equations have been widely applied to evaporation e estimation in poorly monitored areas and under changing conditions it is essential to determine a priori the key parameter called the asymmetric parameter or land surface parameter in the sigmoid equation b for predictive application of complementary equations a previous study wang et al 2020a suggested ecosystem mean b values at the global scale which however exhibit significant variation for specific ecosystem types especially for grasslands this brings a challenge for accurate estimation of e in this study taking the alpine grassland ecosystem on the tibetan plateau tp as an example eddy covariance data from 10 ec monitoring sites across tp were used to investigate b and its control factors our results show that 1 b ranges from 0 48 to 2 56 with a mean value of 1 52 0 65 mean standard deviation in alpine grasslands of the tp and b is significantly correlated r2 0 97 p value 0 01 with the mean annual surface soil water content which results in an empirical formula to determine b 2 the sigmoid generalized complementary equation aided by the estimated b exhibits a high efficiency of evaporation calculation with a mean nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 88 on the tp and 3 a small perturbation in b could cause a high bias in the e estimation especially in areas of low soil moisture the proposed empirical formula to estimate b lays the foundation for accurate evaporation prediction on the tp under fast changing conditions keywords evaporation sigmoid generalized complementary equation tibetan plateau soil water content asymmetric parameter 1 introduction terrestrial evaporation e incorporating soil evaporation canopy interception and plant transpiration is the key variable that connects the water energy balances among the soil vegetation and atmosphere jackson et al 2001 katul et al 2012 williams et al 2012 it is essential to determine the amount of evaporation to identify the dominant process concept grayson and blöschl 2000 blöschl and montanari 2010 in hydrology which represents a set of the most important processes and reduces the uncertainty in hydrological analysis under the background of global climate change a deep understanding of the evaporation process is also important for agricultural management hydrologic forecasting and sustainable water resource management allen et al 1998 bastiaanssen et al 2005 fisher et al 2017 the complementary relation first proposed by bouchet 1963 is an important method for estimating evaporation by using this method evaporation can be calculated with standard meteorological data net radiation temperature wind speed and humidity without complicated underlying landscape properties such as canopy resistance in the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 at first the complementary relation among actual evaporation e potential evaporation e po and apparent potential evaporation e pa was assumed to be a symmetric linear form bouchet 1963 brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 e corresponds to an extensive surface under natural conditions and e po corresponds to the same surface of e but with unlimited evaporating water while e pa takes place from a small saturated surface inside the large surface brutsaert 2015 later the complementary relation was developed to the asymmetric linear form brutsaert and parlange 1998 pettijohn and salvucci 2006 szilagyi 2007 by introducing an asymmetric parameter to date a few nonlinear complementary equations have been proposed including the sigmoid equation han et al 2012 han and tian 2018 polynomial equation brutsaert 2015 and exponential equation gao and xu 2021 among the different forms of generalized complementary equations the sigmoid equation shows the highest accuracy in estimating e han and tian 2018 ma et al 2015b yang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 the asymmetric parameter is a key parameter in the complementary relations and determines the magnitude of the evaporation demand response to the areal evaporation change in the linear complementary approach szilagyi 2007 considered the asymmetric parameter to be an aridity index which can be determined by surface temperature in the sigmoid generalized equation han and tian 2018 the asymmetric parameter is inherited and the meaning is extended to reflect the asymmetric property in the quasilinear central portion and the shape of the sigmoid function wang et al 2020a showed that the asymmetric parameter in the sigmoid equation reflects the land surface moisture property we specify the asymmetric parameter as the land surface parameter b in this study to distinguish the asymmetric parameter in the sigmoid equation from the original one in the linear equation brutsaert and parlange 1998 under certain inputs net radiation temperature wind speed and humidity the amount of predicted evaporation is determined by the value of b thus it is essential to determine a priori b for predictive application a previous study wang et al 2020a provided ecosystem mean b values at the global scale however the results exhibit significant variation for specific ecosystem types especially for grasslands han and tian 2018 wang et al 2021 this brings a challenge for accurate estimation of e which calls for a solution of b based on readily available observations a deep understanding of environmental influence on b may provide important references and help predict b values as an increasing number of remote sensing technologies are available to provide sound estimations of surface information such as soil moisture and vegetation conditions introducing surface information in the complementary approach is a suitable choice for e estimation han and tian 2020 the tibetan plateau tp is called the asian water tower and the third pole of the world more than two thirds of its total area is occupied by grassland cui and graf 2009 the tp has important impacts on regional and even global climate systems because of the strong interactions among the hydrosphere atmosphere biosphere and cryosphere wu et al 2015 yao et al 2015 typical processes of the hydrosphere such as evaporation are sophisticated on the tp due to strong solar radiation and the complex climate and terrain chen et al 2013 qiu 2013 wu et al 2012 yao et al 2015 there were sparse observation sites on the tp and the distribution of existing sites was uneven due to the high elevation and harsh climate conditions xue et al 2017 yang et al 2011 this resulted in a lack of a general understanding of the evaporation processes previous studies based on in situ measurements have focused mainly on evaporation processes within a single site e g ma et al 2015a zhang et al 2018 in recent years long term in situ observations of energy and water have been launched on the tp and in neighboring regions some programs such as the tibetan observation and research platform torp ma et al 2008a new integrated observational system over the tibetan plateau niost xu et al 2008 and heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater li et al 2013 have started to share their observations across the tp which provide a good opportunity to investigate the evaporation process for the region there are two major motivations for this research first wang et al 2020a found that the ecosystem mean b values are highly correlated with the surface moisture condition at the global scale however it is not clear whether such a correlation exists within a specific ecosystem type if a relationship between the site specific b and the site mean surface soil water content swc can be established within an ecosystem type the accuracy of evaporation estimation will be improved for the grassland the variation of b values is high this variation could cause high uncertainties when the ecosystem mean b value is used in the evaporation estimation in addition grasslands provide a good opportunity to investigate the correlation between b and the site mean swc because each term has a wide range this is the reason that we choose grasslands as our objective in this study although 37 grassland sites were investigated in wang et al 2020 no obvious correlation was found between b and site mean swc because these sites are scattered around the world and many factors related to geolocation may affect the results thus we choose to achieve the goal in a particular area at the regional scale second although many efforts have been made to estimate e on the tp the magnitudes and even trends of estimated e are divergent among different studies yin et al 2013 song et al 2017 wang et al 2018 han et al 2021 it is necessary to provide an elaborate analysis considering the differences within ecosystem types especially for grasslands future studies could provide a comprehensive dataset of evaporation using the results in this study after including the analysis of other ecosystem types in this study taking the alpine grassland ecosystem on tp as an example we collected eddy covariance ec data from 10 monitoring sites and simulated evaporation with a sigmoid generalized complementary sgc equation the land surface parameter b and its possible determinants were investigated the objective of this study is to establish the relationships between site specific b and environmental factors which can be used in accurate e estimation in grasslands on the tp this study is an important application of the work in wang et al 2020 and it deepens and expands the previous generalized complementary studies han and tian 2018 wang et al 2020 this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the sgc equation used to estimate the actual e and the data sources and processing section 3 describes and discusses the variation of b values for the region the determination of b values the accuracy of the sgc equation in estimating evaporation e and the sensitivity of the estimated e to b the main findings are summarized in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 sgc equation based on previous studies bouchet 1963 brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert and parlange 1998 han et al 2012 proposed the generalized complementary equation which expresses e e pen as a sigmoid equation sgc of e rad e pen y e e pen 1 1 m x max x x x min n 1 x e rad e pen in eq 1 xmax and xmin respectively correspond to specific maximum or minimum values of x under extremely wet or arid conditions for relatively dry areas xmax and xmin can be set as 1 and 0 respectively wang et al 2020a the e pen term is defined by penman s equation penman 1948 which can be expressed as 2 e pen e rad e aero δ r n g δ γ ρ c p δ γ κ 2 u z ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e a e a where e rad δ r n g δ γ is the

canopy height hc in m table 1 as d 0 0 67 h c z 0 m 0 123 h c and z 0 v 0 1 z 0 m allen et al 1998 the two parameters m and n of eq 1 can be determined by the priestley taylor coefficient α and the land surface parameter b han and tian 2018 3 n 4 α 1 b 1 x 0 5 1 x 0 5 m x 0 5 1 x 0 5 n where x 0 5 0 5 b 1 α 1 b 1 is a variable that corresponds to y 0 5 in this study α was calculated by the mean value of e e rad wherever e e pen was larger than 0 9 kahler and brutsaert 2006 ma et al 2015b when all e e pen values were 0 9 α was set as the default value of 1 26 priestley and taylor 1972 brutsaert and stricker 1979 the parameter b was calibrated by an optimization algorithm with the objective function as minimization of the mean absolute error mae between the e est estimated by eq 1 and e w m 2 observed at the monthly scale a trial and error optimization routine aided by an automatic iterative algorithm szilagyi 2007 was utilized for b to reach e est e m i n the objective function was selected following the instructions of legates and mccabe 1999 and han and tian 2018 2 2 data sources and data processing the eddy flux data analyzed in the present study were obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc https data tpdc ac cn en observations from 10 sites across the tp fig 1 were analyzed all sites were grasslands three sites located in haibei hbs hbw and hbg have different species compositions for example site hbg is a typical alpine grassland site hbs has more shrubs and site hbw is a marshy meadow other detailed information on the 10 sites can be found in table 1 daily data including net radiation ground heat flux sensible heat flux latent heat flux in all in w m 2 air temperature c air pressure kg m 3 wind speed m s 1 relative humidity swc at the first layer 0 5 cm and total precipitation mm were acquired from the tpdc the measurement heights of all variables are listed in table 1 except that the ground heat flux and swc were measured at 0 5 cm underground the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data are from the noaa climate data record cdr of avhrr ndvi which contains gridded daily ndvi derived from the noaa avhrr surface reflectance product all the daily data were converted to monthly data the monthly timestep was chosen to complete the analysis in this study to obtain the best performance of the generalized complementary equation wang et al 2021 in the quality control processes we constrained the sensible heat latent heat and available energy r n g to values above 0 the residual term of the energy balance was attributed to the latent heat as the energy residual er closure correction which has been widely adopted in studies on complementary principles e g ershadi et al 2014 han and tian 2018 the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse was used to evaluate the efficiency of estimating e by the sgc equation legates and mccabe 1999 4 n s e 1 e e est 2 e e 2 where e est is the estimated daily evaporation according to eq 1 and e is the averaged value of e w m 2 a leave one out strategy was adopted to improve the credibility of the prediction results in this strategy the predicted b at the validation site was determined based on the linear regression model with the other 9b values as input 3 results and discussion 3 1 asymmetric parameter b in the grasslands the b values of the 10 grassland sites on the tp are shown in fig 1 and table 2 the minimum value is 0 48 for site qoms this site is located near the qomolangma base camp with the lowest mean evaporation and swc 3 the maximum value is 2 56 for site hbw this site is a marshy meadow in haibei with the highest mean evaporation and swc 45 among the ten sites the b values are lower than 1 at the three sites located in the southern tp five sites have b values in the range of 1 2 and the other two sites in the northeastern tp have b values higher than 2 the mean value is 1 52 0 65 mean standard deviation the mean b value of these sites is smaller than those of grasslands in other regions wang et al 2021 found that the mean b value of 11 grasslands in europe and america from fluxnet was 6 29 1 63 at monthly scale according to a previous study wang et al 2020a the b values are controlled mainly by land surface moisture conditions the relatively low b values on the tp are related to the specific climatological background field and relatively dry conditions compared with the regions at the same latitude or nearby lowland areas ma et al 2015b found that m and n eq 1 substitutions of b in an alpine steppe in the central tp were 2 54 and 1 53 respectively the study site of ma et al 2015b is geologically close to site naqu with coordinates of approximately 32 n and 90 e the results in ma et al 2015b are indeed similar to our results for site naqu m 2 49 n 1 94 with a corresponding b value of 1 32 which indicates that the results in this study are consistent with those of previous studies on the tp 3 2 determination of b the differences in the b values may potentially reflect the background energy input atmospheric conditions and surface water conditions at different sites the mean annual values and standard deviations of environmental factors net radiation r n air temperature t a wind speed u z relative humidity rh swc precipitation ppt and ndvi were shown in table 3 these environmental factors were chosen because they are associated mainly with evaporation processes the linear relationships provided in fig 2 were based on the mean annual results at the 10 sites the results indicate that the mean annual net radiation r2 0 01 p value 0 91 fig 2a and air temperature r2 0 09 p value 0 39 fig 2b have limited impacts on b the wind speed has a negative relationship with b and r2 is 0 48 p value 0 03 fig 2c the relationship between b and the rh is positive with an r2 value of 0 30 p value 0 1 fig 2d theoretically the net radiation and air temperature affect evaporation through e rad and they have substantial influences on the temporal variation of e the wind speed and relative humidity affect the evaporation estimation through e aero however these factors only influence x in eq 1 which represents the atmospheric wetness han and tian 2020 according to the generalized complementary principle b represents the wetness condition of the underlying surface instead of the atmosphere han and tian 2020 wang et al 2020a specifically we found that b exhibits high dependence on the surface swc r2 0 97 p value 0 01 fig 2e and the relationship can be described as 5 b 0 046 s w c 0 495 r 2 0 97 this means that swc can explain most of the variation of b in the grasslands on the tp a previous study wang et al 2020a found that the b values of different ecosystems increase as the land surface wetness increases the ecosystem mean b values are positively correlated with swc and the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 69 wang et al 2020a however this finding was based on only the ecosystem mean results which reflected the control of ecosystem type on b that study provided the impetus for the determination of varying b using surface moisture information at individual sites in this study it was further found that the relationship between b and swc was significant p value 0 01 within the same ecosystem type grassland in a specific plateau region the pearson correlation coefficient reached 0 98 which is even higher than that for ecosystem mean values 0 66 this empirical formula eq 5 p value 0 01 makes it feasible to predict b from swc and lays the foundation for accurate evaporation prediction on the tp in future studies in addition we found that swc has high correlations with u z r2 0 56 and rh r2 0 21 which provides explanations for the pseudo relevance between b and the two meteorological variables for precipitation the correlation is positive with an r2 value of 0 33 the results scatter along the regression line p value 0 08 fig 2f some studies e g liu et al 2018 brutsaert et al 2020 emphasized the importance of precipitation in determining the key parameter of the complementary equations in estimating e however our results did not support that precipitation is more vital than swc we inferred that the inherent surface wetness condition can be better and more directly represented by swc instead of ppt the magnitudes of swc and ppt are out of sync and the two variables show a weak coupling relationship r2 0 33 the probable reason for this difference is that ppt is not the only source of surface moisture for example the marshy meadow in haibei hbw has high swc but moderate ppt in the mountain area on the tp the water availability is determined not only by precipitation but also by glacier meltwater yang et al 2011 ye et al 2007 the thawing of frozen soil guo et al 2011 yang et al 2007 and the replenishment of groundwater cheng and jin 2013 zhang et al 2017 thus the representation of ppt on land surface moisture conditions in this alpine region is not as good as those in other regions liu et al 2018 brutsaert et al 2020 the ndvi is another important land surface variable that provides a measurement of surface vegetation coverage activity this factor is related to the vegetation transpiration process and may affect the value of b the regression relationship between b and the site mean ndvi is shown in fig 2g this result indicates that b and the ndvi have a positive correlation with an r2 of 0 58 p value 0 01 this r2 value is higher than those for the other environmental factors except for swc which indicates that this land surface variable also has an important influence on b however compared with the strong relationship between b and swc the correlation between b and the ndvi is not accurate enough to be used to predict b in addition the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 7 between the swc and ndvi which indicates that the two factors are not independent swc can be used to reflect the synthesized land surface characteristics including soil moisture and vegetation conditions a stepwise regression was established based on the relationship between b and environmental factors r n t a u z rh swc ppt and ndvi and the results show that retaining only swc minimizes the akaike information criterion aic this indicates that the ndvi and the other factors cannot provide additional help for predicting b 3 3 estimation of evaporation based on b the sgc equation shows a high accuracy in estimating the actual evaporation on the tp the simulated results for site hbg and site qoms are shown in fig 3 as examples for the northeastern and southwestern regions on the tp respectively which have substantially different surface moisture conditions generally the observed results black dots in fig 3 cluster tightly around the sigmoid curves red lines in fig 3 which represent the estimations of sgc when b is high the sigmoid line is close to the p t boundary line blue line in fig 3a which is the theoretical upper boundary of evaporation the dashed purple lines fig 3 represent the estimations of the linear advection aridity approach aa brutsaert and stricker 1979 kahler and brutsaert 2006 when e rad e pen is low the results are close to the sigmoid lines but deviate from the aa lines which indicates that the sigmoid equation performs better than the linear aa approach in e estimation we suggest that there is no universal sigmoid shape for all sites which means that a fixed sigmoid curve can simulate e at one site but that the curve should change according to the long term surface moisture conditions at another site for example site qoms swc 3 and site arou swc 34 5 have the same annual mean 0 59 but different y 0 34 for qoms 0 59 for arou obviously one curve cannot fit the results at both of the two sites fig 4 shows the regression relationships between evaporation estimated by the sgc equation and the actual evaporation each dot represents the monthly result generally most of the results lie along the regression lines and all the slopes are close to 1 with high r2 the regression slopes range from 0 84 arou to 1 17 ali with a mean value of 0 96 0 09 seven of the ten sites have slopes between 0 9 and 1 1 the lowest intercept is 7 96 w m 2 for site ali and the highest intercept is 14 59 w m 2 for site namors site setors has a regression slope equal to 1 and an intercept 0 52 closest to 0 the evaluation metrics including the nse r2 root mean square error rmse and mae are shown in table 2 the mean nse value is 0 88 0 10 except for site namors 0 68 the other sites have nse values higher than 0 7 with a mean value of 0 90 0 08 the high nse values satisfy the accuracy requirement of the discharge simulation in hydrological models on the tp tong et al 2014 xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2021 provided the overall performance of the sgc equation in grasslands across the world which has a mean nse value of 0 71 at the monthly scale compared with this global mean level the results mean nse 0 88 indicate that the sgc equation performs fairly well at these sites across the tp r2 ranges from 0 75 to 0 97 with a mean value of 0 91 0 08 site hbg has the highest nse 0 97 and r2 0 97 values the mean rmse and mae values of the ten sites are 11 50 4 40 w m 2 and 8 84 3 44 w m 2 respectively site hbg has the lowest rmse of 6 29 w m 2 and mae of 4 44 w m 2 while site hbw has the highest rmse of 18 37 w m 2 and mae of 15 34 w m 2 most of the sites have rmses and maes lower than 10 w m 2 song et al 2017 estimated evaporation on the tp based on the penman monteith pm algorithm and they reported rmse values ranging from 15 8 w m 2 to 25 7 w m 2 and r2 values ranging from 0 36 to 0 76 when the estimated evaporation was evaluated for site hbg and site dangxiong wang et al 2020b reported rmse values ranging from 11 3 w m 2 to 15 0 w m 2 and r2 values ranging from 0 87 to 0 93 when they used the polynomial complementary equation to estimate e in the central tp the evaluation metrics for e estimation based on the predicted parameter b according to eq 5 are shown in table 4 generally the efficiency of the sgc equation with predicted b is similar to that with calibrated b the maes in table 4 are only slightly higher than those in table 2 the mean mae based on the predicted b is 8 88 3 43 w m 2 which is approximately 0 04 w m 2 higher than that based on the calibrated b value the maximum difference is 0 16 w m 2 for site namors and most of the sites have equal maes the mean rmse is 11 51 4 33 w m 2 which is close to that based on the calibrated b value 11 50 4 40 w m 2 the nses in table 2 and table 4 are similar with the same mean value 0 88 0 10 which indicates that the prognostic model has the same accuracy as the diagnostic model when the leave one out strategy was used to determine the predicted b value the evaluation metrics had no detectable changes table 4 as the obtained b values were close to those estimated by eq 5 under the assumption of the sgc model the key parameter b represents the general land surface wetness condition it is considered a site specific parameter and remains fixed during the study period to validate this assumption in this study we added interannual and seasonal july to september in the summer analyses for dangxiong the results are shown in table 5 from 2006 to 2010 b ranges from 0 68 to 0 97 with a mean value of 0 85 when we used the data for the summer only the calibrated b value equaled 1 10 these values are close to the site mean result of 0 96 because both b 0 68 0 97 and surface soil moisture 9 25 10 73 are within a narrow range the regression relationship cannot be established at one site if we used the interannual b values of all 10 sites the additional scatters would surround the original site mean results this cannot affect the linear correlation between b and swc and only slightly increases the random error because of the noise generally the above results indicate a high efficiency of the sgc equation for e estimation our results are consistent with those of previous studies ma et al 2015b zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2020b which also found that the complementary relationship is substantial and can be applied for high accuracy evaporation estimation on the tp 3 4 sensitivity analysis of estimated evaporation to b to assess how sensitive the estimated evaporation is to parameter b we performed a sensitivity analysis at each site according to timmermans et al 2007 and long et al 2011 we changed the b value from the optimum value at a 10 perturbation within the 50 range the variation of the estimated evaporation var e is calculated by 6 var e e e 0 e 0 100 where e is the estimated e based on the perturbed b values and e 0 is the estimated e based on the optimum b values listed in table 2 the mean values of var e for the 10 sites are shown in fig 5 a all the biases change from negative to positive as the parameter is perturbed from 50 to 50 for the average a 50 decrease in b causes a nearly 15 2 decrease in estimated e and a 50 increase in b causes a 24 10 increase in estimated e fig 5a the sensitivities of estimated evaporation to b vary at different sites taking the moderate site ali as an example a 50 decrease in b could cause a nearly 24 decrease in estimated e and a 50 increase in b could cause a 33 increase in estimated e fig 5b the difference in the magnitude is due to the nonlinear form of the complementary equation for the driest site qoms with the lowest b a 50 decrease in b could cause a nearly 44 decrease in estimated e and a 50 increase in b could cause a 100 increase in estimated e additionally a 10 decrease in b could cause a nearly 12 decrease in estimated e and a 10 increase in b could cause a 14 increase in estimated e fig 5c this indicates that a small perturbation in b could cause a high bias in e estimation at this site for the wettest site hbw with the highest b a 50 decrease in b causes only a 1 5 decrease in the estimated e and a 50 increase in b causes a 1 6 increase in estimated e fig 5d these results indicate that estimated e is sensitive to parameter b especially in low soil moisture areas in other words high biases in the e estimation occur in regions with low surface swcs which is true for most parts of the tp thus the adequate determination of b is vital to the estimation of evaporation in this region and similar arid areas universal b for the whole tp results in a risk of high uncertainties in e estimation it is necessary to determine b with accessible surface information to reduce the uncertainties and improve the accuracy of e estimation in this study the mean annual swc which is a key index of the land surface property shows great potential for this purpose the advantage is that the mean annual swc is stable and easily available with the help of new techniques e g remote sensing compared with other indexes such as ppt and the aridity index the swc can better reflect the surface wetness condition and water usability ma et al 2015b evaluated the sensitivity of the sigmoid equation to m and n eq 1 in a grassland on the tp the swc is approximately 10 at this site the results show that var e is equally sensitive to m and n when m and n decrease by 50 var e increases by approximately 23 and decreases by approximately 26 respectively which is close to our result at moderate sites such as ali both m and n can be expressed as equations of b eq 3 thus the sensitivity analysis for b is more intrinsic and straightforward compared with ma et al 2015b our results have a wide moisture condition range 3 45 thus the variation of the sensitivities at these sites with different soil moisture conditions can be analyzed accounting for limiting dry conditions brutsaert 2015 used adjustable parameter c in the polynomial equation to reflect the surface aridity although he suggested that c should be introduced in unusual situations only later brutsaert et al 2020 used the site specific parameter α c with c 0 for global e estimation and found that α c can be predicted by the mean annual aridity index zhou et al 2021 analyzed the polynomial function at the annual scale and found that α c is highly correlated with precipitation and the aridity index li et al 2021 further found that α c is determined not only by the aridity index but also by the ndvi crago et al 2016 proposed the rescaling complementary approach with a self adjusting independent variable y x x x min 1 x min which is an enormous contribution to express the complementary approach in calibration free form ma and szilagyi 2019 pointed out that the rescaling term for x can be considered an index of aridity compared with this method it is more direct to link the wetness condition with b in this study liu et al 2020 suggested that the complementary approach proposed by crago et al 2016 is intrinsically a linear asymmetric complementary equation with parameter b as a variable b 1 x min x min and x min varies at an individual site thus y x actually represents a cluster of curves in essence brutsaert et al 2020 and crago et al 2016 also considered the limiting conditions however by other means which are different from ours 4 conclusions in this study the sgc equation was used to simulate the actual evaporation with observations from 10 grasslands across the tp the determination of the land surface parameter b was investigated with the expectation of predicting this key parameter the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the parameter b ranges from 0 48 to 2 56 with a mean value of 1 52 0 65 in the grasslands of the tp there is a significant linear relationship p value 0 01 r2 0 97 between b and the surface swc and this relationship can be used to predict b and therefore evaporation on the tp in future studies the high correlation indicates that b represents the land surface moisture property and this parameter could be the key point to combine the advantages of the complementary approach and the budyko or penman type methods which emphasize the usability of surface information in e estimation a deep comprehension of b and land surface water supply capacity will be the development direction of the generalized complementary approach in the future 2 the sgc equation in conjunction with the estimated b value exhibits a high efficiency of evaporation calculation on the tp with high nse 0 88 and low bias in both diagnostic mae 8 84 w m 2 and prognostic mae 8 88 w m 2 models these results are consistent with those of previous studies ma et al 2015b zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2020b which suggests that the complementary relationship is substantial on the tp 3 the estimated e value is sensitive to parameter b and a small perturbation in b can cause a high bias in the e estimation especially in low soil moisture areas further efforts should be made to determine b with high accuracy on the tp where most areas suffer from cold and dry conditions in this study we focus mainly on grasslands which occupy two thirds of the total area of the tp the grasslands including the alpine meadow alpine steppe and temperate steppe show higher variations in physiological properties than the other land cover types e g water body it is necessary to provide an elaborate analysis considering the differences within this ecosystem type in addition it is acknowledged that b differs in different ecosystem types thus more analysis for other ecosystem types such as wetlands and forests also needs to be done before providing an accurate regional e estimation over the whole tp credit authorship contribution statement liming wang visualization investigation software writing original draft fuqiang tian

3706,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom plays a vital role in the biogeochemical cycles of elements in aquatic ecosystems seasonal dynamics of cdom of the lake are sensitive indicators of the biogeochemical processes and water quality which are critical to the water security of the lake thus a field investigation of the cdom and dissolved organic carbon doc properties was conducted during four hydrological seasons in 2016 to track the temporal variability of cdom and doc properties and to explore the influence of rivers and wetlands on the quantity and quality of cdom in poyang lake the results showed that the alternations of flood and dry periods have a different influence on the quantity and quality of cdom and doc in the main lake and the river mouths districts doc and aromaticity in the main lake district were more influenced by seasonal variations while cdom concentrations and molecular weight in the river mouths were more affected cdom fluorescent components in both these districts varied obviously across the hydrological seasons more terrestrial humic like substances with higher aromaticity and lower doc in the rising and flood season than in the dry and retreating season the contributing rate of cdom and its terrestrial humic like substances from input rivers to the lake in the rising season can account for more than 50 which was more than that in the flood season flooding causes wetlands to contribute a higher abundance of cdom and doc with lower aromaticity to the lake contrary to the cdom features in the flood season highlighting the important role of wetlands in the organic carbon pool the doc can be modeled using cdom fluorescent and optical parameters by the support vector regression svr method which provides a tool for doc dynamic monitoring and water quality management keywords chromophoric dissolved organic matter dissolved organic carbon poyang lake hydrological seasons support vector regression parallel factor analysis 1 introduction chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is the optically active fraction of the bulk dissolved organic matter dom pool that affects the ecological functions and biogeochemical cycles of freshwater ecosystems the optical absorption and fluorescence properties of cdom enable its utilization as a fast and convenient spectral tool for tracing the transfer transformation behavior of dom in aquatic ecosystems mariot et al 2007 stedmon et al 2003 zhou et al 2017b zhang et al 2021 cdom affects carbon cycling through its transformation photo degradation or biodegradation moreover it affects the global climate by influencing the ultimate atmospheric mineralization of organic carbon into co2 or ch4 del vecchio et al 2009 fasching et al 2014 lapierre et al 2013 remington et al 2011 tranvik et al 2009 wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 previous studies have reported that cdom is strongly related to dissolved organic carbon doc in inland waters ward et al 2017 given that doc measurements are critical for estimating carbon budgets the rapid measurement of the spectral characteristics of cdom and investigations of the relationship between cdom and doc are topics at the forefront of research frontiers many previous results have shown that cdom can be used as an effective and rapid proxy for doc measurement in various aquatic environments asmala et al 2012 kowalczuk et al 2010 zhao and song 2018 this understanding is important since cdom can affect the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants hur and cho 2012 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011b zhang et al 2021 the dynamics of cdom can also help us understand the water quality in the context of climate change as a bridge linking the carbon cycling and the environmental fate of nutrients heavy metals and pollutants ying et al 2017 zhao and song 2018 thus tracing and understanding the complex characteristics of cdom and its environmental and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems is crucial the absorption coefficients of cdom at the wavelengths of 254 280 355 and 350 nm can be used to estimate the cdom contents of inland water xu et al 2017 yao et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2017a the molecular weights of cdom can be estimated based on the ratio of the cdom absorption coefficients obtained at 250 nm to 365 nm and the aromaticity can be reflected by the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm spencer et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 a portion of the cdom is also able to emit fluorescence and thus it has also been known as fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom kalle 1949 in recent years parallel factor analysis parafac has become widely used for three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem analysis liu et al 2017a yao et al 2011 zhou et al 2017a the fluorescence technology can be utilized to track dynamic changes in the characteristics of cdom although these optical methods cannot match the accuracy of high resolution methods like nuclear magnetic resonance or fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry cortes francisco et al 2014 they are of easy experimental execution and employ relatively low cost analytical instruments therefore many studies have used absorption and fluorescence spectra of cdom to characterize different waters in recent years jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2017a song et al 2019 song et al 2017 ying et al 2018 poyang lake is a river connected lake and the largest freshwater lake in china and the third largest freshwater lake in the world the hydrology climate and terrain of poyang lake basin result in large variability and an extremely seasonally dynamic lake where water levels vary by about 13 m over the year li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a this unique phenomenon needs to collect enough samples from typical seasons and different districts river lake interactions are not only influenced by the regulation of the three gorges dam tgd but also by the result of a complex interaction among a series of alterations under the influence of climate changes and human activities in the poyang lake basin thus it s crucial to explore the seasonal dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in poyang lake only by studying the temporal and spatial changes can we understand its relationship with the poyang lake and river yao et al 2015 reported the variations and the relative abundance of parafac components in poyang lake in only two seasons flood season and retreating season which is not enough to show the entire change process of cdom additionally observations of the geographical distribution of cdom during the hydrological seasons especially in the flood season were lacking some recent studies of poyang lake have found that the cdom absorption coefficient was related to doc in certain districts of poyang lake during the wet season xu et al 2017 and the extremely dry season liu et al 2017b however the relationship was limited to a single season and the relationship was seriously affected by the suspended matter in the lake during the wet season xu et al 2017 which caused regional limitations an effective method to establish the complex relationship between cdom and doc during the entire year remains elusive machine learning ml techniques can provide an insight into the complex relationship between environmental factors and target objects hu et al 2020 lehikoinen et al 2019 in this context the doc concentrations were predicted in poyang lake by using the support vector regression svr method for a full year here we use ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and 3deem spectroscopy to quantify the absorption and fluorescence characteristics of cdom and to clarify the spatial variations of cdom including fdom and doc based on a total of 120 sites in poyang lake during the four seasons of 2016 to solve the complex relationship between cdom and doc under the condition of high water level fluctuations we used svr modeling to predict doc concentrations based on cdom parameters overall the goals of this study are 1 to characterize the cdom and doc changing over the hydrological seasons 2 to explore the influence of rivers and wetlands on the quantity and quality of cdom 3 to use the svr model to predict doc concentration based on cdom parameters for a full year in poyang lake 2 data and methods 2 1 lake description and hydrological data poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is located in the floodplain of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river it receives the majority of water inflow from five rivers namely the gan river fu river xiu river xin river and rao river and exchanges water with the yangtze river through the northern lake mouth during the flood season the yangtze river supplies water to the lake through its northern outlet the total area of poyang lake basin is 16 2 104 km2 which accounts for 9 of the yangtze river basin and 93 9 of the land area of jiangxi province li et al 2019 the lake surface can expand to more than 3000 km2 during the flood season and then diminish to less than 1000 km2 during the dry season yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a which creates abundant wetlands for plants as the water level rises the wetland plants were immersed in high turbidity waters and drowned the hydrological rhythm of poyang lake was divided into four phases in this study the dry season from december to february the rising season from march to may the flood season from june to august and the retreating season from september to november hu et al 2007 dai et al 2015 the mean annual water temperature in the lake was about 20 c and the highest temperature in summer can reach 35 c hu and zhou 2014 the mean conductivity was 127 μscm 1 yuan et al 2018 ca2 and hco3 were the dominant cation and anion in the lake waters hu and zhou 2014 the mean tn and tp concentrations in 2016 ranged from 0 48 to 4 13 mgl 1 and from 0 011 to 0 612 mgl 1 respectively liu et al 2018 xingzi station is located in the northern region of the lake which is simultaneously influenced by both the yangtze river and poyang lake dynamics and was usually used to represent the overall variation of water level in poyang lake dai et al 2015 fang et al 2012 fig 1 shows the variations in daily water levels at the xingzi station and the water discharge of the five rivers in 2016 along with the mean monthly water level at the xingzi station in 2016 the samples collected at mid month during january april july and october 2016 gray columns in fig 1 can represent the dry season rising flood and retreating seasons very well the height of the gray columns in fig 1a and b represents the mean monthly water level at xingzi station and the inflow of the five major input rivers respectively water samples were chosen in april and july in 2016 which should ideally represent the rising season and the flood season it is worth noting that the water levels at xingzi station exceeded the warming water level 19 m for 29 days in july 2016 and the highest water level peak appeared on 11th july 2 2 sample collection to investigate the temporal variability of cdom properties in poyang lake samples were collected during the four hydrological seasons fig 2 a total of 120 water samples were collected in poyang lake and the locations of sites were recorded by global positioning system as shown in fig 2 these were sampled in collaboration with the poyang lake laboratory for wetland ecosystem research of the chinese academy of sciences considering that the area of poyang lake during the flood season can reach two to ten times larger than that in other seasons in fact the lake area exceeded 4000 km2 in july 2016 li and cao 2018 most of the samples were collected during the flood season since a larger geographical area was available to sample in total 15 samples sites 1 15 were collected in the dry rising and retreating season respectively and 75 water samples were collected in the flood season of which 15 samples sites 1 15 came from the same sampling sites as other seasons fig 2 within this sample set 8 samples in the dry rising and retreating season and 13 samples in the flood season were collected from the five main river mouths and others were from the interior of the lake surface water samples were acquired from the lake and river mouths at the depth of approximately 0 5 m water samples were kept on ice and stored in the dark while in the field and transported to the laboratory on the same day the samples were then filtered immediately for use in other measurements during the flood season it took about nine days to collect 75 water samples from 6th july to 14th july in 2016 during the other seasons it only took about one or two days to collect 15 samples during the mid month of january april and october 2016 2 3 dissolved organic carbon absorbance and fluorescence measurements water samples for doc measurements were filtered using millipore filters 0 22 μm after using whatman gf f filters 0 7 μm doc was analyzed via high temperature catalytic oxidation methods with a total organic carbon analyzer model 1020 oi analytical usa to determine the cdom absorption coefficients and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems water samples were first filtered through pre combusted 47 mm diameter whatman gf f filter membranes 0 7 μm porosity and then passed through 0 22 μm pore size cellulose membranes millipore cdom absorption spectra were obtained over a wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals by using a unico uv 4802 spectrophotometer the absorbance spectra obtained at each wavelength were baseline calibrated by subtracting the absorbance spectra obtained at 700 nm napierian absorption coefficients were obtained using the following equation a λ 2 303 a λ r where a λ a λ and r are cdom absorption coefficients at the wavelength λ corrected optical density at the wavelength λ and the path length of the quartz cell in meters 0 05 m respectively in this study we used the absorption coefficients obtained at 254 nm a 254 to represent cdom concentration cdom molecular size m value was estimated based on the ratio of cdom absorption coefficients at 250 nm to 365 nm lower m values indicate higher molecular weight spencer et al 2009 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 was obtained by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration and was reported in the units of litter per milligram carbon per meter this value is a reliable tracer of the aromaticity of doc in waters spencer et al 2015 zhou et al 2017b higher suva 254 values indicated higher aromaticity in cdom the fluorescent portion of dom fdom was characterized using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan with the excitation ex and emission em scanning ranging from 200 nm to 450 nm 5 nm intervals and from 250 nm to 600 nm 1 nm interval eem spectra were corrected for raman effects and rayleigh scattering following the methods recommended in the dom fluor toolbox murphy et al 2013 the inner filter effects were calibrated following the methods reported by zhou et al 2016 and zhou et al 2017b using the following equation f fb 10 aex aem 2 where f and fb represent the fluorescence intensity before and after calibration respectively and aex and aem stand for the absorbance at corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths respectively all eems were finally normalized to the water raman signal at the excitation wavelength of 350 nm of a milli q water sample murphy et al 2010 2 4 parafac modeling out of 120 total samples three outliers were checked during parafac modeling and were removed for better fitting in which two samples were in the lake during the retreating season and one sample during the flood season thus 117 samples were modeled using the parafac modeling in dom fluor toolbox stedmon and markager 2005a stedmon et al 2003 using the matlab 2010a software all corrected eem data were processed by deleting excitation wavelengths from 200 nm to 240 nm and emission wavelengths from 250 nm to 299 nm and from 550 nm to 600 nm this helps to eliminate unreliable instrument measurements next all eems were split into a calibration half and a validation half and were run stepwise from three to six components using both halves split half analysis and visual inspection were applied to determine the correct numbers of components the split half validation results were shown in fig 1s since good agreement among the spectral loadings of excitation and emission which estimated from two random halves of the data set split 1 red lines split 2 blue lines and the complete data set black lines were found only in 3 components therefore we selected 3 components as the best model fit fluorescence intensities of all components were represented the fmax value stedmon and markager 2005b the fmax value of each parafac component is proportional to the intensities of a corresponding fluorescent fraction borisover et al 2009 therefore the relative abundance of fluorescence components was calculated by the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the component to the total fluorescence intensities 2 5 svr svr as one of the machine learning methods was used to model doc concentrations in poyang lake the method was implemented using the python programming language the radial basis function rbf was used in this study for analysis ten fold cross validation was performed to evaluate the performance of svr models this process splits the dataset into ten folds of training and testing sets inconsistent with parafac modeling 117 samples were input into the svr model due to there being one missing value in the data and the svr model is not allowed to have vacant values thus we deleted the corresponding values at the same rank and 116 samples were trained in the model a training set of 75 samples was used to train the model while a testing set of 41 samples was to test the model the prediction accuracy of the svr model was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean relative error mre of the linear regression fit between the predicted and measured doc these metrics are calculated as follows r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where yi is the observed value y i is the predicted value and y i is the mean value of the observed values 2 6 statistical analysis a parametric one way analysis of variance anova coupled with a multiple comparison post hoc test was used to test for significant differences among seasons and an independent sample t test was applied to test for significant differences between the river mouths samples and the main lake samples for all statistical analyses a p value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant a paired sample t test was used to compare the differences between the same sampling sites sites 1 15 over four seasons principal component analysis pca was conducted using cdom parameters including suva 254 a 254 m values and the fluorescence intensities of the parafac components for all the samples all input data before pca analysis were standardized by ln x 1 two principal components eigenvalue greater than 1 were extracted that together explain approximately 79 9 of the total variance the samples were further labeled by different seasons and locations i e river mouths and the main lake all these statistical analyses were performed by spss 19 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 parafac components of fdom three parafac components identified in this study fig 1s were all successfully cross referenced to the openfluor database using a criterion of 95 similarity to indicate a match murphy et al 2014 component c1 with ex em maxima at 245 391 nm shared spectral properties common to microbial humic like substances osburn et al 2018 zhang et al 2011b zhou et al 2017b c2 showed spectral characteristics typical of terrestrial humic like compounds coble 1996 galletti et al 2019 stedmon and markager 2005b c3 ex em maxima 275 304 nm exhibited fluorescence that is often attributed to protein like substances which is associated with compounds containing amino acids goncalves araujo et al 2016 osburn et al 2018 it was reported as the tyrosine like component in rainwater yang et al 2019 but was also suggested to represent tryptophan like dom in groundwater podgorski et al 2018 therefore we considered it to be a mixture of protein like substances such as tryptophan like and tyrosine like substances the proportions of c1 c2 and c3 in the total fluorescence intensities in the lake were 41 4 31 6 and 26 9 respectively 3 2 seasonal change of cdom parameters and doc 3 2 1 seasonal change of optical parameters of cdom and doc after pooling all 96 samples in the main lake for the full year and using a rapid classification of the trophic state based on a 254 values zhang et al 2017b sample sites at the mesotrophic level 4 a 254 10 accounted for 59 4 and those in the light eutrophic level 10 a 254 15 accounted for 37 5 no samples with hyper eutrophication a 254 23 were found in this study the remainder three sites were estimated as a moderate eutrophication state 15 a 254 23 which all occurred in the flood season these results demonstrate that the lake was typically between mesotrophic and light eutrophic levels the seasonal variations of cdom in the main lake and river mouths are shown in fig 3 for cdom concentrations represented by a 254 there was no significant seasonal variation in the main lake however significantly lower cdom concentrations from river mouth samples in the dry season than those in other seasons p 0 01 no significant differences were observed between the rising and the flood seasons from river mouths samples whereas a significant increase of a 254 values at the same sites from site 9 to 15 in the lake from the rising season to the flood season was found in fig 4 p 0 05 doc concentrations from the main lake samples in rainy seasons the rising season and the flood season were significantly lower than the non rainy seasons the dry season and the retreating season p 0 01 however no significant difference of river mouths samples was found among the seasons when the cdom from the river mouths samples showed the property of significantly higher molecular weight reflected by lower m values in the flood season cdom in the main lake in the flood season is likely unaffected by the input of large amounts of cdom with high molecular weight this indicates that there is a complex seasonal relationship between the main input rivers and the main lake we further explore the seasonal variations of cdom and the relationship between the river mouths and the main lake water by analyzing the values at the same 15 sampling sites 1 15 in fig 2 as shown in fig 4 cdom concentrations higher than 10 m 1 in the dry season were discovered only in the southern part of the main lake district while in the retreating season the values in the main lake showed very low variations cv 8 7 during the rising and the flood season high cdom concentrations mainly appeared at the river mouths and the mean cdom concentration from river mouths was relatively higher than that from the main lake district fig 5 higher values of a 254 were also found in the southern lake in the flood and the rising season and there was an obvious decreasing tendency from the southern part to the northern part in the flood season except at the river lake connecting site hukou station location 15 in fig 4 indicating that significant cdom input from the five main input rivers contributed to the lake in the rising season and the flood season and drives the distribution of cdom in the lake to elucidate the relative contribution of cdom from the five main input rivers to poyang lake during the rising season and the flood season we calculate the water area of poyang lake during these two seasons derived from the monthly mean water level at xingzi station xiong et al 2016 and a volume of 8 39 km3 during the rising season and of 9 45 km3 during the flood season can be obtained by multiplying by the mean depth of 2 7 m of poyang lake ye 2014 next the standing stock of cdom in the lake can be obtained by multiplying the mean a 254 value of 8 9 m 1 in april and 9 9 m 1 in july by the corresponding water volumes likewise the mean fluxes of cdom from five input rivers during the rising season and the flood season were 41 0 109 m2 month and 30 7 109 m2 month respectively which was based on multiplying the mean a 254 values from the rivers in april and july by the corresponding mean inflow the contribution of cdom from the input rivers during the rising season and the flood season can account for 56 6 and 34 1 respectively this underlined the relative contribution of the input rivers during the rising season is more important than that during the flood season similar seasonal changes for suva 254 were observed in the lake and the river mouths as the water level rises from the dry season to the flood season the aromaticity of cdom increased and significantly higher aromaticity was observed in the flood season than in the dry season for both lake samples and river mouths samples p 0 01 the samples at the same sites exhibited the same tendency fig 4 which suggests that the aromaticity of cdom in water is seriously affected by seasonal variations overall doc and aromaticity in the main lake were more influenced by seasonal variations while cdom concentrations and molecular weight in the river mouths were more affected 3 2 2 seasonal change of fdom components high proportions of humic like substances c1 c2 with 76 6 and 72 4 of the total intensities were found during the flood and the rising season respectively followed by the retreating season 65 1 and the dry season 60 8 however c3 showed the opposite tendency this indicates that the relative abundance of fluorescence components are affected by seasonal variations the wet season is enriched with humic like fluorescence while the dry season contains a higher protein like fluorescence this result is in good agreement with reports about dom in drinking water reservoirs in china maqbool et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the c2 c3 ratio in the dry season and the retreating season was significantly lower than that observed in the rising season and flood season p 0 01 furthermore c2 contents from the river mouth samples in the rising season were significantly higher than those in the dry season paired samples t test p 0 01 and c2 values in the river mouths sites 1 8 in the rising season were significantly higher than those in the lake sites 9 15 p 0 05 fig 5 indicating that large amounts of terrestrial matter from the five main rivers are transported into the lake during the rising season this was probably due to the fact that the main type of land use in the poyang basin is woodland previous research found that dom in the soils and the rivers in the forest watersheds are dominated by humic like substances kothawala et al 2015 ma and li 2020 yang et al 2012 additionally due to rapid economic growth southwest china has become the third largest heavy acid rain region in the world most acid rains are sulfuric acid rains with a high sulfate content the frequency of acid rain in jiangxi province can reach more than 80 xie et al 2012 generally most rainfall is concentrated in the rising season and flood season in the poyang lake catchment zhang et al 2011a and large amounts of acid rain may cause dom containing lots of humic substances to be lost from red soil in the basin liu et al 2009 rodhe et al 2002 the input of such terrestrially humic like substances from the catchment into poyang lake can result in higher c2 content and a higher proportion of c2 components of fdom in the lake during the period of rising water level combined with the above calculated data including the standing stock of cdom in poyang lake and the flow flux of input rivers the input of c2 from the major input rivers during the rising season and the flood season can account for roughly 59 and 30 7 respectively it is worth noting that significantly higher c2 intensities in the flood season than the rising season were found in the main lake p 0 05 but no significant difference of c2 between the rising season and flood season was found in the river mouth samples this indicated that other sources contributed to the terrestrial humic like matter besides the five main input rivers as shown by the gray pattern in fig 1 the runoff of the five input rivers during the flood season is low while the water level of the lake is high indicating that there was a backflow of water from the yangtze river to the lake which was in accordance with previous findings li et al 2017 additionally high cdom with relatively high aromaticity and high molecular weight characteristics and high fdom concentrations in the flood season were observed at hukou station sampling site 15 in fig 4 which is located at the junction of poyang lake and the yangtze river during the transport process of cdom along the yangtze river lots of refractory organic matter would accumulate in the river gan et al 2013 which can lead to higher cdom concentrations near hukou with the characteristics of higher molecular weight and aromaticity 3 3 geographical comparison of cdom parameters and doc in the flood season fig 6 a g shows the distribution for all the samples in the flood season the cvs of doc and cdom parameters including a 254 suva 254 m values and fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 in the main lake were 21 6 23 5 28 9 17 7 19 5 17 2 and 41 5 respectively which suggest low variability high values of a 254 fig 6a and doc fig 6b were mainly distributed in both the southern and middle regions of the lake the mean value of suva 254 was 2 79 units of l mg 1 m 1 and the maximum value 7 52 was found at the river mouth of the xin river and the minimum value 1 01 was found in the middle branch of the ganjiang river flowing through the nanjishan nature reserve c1 which represents microbially transformed products from terrestrial derived components showed the highest intensities in comparison with the other two components c2 and c3 in the flood season high c3 fig 6g was mainly distributed along the lakeshore near the urban zones such as duchang city indicating that the distribution of c3 was mainly affected by human activity notably high doc and cdom contents with relatively low molecular weight reflected by m values and low aromaticity represented by suva 254 values were found in the immersed nanaji wetland national nature reserve in the flood season this was partly consistent with the field observation that higher doc with relatively higher proportions of super low molecular weight was in the wetlands than the lakes wang et al 2016 further suggests that wetlands can contribute a large input to the organic carbon pool of the lake the reason for this might be that lots of wetland plants were drowned in high turbidity water as a result of rising water levels and subsequently died which released large amounts of fresh organic matter yza et al 2021 additionally the drowned sediment can also release a lot of dissolved organic matter yang et al 2014 thus in accordance with chen s result chen et al 2013 dom compositional features were controlled by soil and wetland plants during dry versus wet seasons which suggested that wetlands as organic carbon storage can affect the quantity and quality of cdom in the poyang lake and further influences the lake carbon cycle 3 4 pca results of cdom parameters a principal component analysis pca was conducted to investigate the quality differences in cdom samples collected during the dry rising flood and retreating seasons and also to explore the influence of river discharge input on cdom in the lake for all water samples the first and second axes of the pca factors 1 and 2 accounted for 46 7 and 33 2 of the total variance respectively the pca score plot showed that cdom abundance especially the humic like components c1 and c2 was positive along with the pca factor 1 axis the m values displayed positive factor 2 loadings and suva 254 showed negative factor 2 loadings fig 7 a implying that pca factor 2 was probably associated with the quality of cdom specifically lower molecular weight and aromaticity of cdom were positive along with the pca factor 2 axis the mean factor 2 score in the dry season was significantly higher than in the rising and the retreating season and the mean factor 1 score for the samples was lower than the rising and flood season p 0 05 further indicating that cdom samples with a low proportion of humic like substances during the dry season present low aromaticity and molecular weight a higher mean factor 1 score was observed for samples collected during the rising season than the dry season p 0 05 fig 7b and a weak higher mean factor 1 score was seen for samples collected from the river mouths during the rising season than those from the main lake p 0 053 fig 7c further substantiating the fact that vast amounts of cdom especially terrestrial humic like matters were discharged into the lake from the main rivers during the rising season a significantly lower mean factor 2 score for samples during the flood season was found by comparing with the adjacent seasons p 0 05 fig 7b this supports the fact that cdom in the flood season presents characteristics of high aromaticity a lower mean factor 2 score for samples collected from the river mouths than those collected from the main lake was observed p 0 01 fig 7d which further highlights that the significant difference between the cdom from input rivers and the main lake during the flood season 3 5 doc prediction using the svr model doc measurements are crucial for estimating carbon budgets but are restricted to measurements of discrete samples and are limited to providing synoptic coverage on relatively small spatial scales fichot and benner 2011 using the measurement of the spectral characteristics of dom absorption and fluorescence with proper instrumentation to estimate doc concentrations therefore represents a compelling alternative many previous results have shown that cdom can be used as a proxy for doc measurement in certain waters asmala et al 2012 avagyan et al 2014 fichot and benner 2011 kowalczuk et al 2010 rochelle newall et al 2014 xu et al 2017 zhao and song 2018 however the relationship between cdom and doc is highly variable across various environments binding et al 2008 griffin et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 miller 2012 and even changed across the same aquatic system such as the three gorges reservoir area jiang et al 2018 poyang lake as the largest freshwater lake and the river connecting lake in china is influenced by climate changes and human activities liu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 which make the lake shows the unique phenomenon lake like with high water level and river like with low water level the large water area and high water level fluctuations in the lake caused the doc and cdom to vary across the seasons and locations as shown in figs 3 4 and 6 and the relationship between the doc and cdom can be more complex which make it hard to estimate doc using cdom parameters during the entire year simple linear regression is therefore no longer a suitable method to overcome this difficulty machine learning methods can be used which are suitable to handle this kind of problem and have been increasingly adopted for exploring complex relationships between a set of predictor variables and a response variable svr has been widely applied for chlorophyll a estimation camps valls et al 2006 he et al 2020 however few studies were carried out for doc prediction by machine learning such as svr based on cdom parameters in water especially in lakes with such extreme high water level fluctuations in this study we pick cdom parameters including cdom fluorescent and optical parameters for predicting doc concentration based on the r2 rmse and mre metrics table 1s since the input indicators have different measurement units the input variables z scores were calculated before svr modeling by comparison with these metrics the relative fluorescence abundance of c1 c2 c3 represented by c1 t c2 t and c3 t in the table 1s respectively values of c1 c2 ratio a 254 m and suva 254 values can be taken as good predictor variables to estimate doc concentration this also indicated that doc matter is strongly related to the quantity and quality of cdom an optimal model fit p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 79 was achieved between predicted and measured doc concentration for the full year in poyang lake fig 8 3 6 effects of river lake interactions on cdom characteristics as one of the only two large lakes another one is the dongting lake connected to the yangtze river changes in the level of the yangtze river caused by the three gorges dam tgd have an impact on the hydrological processes and water cycle in poyang lake as indicated by the seasonal variations of cdom and doc characteristics of the main lake interactions between poyang lake and rivers vary seasonally figs 3 4 and 5 a sharp increase of a 254 values and suva 254 at the hukou site site 15 in figs 2 and 4 of the flood season was found while there is no significant change at the same site in the other three hydrological seasons similarly hydrodynamic modeling statistical analysis and stable isotopes reported respectively that backflow events disturb the normal northward water flow direction in the poyang lake both the frequency and magnitude significantly since tgd began to operate li et al 2017 wu et al 2020 there is a short term backflow of the yangtze river water that transports southward into poyang lake during our sampling period of flood season however cdom and doc characteristics are not only influenced by the regulation of the tgd but also by the influence of climate changes and human activities in the poyang lake basin zhang et al 2015 the mean cdom concentration cdom fluorescent intensities and doc from river mouths in the rising season were relatively higher than those from the main lake district fig 5 these input rivers can contribute more than 50 of the total cdom and terrestrial humic like substances to the lake in the rising season hence future research should focus on the complex interactions between the poyang lake and yangtze river but also the poyang lake basin even the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river catchment to better understand the transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the yangtze river and poyang lake 3 7 environmental implications cdom is an important optically active substance in aquatic environments and plays a key role in nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles which also has significant impacts on environmental pollutants migration toxicity and bioavailability mantoura et al 1978 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the change of intrinsic characteristics in cdom such as aromaticity and molecular weight may also affect the environmental behavior of nutrients and pollutants the previous researches showed that cdom at 254 nm a 254 increased significantly with the trophic status of lakes and reservoirs shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a and they further provided a rapid method of estimating the trophic level in the reservoirs by using a humic index of cdom shang et al 2019 for poyang lake yao et al 2015 indicated fdom can be a proxy for capturing rapid changes in water quality and our previous work further demonstrated that humic like substances as the dominant fraction of fdom in the lake are strongly and positively related to the nitrogen concentrations liu et al 2018 thus cdom content and humic like substances in fdom increased with the rising water level in poyang lake and more than 50 of terrestrial humic like substances flowed into the lake from the main input rivers during the rising seasons which would lead to an enhanced risk of lake eutrophication due to accumulation of terrestrial dom zhou et al 2018 it was even worse in the extreme floods which would induce the occurs of cyanobacterial blooms due to lots of nutrients input from watersheds qin 2020 china s lakes have serious environmental problems huang et al 2019 and poyang lake is suffering from persistent eutrophication tracing the properties of cdom could be used as a fundamental resource for other ongoing studies on water quality including those studying pollutants and nutrients in shallow yangtze river connecting lakes additionally the yangtze river is a source of drinking water for many downstream cities the most common situation of water exchange between the poyang lake and the yangtze river was the flow from the lake to the river an average of 1 436 108 m3 of water flows from poyang lake into the yangtze river each year which makes up 9 7 to 29 0 of the downstream flow of the yangtze river and accounts for 15 5 of the yangtze river annual runoff lai et al 2017 this necessitates better monitoring of cdom characteristics near the outflow to ensure safe drinking water resources the previous study has reported that lakes can be also regulators of carbon cycling and global climate tranvik et al 2009 poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china therefore has a critical role in the global carbon cycle in contrast to semi closed or closed lakes poyang lake exhibits string seasonal and hydrological variations due to its natural input and output connections with rivers and the regulation of its water regime is dictated by the yangtze river and its five main input rivers yao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a this unique characteristic makes it worthy of study on the role of this type of lake within active organic matters in the carbon cycle interestingly although significantly high aromaticity in cdom and low doc is found in poyang lake during the flood season as compared to other seasons cdom with low aromaticity and molecular weight and high doc concentrations were still found in wetlands this part of fresh cdom and doc entering the water body not only influences the distribution of cdom in the lake but also may be actively involved in the microbial and photo degradation processes in the lake and can further impact carbon cycling in the water it may help explain to some extent the phenomenon of why the maximum mean flux of greenhouse gases on the water air interface of poyang lake is found in summer lin 2012 and may give another important approach to research the influence of wetlands on global carbon cycling importantly ml techniques are effective tools that can handle complexities in different aquatic ecosystems hu et al 2020 lehikoinen et al 2019 that is why in the present study the svr technique can be applied in doc concentration retrieval moreover if long term continuous in situ cdom observations by using field instruments are available the svr technique might perform even better than it did in the present study which would facilitate further research of carbon cycling dynamics 4 conclusion a seasonal investigation of cdom from 120 samples in china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake was characterized by absorbance and fluorescence measurements with a parafac analysis and doc estimation by cdom parameters was conducted using ml modeling our study showed that hydrological seasons in the river connected lake can affect the properties of cdom and doc lower doc and a higher proportion of humic like fluorescence matters in fdom were found during the rainy seasons the rising and the flood season than non rainy seasons the dry season and the retreating season 56 6 of cdom abundance and 59 of terrestrial humic like matter came from the five main input rivers during the rising season which can affect the distribution of cdom from the southern region to the northern part of the lake although the cdom samples from the flood season were characterized by high aromaticity and low doc cdom with low aromaticity and high doc concentration was found in the wetlands the contribution of wetlands can affect the characteristics and spatial distribution of cdom in waters and can also further improve our understanding of the important role of wetlands in the poyang lake watershed our methods may also be extended to similar waters with high water level fluctuations additionally our study has demonstrated that ml represents a robust approach to predict doc concentrations effectively based on cdom parameters which can overcome the prediction difficulties inherent in a large lake system with strong spatial and seasonal variations this allows the benefit of being able to capture organic carbon information quickly and to improve our understanding of the cycling dynamics of carbon or other related matters i e nutrients and pollutants in these kinds of river connecting freshwater lakes credit authorship contribution

3706,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom plays a vital role in the biogeochemical cycles of elements in aquatic ecosystems seasonal dynamics of cdom of the lake are sensitive indicators of the biogeochemical processes and water quality which are critical to the water security of the lake thus a field investigation of the cdom and dissolved organic carbon doc properties was conducted during four hydrological seasons in 2016 to track the temporal variability of cdom and doc properties and to explore the influence of rivers and wetlands on the quantity and quality of cdom in poyang lake the results showed that the alternations of flood and dry periods have a different influence on the quantity and quality of cdom and doc in the main lake and the river mouths districts doc and aromaticity in the main lake district were more influenced by seasonal variations while cdom concentrations and molecular weight in the river mouths were more affected cdom fluorescent components in both these districts varied obviously across the hydrological seasons more terrestrial humic like substances with higher aromaticity and lower doc in the rising and flood season than in the dry and retreating season the contributing rate of cdom and its terrestrial humic like substances from input rivers to the lake in the rising season can account for more than 50 which was more than that in the flood season flooding causes wetlands to contribute a higher abundance of cdom and doc with lower aromaticity to the lake contrary to the cdom features in the flood season highlighting the important role of wetlands in the organic carbon pool the doc can be modeled using cdom fluorescent and optical parameters by the support vector regression svr method which provides a tool for doc dynamic monitoring and water quality management keywords chromophoric dissolved organic matter dissolved organic carbon poyang lake hydrological seasons support vector regression parallel factor analysis 1 introduction chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is the optically active fraction of the bulk dissolved organic matter dom pool that affects the ecological functions and biogeochemical cycles of freshwater ecosystems the optical absorption and fluorescence properties of cdom enable its utilization as a fast and convenient spectral tool for tracing the transfer transformation behavior of dom in aquatic ecosystems mariot et al 2007 stedmon et al 2003 zhou et al 2017b zhang et al 2021 cdom affects carbon cycling through its transformation photo degradation or biodegradation moreover it affects the global climate by influencing the ultimate atmospheric mineralization of organic carbon into co2 or ch4 del vecchio et al 2009 fasching et al 2014 lapierre et al 2013 remington et al 2011 tranvik et al 2009 wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 previous studies have reported that cdom is strongly related to dissolved organic carbon doc in inland waters ward et al 2017 given that doc measurements are critical for estimating carbon budgets the rapid measurement of the spectral characteristics of cdom and investigations of the relationship between cdom and doc are topics at the forefront of research frontiers many previous results have shown that cdom can be used as an effective and rapid proxy for doc measurement in various aquatic environments asmala et al 2012 kowalczuk et al 2010 zhao and song 2018 this understanding is important since cdom can affect the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients heavy metals and organic pollutants hur and cho 2012 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011b zhang et al 2021 the dynamics of cdom can also help us understand the water quality in the context of climate change as a bridge linking the carbon cycling and the environmental fate of nutrients heavy metals and pollutants ying et al 2017 zhao and song 2018 thus tracing and understanding the complex characteristics of cdom and its environmental and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems is crucial the absorption coefficients of cdom at the wavelengths of 254 280 355 and 350 nm can be used to estimate the cdom contents of inland water xu et al 2017 yao et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2017a the molecular weights of cdom can be estimated based on the ratio of the cdom absorption coefficients obtained at 250 nm to 365 nm and the aromaticity can be reflected by the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm spencer et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 a portion of the cdom is also able to emit fluorescence and thus it has also been known as fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom kalle 1949 in recent years parallel factor analysis parafac has become widely used for three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem analysis liu et al 2017a yao et al 2011 zhou et al 2017a the fluorescence technology can be utilized to track dynamic changes in the characteristics of cdom although these optical methods cannot match the accuracy of high resolution methods like nuclear magnetic resonance or fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry cortes francisco et al 2014 they are of easy experimental execution and employ relatively low cost analytical instruments therefore many studies have used absorption and fluorescence spectra of cdom to characterize different waters in recent years jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2017a song et al 2019 song et al 2017 ying et al 2018 poyang lake is a river connected lake and the largest freshwater lake in china and the third largest freshwater lake in the world the hydrology climate and terrain of poyang lake basin result in large variability and an extremely seasonally dynamic lake where water levels vary by about 13 m over the year li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a this unique phenomenon needs to collect enough samples from typical seasons and different districts river lake interactions are not only influenced by the regulation of the three gorges dam tgd but also by the result of a complex interaction among a series of alterations under the influence of climate changes and human activities in the poyang lake basin thus it s crucial to explore the seasonal dynamics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in poyang lake only by studying the temporal and spatial changes can we understand its relationship with the poyang lake and river yao et al 2015 reported the variations and the relative abundance of parafac components in poyang lake in only two seasons flood season and retreating season which is not enough to show the entire change process of cdom additionally observations of the geographical distribution of cdom during the hydrological seasons especially in the flood season were lacking some recent studies of poyang lake have found that the cdom absorption coefficient was related to doc in certain districts of poyang lake during the wet season xu et al 2017 and the extremely dry season liu et al 2017b however the relationship was limited to a single season and the relationship was seriously affected by the suspended matter in the lake during the wet season xu et al 2017 which caused regional limitations an effective method to establish the complex relationship between cdom and doc during the entire year remains elusive machine learning ml techniques can provide an insight into the complex relationship between environmental factors and target objects hu et al 2020 lehikoinen et al 2019 in this context the doc concentrations were predicted in poyang lake by using the support vector regression svr method for a full year here we use ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and 3deem spectroscopy to quantify the absorption and fluorescence characteristics of cdom and to clarify the spatial variations of cdom including fdom and doc based on a total of 120 sites in poyang lake during the four seasons of 2016 to solve the complex relationship between cdom and doc under the condition of high water level fluctuations we used svr modeling to predict doc concentrations based on cdom parameters overall the goals of this study are 1 to characterize the cdom and doc changing over the hydrological seasons 2 to explore the influence of rivers and wetlands on the quantity and quality of cdom 3 to use the svr model to predict doc concentration based on cdom parameters for a full year in poyang lake 2 data and methods 2 1 lake description and hydrological data poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is located in the floodplain of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river it receives the majority of water inflow from five rivers namely the gan river fu river xiu river xin river and rao river and exchanges water with the yangtze river through the northern lake mouth during the flood season the yangtze river supplies water to the lake through its northern outlet the total area of poyang lake basin is 16 2 104 km2 which accounts for 9 of the yangtze river basin and 93 9 of the land area of jiangxi province li et al 2019 the lake surface can expand to more than 3000 km2 during the flood season and then diminish to less than 1000 km2 during the dry season yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a which creates abundant wetlands for plants as the water level rises the wetland plants were immersed in high turbidity waters and drowned the hydrological rhythm of poyang lake was divided into four phases in this study the dry season from december to february the rising season from march to may the flood season from june to august and the retreating season from september to november hu et al 2007 dai et al 2015 the mean annual water temperature in the lake was about 20 c and the highest temperature in summer can reach 35 c hu and zhou 2014 the mean conductivity was 127 μscm 1 yuan et al 2018 ca2 and hco3 were the dominant cation and anion in the lake waters hu and zhou 2014 the mean tn and tp concentrations in 2016 ranged from 0 48 to 4 13 mgl 1 and from 0 011 to 0 612 mgl 1 respectively liu et al 2018 xingzi station is located in the northern region of the lake which is simultaneously influenced by both the yangtze river and poyang lake dynamics and was usually used to represent the overall variation of water level in poyang lake dai et al 2015 fang et al 2012 fig 1 shows the variations in daily water levels at the xingzi station and the water discharge of the five rivers in 2016 along with the mean monthly water level at the xingzi station in 2016 the samples collected at mid month during january april july and october 2016 gray columns in fig 1 can represent the dry season rising flood and retreating seasons very well the height of the gray columns in fig 1a and b represents the mean monthly water level at xingzi station and the inflow of the five major input rivers respectively water samples were chosen in april and july in 2016 which should ideally represent the rising season and the flood season it is worth noting that the water levels at xingzi station exceeded the warming water level 19 m for 29 days in july 2016 and the highest water level peak appeared on 11th july 2 2 sample collection to investigate the temporal variability of cdom properties in poyang lake samples were collected during the four hydrological seasons fig 2 a total of 120 water samples were collected in poyang lake and the locations of sites were recorded by global positioning system as shown in fig 2 these were sampled in collaboration with the poyang lake laboratory for wetland ecosystem research of the chinese academy of sciences considering that the area of poyang lake during the flood season can reach two to ten times larger than that in other seasons in fact the lake area exceeded 4000 km2 in july 2016 li and cao 2018 most of the samples were collected during the flood season since a larger geographical area was available to sample in total 15 samples sites 1 15 were collected in the dry rising and retreating season respectively and 75 water samples were collected in the flood season of which 15 samples sites 1 15 came from the same sampling sites as other seasons fig 2 within this sample set 8 samples in the dry rising and retreating season and 13 samples in the flood season were collected from the five main river mouths and others were from the interior of the lake surface water samples were acquired from the lake and river mouths at the depth of approximately 0 5 m water samples were kept on ice and stored in the dark while in the field and transported to the laboratory on the same day the samples were then filtered immediately for use in other measurements during the flood season it took about nine days to collect 75 water samples from 6th july to 14th july in 2016 during the other seasons it only took about one or two days to collect 15 samples during the mid month of january april and october 2016 2 3 dissolved organic carbon absorbance and fluorescence measurements water samples for doc measurements were filtered using millipore filters 0 22 μm after using whatman gf f filters 0 7 μm doc was analyzed via high temperature catalytic oxidation methods with a total organic carbon analyzer model 1020 oi analytical usa to determine the cdom absorption coefficients and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems water samples were first filtered through pre combusted 47 mm diameter whatman gf f filter membranes 0 7 μm porosity and then passed through 0 22 μm pore size cellulose membranes millipore cdom absorption spectra were obtained over a wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals by using a unico uv 4802 spectrophotometer the absorbance spectra obtained at each wavelength were baseline calibrated by subtracting the absorbance spectra obtained at 700 nm napierian absorption coefficients were obtained using the following equation a λ 2 303 a λ r where a λ a λ and r are cdom absorption coefficients at the wavelength λ corrected optical density at the wavelength λ and the path length of the quartz cell in meters 0 05 m respectively in this study we used the absorption coefficients obtained at 254 nm a 254 to represent cdom concentration cdom molecular size m value was estimated based on the ratio of cdom absorption coefficients at 250 nm to 365 nm lower m values indicate higher molecular weight spencer et al 2009 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 was obtained by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by the doc concentration and was reported in the units of litter per milligram carbon per meter this value is a reliable tracer of the aromaticity of doc in waters spencer et al 2015 zhou et al 2017b higher suva 254 values indicated higher aromaticity in cdom the fluorescent portion of dom fdom was characterized using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan with the excitation ex and emission em scanning ranging from 200 nm to 450 nm 5 nm intervals and from 250 nm to 600 nm 1 nm interval eem spectra were corrected for raman effects and rayleigh scattering following the methods recommended in the dom fluor toolbox murphy et al 2013 the inner filter effects were calibrated following the methods reported by zhou et al 2016 and zhou et al 2017b using the following equation f fb 10 aex aem 2 where f and fb represent the fluorescence intensity before and after calibration respectively and aex and aem stand for the absorbance at corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths respectively all eems were finally normalized to the water raman signal at the excitation wavelength of 350 nm of a milli q water sample murphy et al 2010 2 4 parafac modeling out of 120 total samples three outliers were checked during parafac modeling and were removed for better fitting in which two samples were in the lake during the retreating season and one sample during the flood season thus 117 samples were modeled using the parafac modeling in dom fluor toolbox stedmon and markager 2005a stedmon et al 2003 using the matlab 2010a software all corrected eem data were processed by deleting excitation wavelengths from 200 nm to 240 nm and emission wavelengths from 250 nm to 299 nm and from 550 nm to 600 nm this helps to eliminate unreliable instrument measurements next all eems were split into a calibration half and a validation half and were run stepwise from three to six components using both halves split half analysis and visual inspection were applied to determine the correct numbers of components the split half validation results were shown in fig 1s since good agreement among the spectral loadings of excitation and emission which estimated from two random halves of the data set split 1 red lines split 2 blue lines and the complete data set black lines were found only in 3 components therefore we selected 3 components as the best model fit fluorescence intensities of all components were represented the fmax value stedmon and markager 2005b the fmax value of each parafac component is proportional to the intensities of a corresponding fluorescent fraction borisover et al 2009 therefore the relative abundance of fluorescence components was calculated by the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the component to the total fluorescence intensities 2 5 svr svr as one of the machine learning methods was used to model doc concentrations in poyang lake the method was implemented using the python programming language the radial basis function rbf was used in this study for analysis ten fold cross validation was performed to evaluate the performance of svr models this process splits the dataset into ten folds of training and testing sets inconsistent with parafac modeling 117 samples were input into the svr model due to there being one missing value in the data and the svr model is not allowed to have vacant values thus we deleted the corresponding values at the same rank and 116 samples were trained in the model a training set of 75 samples was used to train the model while a testing set of 41 samples was to test the model the prediction accuracy of the svr model was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean relative error mre of the linear regression fit between the predicted and measured doc these metrics are calculated as follows r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where yi is the observed value y i is the predicted value and y i is the mean value of the observed values 2 6 statistical analysis a parametric one way analysis of variance anova coupled with a multiple comparison post hoc test was used to test for significant differences among seasons and an independent sample t test was applied to test for significant differences between the river mouths samples and the main lake samples for all statistical analyses a p value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant a paired sample t test was used to compare the differences between the same sampling sites sites 1 15 over four seasons principal component analysis pca was conducted using cdom parameters including suva 254 a 254 m values and the fluorescence intensities of the parafac components for all the samples all input data before pca analysis were standardized by ln x 1 two principal components eigenvalue greater than 1 were extracted that together explain approximately 79 9 of the total variance the samples were further labeled by different seasons and locations i e river mouths and the main lake all these statistical analyses were performed by spss 19 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 parafac components of fdom three parafac components identified in this study fig 1s were all successfully cross referenced to the openfluor database using a criterion of 95 similarity to indicate a match murphy et al 2014 component c1 with ex em maxima at 245 391 nm shared spectral properties common to microbial humic like substances osburn et al 2018 zhang et al 2011b zhou et al 2017b c2 showed spectral characteristics typical of terrestrial humic like compounds coble 1996 galletti et al 2019 stedmon and markager 2005b c3 ex em maxima 275 304 nm exhibited fluorescence that is often attributed to protein like substances which is associated with compounds containing amino acids goncalves araujo et al 2016 osburn et al 2018 it was reported as the tyrosine like component in rainwater yang et al 2019 but was also suggested to represent tryptophan like dom in groundwater podgorski et al 2018 therefore we considered it to be a mixture of protein like substances such as tryptophan like and tyrosine like substances the proportions of c1 c2 and c3 in the total fluorescence intensities in the lake were 41 4 31 6 and 26 9 respectively 3 2 seasonal change of cdom parameters and doc 3 2 1 seasonal change of optical parameters of cdom and doc after pooling all 96 samples in the main lake for the full year and using a rapid classification of the trophic state based on a 254 values zhang et al 2017b sample sites at the mesotrophic level 4 a 254 10 accounted for 59 4 and those in the light eutrophic level 10 a 254 15 accounted for 37 5 no samples with hyper eutrophication a 254 23 were found in this study the remainder three sites were estimated as a moderate eutrophication state 15 a 254 23 which all occurred in the flood season these results demonstrate that the lake was typically between mesotrophic and light eutrophic levels the seasonal variations of cdom in the main lake and river mouths are shown in fig 3 for cdom concentrations represented by a 254 there was no significant seasonal variation in the main lake however significantly lower cdom concentrations from river mouth samples in the dry season than those in other seasons p 0 01 no significant differences were observed between the rising and the flood seasons from river mouths samples whereas a significant increase of a 254 values at the same sites from site 9 to 15 in the lake from the rising season to the flood season was found in fig 4 p 0 05 doc concentrations from the main lake samples in rainy seasons the rising season and the flood season were significantly lower than the non rainy seasons the dry season and the retreating season p 0 01 however no significant difference of river mouths samples was found among the seasons when the cdom from the river mouths samples showed the property of significantly higher molecular weight reflected by lower m values in the flood season cdom in the main lake in the flood season is likely unaffected by the input of large amounts of cdom with high molecular weight this indicates that there is a complex seasonal relationship between the main input rivers and the main lake we further explore the seasonal variations of cdom and the relationship between the river mouths and the main lake water by analyzing the values at the same 15 sampling sites 1 15 in fig 2 as shown in fig 4 cdom concentrations higher than 10 m 1 in the dry season were discovered only in the southern part of the main lake district while in the retreating season the values in the main lake showed very low variations cv 8 7 during the rising and the flood season high cdom concentrations mainly appeared at the river mouths and the mean cdom concentration from river mouths was relatively higher than that from the main lake district fig 5 higher values of a 254 were also found in the southern lake in the flood and the rising season and there was an obvious decreasing tendency from the southern part to the northern part in the flood season except at the river lake connecting site hukou station location 15 in fig 4 indicating that significant cdom input from the five main input rivers contributed to the lake in the rising season and the flood season and drives the distribution of cdom in the lake to elucidate the relative contribution of cdom from the five main input rivers to poyang lake during the rising season and the flood season we calculate the water area of poyang lake during these two seasons derived from the monthly mean water level at xingzi station xiong et al 2016 and a volume of 8 39 km3 during the rising season and of 9 45 km3 during the flood season can be obtained by multiplying by the mean depth of 2 7 m of poyang lake ye 2014 next the standing stock of cdom in the lake can be obtained by multiplying the mean a 254 value of 8 9 m 1 in april and 9 9 m 1 in july by the corresponding water volumes likewise the mean fluxes of cdom from five input rivers during the rising season and the flood season were 41 0 109 m2 month and 30 7 109 m2 month respectively which was based on multiplying the mean a 254 values from the rivers in april and july by the corresponding mean inflow the contribution of cdom from the input rivers during the rising season and the flood season can account for 56 6 and 34 1 respectively this underlined the relative contribution of the input rivers during the rising season is more important than that during the flood season similar seasonal changes for suva 254 were observed in the lake and the river mouths as the water level rises from the dry season to the flood season the aromaticity of cdom increased and significantly higher aromaticity was observed in the flood season than in the dry season for both lake samples and river mouths samples p 0 01 the samples at the same sites exhibited the same tendency fig 4 which suggests that the aromaticity of cdom in water is seriously affected by seasonal variations overall doc and aromaticity in the main lake were more influenced by seasonal variations while cdom concentrations and molecular weight in the river mouths were more affected 3 2 2 seasonal change of fdom components high proportions of humic like substances c1 c2 with 76 6 and 72 4 of the total intensities were found during the flood and the rising season respectively followed by the retreating season 65 1 and the dry season 60 8 however c3 showed the opposite tendency this indicates that the relative abundance of fluorescence components are affected by seasonal variations the wet season is enriched with humic like fluorescence while the dry season contains a higher protein like fluorescence this result is in good agreement with reports about dom in drinking water reservoirs in china maqbool et al 2020 shi et al 2020 the c2 c3 ratio in the dry season and the retreating season was significantly lower than that observed in the rising season and flood season p 0 01 furthermore c2 contents from the river mouth samples in the rising season were significantly higher than those in the dry season paired samples t test p 0 01 and c2 values in the river mouths sites 1 8 in the rising season were significantly higher than those in the lake sites 9 15 p 0 05 fig 5 indicating that large amounts of terrestrial matter from the five main rivers are transported into the lake during the rising season this was probably due to the fact that the main type of land use in the poyang basin is woodland previous research found that dom in the soils and the rivers in the forest watersheds are dominated by humic like substances kothawala et al 2015 ma and li 2020 yang et al 2012 additionally due to rapid economic growth southwest china has become the third largest heavy acid rain region in the world most acid rains are sulfuric acid rains with a high sulfate content the frequency of acid rain in jiangxi province can reach more than 80 xie et al 2012 generally most rainfall is concentrated in the rising season and flood season in the poyang lake catchment zhang et al 2011a and large amounts of acid rain may cause dom containing lots of humic substances to be lost from red soil in the basin liu et al 2009 rodhe et al 2002 the input of such terrestrially humic like substances from the catchment into poyang lake can result in higher c2 content and a higher proportion of c2 components of fdom in the lake during the period of rising water level combined with the above calculated data including the standing stock of cdom in poyang lake and the flow flux of input rivers the input of c2 from the major input rivers during the rising season and the flood season can account for roughly 59 and 30 7 respectively it is worth noting that significantly higher c2 intensities in the flood season than the rising season were found in the main lake p 0 05 but no significant difference of c2 between the rising season and flood season was found in the river mouth samples this indicated that other sources contributed to the terrestrial humic like matter besides the five main input rivers as shown by the gray pattern in fig 1 the runoff of the five input rivers during the flood season is low while the water level of the lake is high indicating that there was a backflow of water from the yangtze river to the lake which was in accordance with previous findings li et al 2017 additionally high cdom with relatively high aromaticity and high molecular weight characteristics and high fdom concentrations in the flood season were observed at hukou station sampling site 15 in fig 4 which is located at the junction of poyang lake and the yangtze river during the transport process of cdom along the yangtze river lots of refractory organic matter would accumulate in the river gan et al 2013 which can lead to higher cdom concentrations near hukou with the characteristics of higher molecular weight and aromaticity 3 3 geographical comparison of cdom parameters and doc in the flood season fig 6 a g shows the distribution for all the samples in the flood season the cvs of doc and cdom parameters including a 254 suva 254 m values and fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 in the main lake were 21 6 23 5 28 9 17 7 19 5 17 2 and 41 5 respectively which suggest low variability high values of a 254 fig 6a and doc fig 6b were mainly distributed in both the southern and middle regions of the lake the mean value of suva 254 was 2 79 units of l mg 1 m 1 and the maximum value 7 52 was found at the river mouth of the xin river and the minimum value 1 01 was found in the middle branch of the ganjiang river flowing through the nanjishan nature reserve c1 which represents microbially transformed products from terrestrial derived components showed the highest intensities in comparison with the other two components c2 and c3 in the flood season high c3 fig 6g was mainly distributed along the lakeshore near the urban zones such as duchang city indicating that the distribution of c3 was mainly affected by human activity notably high doc and cdom contents with relatively low molecular weight reflected by m values and low aromaticity represented by suva 254 values were found in the immersed nanaji wetland national nature reserve in the flood season this was partly consistent with the field observation that higher doc with relatively higher proportions of super low molecular weight was in the wetlands than the lakes wang et al 2016 further suggests that wetlands can contribute a large input to the organic carbon pool of the lake the reason for this might be that lots of wetland plants were drowned in high turbidity water as a result of rising water levels and subsequently died which released large amounts of fresh organic matter yza et al 2021 additionally the drowned sediment can also release a lot of dissolved organic matter yang et al 2014 thus in accordance with chen s result chen et al 2013 dom compositional features were controlled by soil and wetland plants during dry versus wet seasons which suggested that wetlands as organic carbon storage can affect the quantity and quality of cdom in the poyang lake and further influences the lake carbon cycle 3 4 pca results of cdom parameters a principal component analysis pca was conducted to investigate the quality differences in cdom samples collected during the dry rising flood and retreating seasons and also to explore the influence of river discharge input on cdom in the lake for all water samples the first and second axes of the pca factors 1 and 2 accounted for 46 7 and 33 2 of the total variance respectively the pca score plot showed that cdom abundance especially the humic like components c1 and c2 was positive along with the pca factor 1 axis the m values displayed positive factor 2 loadings and suva 254 showed negative factor 2 loadings fig 7 a implying that pca factor 2 was probably associated with the quality of cdom specifically lower molecular weight and aromaticity of cdom were positive along with the pca factor 2 axis the mean factor 2 score in the dry season was significantly higher than in the rising and the retreating season and the mean factor 1 score for the samples was lower than the rising and flood season p 0 05 further indicating that cdom samples with a low proportion of humic like substances during the dry season present low aromaticity and molecular weight a higher mean factor 1 score was observed for samples collected during the rising season than the dry season p 0 05 fig 7b and a weak higher mean factor 1 score was seen for samples collected from the river mouths during the rising season than those from the main lake p 0 053 fig 7c further substantiating the fact that vast amounts of cdom especially terrestrial humic like matters were discharged into the lake from the main rivers during the rising season a significantly lower mean factor 2 score for samples during the flood season was found by comparing with the adjacent seasons p 0 05 fig 7b this supports the fact that cdom in the flood season presents characteristics of high aromaticity a lower mean factor 2 score for samples collected from the river mouths than those collected from the main lake was observed p 0 01 fig 7d which further highlights that the significant difference between the cdom from input rivers and the main lake during the flood season 3 5 doc prediction using the svr model doc measurements are crucial for estimating carbon budgets but are restricted to measurements of discrete samples and are limited to providing synoptic coverage on relatively small spatial scales fichot and benner 2011 using the measurement of the spectral characteristics of dom absorption and fluorescence with proper instrumentation to estimate doc concentrations therefore represents a compelling alternative many previous results have shown that cdom can be used as a proxy for doc measurement in certain waters asmala et al 2012 avagyan et al 2014 fichot and benner 2011 kowalczuk et al 2010 rochelle newall et al 2014 xu et al 2017 zhao and song 2018 however the relationship between cdom and doc is highly variable across various environments binding et al 2008 griffin et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 miller 2012 and even changed across the same aquatic system such as the three gorges reservoir area jiang et al 2018 poyang lake as the largest freshwater lake and the river connecting lake in china is influenced by climate changes and human activities liu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 which make the lake shows the unique phenomenon lake like with high water level and river like with low water level the large water area and high water level fluctuations in the lake caused the doc and cdom to vary across the seasons and locations as shown in figs 3 4 and 6 and the relationship between the doc and cdom can be more complex which make it hard to estimate doc using cdom parameters during the entire year simple linear regression is therefore no longer a suitable method to overcome this difficulty machine learning methods can be used which are suitable to handle this kind of problem and have been increasingly adopted for exploring complex relationships between a set of predictor variables and a response variable svr has been widely applied for chlorophyll a estimation camps valls et al 2006 he et al 2020 however few studies were carried out for doc prediction by machine learning such as svr based on cdom parameters in water especially in lakes with such extreme high water level fluctuations in this study we pick cdom parameters including cdom fluorescent and optical parameters for predicting doc concentration based on the r2 rmse and mre metrics table 1s since the input indicators have different measurement units the input variables z scores were calculated before svr modeling by comparison with these metrics the relative fluorescence abundance of c1 c2 c3 represented by c1 t c2 t and c3 t in the table 1s respectively values of c1 c2 ratio a 254 m and suva 254 values can be taken as good predictor variables to estimate doc concentration this also indicated that doc matter is strongly related to the quantity and quality of cdom an optimal model fit p 0 001 with an r2 value of 0 79 was achieved between predicted and measured doc concentration for the full year in poyang lake fig 8 3 6 effects of river lake interactions on cdom characteristics as one of the only two large lakes another one is the dongting lake connected to the yangtze river changes in the level of the yangtze river caused by the three gorges dam tgd have an impact on the hydrological processes and water cycle in poyang lake as indicated by the seasonal variations of cdom and doc characteristics of the main lake interactions between poyang lake and rivers vary seasonally figs 3 4 and 5 a sharp increase of a 254 values and suva 254 at the hukou site site 15 in figs 2 and 4 of the flood season was found while there is no significant change at the same site in the other three hydrological seasons similarly hydrodynamic modeling statistical analysis and stable isotopes reported respectively that backflow events disturb the normal northward water flow direction in the poyang lake both the frequency and magnitude significantly since tgd began to operate li et al 2017 wu et al 2020 there is a short term backflow of the yangtze river water that transports southward into poyang lake during our sampling period of flood season however cdom and doc characteristics are not only influenced by the regulation of the tgd but also by the influence of climate changes and human activities in the poyang lake basin zhang et al 2015 the mean cdom concentration cdom fluorescent intensities and doc from river mouths in the rising season were relatively higher than those from the main lake district fig 5 these input rivers can contribute more than 50 of the total cdom and terrestrial humic like substances to the lake in the rising season hence future research should focus on the complex interactions between the poyang lake and yangtze river but also the poyang lake basin even the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river catchment to better understand the transport of pollutants and solutes around the confluence zone of the yangtze river and poyang lake 3 7 environmental implications cdom is an important optically active substance in aquatic environments and plays a key role in nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles which also has significant impacts on environmental pollutants migration toxicity and bioavailability mantoura et al 1978 jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the change of intrinsic characteristics in cdom such as aromaticity and molecular weight may also affect the environmental behavior of nutrients and pollutants the previous researches showed that cdom at 254 nm a 254 increased significantly with the trophic status of lakes and reservoirs shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017a and they further provided a rapid method of estimating the trophic level in the reservoirs by using a humic index of cdom shang et al 2019 for poyang lake yao et al 2015 indicated fdom can be a proxy for capturing rapid changes in water quality and our previous work further demonstrated that humic like substances as the dominant fraction of fdom in the lake are strongly and positively related to the nitrogen concentrations liu et al 2018 thus cdom content and humic like substances in fdom increased with the rising water level in poyang lake and more than 50 of terrestrial humic like substances flowed into the lake from the main input rivers during the rising seasons which would lead to an enhanced risk of lake eutrophication due to accumulation of terrestrial dom zhou et al 2018 it was even worse in the extreme floods which would induce the occurs of cyanobacterial blooms due to lots of nutrients input from watersheds qin 2020 china s lakes have serious environmental problems huang et al 2019 and poyang lake is suffering from persistent eutrophication tracing the properties of cdom could be used as a fundamental resource for other ongoing studies on water quality including those studying pollutants and nutrients in shallow yangtze river connecting lakes additionally the yangtze river is a source of drinking water for many downstream cities the most common situation of water exchange between the poyang lake and the yangtze river was the flow from the lake to the river an average of 1 436 108 m3 of water flows from poyang lake into the yangtze river each year which makes up 9 7 to 29 0 of the downstream flow of the yangtze river and accounts for 15 5 of the yangtze river annual runoff lai et al 2017 this necessitates better monitoring of cdom characteristics near the outflow to ensure safe drinking water resources the previous study has reported that lakes can be also regulators of carbon cycling and global climate tranvik et al 2009 poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china therefore has a critical role in the global carbon cycle in contrast to semi closed or closed lakes poyang lake exhibits string seasonal and hydrological variations due to its natural input and output connections with rivers and the regulation of its water regime is dictated by the yangtze river and its five main input rivers yao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a this unique characteristic makes it worthy of study on the role of this type of lake within active organic matters in the carbon cycle interestingly although significantly high aromaticity in cdom and low doc is found in poyang lake during the flood season as compared to other seasons cdom with low aromaticity and molecular weight and high doc concentrations were still found in wetlands this part of fresh cdom and doc entering the water body not only influences the distribution of cdom in the lake but also may be actively involved in the microbial and photo degradation processes in the lake and can further impact carbon cycling in the water it may help explain to some extent the phenomenon of why the maximum mean flux of greenhouse gases on the water air interface of poyang lake is found in summer lin 2012 and may give another important approach to research the influence of wetlands on global carbon cycling importantly ml techniques are effective tools that can handle complexities in different aquatic ecosystems hu et al 2020 lehikoinen et al 2019 that is why in the present study the svr technique can be applied in doc concentration retrieval moreover if long term continuous in situ cdom observations by using field instruments are available the svr technique might perform even better than it did in the present study which would facilitate further research of carbon cycling dynamics 4 conclusion a seasonal investigation of cdom from 120 samples in china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake was characterized by absorbance and fluorescence measurements with a parafac analysis and doc estimation by cdom parameters was conducted using ml modeling our study showed that hydrological seasons in the river connected lake can affect the properties of cdom and doc lower doc and a higher proportion of humic like fluorescence matters in fdom were found during the rainy seasons the rising and the flood season than non rainy seasons the dry season and the retreating season 56 6 of cdom abundance and 59 of terrestrial humic like matter came from the five main input rivers during the rising season which can affect the distribution of cdom from the southern region to the northern part of the lake although the cdom samples from the flood season were characterized by high aromaticity and low doc cdom with low aromaticity and high doc concentration was found in the wetlands the contribution of wetlands can affect the characteristics and spatial distribution of cdom in waters and can also further improve our understanding of the important role of wetlands in the poyang lake watershed our methods may also be extended to similar waters with high water level fluctuations additionally our study has demonstrated that ml represents a robust approach to predict doc concentrations effectively based on cdom parameters which can overcome the prediction difficulties inherent in a large lake system with strong spatial and seasonal variations this allows the benefit of being able to capture organic carbon information quickly and to improve our understanding of the cycling dynamics of carbon or other related matters i e nutrients and pollutants in these kinds of river connecting freshwater lakes credit authorship contribution

3707,in this paper we address the impact of agricultural expansion on hydrological patterns of water and sediment budget in one of the largest floodplains along the cambodian mekong since the 1980s using field water level discharge sediment rainfall and groundwater level and remote sensing land use surface suspended sediment data and numerical simulations specifically while both the surface suspended sediment concentration and water level in the mekong river around kampong cham and neak luong decreased the floodplain seasonal water storage increased in addition the rate of sediment input from the river to the floodplain was almost constant throughout the studied period the investigation of the floodplain s annual sediment budget however reveals a significant drop during the analyzed period mainly due to the decreased sediment trapping rate 66 in the 1980s to 46 in the 2010s currently a good amount of sediment bypass the floodplain and return back to the river the observed hydrological patterns in the floodplain could have been triggered by the agricultural expansion that has increased surface erodibility due to removals of primary vegetation and lowered the land surface elevation due to groundwater extraction despite the well known impacts of the hydropower dams on the mekong delta hydrological conditions particularly the reduction of sediment reaching the delta due to sediment trapping by dam reservoirs our observations point to new and more localized driving factors of sediment deficit in floodplain agricultural expansion finally we used 2d hydrodynamic simulation telemac 2d to visualize the processes of water routing and sedimentation in the floodplain accounting for land cover change since the 1980s the floodplain hydrology reported in this paper is an unexplored environmental consequence of agricultural expansion in the lower mekong geomorphologically this study presents a peculiar case of floodplain showing how agricultural expansion can diminish the role of a floodplain as a sediment sink through decreasing the trapping rate keywords floodplain sedimentation land use land cover change human impacts cambodia mekong 1 introduction along with rich water resources from the mekong river cambodia has been developing its economies around agriculture especially rice production exports currently 65 of the entire labour force in cambodia are engaged in rice production activities contributing approximately 25 to the national gross domestic product cramb et al 2020 however the nation s irrigation capacity is limited and has only been able to irrigate 10 of its rice crops the rainfed lowland rice is still the most common cultivation system cramb et al 2020 erban gorelick 2016 most cambodian rice crops therefore are grown between may and november with ample surface water resources evidently it is not the case for the dry season which pushes the farmers towards exploiting the groundwater resources sok choup 2017 as a result on site irrigation systems through sinking tube wells have been extensively used to draw groundwater to feed these rice fields during the dry seasons sok choup 2017 observed that more than 80 of the total groundwater extracted in cambodia has ended up fueling agricultural activities and the trend continues to rise over the years in the prey veng province for instance the number of tube wells for irrigation had grown from 1 600 to 25 000 in the last decade ide 2005 even though groundwater has been abundantly available in most areas of the lowland plains of cambodia especially around tonle sap lake promoting extensive groundwater use entails multiple environmental issues challenging the sustainable development of the region cramb et al 2020 for instance during the withdrawal pore spaces within subsurface materials are reduced causing the multiple layers of sediments to be compacted and ultimately lead to land subsidence erban et al 2014 one of the most notable evidence was reported by sok 2017 and chen et al 2019 in that excessive groundwater extraction around angkor wat could have been responsible for the sinking of this world heritage site poorly planned groundwater extraction could also intensify arsenic contamination via lowered water table erban et al 2013 winkel et al 2011 in the case of prey veng and svey rieng in cambodia being the focus of this study the drawdown exceeded the recharge rate and the overall decline in groundwater levels from 1996 to 2008 was critically remarkable johnston et al 2013 as a result the unplanned over exploitation of groundwater has triggered a series of environmental consequences this includes a declining water table which makes it harder and costlier to lift exacerbating land subsidence and arsenic contamination erban et al 2013 sok and choup 2017 winkel et al 2011 from the trans catchment perspective the water resources of these cambodian floodplains are also vulnerable to multiple external pressures among these the operation of upstream hydropower dams and the ever intensifying riverbed mining activities could directly affect the available water resources by reducing the chronicle inundation frequencies of the floodplains park et al 2020 park et al 2021a park et al 2021b such a decrease of the natural supply of water to the floodplains would consequently lead to the disruption of the livelihoods of millions of agricultural habitats and ultimately the regional food security e g binh et al 2020a eslami et al 2019 loc et al 2017 loc et al 2021a loc et al 2021b loc et al 2021c among others although the unfavourable outcomes from the proliferation of mechanized groundwater irrigation pumps have been well documented in previous studies either in the region erban et al 2013 erban gorelick 2016 or in the broader asia such as india or china e g shah et al 2007 what distinguishes the case of cambodian floodplains are the novel impacts of agricultural expansion driven extensive groundwater extraction on floodplain water and sediment budgets on the one hand the seasonal water extents and flood frequencies along the largest cambodian mekong floodplain close to phnom penh have constantly increased over the past few decades since the 1980s according to the data by pekel et al 2016 on the other hand the water levels and surface suspended sediment concentration sssc in the mekong river constantly exhibit decreasing trends in the respective period related to the upstream dam constructions and riverbed mining binh et al 2020b binh et al 2021 ng park 2021 such seemingly contradictory phenomena however could have been attributed to the enhanced water accommodation capacity of the floodplain as shown in fig 1 a because of the subsided land surfaces which is in turn caused by groundwater extraction and surface erosion interestingly in the beginning stages of our investigation section 3 1 we found that against the increased water fluxes into the floodplain and stationary sediment inflows the sediment storage i e the annual budget still decreases significantly over the same period of time we proceeded to hypothesize that it is the decline of surface roughness driven by the agricultural expansion that has significantly decreased the sediment trapping in the floodplain over recent years in this paper we aim to address this hydrological pattern in the largest floodplain in cambodian mekong and to identify the root cause of the phenomena we focused on this floodplain as a case study site because it is representative of a cultivated floodplain system in the cambodian mekong the floodplain has recently experienced agricultural expansion along with intensifying groundwater extraction and is also under direct impact of other environmental pressures regulating the river hydrology such as dams and sand mining we analyzed hydrological data water level and discharge at multiple gauge stations around the floodplain reconstructed time series sssc data at virtual gauge stations using field calibrated optical remote sensing data and then calculated water and sediment budgets agricultural expansion on the floodplain has been mapped since the early 1980s which is corroborated by groundwater level data over 17 monitoring wells since our analysis of floodplain water and sediment budgets is based on hydrological data in the mekong river main channel we incorporated results from two dimensional hydrodynamic simulation telemac 2d to visualize the floodplain water routing patterns and sedimentation processes accounting for the land cover changes during the studied periods 2 data and methods 2 1 hydrological data and trend analysis at gauge stations daily water level and discharge q data for the four stations along the lower mekong river in cambodia kampong cham kc chaktomuk cm prek kdam pk and neak luong nl from 1980 to 2020 were obtained from the mekong river commission mrc fig 1 these stations were chosen to calculate the water and sediment budget of the floodplain some of these stations had missing q records between 2002 and 2020 and for those cases daily q were estimated by the rating curves between water level and q kc is located around 10 km upstream from the inlet where the mekong water is transferred to the floodplain through channelized flow fig 1 nl is located around 5 km downstream from outlet1 the water export from the floodplain happens via outlet1 or outlet2 and there is no floodplain channel that connects the river and the floodplain between kc and nl verified through the maximum inundation area map by pekel et al 2016 both inlet and outlet are permanent channels that remain connected even during the dry season the tonle sap river connects the mekong river to the tonle sap lake the flow direction of the river is reversed seasonally toward the lake and river during wet and dry seasons respectively cm is located on the bassac river close to phnom penh first trends of hydrological time series were analyzed using the seasonal mann kendall s test mk at 95 confidence level a robust non parametric procedure in which kendall s tau with time as the covariate is computed by the user defined season helsel hirsch 1992 median slopes of all ranked seasonal regression slopes are used to estimate the slope for the trend s magnitude temporal autocorrelation was not accounted for because we examined the trends with the period of record mcbride 2005 we tested the time series at 95 confidence level and p values and kendall s tau are reported in section 3 hydrological data used in this study is summaried in table 1 2 2 calculating floodplain water budget floodplain water budget was computed using q data at the gauge stations and other hydrological variables i e rainfall evapotranspiration et rate and q at outlet2 using the following equation 1 seasonal w a t e r b u d g e t q kc q cm q nl q pk q o u t l e t 2 r a i n f a l l e t where qx denotes the mean monthly discharge at the station and qoutlet2 not a station is the discharge at outlet2 along the floodplain channel other than qkc and qnl along the mekong mainstream there are several other variables used in the annual water budget computation qcm representing the bassac river s discharge a distributary of the mekong which we subtracted from qkc qpk representing the discharge added to the floodplain water budget during the falling season when water flows from tonle sap to the mekong and vice versa during the rising season qoutlet2 is an atypically long meandering 90 km branch that merges back to the mekong main channel in vietnam close to the border qoutlet2 was estimated by the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp survey data that we obtained in 2017 along the vam nao channel a geomorphologically similar floodplain channel in the mekong delta located approximately 30 km downstream from the cambodian border this floodplain channel with outlet2 has the comparable sinuosity index 1 54 reach channel slope 6 5 cm km stability almost no migration was confirmed through visual inspection of google earth historical imagery during 1985 2019 and is constructed by similar fine sediment materials hackney et al 2020 hence we consider that the w d ratio of the two channels should be analogous manning s equation manning et al 1890 was used to estimate the flow velocity of the floodplain channel as follow 2 v r 2 3 s 1 2 n where r is a hydraulic radius estimated using mean width approximately 100 m measured from the 0 5 m resolution digital globe image and mean depth of the floodplain channel and s is the slope calculated from the adcp data at the vam nao channel daily total rainfall data from 1980 to 2020 at 5 km resolution is obtained from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 and then total monthly rainfall landed on the floodplain was calculated et in the lower mekong was obtained from zhou et al 2006 at 3 4 mm day averaged potential evapotranspiration over the lower mekong consumption of water by paddy is not included in the budget because it does not affect hydrological input or output in the floodplain rather it is partially accounted for in the et term 2 3 estimating suspended sediment concentration based on field survey data and the floodplain sediment budget sssc along the four virtual stations was estimated based on landsat data landsat 4 8 level 2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance product since 1987 at 30 m resolution was downloaded from usgs earth explorer a total of 647 images first we developed a reflectance sssc calibration model along the lower mekong two field measurements of the sssc in the mekong river were used for calibration 1 sssc data around phnom penh port ppp by lu et al 2014 collected between may 2008 to may 2011 n 32 and 2 sssc data along the mekong river in vietnam between tan chau and my thuan for location see park et al 2021 collected between december 2020 and january 2021 n 23 surface sediment was collected through surface water sampling using a 500 ml bottle filtered with the cellulose acetate membranes 0 45 μm and weighted after drying 24 h for the landsat data we used the red band centred around 0 655 μm which is constantly sensitive to the level of surface sediment concentration in inland turbid waters doxaran et al 2002 park and latrubesse 2014 a 7 7 pixel mask centered on the field measurement site was delineated and median reflectance was computed after filtering out outlier pixels i e greater than 2 standard deviations to minimize the sensor noise the remaining qualified pixels were used to build a regression model in which the slope is statistically significant at 95 confidence level fig 2 using this field calibrated reflectance sssc model sssc time series since 1978 were estimated over the four virtual stations 529 n 1 308 here we consider that most qs that we calculate in this study is dominantly washload composed of mostly silt and clay as verified by hackney et al 2020 and our own field survey data 2 sand fig 2b estimated sssc was incorporated with q data to estimate the sediment fluxes qs at each four stations as below 3 qs sssc t q t k where sssct and qt denotes sssc and q on a specific date t while k is a conversion factor the seasonal sediment budget of the floodplain was then calculated by the following equation 4 seasonal s e d i m e n t b u d g e t qs kc qs cm qs nl qs pk qs o u t l e t 2 where qsx denotes the annual qs at the station x we verified through visual inspection of high resolution images in google earth that there is no additional sediment input or output for the floodplain other than the fluxes through identified inlet or outlet in this study 2 4 mapping agricultural expansion and dry season ndvi using landsat data land use and land cover change over the floodplain since the 1970s has been mapped based on landsat data at 30 m on the google earth engine gee cloud based platform we used level 1 terrain precision l1tp calibrated top of atmosphere toa reflectance image path 126 and row 52 that has been corrected for the atmospheric effects through the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps masek et al 2012 images with cloud cover and the shadows exceeding 25 were masked out random forest after generating a classifier trees based on bootstrapped samples of training data within each image breiman 1999 was used to classify the pixels into five classes water natural vegetation bare paddy green paddy and urban classes defined by local expert knowledge based on the same landsat product on gee dry season normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to identify vegetation growth and from there we made inferences to groundwater extraction activities ndvi is defined as follows 5 ndvi n i r r e d n i r r e d while nir and red denote near infrared and red bands respectively since the positive ndvi values represent green vegetation from grassland to dense forest toward 1 we computed the average value over the floodplain during the dry season december may since the 1980s the reasoning for this is that since double cropping is a predominant agricultural practice in this part of cambodia ear et al 2017 irra 2010 farmers exploit groundwater to irrigate crops during the dry season fao 2015 when floodplain recharges from both limited rainfall and the low mekong water inflow ear et al 2017 irra 2010 kwak et al 2015 without exploiting groundwater resources in the dry season when both the meteorological and fluvial hydrological inputs are limited most of the floodplain land should have remained dry barren land and dry soil that normally yields lower ndvi values i e ndvi 0 2 5 groundwater level trend examination and field controls the groundwater data level used in this study was provided by the international development enterprises ide provincial scale data of groundwater usage total extraction rates and out of domestic usage has been supplied from sok choup 2017 in this study we considered groundwater level data from 17 wells mostly within the prey veng and kandal provinces of which the groundwater level data were measured once per month from 1996 to 2008 see section 3 2 for location using the groundwater level decline rates from the monitoring wells measured relatively well distributed across the study area we created a heatmap via ordinary kriging to signify the spatial patterns of groundwater level declines for illustration purpose monthly water level time series from two wells p 24 measured and p 15 estimated from the ratio between p 24 obtained from the interpolated map are plotted to verify the temporal change of groundwater level we employed the mann kendall test as described above lastly photo documentary evidence showing the consequences of the groundwater extraction in the study area such as land subsidence was collected from various sources online in khmer keywords used 2 6 2d hydrodynamic modelling of floodplain sedimentation we used a coupled telemac 2d and sisyphe model of the telemac mascaret system to simulate spatial distribution patterns of sedimentation in the floodplain the telemac 2d model is used to simulate hydrodynamics solving the depth averaged saint venant equations while the sisyphe model villaret 2010 villaret et al 2013 simulates sediment transport and bed evolution by solving a two dimensional advection diffusion and the exner equations as below exner 1920 exner 1925 pablo 2018 6 h c t h u c x h v c y x h ε s c x y h ε s c y e d where c is the depth averaged concentration volume u and v are the depth averaged velocities in x and y directions m s respectively ε s is the turbulent diffusivity of the sediment related to the eddy viscosity ε s ν t σ c σ c is the schmidt number 1 0 ω s is settling velocity cm s e and d are the erosion and deposition rates respectively which are estimated by the equation below for bed elevation 7 1 λ z b t e d 0 where λ is the bed porosity z b is the bed level m in the advection diffusion equations only suspended sediment is considered because sediment in the floodplain is mainly transported in the suspension mode hung et al 2014 also bedload contributes only 1 3 of the total load in the lower mekong in cambodia hackney et al 2020 we internally coupled the telemac 2d model with the sisyphe model by which hydrodynamic parameters solved by the telemac 2d model are sent to the sisyphe model to estimate bed evolution the updated bed elevations are sent back into the telemac 2d model to repeat the simulation cycles during the flood season june to november the channelized flows from the mekong river to the floodplain via the inlet fig 1 is the dominant source of the floodplain water and sediment budgets an unstructured triangle mesh of 300 m was generated by a finite element method totalling approximately 53 000 elements we imposed daily discharge and sssc at the upstream boundary i e the floodplain inlet and free flow and sediment at the downstream boundary i e the outlet1 the model was calibrated and validated against the flood data june november in 2000 representing one of the most extreme floods that occurred during the investigated period we performed a hot start simulation which was simulated for seven days using constant discharge and sssc at the boundaries to obtain a steady condition then the results were used as initial conditions for the main simulations the floodplain geometry was obtained from the multi error removed improved terrain merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 where the elevation of the alluvial plain part of the floodplain excluding uplands ranged mostly from 1 to 12 m above egm96 reference geoid including floodplain ridges the model was calibrated by tuning various parameters including friction coefficient velocity diffusivity 10 6 m s for the telemac 2d model critical shear stress for erosion 0 15 n m2 critical shear velocity for deposition 0 03 m s settling velocity 6 6x10 5 m s and krone partheniades erosion constant 1 10 6 kg s m2 for the sisyphe model the initial distribution of the manning coefficient n was estimated from the 2000 land use map using the method described by acrement 1989 the landsat derived sssc values at 30 random locations within the floodplain were compared to the simulated values to evaluate the model performance validation the goodness of the model was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse after that we simulated sedimentation in the floodplain driven by land use change from 1995 to 2015 by changing the manning coefficient accordingly lastly the simulated volume of sediment deposited in the floodplain each year is compared with the sediment budget in mass tons using the porosity of silt and clay 3 results and discussion 3 1 trends of floodplain water and sediment budgets we first assessed the trends of discharge wl and sssc at the two stations kc and nl inlet and outlet respectively when computing the water and sediment budgets of the floodplain in the next section we used mainly these two inlet outlet stations because there are no river floodplain hydrological interactions along the mekong reach between kc and nl confirmed through visual inspections of the global surface water explorer s maximum inundation layer during the past 40 years pekel et al 2016 floodplain has only one inlet that is close to kc 10 km downstream from kc the floodplain channel permanently connects the river with the floodplain and has 40 m width on average close to the inlet fig 1a therefore the mekong river s wl and q around the inlet determines the amount of hydrological input fluxes entering the floodplain prior to 2000 daily q and wl at kc showed a relatively consistent trend without a change after the mk test p value 0 22 for wl however q and wl showed a decreasing trend after 2000 p value 0 01 the mean annual water level has decreased from 6 94 pre 2000 to 6 56 m post 2000 this might be related to the operation of the dams in the mekong upstream as most of them were built after 2000 11 out of 12 on the main channel with many more planned to be built in the near future in the upstream reaches from cambodia hecht et al 2019 latrubesse et al 2020 the impact of the upstream dams is also evident in surface suspended sediment concentration time series estimated at kc fig 3 e showing a decreasing trend p value 0 01 when compared pre dam with post dam the monthly averaged sssc decreased from 70 3 to 60 6 mg l at kc fig 3h approximately a 14 decrease in summary q wl and sssc at kc all showed a decreasing trend since the 1980s which could have been attributed to the upstream dam construction and operation activities the daily discharge observed at the outlet station nl on the other hand showed no significant trends overall when assessed over the 40 years 1980 2020 p value 0 07 however a decreasing trend in wl is present when the time series is divided into two periods before vs after 2000 p value 0 01 in the case of nl we attribute the trend mainly to not only the upstream dams but also the aggressive riverbed mining activities taking place in this area which is not as much in the case of kc however it should be noted that it is very challenging to provide clear evidence of the dam due to the complex hydrological interactions of the mekong river with the tonle sap lake that largely alters the mekong s hydrology downstream of ppp kummu et al 2014 rather we speculate that the impact of riverbed mining around the reach between ppp and nl could have more significantly affected the observed decreasing trend of wl after 2000 this reach is one of the most intensively mined area in the mekong river hackney et al 2020 ng park 2021 since the effect of riverbed mining is localized dredging may result in the incision of the riverbed which lowers the water level without drastically altering the q at the same place as observed in the mekong delta park et al 2020 sssc also decreased substantially since 1987 at nl p value 0 01 from a mean annual average of 53 1 to 47 2 mg l 12 decrease before and after 2000 respectively the floodplain annual water budget calculated using eq 1 in section 2 2 was analyzed qoutlet2 representing the annual water loss through this floodplain channel was estimated to be almost negligible 40 m3 s mean annual discharge which is 1 of the mean annual discharge of the mekong at nl the total annual rainfall was computed to be 2 65x109 m3 on an inter annual average the annual water budget over the investigated period 1980 2020 was around 31 4x103m3 with the highest and lowest of 83 1 x103m3 and 3 27x103m3 observed in 1983 and 2002 respectively the overall increasing trend since 1980 was statistically significant p value 0 01 and sen s slope 0 0137 given that the wls at the floodplain inlet as well as in the outlet decreased significantly particularly after 2000 fig 3d which should have decreased the river floodplain connectivity and the floodplain recharge through the inlet it is remarkable to observe that the floodplain water budget has increased over time looking at the seasonal distribution of the floodplain water storage a good part of the annual water storage happens during the rising season when the floodplain has been recharged with the river water fig 4 b approximately 91 and 84 of the annual water budget i e 25 and 39x103m3 volume have been stored during the four months july to october for the periods the 1980s and the 2010s respectively comparing these two periods most of the months presented an increased water monthly budget with the highest increases of 6 9 103 m3 and 3 7 103 m3 observed in july and august respectively fig 4b we also took notice that although the floodplain s annual water budget has increased since the 1980s the annual sediment inputs from the mekong river to the floodplain in the same period does not exhibit any significant trends of shifts as shown in fig 4c this is likely due to the dam induced decrease of sssc in the mekong river around kc that has offset the effect of increased floodplain water recharge despite some outliers such as the exceptionally high values associated with 2002 and 2005 and the low values in 1998 the overall inter annual average remained around 3x106t without any significant trends p value 0 19 the comparison of the annual sediment inflows between the earliest and the latest investigated decades the 1980s vs 2020s reveals a slightly decreasing trend of 0 45 and 0 19x106t during the months of july and august when the water level at the mekong is at its peak however the mean monthly inflows of the two decades remained relatively similar i e 0 49 to 0 41x106t fig 4d likewise to the annual water budget floodplain sediment input from the mekong has substantially concentrated during the rising season particularly close to the peak water stages in the mekong river around july to september intriguingly against the stationary trend of the floodplain sediment inflows even though discharge has increased over the same period the annual floodplain sediment budget has significantly decreased 1988 2020 p value 0 01 as revealed in fig 4e more specifically the average sediment budget before 2000 was 2 1x106t while it decreased by approximately 30 to 1 46x106t 2010 2020 phasing with the sediment inflows most of the sedimentation in the floodplain occurred close to the peak stage around august and september on an inter annual average fig 4f finally the sediment trapping rate of the floodplain showed a clear decreasing trend during the investigated period ranging from 98 1991 to around 23 2010 this indicates that the role of the floodplain as a sediment sink has been diminishing gradually over the past 40 years and that a substantial portion of the mekong s sediment entering the floodplain currently flows back to the river through the outlets we would like to remark that the observed decreasing patterns of floodplain sediment budget occurred while the floodplain sediment inflows have not considerably changed over the same period since the 1980s this incongruous behaviour of the floodplain seems to be enabled through the gradual decrease of the trapping rate in the floodplain in which the causes are discussed in the next section 3 2 floodplain hydrology and agricultural expansion there are many other possible causes for the incongruous hydrological developments presented in this paper yet here we focus on only one anthropogenic activity more specifically we could have associated the increased annual water budget in the floodplain with the agricultural expansion in the floodplain for a couple of reasons first since the 1980s the floodplain has experienced drastic land use change paddy field area has increased approximately 300 from 457 to 1 381 km2 out of around 2 200 km2 total floodplain area while the natural vegetation cover has decreased from 861 to 343 km2 approximately 39 fig 1d and e and fig 5 a and b the area of the seasonally flooded land in the floodplain has also increased from 1 878 1985 1995 to 2 238 1996 2020 km2 based on the data by pekel et al 2016 fig 1 a and b second most of the increased newly generated seasonally flooding parts of the floodplain are irrigated farmlands that have been converted from the natural vegetation forest and shrubs overall the mean annual water extent has drastically increased in the floodplain since the 1980s p value 0 01 and r2 0 4 fig 1c combining this water extent time series with the floodplain water budget volume we roughly estimated the mean depth of the flooding during the peak stage we used the annual water extent maxima and monthly water budget for august and september from fig 4b and estimated the mean depth using water volume in m3 divided by area in m2 for the 1980s and 2000s as 0 82 and 1 64 m respectively indicating the increase in the flood water depth over time here we remark on the two key drivers for the floodwater depth increase in the floodplain surface erosion and land subsidence the floodplain has also experienced a rapid expansion of the paddy fields fig 5b similar trends were also observed around the tonlé sap region where naturally forested areas have been rapidly converted to paddy fields for rice cultivation to fuel the country s economic development kc et al 2019 evidently such rapid intensification of agriculture came with a hefty price several pristine landscapes including the indigenous vegetated areas of the floodplain as shown in fig 5e have been compromised hydrologically the non heterogeneous paddies are much smoother than the naturally rugged vegetated landscapes hence the larger velocity of the overland flows of the former condition the conversion of landscape as such in turn implies a duo impact i bypassing sediments originating from upstream now have a smaller chance of settling in the floodplain and ii erosion topsoil that originated from the vegetated landscape will be eroded fig 5c provides an example of the surface erosion in the kandal stung district kandal province this was also verified by our modelling results presented in the next section another cause is the land subsidence due to intensive groundwater extraction which is the widely recognized issue across cambodia chen et al 2019 erban et al 2014 minderhoud et al 2018 provinces around mekong river close to ppp where the nation s population is concentrated such as phnom penh kandal and prey veng dependency on the groundwater usage mainly for agriculture and domestic purposes such as drinking or cooking is substantial with typical extraction rates over 35 000 m3 per day in each province data from the 1990s and 2000s fig 6 a in these provinces groundwater comprises over 90 of the total domestic water use fig 6b in our study area kandal province double cropping is a widely adapted agricultural practice where farmers exploit groundwater to irrigate crops mostly paddy fields during the dry season when floodplain recharges from both the rainfall and the mekong water is limited irra 2010 kwak et al 2015 ear et al 2017 ndvi time series mapped during the dry season also shows an increasing trend since 1978 p value 0 01 and r2 0 32 fig 6d indicating that the irrigation for the dry season cropping in the floodplain has been intensified over time the groundwater level time series from the two monitoring p 24 and p 15 1996 2008 wells in the province also showed a significant decreasing trend of 51 and 49 cm year respectively this could have served as a proxy of the land subsidence due to the soil compaction fig 6e in fact the groundwater drawdown rates are exceeding the natural compaction rate of soil and comparable to the upper limits of anthropogenic driven groundwater level decrease observed throughout the indochina peninsular for example groundwater level declines between 2 5 and 50 cm year in hanoi and 30 cm year in the vietnamese mekong delta erban et al 2014 tam and nga 2018 we also present field observations of surface sinking in the kandal that relative level of ground has subsided after intensive groundwater drawdown fig 5d in summary it is evident that the floodplain land has been lowered mainly due to the dry season irrigation driven by the agricultural expansion in the floodplain as well as surface erosion in the recent decades we consider that agricultural expansion driven lowering of the floodplain landscape due to surface erosion and land subsidence has increased the floodplain s seasonal water storage although the sssc in the mekong has decreased over time floodplain sediment recharge remained stationary ironically the annual floodplain sediment budget has decreased which can be explained only by the decrease in the trapping rate currently the floodplain traps about 40 after 2010 of the sediment entering the floodplain and the lowest rate around 23 was observed in 2010 this rate used to be around 65 in the late 1980s the floodplain is changing into a sediment bypassing system instead of an efficient sink we conclude that the floodplain trapping rate has been affected dramatically by the land cover change in the floodplain which altered the surface roughness controlling the flow resistance and sedimentation large scale conversion of natural and pioneer vegetation to paddy fields or other low lying crops in the floodplain should have considerably reduced the roughness of the terrain by hampering settlement of the sediment from the river 3 3 floodplain sedimentation patterns and hydraulic impacts on inundation dynamics although the budgetary approach adopted in this study was mostly based on the river gauge stations data the patterns of sedimentation within the floodplain remain unknown to quantitatively assess the sedimentation patterns in the floodplain under different terrain roughness conditions that has been described in section 3 2 here we show hydrodynamic simulation results first we show the validation result of the model set up we compared the sssc map simulated over the floodplain in the three distinct phases rising peak and falling stages in 2000 to the sssc time series estimated from field calibrated landsat images i e observed fig 7 out of 30 randomly distributed validation points landsat driven sssc maps yielded at least 25 sample points to validate after filtering out the cloud shadow and other unqualified pixels the validation results yielded the average rmse of 28 9 mg l without a notable seasonal dependency fig 7b the rmse indicates a reasonably good performance of the hydrodynamic simulation as it is lower than 10 of the total sssc variability across the floodplain ranging from 30 to 400 mg l likewise an average r2 across the seasons also yielded a satisfactory value of 0 73 with the highest 0 76 and the lowest 0 68 fits during peak and falling seasons respectively when the river water enters the floodplain through the floodplain channel via an inlet it seems that the sedimentation along the floodplain channel is not high 0 5 cm year fig 8 this is perhaps due to the limited vertical aggradation capacity of the floodplain channel associated with the recent decrease in sssc and the lowering of water level in the mekong river around kc fig 3 the levee height of the floodplain channel seems low as inferred from the observation that every season they are fully covered by water during the peak flood stage observation from pekel et al 2016 the floodplain landscape is also generally flat average slope 4 cm km with rounded lakes and extensive paddy fields that are hydrologically well connected through small medium sized irrigation canals these canals act as a conveyor to transport sediment throughout the floodplain and to the distal parts of the floodplain during the flood season therefore the sedimentation rate seems to be not in phase with the distance to the channel due to well developed channelized connections as opposed to the other typical flood pulse system junk et al 1989 similar floodplain internal connectivity patterns have been observed in other pristine floodplain lakes that due to channelized network in the floodplain routing of the river flood water presents intricate network patterns park latrubesse 2017 the spatial distribution of sedimentation in the floodplain is heterogeneous the rates range from nearly 0 up to around 8 cm year in the case of large rounded lakes developed through continuous overbank dispersion from the floodplain channel they are concentrated in the western part of the floodplain and can have about 3 cm year of sedimentation on average these lakes are proximal to the river but indirectly receive water from the mekong via the floodplain channel that starts from the inlet overall the sedimentation rate for a good part of the floodplain more than 80 area showed 0 4 cm year and sedimentation hotspots correlate with the location of the rounded lakes locally depressed along the floodplain channel in other large rivers they are called impeded floodplain lakes and have been described as important sediment sinks within floodplain park 2020 park latrubesse 2019 it is assumed that most of the deposited materials are fine cohesive sediments washload which are exhaustively sourced from the river our grain size distribution analysis results at the lower reach of the mekong also indicated that suspended sediment is mostly silty and clay materials and 5 of the sandy fractions fig 2 given that the freeboard of the mekong at kc is 10 m and the exponentially decaying nature of the sandy sediment concentration as it gets toward the river surface it is not likely that suspended sandy loads enters the floodplain even during the flood mean depth and velocity of the mekong around kc during flood season were 20 m and 1 5 m3 s respectively hackney et al 2020 impacts of land cover change on sedimentation rate on floodplain was remarkable shown from our simulation results of the floodplain sedimentation over the five different years 1995 to 2015 with 5 years interval fig 8 along with the agricultural expansion overall sedimentation rates across the floodplain decreased with the pronounced decrease observed around the rounded lakes in the western fringe we consider that though a similar amount of sediment fluxes enters the floodplain on inter annual average fig 4c the floodplain cover has gradually lost the capacity to trap sediment due to the decreased terrain roughness therefore it is assumed that currently these rounded lakes efficiently export sediments mostly during the peak and falling seasons our modelled sedimentation rates showed a decreasing trend from 2 11 1995 to 0 68 cm year 2015 on average which translates into the sediment deposited mass of 4 21 and 1 36 mt respectively when converted to the volume using an aggregate density of 1 6 t m3 binh et al 2020a they were 2 63 and 0 85 mm3 which are almost in agreement with the volume estimated for the period before 1995 2 75x106 m3 and after 2015 1 23x106 m3 through the budgetary approach fig 4e and f a slight discrepancy of the modelled budget from the budget estimated from gauge stations can be related to the morphological complexity of the floodplain landscape for example we could not incorporate the land subsidence factor in the hydrodynamic simulation due to the lack of a subsidence map in the follow up study we expect to generate a subsidence map using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar which can be used to improve the hydrodynamic simulation accuracy 4 summary and final remarks in this paper we address the patterns of floodplain water and sediment budget in the floodplain of the mekong based in cambodia over the past 40 years both the surface suspended sediment concentration and water level in the mekong river decreased due to upstream dam constructions and intensive riverbed mining however floodplain seasonal water storage increased for the same period and the rate of sediment input from the river is almost constant during the study period the annual sediment budget of the floodplain however significantly decreased during the same period mainly due to the reduced sediment trapping rate from 66 in the 1980s to 46 in the 2010s and a good part of sediment entering the floodplain currently bypass it and enters back into the river we conclude that this observed paradox was enabled by the agricultural expansion in the floodplain that increased erodibility of the surface and lowered the land we expect the findings of our paper are of scientific significance in multiple aspects firstly connecting agricultural expansion with the alterations of floodplain s water and sediment budget constitutes an unexplored environmental consequence of human activities in the lower mekong river secondly the hydrological patterns of a large lowland floodplain described in this study has never been reported before or elsewhere in the world whereby three different hydro geomorphological processes happen simultaneously 1 increased water budget 2 constant sediment inflows and 3 decreased sediment budget lastly this study was able to contribute novel insight into understanding the sediment balance situation along the broader mekong river we speculate that lowered sediment trapping in the cambodian floodplain might have partially contributed to alleviating the sediment deficit downstream at the vietnam mekong delta however such floodplains while losing one of their most fundamental functions as sinks of sediments cannot evolve geomorphologically thus would remain incomplete indefinitely credit authorship contribution statement edward park conceptualization funding

3707,in this paper we address the impact of agricultural expansion on hydrological patterns of water and sediment budget in one of the largest floodplains along the cambodian mekong since the 1980s using field water level discharge sediment rainfall and groundwater level and remote sensing land use surface suspended sediment data and numerical simulations specifically while both the surface suspended sediment concentration and water level in the mekong river around kampong cham and neak luong decreased the floodplain seasonal water storage increased in addition the rate of sediment input from the river to the floodplain was almost constant throughout the studied period the investigation of the floodplain s annual sediment budget however reveals a significant drop during the analyzed period mainly due to the decreased sediment trapping rate 66 in the 1980s to 46 in the 2010s currently a good amount of sediment bypass the floodplain and return back to the river the observed hydrological patterns in the floodplain could have been triggered by the agricultural expansion that has increased surface erodibility due to removals of primary vegetation and lowered the land surface elevation due to groundwater extraction despite the well known impacts of the hydropower dams on the mekong delta hydrological conditions particularly the reduction of sediment reaching the delta due to sediment trapping by dam reservoirs our observations point to new and more localized driving factors of sediment deficit in floodplain agricultural expansion finally we used 2d hydrodynamic simulation telemac 2d to visualize the processes of water routing and sedimentation in the floodplain accounting for land cover change since the 1980s the floodplain hydrology reported in this paper is an unexplored environmental consequence of agricultural expansion in the lower mekong geomorphologically this study presents a peculiar case of floodplain showing how agricultural expansion can diminish the role of a floodplain as a sediment sink through decreasing the trapping rate keywords floodplain sedimentation land use land cover change human impacts cambodia mekong 1 introduction along with rich water resources from the mekong river cambodia has been developing its economies around agriculture especially rice production exports currently 65 of the entire labour force in cambodia are engaged in rice production activities contributing approximately 25 to the national gross domestic product cramb et al 2020 however the nation s irrigation capacity is limited and has only been able to irrigate 10 of its rice crops the rainfed lowland rice is still the most common cultivation system cramb et al 2020 erban gorelick 2016 most cambodian rice crops therefore are grown between may and november with ample surface water resources evidently it is not the case for the dry season which pushes the farmers towards exploiting the groundwater resources sok choup 2017 as a result on site irrigation systems through sinking tube wells have been extensively used to draw groundwater to feed these rice fields during the dry seasons sok choup 2017 observed that more than 80 of the total groundwater extracted in cambodia has ended up fueling agricultural activities and the trend continues to rise over the years in the prey veng province for instance the number of tube wells for irrigation had grown from 1 600 to 25 000 in the last decade ide 2005 even though groundwater has been abundantly available in most areas of the lowland plains of cambodia especially around tonle sap lake promoting extensive groundwater use entails multiple environmental issues challenging the sustainable development of the region cramb et al 2020 for instance during the withdrawal pore spaces within subsurface materials are reduced causing the multiple layers of sediments to be compacted and ultimately lead to land subsidence erban et al 2014 one of the most notable evidence was reported by sok 2017 and chen et al 2019 in that excessive groundwater extraction around angkor wat could have been responsible for the sinking of this world heritage site poorly planned groundwater extraction could also intensify arsenic contamination via lowered water table erban et al 2013 winkel et al 2011 in the case of prey veng and svey rieng in cambodia being the focus of this study the drawdown exceeded the recharge rate and the overall decline in groundwater levels from 1996 to 2008 was critically remarkable johnston et al 2013 as a result the unplanned over exploitation of groundwater has triggered a series of environmental consequences this includes a declining water table which makes it harder and costlier to lift exacerbating land subsidence and arsenic contamination erban et al 2013 sok and choup 2017 winkel et al 2011 from the trans catchment perspective the water resources of these cambodian floodplains are also vulnerable to multiple external pressures among these the operation of upstream hydropower dams and the ever intensifying riverbed mining activities could directly affect the available water resources by reducing the chronicle inundation frequencies of the floodplains park et al 2020 park et al 2021a park et al 2021b such a decrease of the natural supply of water to the floodplains would consequently lead to the disruption of the livelihoods of millions of agricultural habitats and ultimately the regional food security e g binh et al 2020a eslami et al 2019 loc et al 2017 loc et al 2021a loc et al 2021b loc et al 2021c among others although the unfavourable outcomes from the proliferation of mechanized groundwater irrigation pumps have been well documented in previous studies either in the region erban et al 2013 erban gorelick 2016 or in the broader asia such as india or china e g shah et al 2007 what distinguishes the case of cambodian floodplains are the novel impacts of agricultural expansion driven extensive groundwater extraction on floodplain water and sediment budgets on the one hand the seasonal water extents and flood frequencies along the largest cambodian mekong floodplain close to phnom penh have constantly increased over the past few decades since the 1980s according to the data by pekel et al 2016 on the other hand the water levels and surface suspended sediment concentration sssc in the mekong river constantly exhibit decreasing trends in the respective period related to the upstream dam constructions and riverbed mining binh et al 2020b binh et al 2021 ng park 2021 such seemingly contradictory phenomena however could have been attributed to the enhanced water accommodation capacity of the floodplain as shown in fig 1 a because of the subsided land surfaces which is in turn caused by groundwater extraction and surface erosion interestingly in the beginning stages of our investigation section 3 1 we found that against the increased water fluxes into the floodplain and stationary sediment inflows the sediment storage i e the annual budget still decreases significantly over the same period of time we proceeded to hypothesize that it is the decline of surface roughness driven by the agricultural expansion that has significantly decreased the sediment trapping in the floodplain over recent years in this paper we aim to address this hydrological pattern in the largest floodplain in cambodian mekong and to identify the root cause of the phenomena we focused on this floodplain as a case study site because it is representative of a cultivated floodplain system in the cambodian mekong the floodplain has recently experienced agricultural expansion along with intensifying groundwater extraction and is also under direct impact of other environmental pressures regulating the river hydrology such as dams and sand mining we analyzed hydrological data water level and discharge at multiple gauge stations around the floodplain reconstructed time series sssc data at virtual gauge stations using field calibrated optical remote sensing data and then calculated water and sediment budgets agricultural expansion on the floodplain has been mapped since the early 1980s which is corroborated by groundwater level data over 17 monitoring wells since our analysis of floodplain water and sediment budgets is based on hydrological data in the mekong river main channel we incorporated results from two dimensional hydrodynamic simulation telemac 2d to visualize the floodplain water routing patterns and sedimentation processes accounting for the land cover changes during the studied periods 2 data and methods 2 1 hydrological data and trend analysis at gauge stations daily water level and discharge q data for the four stations along the lower mekong river in cambodia kampong cham kc chaktomuk cm prek kdam pk and neak luong nl from 1980 to 2020 were obtained from the mekong river commission mrc fig 1 these stations were chosen to calculate the water and sediment budget of the floodplain some of these stations had missing q records between 2002 and 2020 and for those cases daily q were estimated by the rating curves between water level and q kc is located around 10 km upstream from the inlet where the mekong water is transferred to the floodplain through channelized flow fig 1 nl is located around 5 km downstream from outlet1 the water export from the floodplain happens via outlet1 or outlet2 and there is no floodplain channel that connects the river and the floodplain between kc and nl verified through the maximum inundation area map by pekel et al 2016 both inlet and outlet are permanent channels that remain connected even during the dry season the tonle sap river connects the mekong river to the tonle sap lake the flow direction of the river is reversed seasonally toward the lake and river during wet and dry seasons respectively cm is located on the bassac river close to phnom penh first trends of hydrological time series were analyzed using the seasonal mann kendall s test mk at 95 confidence level a robust non parametric procedure in which kendall s tau with time as the covariate is computed by the user defined season helsel hirsch 1992 median slopes of all ranked seasonal regression slopes are used to estimate the slope for the trend s magnitude temporal autocorrelation was not accounted for because we examined the trends with the period of record mcbride 2005 we tested the time series at 95 confidence level and p values and kendall s tau are reported in section 3 hydrological data used in this study is summaried in table 1 2 2 calculating floodplain water budget floodplain water budget was computed using q data at the gauge stations and other hydrological variables i e rainfall evapotranspiration et rate and q at outlet2 using the following equation 1 seasonal w a t e r b u d g e t q kc q cm q nl q pk q o u t l e t 2 r a i n f a l l e t where qx denotes the mean monthly discharge at the station and qoutlet2 not a station is the discharge at outlet2 along the floodplain channel other than qkc and qnl along the mekong mainstream there are several other variables used in the annual water budget computation qcm representing the bassac river s discharge a distributary of the mekong which we subtracted from qkc qpk representing the discharge added to the floodplain water budget during the falling season when water flows from tonle sap to the mekong and vice versa during the rising season qoutlet2 is an atypically long meandering 90 km branch that merges back to the mekong main channel in vietnam close to the border qoutlet2 was estimated by the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp survey data that we obtained in 2017 along the vam nao channel a geomorphologically similar floodplain channel in the mekong delta located approximately 30 km downstream from the cambodian border this floodplain channel with outlet2 has the comparable sinuosity index 1 54 reach channel slope 6 5 cm km stability almost no migration was confirmed through visual inspection of google earth historical imagery during 1985 2019 and is constructed by similar fine sediment materials hackney et al 2020 hence we consider that the w d ratio of the two channels should be analogous manning s equation manning et al 1890 was used to estimate the flow velocity of the floodplain channel as follow 2 v r 2 3 s 1 2 n where r is a hydraulic radius estimated using mean width approximately 100 m measured from the 0 5 m resolution digital globe image and mean depth of the floodplain channel and s is the slope calculated from the adcp data at the vam nao channel daily total rainfall data from 1980 to 2020 at 5 km resolution is obtained from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 and then total monthly rainfall landed on the floodplain was calculated et in the lower mekong was obtained from zhou et al 2006 at 3 4 mm day averaged potential evapotranspiration over the lower mekong consumption of water by paddy is not included in the budget because it does not affect hydrological input or output in the floodplain rather it is partially accounted for in the et term 2 3 estimating suspended sediment concentration based on field survey data and the floodplain sediment budget sssc along the four virtual stations was estimated based on landsat data landsat 4 8 level 2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance product since 1987 at 30 m resolution was downloaded from usgs earth explorer a total of 647 images first we developed a reflectance sssc calibration model along the lower mekong two field measurements of the sssc in the mekong river were used for calibration 1 sssc data around phnom penh port ppp by lu et al 2014 collected between may 2008 to may 2011 n 32 and 2 sssc data along the mekong river in vietnam between tan chau and my thuan for location see park et al 2021 collected between december 2020 and january 2021 n 23 surface sediment was collected through surface water sampling using a 500 ml bottle filtered with the cellulose acetate membranes 0 45 μm and weighted after drying 24 h for the landsat data we used the red band centred around 0 655 μm which is constantly sensitive to the level of surface sediment concentration in inland turbid waters doxaran et al 2002 park and latrubesse 2014 a 7 7 pixel mask centered on the field measurement site was delineated and median reflectance was computed after filtering out outlier pixels i e greater than 2 standard deviations to minimize the sensor noise the remaining qualified pixels were used to build a regression model in which the slope is statistically significant at 95 confidence level fig 2 using this field calibrated reflectance sssc model sssc time series since 1978 were estimated over the four virtual stations 529 n 1 308 here we consider that most qs that we calculate in this study is dominantly washload composed of mostly silt and clay as verified by hackney et al 2020 and our own field survey data 2 sand fig 2b estimated sssc was incorporated with q data to estimate the sediment fluxes qs at each four stations as below 3 qs sssc t q t k where sssct and qt denotes sssc and q on a specific date t while k is a conversion factor the seasonal sediment budget of the floodplain was then calculated by the following equation 4 seasonal s e d i m e n t b u d g e t qs kc qs cm qs nl qs pk qs o u t l e t 2 where qsx denotes the annual qs at the station x we verified through visual inspection of high resolution images in google earth that there is no additional sediment input or output for the floodplain other than the fluxes through identified inlet or outlet in this study 2 4 mapping agricultural expansion and dry season ndvi using landsat data land use and land cover change over the floodplain since the 1970s has been mapped based on landsat data at 30 m on the google earth engine gee cloud based platform we used level 1 terrain precision l1tp calibrated top of atmosphere toa reflectance image path 126 and row 52 that has been corrected for the atmospheric effects through the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps masek et al 2012 images with cloud cover and the shadows exceeding 25 were masked out random forest after generating a classifier trees based on bootstrapped samples of training data within each image breiman 1999 was used to classify the pixels into five classes water natural vegetation bare paddy green paddy and urban classes defined by local expert knowledge based on the same landsat product on gee dry season normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used to identify vegetation growth and from there we made inferences to groundwater extraction activities ndvi is defined as follows 5 ndvi n i r r e d n i r r e d while nir and red denote near infrared and red bands respectively since the positive ndvi values represent green vegetation from grassland to dense forest toward 1 we computed the average value over the floodplain during the dry season december may since the 1980s the reasoning for this is that since double cropping is a predominant agricultural practice in this part of cambodia ear et al 2017 irra 2010 farmers exploit groundwater to irrigate crops during the dry season fao 2015 when floodplain recharges from both limited rainfall and the low mekong water inflow ear et al 2017 irra 2010 kwak et al 2015 without exploiting groundwater resources in the dry season when both the meteorological and fluvial hydrological inputs are limited most of the floodplain land should have remained dry barren land and dry soil that normally yields lower ndvi values i e ndvi 0 2 5 groundwater level trend examination and field controls the groundwater data level used in this study was provided by the international development enterprises ide provincial scale data of groundwater usage total extraction rates and out of domestic usage has been supplied from sok choup 2017 in this study we considered groundwater level data from 17 wells mostly within the prey veng and kandal provinces of which the groundwater level data were measured once per month from 1996 to 2008 see section 3 2 for location using the groundwater level decline rates from the monitoring wells measured relatively well distributed across the study area we created a heatmap via ordinary kriging to signify the spatial patterns of groundwater level declines for illustration purpose monthly water level time series from two wells p 24 measured and p 15 estimated from the ratio between p 24 obtained from the interpolated map are plotted to verify the temporal change of groundwater level we employed the mann kendall test as described above lastly photo documentary evidence showing the consequences of the groundwater extraction in the study area such as land subsidence was collected from various sources online in khmer keywords used 2 6 2d hydrodynamic modelling of floodplain sedimentation we used a coupled telemac 2d and sisyphe model of the telemac mascaret system to simulate spatial distribution patterns of sedimentation in the floodplain the telemac 2d model is used to simulate hydrodynamics solving the depth averaged saint venant equations while the sisyphe model villaret 2010 villaret et al 2013 simulates sediment transport and bed evolution by solving a two dimensional advection diffusion and the exner equations as below exner 1920 exner 1925 pablo 2018 6 h c t h u c x h v c y x h ε s c x y h ε s c y e d where c is the depth averaged concentration volume u and v are the depth averaged velocities in x and y directions m s respectively ε s is the turbulent diffusivity of the sediment related to the eddy viscosity ε s ν t σ c σ c is the schmidt number 1 0 ω s is settling velocity cm s e and d are the erosion and deposition rates respectively which are estimated by the equation below for bed elevation 7 1 λ z b t e d 0 where λ is the bed porosity z b is the bed level m in the advection diffusion equations only suspended sediment is considered because sediment in the floodplain is mainly transported in the suspension mode hung et al 2014 also bedload contributes only 1 3 of the total load in the lower mekong in cambodia hackney et al 2020 we internally coupled the telemac 2d model with the sisyphe model by which hydrodynamic parameters solved by the telemac 2d model are sent to the sisyphe model to estimate bed evolution the updated bed elevations are sent back into the telemac 2d model to repeat the simulation cycles during the flood season june to november the channelized flows from the mekong river to the floodplain via the inlet fig 1 is the dominant source of the floodplain water and sediment budgets an unstructured triangle mesh of 300 m was generated by a finite element method totalling approximately 53 000 elements we imposed daily discharge and sssc at the upstream boundary i e the floodplain inlet and free flow and sediment at the downstream boundary i e the outlet1 the model was calibrated and validated against the flood data june november in 2000 representing one of the most extreme floods that occurred during the investigated period we performed a hot start simulation which was simulated for seven days using constant discharge and sssc at the boundaries to obtain a steady condition then the results were used as initial conditions for the main simulations the floodplain geometry was obtained from the multi error removed improved terrain merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 where the elevation of the alluvial plain part of the floodplain excluding uplands ranged mostly from 1 to 12 m above egm96 reference geoid including floodplain ridges the model was calibrated by tuning various parameters including friction coefficient velocity diffusivity 10 6 m s for the telemac 2d model critical shear stress for erosion 0 15 n m2 critical shear velocity for deposition 0 03 m s settling velocity 6 6x10 5 m s and krone partheniades erosion constant 1 10 6 kg s m2 for the sisyphe model the initial distribution of the manning coefficient n was estimated from the 2000 land use map using the method described by acrement 1989 the landsat derived sssc values at 30 random locations within the floodplain were compared to the simulated values to evaluate the model performance validation the goodness of the model was assessed by the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse after that we simulated sedimentation in the floodplain driven by land use change from 1995 to 2015 by changing the manning coefficient accordingly lastly the simulated volume of sediment deposited in the floodplain each year is compared with the sediment budget in mass tons using the porosity of silt and clay 3 results and discussion 3 1 trends of floodplain water and sediment budgets we first assessed the trends of discharge wl and sssc at the two stations kc and nl inlet and outlet respectively when computing the water and sediment budgets of the floodplain in the next section we used mainly these two inlet outlet stations because there are no river floodplain hydrological interactions along the mekong reach between kc and nl confirmed through visual inspections of the global surface water explorer s maximum inundation layer during the past 40 years pekel et al 2016 floodplain has only one inlet that is close to kc 10 km downstream from kc the floodplain channel permanently connects the river with the floodplain and has 40 m width on average close to the inlet fig 1a therefore the mekong river s wl and q around the inlet determines the amount of hydrological input fluxes entering the floodplain prior to 2000 daily q and wl at kc showed a relatively consistent trend without a change after the mk test p value 0 22 for wl however q and wl showed a decreasing trend after 2000 p value 0 01 the mean annual water level has decreased from 6 94 pre 2000 to 6 56 m post 2000 this might be related to the operation of the dams in the mekong upstream as most of them were built after 2000 11 out of 12 on the main channel with many more planned to be built in the near future in the upstream reaches from cambodia hecht et al 2019 latrubesse et al 2020 the impact of the upstream dams is also evident in surface suspended sediment concentration time series estimated at kc fig 3 e showing a decreasing trend p value 0 01 when compared pre dam with post dam the monthly averaged sssc decreased from 70 3 to 60 6 mg l at kc fig 3h approximately a 14 decrease in summary q wl and sssc at kc all showed a decreasing trend since the 1980s which could have been attributed to the upstream dam construction and operation activities the daily discharge observed at the outlet station nl on the other hand showed no significant trends overall when assessed over the 40 years 1980 2020 p value 0 07 however a decreasing trend in wl is present when the time series is divided into two periods before vs after 2000 p value 0 01 in the case of nl we attribute the trend mainly to not only the upstream dams but also the aggressive riverbed mining activities taking place in this area which is not as much in the case of kc however it should be noted that it is very challenging to provide clear evidence of the dam due to the complex hydrological interactions of the mekong river with the tonle sap lake that largely alters the mekong s hydrology downstream of ppp kummu et al 2014 rather we speculate that the impact of riverbed mining around the reach between ppp and nl could have more significantly affected the observed decreasing trend of wl after 2000 this reach is one of the most intensively mined area in the mekong river hackney et al 2020 ng park 2021 since the effect of riverbed mining is localized dredging may result in the incision of the riverbed which lowers the water level without drastically altering the q at the same place as observed in the mekong delta park et al 2020 sssc also decreased substantially since 1987 at nl p value 0 01 from a mean annual average of 53 1 to 47 2 mg l 12 decrease before and after 2000 respectively the floodplain annual water budget calculated using eq 1 in section 2 2 was analyzed qoutlet2 representing the annual water loss through this floodplain channel was estimated to be almost negligible 40 m3 s mean annual discharge which is 1 of the mean annual discharge of the mekong at nl the total annual rainfall was computed to be 2 65x109 m3 on an inter annual average the annual water budget over the investigated period 1980 2020 was around 31 4x103m3 with the highest and lowest of 83 1 x103m3 and 3 27x103m3 observed in 1983 and 2002 respectively the overall increasing trend since 1980 was statistically significant p value 0 01 and sen s slope 0 0137 given that the wls at the floodplain inlet as well as in the outlet decreased significantly particularly after 2000 fig 3d which should have decreased the river floodplain connectivity and the floodplain recharge through the inlet it is remarkable to observe that the floodplain water budget has increased over time looking at the seasonal distribution of the floodplain water storage a good part of the annual water storage happens during the rising season when the floodplain has been recharged with the river water fig 4 b approximately 91 and 84 of the annual water budget i e 25 and 39x103m3 volume have been stored during the four months july to october for the periods the 1980s and the 2010s respectively comparing these two periods most of the months presented an increased water monthly budget with the highest increases of 6 9 103 m3 and 3 7 103 m3 observed in july and august respectively fig 4b we also took notice that although the floodplain s annual water budget has increased since the 1980s the annual sediment inputs from the mekong river to the floodplain in the same period does not exhibit any significant trends of shifts as shown in fig 4c this is likely due to the dam induced decrease of sssc in the mekong river around kc that has offset the effect of increased floodplain water recharge despite some outliers such as the exceptionally high values associated with 2002 and 2005 and the low values in 1998 the overall inter annual average remained around 3x106t without any significant trends p value 0 19 the comparison of the annual sediment inflows between the earliest and the latest investigated decades the 1980s vs 2020s reveals a slightly decreasing trend of 0 45 and 0 19x106t during the months of july and august when the water level at the mekong is at its peak however the mean monthly inflows of the two decades remained relatively similar i e 0 49 to 0 41x106t fig 4d likewise to the annual water budget floodplain sediment input from the mekong has substantially concentrated during the rising season particularly close to the peak water stages in the mekong river around july to september intriguingly against the stationary trend of the floodplain sediment inflows even though discharge has increased over the same period the annual floodplain sediment budget has significantly decreased 1988 2020 p value 0 01 as revealed in fig 4e more specifically the average sediment budget before 2000 was 2 1x106t while it decreased by approximately 30 to 1 46x106t 2010 2020 phasing with the sediment inflows most of the sedimentation in the floodplain occurred close to the peak stage around august and september on an inter annual average fig 4f finally the sediment trapping rate of the floodplain showed a clear decreasing trend during the investigated period ranging from 98 1991 to around 23 2010 this indicates that the role of the floodplain as a sediment sink has been diminishing gradually over the past 40 years and that a substantial portion of the mekong s sediment entering the floodplain currently flows back to the river through the outlets we would like to remark that the observed decreasing patterns of floodplain sediment budget occurred while the floodplain sediment inflows have not considerably changed over the same period since the 1980s this incongruous behaviour of the floodplain seems to be enabled through the gradual decrease of the trapping rate in the floodplain in which the causes are discussed in the next section 3 2 floodplain hydrology and agricultural expansion there are many other possible causes for the incongruous hydrological developments presented in this paper yet here we focus on only one anthropogenic activity more specifically we could have associated the increased annual water budget in the floodplain with the agricultural expansion in the floodplain for a couple of reasons first since the 1980s the floodplain has experienced drastic land use change paddy field area has increased approximately 300 from 457 to 1 381 km2 out of around 2 200 km2 total floodplain area while the natural vegetation cover has decreased from 861 to 343 km2 approximately 39 fig 1d and e and fig 5 a and b the area of the seasonally flooded land in the floodplain has also increased from 1 878 1985 1995 to 2 238 1996 2020 km2 based on the data by pekel et al 2016 fig 1 a and b second most of the increased newly generated seasonally flooding parts of the floodplain are irrigated farmlands that have been converted from the natural vegetation forest and shrubs overall the mean annual water extent has drastically increased in the floodplain since the 1980s p value 0 01 and r2 0 4 fig 1c combining this water extent time series with the floodplain water budget volume we roughly estimated the mean depth of the flooding during the peak stage we used the annual water extent maxima and monthly water budget for august and september from fig 4b and estimated the mean depth using water volume in m3 divided by area in m2 for the 1980s and 2000s as 0 82 and 1 64 m respectively indicating the increase in the flood water depth over time here we remark on the two key drivers for the floodwater depth increase in the floodplain surface erosion and land subsidence the floodplain has also experienced a rapid expansion of the paddy fields fig 5b similar trends were also observed around the tonlé sap region where naturally forested areas have been rapidly converted to paddy fields for rice cultivation to fuel the country s economic development kc et al 2019 evidently such rapid intensification of agriculture came with a hefty price several pristine landscapes including the indigenous vegetated areas of the floodplain as shown in fig 5e have been compromised hydrologically the non heterogeneous paddies are much smoother than the naturally rugged vegetated landscapes hence the larger velocity of the overland flows of the former condition the conversion of landscape as such in turn implies a duo impact i bypassing sediments originating from upstream now have a smaller chance of settling in the floodplain and ii erosion topsoil that originated from the vegetated landscape will be eroded fig 5c provides an example of the surface erosion in the kandal stung district kandal province this was also verified by our modelling results presented in the next section another cause is the land subsidence due to intensive groundwater extraction which is the widely recognized issue across cambodia chen et al 2019 erban et al 2014 minderhoud et al 2018 provinces around mekong river close to ppp where the nation s population is concentrated such as phnom penh kandal and prey veng dependency on the groundwater usage mainly for agriculture and domestic purposes such as drinking or cooking is substantial with typical extraction rates over 35 000 m3 per day in each province data from the 1990s and 2000s fig 6 a in these provinces groundwater comprises over 90 of the total domestic water use fig 6b in our study area kandal province double cropping is a widely adapted agricultural practice where farmers exploit groundwater to irrigate crops mostly paddy fields during the dry season when floodplain recharges from both the rainfall and the mekong water is limited irra 2010 kwak et al 2015 ear et al 2017 ndvi time series mapped during the dry season also shows an increasing trend since 1978 p value 0 01 and r2 0 32 fig 6d indicating that the irrigation for the dry season cropping in the floodplain has been intensified over time the groundwater level time series from the two monitoring p 24 and p 15 1996 2008 wells in the province also showed a significant decreasing trend of 51 and 49 cm year respectively this could have served as a proxy of the land subsidence due to the soil compaction fig 6e in fact the groundwater drawdown rates are exceeding the natural compaction rate of soil and comparable to the upper limits of anthropogenic driven groundwater level decrease observed throughout the indochina peninsular for example groundwater level declines between 2 5 and 50 cm year in hanoi and 30 cm year in the vietnamese mekong delta erban et al 2014 tam and nga 2018 we also present field observations of surface sinking in the kandal that relative level of ground has subsided after intensive groundwater drawdown fig 5d in summary it is evident that the floodplain land has been lowered mainly due to the dry season irrigation driven by the agricultural expansion in the floodplain as well as surface erosion in the recent decades we consider that agricultural expansion driven lowering of the floodplain landscape due to surface erosion and land subsidence has increased the floodplain s seasonal water storage although the sssc in the mekong has decreased over time floodplain sediment recharge remained stationary ironically the annual floodplain sediment budget has decreased which can be explained only by the decrease in the trapping rate currently the floodplain traps about 40 after 2010 of the sediment entering the floodplain and the lowest rate around 23 was observed in 2010 this rate used to be around 65 in the late 1980s the floodplain is changing into a sediment bypassing system instead of an efficient sink we conclude that the floodplain trapping rate has been affected dramatically by the land cover change in the floodplain which altered the surface roughness controlling the flow resistance and sedimentation large scale conversion of natural and pioneer vegetation to paddy fields or other low lying crops in the floodplain should have considerably reduced the roughness of the terrain by hampering settlement of the sediment from the river 3 3 floodplain sedimentation patterns and hydraulic impacts on inundation dynamics although the budgetary approach adopted in this study was mostly based on the river gauge stations data the patterns of sedimentation within the floodplain remain unknown to quantitatively assess the sedimentation patterns in the floodplain under different terrain roughness conditions that has been described in section 3 2 here we show hydrodynamic simulation results first we show the validation result of the model set up we compared the sssc map simulated over the floodplain in the three distinct phases rising peak and falling stages in 2000 to the sssc time series estimated from field calibrated landsat images i e observed fig 7 out of 30 randomly distributed validation points landsat driven sssc maps yielded at least 25 sample points to validate after filtering out the cloud shadow and other unqualified pixels the validation results yielded the average rmse of 28 9 mg l without a notable seasonal dependency fig 7b the rmse indicates a reasonably good performance of the hydrodynamic simulation as it is lower than 10 of the total sssc variability across the floodplain ranging from 30 to 400 mg l likewise an average r2 across the seasons also yielded a satisfactory value of 0 73 with the highest 0 76 and the lowest 0 68 fits during peak and falling seasons respectively when the river water enters the floodplain through the floodplain channel via an inlet it seems that the sedimentation along the floodplain channel is not high 0 5 cm year fig 8 this is perhaps due to the limited vertical aggradation capacity of the floodplain channel associated with the recent decrease in sssc and the lowering of water level in the mekong river around kc fig 3 the levee height of the floodplain channel seems low as inferred from the observation that every season they are fully covered by water during the peak flood stage observation from pekel et al 2016 the floodplain landscape is also generally flat average slope 4 cm km with rounded lakes and extensive paddy fields that are hydrologically well connected through small medium sized irrigation canals these canals act as a conveyor to transport sediment throughout the floodplain and to the distal parts of the floodplain during the flood season therefore the sedimentation rate seems to be not in phase with the distance to the channel due to well developed channelized connections as opposed to the other typical flood pulse system junk et al 1989 similar floodplain internal connectivity patterns have been observed in other pristine floodplain lakes that due to channelized network in the floodplain routing of the river flood water presents intricate network patterns park latrubesse 2017 the spatial distribution of sedimentation in the floodplain is heterogeneous the rates range from nearly 0 up to around 8 cm year in the case of large rounded lakes developed through continuous overbank dispersion from the floodplain channel they are concentrated in the western part of the floodplain and can have about 3 cm year of sedimentation on average these lakes are proximal to the river but indirectly receive water from the mekong via the floodplain channel that starts from the inlet overall the sedimentation rate for a good part of the floodplain more than 80 area showed 0 4 cm year and sedimentation hotspots correlate with the location of the rounded lakes locally depressed along the floodplain channel in other large rivers they are called impeded floodplain lakes and have been described as important sediment sinks within floodplain park 2020 park latrubesse 2019 it is assumed that most of the deposited materials are fine cohesive sediments washload which are exhaustively sourced from the river our grain size distribution analysis results at the lower reach of the mekong also indicated that suspended sediment is mostly silty and clay materials and 5 of the sandy fractions fig 2 given that the freeboard of the mekong at kc is 10 m and the exponentially decaying nature of the sandy sediment concentration as it gets toward the river surface it is not likely that suspended sandy loads enters the floodplain even during the flood mean depth and velocity of the mekong around kc during flood season were 20 m and 1 5 m3 s respectively hackney et al 2020 impacts of land cover change on sedimentation rate on floodplain was remarkable shown from our simulation results of the floodplain sedimentation over the five different years 1995 to 2015 with 5 years interval fig 8 along with the agricultural expansion overall sedimentation rates across the floodplain decreased with the pronounced decrease observed around the rounded lakes in the western fringe we consider that though a similar amount of sediment fluxes enters the floodplain on inter annual average fig 4c the floodplain cover has gradually lost the capacity to trap sediment due to the decreased terrain roughness therefore it is assumed that currently these rounded lakes efficiently export sediments mostly during the peak and falling seasons our modelled sedimentation rates showed a decreasing trend from 2 11 1995 to 0 68 cm year 2015 on average which translates into the sediment deposited mass of 4 21 and 1 36 mt respectively when converted to the volume using an aggregate density of 1 6 t m3 binh et al 2020a they were 2 63 and 0 85 mm3 which are almost in agreement with the volume estimated for the period before 1995 2 75x106 m3 and after 2015 1 23x106 m3 through the budgetary approach fig 4e and f a slight discrepancy of the modelled budget from the budget estimated from gauge stations can be related to the morphological complexity of the floodplain landscape for example we could not incorporate the land subsidence factor in the hydrodynamic simulation due to the lack of a subsidence map in the follow up study we expect to generate a subsidence map using interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar which can be used to improve the hydrodynamic simulation accuracy 4 summary and final remarks in this paper we address the patterns of floodplain water and sediment budget in the floodplain of the mekong based in cambodia over the past 40 years both the surface suspended sediment concentration and water level in the mekong river decreased due to upstream dam constructions and intensive riverbed mining however floodplain seasonal water storage increased for the same period and the rate of sediment input from the river is almost constant during the study period the annual sediment budget of the floodplain however significantly decreased during the same period mainly due to the reduced sediment trapping rate from 66 in the 1980s to 46 in the 2010s and a good part of sediment entering the floodplain currently bypass it and enters back into the river we conclude that this observed paradox was enabled by the agricultural expansion in the floodplain that increased erodibility of the surface and lowered the land we expect the findings of our paper are of scientific significance in multiple aspects firstly connecting agricultural expansion with the alterations of floodplain s water and sediment budget constitutes an unexplored environmental consequence of human activities in the lower mekong river secondly the hydrological patterns of a large lowland floodplain described in this study has never been reported before or elsewhere in the world whereby three different hydro geomorphological processes happen simultaneously 1 increased water budget 2 constant sediment inflows and 3 decreased sediment budget lastly this study was able to contribute novel insight into understanding the sediment balance situation along the broader mekong river we speculate that lowered sediment trapping in the cambodian floodplain might have partially contributed to alleviating the sediment deficit downstream at the vietnam mekong delta however such floodplains while losing one of their most fundamental functions as sinks of sediments cannot evolve geomorphologically thus would remain incomplete indefinitely credit authorship contribution statement edward park conceptualization funding

3708,we describe an adaptive extension of the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter for conditional bias cb aware data assimilation da and comparatively evaluate with the ensemble kalman filter enkf for 6 headwater basins in texas using the operational lumped hydrologic models from the national weather service we then use cb aware da and the degrees of freedom for signal to assess the marginal information content of observations we show that cb arises very frequently in varying magnitudes when assimilating streamflow observations during the catchment s response to precipitation and subsequent drainage and that in general larger discharges are associated with larger cb cb aware da improves over enkf by varying margins in times of significant flow and the improvement is particularly large during sharp rises of the outlet hydrograph with large peak flows for the 6 study basins the average relative reduction in root mean square error of the ensemble mean streamflow analysis by cb aware da over enkf is 31 5 for all ranges of observed flow and 32 1 for observed flow exceeding 200 cms the flow dependent marginal information content of the observations varies very significantly with the streamflow response of the catchment and the magnitude of cb and tends to decrease and increase in the rising and falling phases of the hydrograph respectively the findings indicate that cb aware da with information content analysis offers an objective framework for dynamically balancing the predictive skill of hydrologic models quality and frequency of hydrologic observation and scheduling of da cycles toward improving operational flood forecasting cost effectively keywords flood forecasting data assimilation streamflow conditional bias information content 1 introduction data assimilation da is widely used to reduce uncertainty in the initial conditions ic of the prediction models by fusing the actual and model predicted observations kitanidis and bras 1978 evensen 1994 georgakakos and sperflage 1995 evensen and van leeuwen 2000 moradkhani et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 reichle 2008 liu et al 2012 for cost effective observation and da operation however it is necessary to consider not only the da method but also the flow dependent information content of the observations for example an additional streamflow observation at the base of the rising limb of an unfolding hydrograph has a larger marginal information content than one at the lower recession limb it is hence desirable to make more frequent observations of streamflow in the early rise phase of the streamflow response and schedule the da cycles accordingly in the context of da the marginal information content of observations may be expressed in terms of the reduction in uncertainty in the ics due to da relative to that without da if the assimilation completely eliminates the uncertainty in the ics as in the case of perfect observation the marginal information content of the observation is 100 if it does not reduce the uncertainty at all as in the case of infinitely large observation uncertainty or a combination of non informative model prediction and very large observation uncertainty the observation has no marginal information content for optimal information fusion operation of observing systems and da operation it is hence important that the da method be able to quantify the predictive uncertainty as accurately as possible at their core almost all da methods are based on least squares minimization jazwinski 1970 miller et al 1999 li and navon 2001 lewis et al 2006 tabeart et al 2018 tian et al 2018 therefore when observations are made with significant uncertainties they are subject to conditional bias cb which often leads to under and over prediction of the predictand over the upper and lower tails respectively fuller 1987 seber et al 1989 hughes 1993 frost and thompson 2000 accounting for cb in da is hence a very important consideration for prediction of extremes such as floods and droughts to address the adverse impact of cb in da lee et al 2019 proposed the cb penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf which minimizes a linearly weighted sum of error variance and variance of type ii error jolliffe and stephenson 2003 wilks 2011 cb may be differentiated into type i and type ii type i cb defined as e x x x x is associated with false alarm where x x and x denote the unknown truth the estimate and the realization of x respectively jolliffe and stephenson 2003 type ii cb defined as e x x x x is associated with failure to detect the event whereas type i cb can be reduced by calibration type 2 cb cannot wilks 2011 seo 2013 lee et al 2019 showed that cbenkf significantly improves over enkf for prediction of high flows the improvement is in both reliability and resolution jolliffe and stephenson 2003 wilks 2011 and the margin of improvement over enkf is larger for larger events these findings are consistent with those from the family of techniques based on cb penalized optimal estimation seo 2013 shen et al 2019 such as cb penalized kriging brown and seo 2013 seo 2013 seo et al 2014 kim et al 2018 jozaghi et al 2019 cb penalized kalman filter cbpkf seo et al 2018a 2018b shen et al 2019 and cb penalized linear regression kim et al 2014 jozaghi et al 2021 several remedies have been studied in hydrology to alleviate the limitations of the conventional kalman filter kf in the presence of large model or observation errors the bias aware kf is applied to correct model and observation biases by updating the conditional mean and bias separately drécourt et al 2006 rasmussen et al 2016 ridler et al 2018 the variance inflation techniques are introduced to tackle underestimation of variance in enkf when using a limited ensemble size it is found that variance inflation could reduce model biases by adjusting ensemble spread during the analysis step multiple studies in soil hydrology reported improved results by employing the inflation methods bauser et al 2018 jamal and linker 2020 while bias aware filters and variance inflation use additional steps to the conventional filters to ameliorate their limitations the cbpkf uses the kf like recursive form of the fisher like solution resulting from co minimizing error variance and variance of the type ii error shen et al 2019 in the cb penalized techniques the largest additional source of uncertainty and potential subjectivity is the scalar weight for the cb penalty α see eq 1 in section 3 the premise of adaptive cbenkf is that by significantly reducing the parametric uncertainty in α one may quantify more accurately the marginal information content of the observations which in turn improves the da aided analysis and prediction particularly when the hydrologic system is in extreme states in this paper we describe adaptive cbenkf comparatively evaluate it with enkf and assess the flow dependent information content in relation to the streamflow response to precipitation at the catchment scale for quantification of marginal information content we use the degrees of freedom for signal dfs rodgers 2000 zupanski et al 2007 which may be considered as a skill score for information fusion the new and significant contributions of this paper are development of cb aware da in the form of adaptive cbenkf for assimilation of streamflow observations comparative evaluation of adaptive cbenkf with enkf under varying levels of hydrologic uncertainty modeling and advances in understanding of flow dependent information content in hydrologic observations and its temporal vatiation in relation to streamflow response to precipitation at the catchment scale this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrologic models streamflow and precipitation data and basins used for the study section 3 describes cbenkf and the control vector flow dependent information content the adaptive extension of cbenkf and uncertainty modeling section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 provides the conclusions 2 models data and basins used in this section we describe the hydrologic models the forcings and streamflow data and the basins used in this study they were also used in a number of previous studies of hydrologic modeling and da seo et al 2009 lee et al 2012 2016 2019 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 as such we limit the descriptions only to those that are essential to the development of this paper 2 1 hydrologic models used we used the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac burnash et al 1973 for rainfall runoff modeling and the unit hydrograph uh chow et al 1988 for runoff routing they represent the long standing hydrologic models used for headwater basins at the river forecast centers of the national weather service nws for operational hydrologic forecasting the sac inputs mean areal precipitation map and mean areal potential evapotranspiration mape and outputs the total channel inflow tci which represents the sum of surface and subsurface runoffs into the channels in this work we assume clairvoyant forcing forecasts and use the observed map and mape for future input as well in this way the impact of da on hydrologic uncertainty may be clearly assessed the sac is a conceptual soil moisture accounting model and uses two layers of soil storages in the upper and lower zones to model soil water balance in the vertical surface runoff includes both fast and slow runoffs fast runoff consists of the rainfall intensity dependent surface runoff from the unsaturated area direct runoff from the saturated area and impervious runoff from the impervious area slow runoff processes produce interflow supplemental baseflow and primary baseflow burnash et al 1973 the uh model which inputs the tci and outputs discharge at the catchment outlet is used to route the runoff to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the basin the objective of da in this work is to reduce the hydrologic ic uncertainty as such it is important to reduce other sources of error such as systematic biases in the observed forcings systematic timing errors and model parametric uncertainties in this way one may clearly ascertain the effectiveness of da for reducing the ic uncertainty in this work we used hourly map given the flashiness and relatively short response time of the study basins for mape we used climatological mean values adjusted via calibration before being input to sac typically the observed forcings of map and mape are adjusted for long term biases via multiplicative correction factors in this work we used the adjoint based optimizer ab opt seo et al 2009 to estimate the adjustment factors as well as to derive the empirical uh and to refine the sac parameters the ab opt uses variational assimilation to estimate the adjustment factors and empirical uh and the stepwise line search kuzmin et al 2008 to refine the sac parameters 2 2 data used the observations assimilated are map mape and streamflow the map observations are from the multisensor precipitation estimator fulton et al 1998 seo 1998 seo et al 1999 2010 young et al 2000 produced operationally by the nws west gulf river forecast center wgrfc for mape the monthly climatology of daily estimates was disaggregated to hourly estimates based on the diurnal cycle of solar radiation because the da cycles consist only of the periods of significant flow potential evapotranspiration does not play an important role hence the lack of dynamically varying mape does not impact the outcome in any significant way for assimilation and validation we used the us geological survey s hourly streamflow data at the catchment outlet because our focus is on flood forecasting we identified only the significant events from the observed streamflow data and used the resulting partial duration time series a significant event is defined as a hydrograph whose peak flow exceeds 100 m3 s once an event is identified the beginning and ending hours of the event were determined by subtracting and adding 72 hrs from and to the first and last hours of the partial duration exceeding 100 m3 s respectively the choice of 72 hrs is made to include most of the significant portions of the primary baseflow response in the assimilation process 2 3 basins used a total of 6 basins was used in the wgrfc s service area dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 see fig 1 for location and table 1 for hydroclimatological attributes in table 1 the dryness index di is defined as the ratio of mean mape to mean map budyko 1974 a value of di greater and less than unity indicates the catchment is water and energy limited respectively the study basins are part of the wgrfc da testbed which includes a group of 23 basins identified as particularly challenging for operational streamflow forecasting the testbed has been previously used by the authors and their collaborators for hydrologic da and related research seo et al 2009 liu et al 2011 lee et al 2012 2016 2019 rafieeinasab et al 2014 noh et al 2018 the 6 basins used in this work are located along the longitudinal line of mean annual precipitation of approximately 1 000 mm due to the strong east to west gradient in precipitation climatology and the influence of the gulf of mexico significant hydroclimatological variations exist among the basins ranging from semi arid to humid providing a degree of diversity see fig 1 table 1 streamflow forecasting is generally more challenging for more arid basins due to the quicker catchment response larger uncertainties in the ics generally larger structural uncertainties due to unmodeled processes such as infiltration into dry channel beds and larger parametric uncertainties due to the above factors and the limited number of large events available for calibration alizadeh et al 2020 in addition the large spatio temporal variability of precipitation from convective events adds uncertainty in lumped modelling particularly for large basins smith et al 2004 hence the study basins collectively offer a rather challenging test for streamflow da in addition to the hydroclimatological variations we also considered the size of the basins as explained below given the hydrologic models observations and da method used the potency of da depends primarily on the memory of the hydrologic system alizadeh et al 2020 in general the larger the storage of surface and subsurface water is the larger the streamflow predictability is streams in semi arid basins may be ephemeral due to intermittent soil water in some of the storages resulting in significantly smaller predictability accordingly one may expect the potential gains from da to be relatively small for small urban basins or semi arid basins even though they may be relatively large in size for this reason we chose larger basins in the 23 basin testbed even though they are less likely to satisfy the uh assumptions chow et al 1988 liu et al 2011 3 methods used in this section we describe adaptive cbenkf and how flow dependent marginal information content is assessed using dfs the technical details of cbenkf are not central to the development of this work for a complete mathematical and algorithmic description of cbenkf the reader is referred to lee et al 2019 for a complete derivation of cbpkf the reader is referred to seo et al 2018a 2018b and shen et al 2019 for the simpler and computationally less expensive approximation of cbpkf via variance inflated kf which is used in this work the reader is referred to shen et al 2019 for details on optimization of α using the newton s method the reader is referred to seo et al 2021 3 1 cbenkf and formulation of control vector cbenkf lee et al 2019 is an ensemble extension of cbpkf seo et al 2018a 2018b and is completely analogous to what enkf evensen 1994 lorentzen and naevdal 2011 is to kf kalman 1960 whereas kf minimizes error variance only cbpkf minimizes a linearly weighted sum of error variance and variance of the type ii error 1 σ k e x k x k x k x k t α e x k e x k x k x k e x k x k t where x k denotes the vector of the estimated states the first and second terms represent the error covariance and the cb penalty respectively and α denotes the scalar weight for the latter if α 0 the cbpkf and cbenkf reduce to kf and enkf respectively in the context of linear regression the weight may be considered analogous to the tuning parameter λ in tikhonov regularization tikhonov and arsenin 1977 tikhonov et al 1995 or ridge regression hoerl 1962 hoerl and kennard 1970 or its l 1 version the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator lasso tibshirani 1996 1997 although the nature of the penalty is very different jozaghi et al 2021 the cbenkf and enkf are applied in this work as sequential assimilators but using the fixed lag smoother formulation lee et al 2019 the size of the fixed lag or the assimilation window see fig 2 is chosen to be the same as the length of the uh fig 3 shows the empirical uhs for all 6 basins whose durations are 39 80 67 98 96 and 54 hrs for djct2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 respectively in this way the time lag between the runoff generation at the most upstream areas of the catchment and the resulting flow at the basin outlet is captured in the da process seo et al 2009 rafieeinasab et al 2014 the motivation for the fixed lag smoother approximation as opposed to using an explicit smoother formulation evensen and van leeuwen 2000 is to handle both cold and warm restarts with a clearly identifiable assimilation window for possible human forecaster supervised operation seo et al 2009 as with any models hydrologic prediction using sac uh is subject to various sources of uncertainty because map is a spatially averaged quantity purely random errors tend to cancel out whereas systematic errors do not to address time varying biases in the forcings we include in the control i e state vector x k in eq 1 the multiplicative adjustment factors to map and mape x k p and x k e respectively we assume that l n x k p and l n x k e are normally distributed and autoregressive 1 ar 1 smith and krajewski 1991 anagnostou and krajewski 1999 seo et al 1999 2 lx k p φ p lx k 1 p w p 3 lx k e φ e lx k 1 e w e where lx k p and lx k e denote l n x k p and l n x k e respectively φ p and φ e denote lag 1 autocorrelation for l n x k p and l n x k e respectively and w p and w e denote the white noise for the respective ar 1 models the sac soil moisture states are conceptual quantities which may also be expressed as volumetric soil water contents lee et al 2011 koren et al 2014 in reality soil water is seldom observed at catchment scale as such the sac states are subject to potentially large structural and parametric uncertainties of the soil moisture accounting model in addition to the input uncertainty in observed forcings carpenter et al 2001 yilmaz et al 2008 lee and seo 2014 lee et al 2016 the temporal evolution of the sac states is modelled as 4 x k l 1 s m x k l s w k l s where x k l 1 s denotes the 6 sac states valid at the beginning of the assimilation window at the k th assimilation cycle m denotes the sac and w k l s denotes the zero mean model error for state transition from the k 1 st to the k th assimilation cycle see fig 2 the errors w k l s are assumed to be independent of one another with standard deviation of approximately 4 of the time varying sac states as noted above the study area is hydroclimatologically challenging for streamflow prediction alizadeh et al 2020 it is very possible that the ensemble subspace for streamflow spanned by x k p x k e and x k l 1 s may fail to encompass the observed flow due to a combination of large hydrologic and input uncertainties krzysztofowicz 1999 seo et al 2006 for this reason we include the additive error to tci x k r to the control vector the control variable x k r may be best understood in the context of the uh operation expressed below as a continuous convolution 5 z q t 0 t i τ w τ u t τ d τ i τ w τ 0 where z q t denotes the observed streamflow valid at time t i τ denotes the tci w τ denotes the additive error to tci and u denotes the uh the control variable x k r is a discrete implementation of w in eq 5 and represents the time varying errors in sac uh that cannot be addressed by adjusting the sac states map and mape we assume that x k r is normally distributed and ar 1 6 x k r φ r x k 1 r w r where φ r and w r denote the lag 1 correlation coefficient and the white noise for the ar 1 model respectively with the addition of x k r the control vector in eq 1 for the k th assimilation cycle is given by x k x k l 1 s x k p x k e x k r t the above formulation has proven very effective in numerous previous studies seo et al 2003 lee et al 2011 2012 2016 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 noh et al 2018 the observational equation is written as 7 z k h k y k v k in the above z k is the observation vector given by z k z k p z k e z k r z k q t where z k p z k e and z k r are the vectors of hourly observed map climatological mape and additive errors in tci valid over the assimilation window respectively and z k q is the streamflow observation valid at the end of the assimilation window i e the prediction time h k is the observation structure matrix y k is the augmented state vector given by y k x k g x k t where x k is the control vector x k x k l 1 s x k p x k e x k r t and g x k is the the model simulated flow for z k q and v k denotes the observation error vector given by v k v k p v k e v k r v k q t the purpose of the state augmentation in y k to render the observation equation linear while accounting for possible nonlinear relations between the state variables and the observed variables lorentzen and nævdal 2011 in reality z k r is not observed and is assumed to be zero under the assumption that the model simulated tci is unbiased the zero mean observation errors v k are assumed to be uncorrelated temporally among themselves and with x k and have covariance of r k the observation structure matrix h k in eq 7 is made of a zero submatrix associated with the 6 sac states x k l 1 s and a diagonal submatrix associated with x k p x k e x k r g x k the latter pairs the bias adjusted map and mape z k p x k p and z k e x k e with the observed map and climatological mape z k p and z k e respectively the da estimated additive error to tci x k r with z k r and the model simulated streamflow observation g x k with the observed flow z k q note in the above formulation that the observation structure matrix h k uses z k p and z k e so that x k p and x k e are multiplicative adjustment factors although not explicitly expressed as such in the above development for notational brevity the control variables x k p x k e and x k r are applied to the map mape and tci observations over equal duration subperiods within the assimilation window whereas x k l 1 s is applied at the beginning of the window only see fig 2 the subperiod or the time scale of adjustment may range from 1 hr to the entire assimilation window and is chosen via sensitivity analysis the motivation for the adaptable time scale of adjustment is to allow for hydrologic uncertainties with shorter characteristic time scales than the entire assimilation window such as timing errors and time varying biases and errors in radar based map and model simulated runoff respectively for example a temporally uniform x k r over the entire assimilation window implicitly assumes a perfect uh which is not very realistic particularly for large basins receiving highly convective precipitation dooge 1959 chow et al 1988 saghafian 2006 liu et al 2011 note that even a relatively small w τ may significantly alter the adjusted runoff hyetograph due to the nonlinearity in i τ w τ 0 τ t see eq 5 as such the choice for the time scale of adjustment can significantly impact the performance of da for the 6 study basins we chose via sensitivity analysis time scales of adjustment of 2 3 3 12 6 and 3 hrs for dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 respectively in this work we assimilate observed streamflow valid at the prediction time only which adds another control variable to y k there are hence a total of 6 3 n s 1 control variables in the augmented state vector where n s is the number of equal duration subperiods within the assimilation window the 6 sac states for x k l 1 s n s each for x k p x k e and x k r and the model simulated streamflow collectively the control variables employed in this work encompass a very large feasible region for input and hydrologic uncertainties for some basins however the variables may not well represent the actual errors in which case they would only add noise to assess the relative performance of adaptive cbenkf under varying levels of hydrologic uncertainty lee et al 2012 2016 we performed da under three different levels of hydrologic uncertainty modeling in the weakly constrained implementation or wc we invoke the adjustment factors to forcings uncertainty in soil moisture transition dynamics w k l s and uncertainty in runoff depth w τ which results in the control vector of x k x k l 1 s x k p j x k e j x k r j j 1 n s t in the moderately constrained implementation or mc we drop w τ from wc which results in the control vector of x k x k l 1 s x k p j x k e j j 1 n s t the strongly constrained implementation or sc is the same as mc but the variance of w k l s is reduced to zero to emulate the control vector of x k x k p j x k e j j 1 n s t in this way we allow time varying biases in map and mape within the assimilation window for all 3 cases additionally allow in mc and wc uncertain soil moisture at the beginning of the assimilation window and further allow in wc time varying errors in tci within the assimilation window 3 2 flow dependent information content for the adaptive extension of cbenkf it is necessary to quantify the flow dependent marginal information content in the observations for this we use the degrees of freedom for signal dfs rodgers 2000 zupanski et al 2007 the dfs is widely used in atmospheric da for prognostic assessment of the impact of new observations fisher 2003 zupanski et al 2007 zupanski 2009 the dfs is based on the degrees of freedom df of the cost function under the normality assumption for the true state x k and describes the number of useful independent quantities in the observation rodgers 2000 8 e χ k 2 e x k x k k 1 t σ k k 1 1 x k x k k 1 e z k h k x k t r k 1 z k h k x k where χ k 2 denotes the chi square random variable for the k th assimilation cycle x k denotes the optimal solution and x k k 1 is the one step prediction the first term in eq 8 is attributable to the state vector and is referred to as the dfs the second term is attributable to the residuals and is referred to as the degrees of freedom for noise dfn the sum of the two equals the number of observations rodgers 2000 because df exceeding the number of observations n or the number of states m is meaningless the largest possible df is given by min m n in the context of kf or a similar sequential filter one may express dfs for the k th assimilation cycle d s k as 9 d s k t r σ k k 1 σ k k σ k k 1 1 t r i σ k k σ k k 1 1 t r k k h k in the above t r denotes the trace of the matrix bracketed i denotes the identity matrix and σ k k and σ k k 1 denote the updated and forecast error covariance matrices of the state variables respectively and k k denotes the kalman gain in the k th assimilation cycle in the above σ k k and k k are given by 10 σ k k h k t r k 1 h k σ k k 1 1 1 11 k k σ k k h k r k 1 one may also evaluate d s k via singular value decomposition of h k 12 h k r k 1 2 h k σ k k 1 1 2 u k λ k v k t where u k and v k are the unitary matrices and λ k is the diagonal matrix of singular values we then have for dfs rodgers 2000 zupanski 2009 13 d s k t r λ k 2 λ k 2 i 1 σ i 1 m λ k i 2 1 λ k i 2 where λ k i denotes the i th largest singular value for the k th assimilation cycle as seen in eq 9 dfs quantifies the reduction in uncertainty due to da relative to the uncertainty without da if assimilating the observation completely reduces or does not reduce uncertainty at all dfs is given by m i n m n or zero respectively in sequential da one may hence consider dfs a skill score i e when normalized by m i n m n for uncertainty reduction due to the assimilation of new observations given the information content of the model prediction because dfs depends on the relative magnitude of σ k k and σ k k 1 its utility as a skill score for information fusion depends on the goodness of uncertainty modeling it is possible that one may calibrate the uncertainty models to increase dfs but without necessarily improving the forecast skill itself for this reason it is necessary to accompany the information content analysis with verification of the ensemble analysis and forecast lee et al 2019 have shown that ensemble predictions for flood events from cbenkf are more reliable and have larger resolution than those from enkf one may hence expect the adaptive cbenkf to provide more realistic quantification of dfs while improving predictive skill 3 3 adaptive extension in cbenkf prescribing the scalar weight for the cb penalty α is a significant source of uncertainty and potential subjectivity the choice of the value of α depends on whether the state of the uncertain system that manifests the predictor predictand relationship being observed is in a normal or extreme state if the system is at or near its median state α should be set to near zero so that cbenkf reduces to enkf and produces the least squares solution if the system is in an extreme state α should be set to a large value so that cb is reduced as much as possible the basic strategy for the adaptive extension is hence to prescribe a large weight if the true state is in the tail and a small weight if it is near median respectively kim et al 2018 shen et al 2019 because the true state is not known in reality α can only be prescribed suboptimally using synthetic experiments with known truth shen et al 2019 assessed the upper bound of the possible improvement by cbpkf over kf by prescribing α perfectly the results show that with uncertainty in α removed adaptive cbpkf is not only far superior to kf for large truth but also improves over kf in the unconditional sense as well this is because the adaptive extension renders α an implicit function of the uncertain true state which makes adaptive cbpkf a nonlinear filter whereas the upper bound of the performance seen in shen et al 2019 is not attainable in reality it is possible to use real time observations to infer the state of the hydrologic system and prescribe α objectively in the information theoretical sense α should be chosen such that the information content in the available observations chen and oliver 2013 in the current assimilation cycle is maximized for state estimation the dfs serves this purpose well in that maximizing dfs or equivalently minimizing dfn in the k th assimilation cycle maximizes the number of useful independent quantities of information in the observations related to the states in this work we optimize α by minimizing dfn which in a sequential linear filter amounts to minimizing weight averaged measurement post fit residual see eq 8 for the adaptive cbenkf we use the approximate solution for cbpkf referred to in shen et al 2019 as the variance inflated kf the analysis solution is given by 14 x k k x k k 1 k k z k h k x k k 1 in the above the gain given by 15 k k 1 α k σ k k 1 h k t r k h k 1 α k σ k k 1 h k t 1 the analysis error covariance solution is given by 16 σ k k σ 1 α k k k σ 1 α k 2 k k 1 σ 1 α k k k in the above σ β k k is the kf analysis error covariance in which forecast error covariance is inflated by a factor of β β 1 17 σ β k k i k k h k β σ k k 1 note that eqs 14 and 15 are identical to the kf counterparts except that σ k k 1 is inflated by a factor of 1 α k α k 0 because the approximate solution is built on the kf solution it offers an important alternative interpretation of α via analogy a positive α is an indication that due to cb the model prediction is in reality less informative than indicated by the enkf analysis error variance an infinitely large α is an indication that the model prediction is non informative due to infinitely large cb in the latter case state updating via the adaptive cbenkf using eq 14 is equivalent to fisher estimation based on observations only seo et al 2021 an important implication of the above information processing is that unlike enkf the adaptive cbenkf may not necessarily reduce the forecast error variance if cb is sufficiently large while counter intuitive in the context of kf and enkf which do not consider cb the above outcome can easily arise in reality if the model prediction suffers from large cb in which case one may not expect the forecast error variance to be realistic a drawback of the above approximate solution is that it monotonically but nonlinearly scales up α see fig 1 of shen et al 2019 as such one may consider the optimal α from adaptive cbenkf only as an inflated proxy for the actual weight for the cb penalty in eq 1 an overriding advantage of the approximate solution however is that owing to its simplicity eq 14 yields closed form expressions for the derivatives of dfn with respect to α with the first and second order derivatives accurately evaluated one may use the newton s method to optimize α cost effectively on average the resulting adaptive cbenkf is only about 2 to 3 times computationally more expensive than enkf for the study basins algorithmically the adaptive cbenkf can be easily implemented in any existing enkf code with the addition of the α optimization module for further details including a complete algorithmic description of the optimization of α the reader is referred to seo et al 2021 3 4 uncertainty modelling because the accuracy of dfs depends on the goodness of uncertainty modelling it is particularly important to model the dynamical and observational uncertainties as realistically and objectively as possible in this work we model observational errors as heteroscedastic and temporally uncorrelated for heteroscedastic modeling of observation errors for streamflow and map we used the following formulations sorooshian and dracup 1980 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 weerts and el serafy 2006 clark et al 2008 rakovec et al 2012 18 σ p c p z p c po 19 σ q c q z q c qo where z q and z p denote the streamflow and map observations respectively σ q and σ p denote the observation error standard deviations for streamflow and map in mm hr and cms respectively c q and c p denote the multiplicative coefficients for the streamflow and map observation error standard deviation respectively and c qo and c po denote the additive coefficients for the streamflow and map observation error standard deviation respectively the additive coefficients are necessary to keep the variance positive when the observation is zero for hourly mape we used a fixed observational uncertainty of 1 mm hr 2 the coefficients in eqs 18 and 19 should be carefully chosen as inaccurate heteroscedastic modeling may be counter productive compared to homoscedastic modeling rafieeinasab et al 2014 ideally the parameters should be estimated based on statistical analysis using the truth due to lack of such data however the coefficients are prescribed in this work using a combination of the literature review carpenter and georgakakos 2004 weerts and el serafy 2006 clark et al 2008 rakovec et al 2012 and limited sensitivity analysis based on the above we chose 0 15 and 0 25 for c q and c qo respectively and 0 4 and 0 25 for c p and c po respectively because runoff is not directly observed variance of x k r cannot be estimated empirically in this work it is inferred from the observed and simulated streamflow via the following steps assuming stationarity of w τ in eq 5 within the duration of the uh we have for error variance of simulated streamflow 20 σ eq 2 σ rs 2 0 t 0 t u t τ u t s d s d τ where σ eq 2 denotes the error variance of simulated streamflow and σ rs 2 denotes the runoff error variance one may develop an empirical relationship between σ eq 2 and the observed flow and use eq 18 to express σ rs 2 as a function of σ eq 2 and hence of the observed flow rafieeinasab et al 2014 for the relationship between σ eq 2 and observed flow we used linear regression for simplicity though nonlinear modeling is likely to improve accuracy 4 results and discussion in this section we present the comparative evaluation results and offer discussion for each basin the adaptive cbenkf and enkf were run for all events whose peak flow exceeded 100 m3 s within the 12 yr period of record of 1996 through 2007 we then verified ensemble mean and ensemble streamflow analysis and predictions from the twin hindcasting experiments using the adaptive cbenkf and enkf both filters were initialized identically at the beginning of each event and run independently of each other every hour under the identical conditions for the entire event the process was then repeated until all events were exhausted skillful da performance in times of very poor ics is an extremely important consideration for event based flood forecasting kim et al 2020 to reflect performance under wide ranging qualities of the ics we also included the warmup periods for sac in the evaluation as such the base simulation has very large errors in the ics in the early part of the assimilation horizon resulting in severe under simulation for a very tough test for da lee et al 2019 showed that the cbenkf ensembles are generally more reliable and has better resolution than the enkf ensembles and that the continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 and continuous ranked probability skill score results are qualitatively very similar to root mean square error rmse and mean square error skill score of ensemble mean results respectively as such here we focus mainly on the rmse of ensemble mean results ensemble mean is sensitive to extreme ensemble members whereas crps benefits from the smoothing effects as such rmse tends to be less favorable to ensemble prediction than mean crps in addition rmse of ensemble mean allows the user to assess readily the practical significance of the improvement a large ensemble size of 200 was used for all experiments to reduce sampling uncertainty 4 1 ensemble streamflow analysis and flow dependent information content to provide a visual sense of how the ensemble analysis of the adaptive cbenkf may differ from that of enkf we show in fig 4 examples of the adaptive cbenkf and enkf ensemble analysis results all da results in the figure are based on the weakly constrained implementation or wc see section 3 1 it is reminded that the dfn minimizing α values from the adaptive cbenkf shown at the bottom do not represent the actual weight for the cb penalty but a nonlinearly inflated proxy see subsection 3 3 the dfs evaluated by the adaptive cbenkf and enkf is shown at the top without the y axis to avoid clutter these examples are mostly associated severe underprediction by the base simulation and are chosen to highlight the differences between the two filters in each of fig 4a through 4d the dfs for the adaptive cbenkf bottoms out at the lower bound of zero whereas that for enkf tops out at the upper bounds of 15 7 27 5 22 6 and 8 1 for djct2 lynt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 or 23 31 31 and 26 of the total number of the state variables of 67 88 73 and 31 respectively in the augmented state vector y k in eq 7 fig 4 shows that in general dfs varies inversely with the observed streamflow the dfs values are similar between the adaptive cbenkf and enkf in low flows where the maximum dfs occurs in high flows however they differ significantly because the assimilation of observations in the adaptive cbenkf cannot overcome the loss of information content in the model prediction due to large cb as indicated by large values of α for enkf the decline in dfs is less severe when the hydrograph first begins to rise but drops to minima of 0 6 1 8 1 7 and 0 6 for dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 from the maxima of 15 7 27 5 22 6 and 8 1 respectively the enkf results show that the marginal information content of the observations is strongly flow dependent depleted rather quickly as the hydrograph first rises and regained gradually over the receding limb the above pattern is significantly more pronounced for the adaptive cbenkf results due to the fact that when significant type i i error i e failure to detect is present the model prediction is necessarily less informative than indicated by the forecast error variance it is readily seen in fig 4 that the cbenkf analysis generally tracks the observed hydrographs more closely than the enkf analysis for superior resolution and that the cbenkf ensemble spread tends to capture the observed flow better than the enkf for superior reliability in fig 4a the adaptive cbenkf invokes a large α of about 18 in the 1541st assimilation cycle when the hydrograph rises very rapidly this spike in α is an indication that the model prediction is largely non informative and hence the adaptive cbenkf relies mostly on the observations for state estimation the result is that the adaptive cbenkf analysis is closer the observed and the ensemble spread is much larger than that of the enkf analysis in reflection of the increased uncertainty due to large cb note also that though the cbenkf ensemble mean is still significantly below the observed flow its 99th percentile closely approaches the observed peak whereas the enkf ensembles show little indication of the sharp peak in fig 4b the overall difference between the two da results is not very large the adaptive cbenkf however is able to keep up with the fastest rise in the hydrograph in the upper part of the rising limb whereas enkf falls well short in the early part of the rising limb the adaptive cbenkf is able to recognize large errors and hence lack of information content in the model prediction with a very large α the adaptive cbenkf lifts the analysis close to the observed flow in the 58th assimilation cycle the enkf on the other hand overweights the model prediction which not only delays the rise of the analysis hydrograph but also keeps the ensemble analysis underspread fig 4c shows a relative performance similar to fig 4b the adaptive cbenkf tracks the fast rising limb much better than the enkf though the former is not able to reach the observed peak due to the severe underprediction in the base simulation note also in the rising limb that the adaptive cbenkf analysis has a much larger ensemble spread than enkf in reflection of the increased uncertainty due to cb unlike the first three case the base simulation in fig 4d trails observed flow by a significant margin the adaptive cbenkf recognizes this delayed model response and in the 376th and 377th assimilation cycles invokes very large values of α in reflection of the largely non informative model predictions this cb awareness enables the adaptive cbenkf analysis to track the observed flow very closely whereas enkf overweights the model predictions resulting in a much delayed and suppressed rise in the first peak for the second peak enkf over responds to the rise in the model prediction as may be seen in the base simulation leading to too early a rise and overshooting of the peak flow the adaptive cbenkf on the other hand recognizes that the model prediction has larger errors than indicated by the forecast error variance and invokes a very large α in the 417th assimilation cycle this spike in α results in increased ensemble spread in reflection of the non informative model prediction and allows the adaptive cbenkf to track the observed flow very closely in all 4 cases in fig 4 spikes in α occur near the base of the rising limb where dfs drops rapidly the above pattern arises because the hydrologic system is likely to be most under determined for streamflow prediction when discharge first emerges at the outlet due to the increased number of possible surface and subsurface flow paths one may hence expect the degrees of freedom for the inverse problem to quickly increase near the base of the rising limb the above observations point out the importance of accurately estimating both the timing and magnitude of the cb penalty for cb aware da to be highly effective 4 2 ensemble mean streamflow prediction fig 5 shows the rmse vs lead time for all 6 basins these results include all streamflow observations within the partial duration time series of all events whose peaks exceed 100 cms for wc the reduction in rmse by adaptive cbenkf analysis over enkf is about 38 6 31 0 21 7 42 1 15 2 and 40 4 with sample sizes of 2282 1584 4604 3036 1966 and 2864 for dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 respectively the above reductions in rmse translates into gains of a few to several hours in lead time fig 5 indicates that in general wc and mc perform similarly whereas the performance of sc drops off significantly it suggests that the positive impact of da comes mainly from reducing biases in map and mape and providing the sac with higher quality ics at the beginning of the assimilation window that mtpt2 shows the largest positive impact of da among the 6 basins is a reflection of the large storage of water in this humid basin and the resulting stronger hydrologic memory it is interesting to note that sc performs comparably to wc and mc for mtpt2 for the adaptive cbenkf but not for enkf it points out the importance of accounting for cb even when hydrologic uncertainty is relatively small for sbmt2 wc and mc are superior to sc only for shorter lead times it is suspected that for these basins the performance of da is adversely impacted by timing errors at longer lead times as explained below liu et al 2011 reported that reft2 and sbmt2 have significant timing errors for which the model simulation tends to trail the observed in such cases da is likely to over adjust the control variables when the catchment starts to respond to precipitation such over adjustment makes reducing hydrologic uncertainty particularly challenging and tends to result in phase errors in da aided predictions overall fig 5 shows that the adaptive cbenkf improves over enkf consistently and significantly regardless of the level of hydrologic uncertainty modeled fig 6 is the same as fig 5 but for mean crps in these results no da refers to the base ensemble prediction rather than the base single valued prediction shown in fig 5 the base ensemble predictions in fig 6 show larger mean crps at shorter lead times which gradually decreases asymptotically the above pattern arises because the base ensemble prediction is newly generated in each assimilation cycle by perturbing the base single valued prediction for ensemble da only rather than for actual prediction with little consideration for ensemble quality the mean crps results are generally similar to the rmse results but present a more favorable picture for both adaptive cbenkf and enkf than the rmse results and a somewhat more favorable picture for the adaptive cbenkf than for enkf compared to the rmse results the adaptive cbenkf renders α an implicit function of the uncertain true state to elicit performance of a nonlinear filter if successful one may expect the adaptive cbenkf to improve over the fixed α implementation of cbenkf lee et al 2019 fig 7 tests the above hypothesis by comparing the adaptive cbenkf with the fixed α cbenkf and enkf all da results in fig 7 are based on wc the performance of the fixed α cbenkf necessarily depends on the choice of the α value ideally α should be optimized problem specifically under the user s choice of performance criteria in this work we chose α values based on limited sensitivity analysis similar to lee et al 2019 fig 7 shows that the fix α cbenkf performs comparably to or slightly better than the adaptive cbenkf at short lead times but its performance deteriorates to the level of enkf at longer lead times the overall differences are however relatively small because its performance envelope formed the adaptive cbenkf and enkf is rather narrow qualitatively the above results are not very surprising in that the fixed α cbenkf tends to overfit the observations which provides good performance at short lead times but at the expense of reduced performance at longer lead time we now turn out attention to comparative evaluation of adaptive cbenkf conditioned on α if the adaptive extension prescribes α skillfully we may expect cbenkf to outperform enkf by larger margins than seen above when the dfn minimizing α is large assessment of this conditional performance is particularly important for flood forecasting in that the larger the verifying observed flow is the larger the cb and hence α tends to be see fig 4 fig 8 abc show the rmse vs lead time for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively these basins are least impacted by timing errors and hence are better suited for the conditional evaluation the results in fig 8abc are conditioned on the dfn minimizing α exceeding the mean of such α values over the entire assimilation horizon in these figures the rmse associated with the no da results tends to decrease as the lead time increases this is because larger α tends occur more frequently over the receding limb due to its longer duration than over the rising limb accordingly the verifying observed flow associated with larger α tends to decrease as the lead time increases comparison of fig 8abc with fig 5acd indicates that the margin of improvement by adaptive cbenkf over enkf is on average larger when a large cb penalty is invoked the reduction in rmse by the adaptive cbenkf over enkf in fig 8abc is approximately 42 6 26 4 and 60 4 for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively fig 8def show the rmse vs lead time for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively for the verifying observed flow exceeding 200 cms regardless of α fig 8def are to be compared with fig 5acd respectively which show the unconditional results it is seen that the margin of improvement by adaptive cbenkf over enkf is generally larger when only high flows are considered the relative reduction in rmse for ensemble mean analysis by adaptive cbenkf over enkf is 40 9 24 1 and 26 7 for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively also shown in fig 8 at lead time of 0 are the 95 confidence intervals assessed via bootstrapping which indicate that the improvement by the adaptive cbenkf over enkf is statistically significant finally we examine the comparative performance of adaptive cbenkf for rising vs falling limbs given that the rate of change in streamflow is generally larger in the rising limb than in the falling limb one may hypothesize that cb and hence the positive impact of cb aware da may be larger in the rising limb to assess this we conditioned the predictions on increasing vs decreasing observed flow as a proxy for rising vs falling limbs admittedly this stratification is only approximate in that streamflow may increase and decrease within falling and rising limbs respectively fig 9 shows the rmse vs lead time for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 conditional on the verifying observation exceeding 150 cms for each pair the upper and lower panels are further conditioned on increasing vs decreasing flows respectively because the magnitude of flow is generally smaller for decreasing flow and the sample size is not the same head to head comparisons are not readily possible nevertheless it may be seen in fig 9 that the marginal improvement by adaptive cbenkf over enkf tends to be somewhat larger over the rising limb than over the falling limb additional research is needed however for more rigorous evaluation based on a large number of basins in diverse hydroclimatological regions 5 conclusions floods are associated with extreme states of the hydrologic system which can only be observed with significant uncertainty as such data assimilation da for flood forecasting is subject to conditional bias cb which adversely impacts optimal information fusion this work describes cb aware da based on an adaptive extension of the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf and comparatively evaluates with the ensemble kalman filter enkf for 6 headwater basins in texas using the nws s operational lumped hydrologic models cb aware da and the degrees of freedom for signal are then used to quantify the marginal information content of the observations the main findings and conclusions follow below cb arises very frequently in varying magnitude when assimilating streamflow observations during the catchment s response to precipitation and drainage in general the larger the discharge is the larger the cb is the flow dependent marginal information content in the observations varies with the streamflow response of the catchment and the magnitude of cb and tends to decrease and increase in the rising and falling phases of the hydrograph respectively adaptive cbenkf improves over enkf consistently and significantly regardless of the level of hydrologic uncertainty modeled the improvement is particularly large during sharp rises of the outlet hydrograph with large peak flow or when the model prediction is non informative due to large cb cb aware da is hence likely to have the largest positive impact for forecasting of rising flood flows in fast responding basins as well as for basins for which skillful hydrologic prediction is particularly challenging the overall findings indicate that cb aware da with information content analysis offers an objective framework for dynamically balancing the flow dependent predictive skill of hydrologic models quality and frequency of hydrologic observation and scheduling of the da cycle toward cost

3708,we describe an adaptive extension of the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter for conditional bias cb aware data assimilation da and comparatively evaluate with the ensemble kalman filter enkf for 6 headwater basins in texas using the operational lumped hydrologic models from the national weather service we then use cb aware da and the degrees of freedom for signal to assess the marginal information content of observations we show that cb arises very frequently in varying magnitudes when assimilating streamflow observations during the catchment s response to precipitation and subsequent drainage and that in general larger discharges are associated with larger cb cb aware da improves over enkf by varying margins in times of significant flow and the improvement is particularly large during sharp rises of the outlet hydrograph with large peak flows for the 6 study basins the average relative reduction in root mean square error of the ensemble mean streamflow analysis by cb aware da over enkf is 31 5 for all ranges of observed flow and 32 1 for observed flow exceeding 200 cms the flow dependent marginal information content of the observations varies very significantly with the streamflow response of the catchment and the magnitude of cb and tends to decrease and increase in the rising and falling phases of the hydrograph respectively the findings indicate that cb aware da with information content analysis offers an objective framework for dynamically balancing the predictive skill of hydrologic models quality and frequency of hydrologic observation and scheduling of da cycles toward improving operational flood forecasting cost effectively keywords flood forecasting data assimilation streamflow conditional bias information content 1 introduction data assimilation da is widely used to reduce uncertainty in the initial conditions ic of the prediction models by fusing the actual and model predicted observations kitanidis and bras 1978 evensen 1994 georgakakos and sperflage 1995 evensen and van leeuwen 2000 moradkhani et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 reichle 2008 liu et al 2012 for cost effective observation and da operation however it is necessary to consider not only the da method but also the flow dependent information content of the observations for example an additional streamflow observation at the base of the rising limb of an unfolding hydrograph has a larger marginal information content than one at the lower recession limb it is hence desirable to make more frequent observations of streamflow in the early rise phase of the streamflow response and schedule the da cycles accordingly in the context of da the marginal information content of observations may be expressed in terms of the reduction in uncertainty in the ics due to da relative to that without da if the assimilation completely eliminates the uncertainty in the ics as in the case of perfect observation the marginal information content of the observation is 100 if it does not reduce the uncertainty at all as in the case of infinitely large observation uncertainty or a combination of non informative model prediction and very large observation uncertainty the observation has no marginal information content for optimal information fusion operation of observing systems and da operation it is hence important that the da method be able to quantify the predictive uncertainty as accurately as possible at their core almost all da methods are based on least squares minimization jazwinski 1970 miller et al 1999 li and navon 2001 lewis et al 2006 tabeart et al 2018 tian et al 2018 therefore when observations are made with significant uncertainties they are subject to conditional bias cb which often leads to under and over prediction of the predictand over the upper and lower tails respectively fuller 1987 seber et al 1989 hughes 1993 frost and thompson 2000 accounting for cb in da is hence a very important consideration for prediction of extremes such as floods and droughts to address the adverse impact of cb in da lee et al 2019 proposed the cb penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf which minimizes a linearly weighted sum of error variance and variance of type ii error jolliffe and stephenson 2003 wilks 2011 cb may be differentiated into type i and type ii type i cb defined as e x x x x is associated with false alarm where x x and x denote the unknown truth the estimate and the realization of x respectively jolliffe and stephenson 2003 type ii cb defined as e x x x x is associated with failure to detect the event whereas type i cb can be reduced by calibration type 2 cb cannot wilks 2011 seo 2013 lee et al 2019 showed that cbenkf significantly improves over enkf for prediction of high flows the improvement is in both reliability and resolution jolliffe and stephenson 2003 wilks 2011 and the margin of improvement over enkf is larger for larger events these findings are consistent with those from the family of techniques based on cb penalized optimal estimation seo 2013 shen et al 2019 such as cb penalized kriging brown and seo 2013 seo 2013 seo et al 2014 kim et al 2018 jozaghi et al 2019 cb penalized kalman filter cbpkf seo et al 2018a 2018b shen et al 2019 and cb penalized linear regression kim et al 2014 jozaghi et al 2021 several remedies have been studied in hydrology to alleviate the limitations of the conventional kalman filter kf in the presence of large model or observation errors the bias aware kf is applied to correct model and observation biases by updating the conditional mean and bias separately drécourt et al 2006 rasmussen et al 2016 ridler et al 2018 the variance inflation techniques are introduced to tackle underestimation of variance in enkf when using a limited ensemble size it is found that variance inflation could reduce model biases by adjusting ensemble spread during the analysis step multiple studies in soil hydrology reported improved results by employing the inflation methods bauser et al 2018 jamal and linker 2020 while bias aware filters and variance inflation use additional steps to the conventional filters to ameliorate their limitations the cbpkf uses the kf like recursive form of the fisher like solution resulting from co minimizing error variance and variance of the type ii error shen et al 2019 in the cb penalized techniques the largest additional source of uncertainty and potential subjectivity is the scalar weight for the cb penalty α see eq 1 in section 3 the premise of adaptive cbenkf is that by significantly reducing the parametric uncertainty in α one may quantify more accurately the marginal information content of the observations which in turn improves the da aided analysis and prediction particularly when the hydrologic system is in extreme states in this paper we describe adaptive cbenkf comparatively evaluate it with enkf and assess the flow dependent information content in relation to the streamflow response to precipitation at the catchment scale for quantification of marginal information content we use the degrees of freedom for signal dfs rodgers 2000 zupanski et al 2007 which may be considered as a skill score for information fusion the new and significant contributions of this paper are development of cb aware da in the form of adaptive cbenkf for assimilation of streamflow observations comparative evaluation of adaptive cbenkf with enkf under varying levels of hydrologic uncertainty modeling and advances in understanding of flow dependent information content in hydrologic observations and its temporal vatiation in relation to streamflow response to precipitation at the catchment scale this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrologic models streamflow and precipitation data and basins used for the study section 3 describes cbenkf and the control vector flow dependent information content the adaptive extension of cbenkf and uncertainty modeling section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 provides the conclusions 2 models data and basins used in this section we describe the hydrologic models the forcings and streamflow data and the basins used in this study they were also used in a number of previous studies of hydrologic modeling and da seo et al 2009 lee et al 2012 2016 2019 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 as such we limit the descriptions only to those that are essential to the development of this paper 2 1 hydrologic models used we used the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac burnash et al 1973 for rainfall runoff modeling and the unit hydrograph uh chow et al 1988 for runoff routing they represent the long standing hydrologic models used for headwater basins at the river forecast centers of the national weather service nws for operational hydrologic forecasting the sac inputs mean areal precipitation map and mean areal potential evapotranspiration mape and outputs the total channel inflow tci which represents the sum of surface and subsurface runoffs into the channels in this work we assume clairvoyant forcing forecasts and use the observed map and mape for future input as well in this way the impact of da on hydrologic uncertainty may be clearly assessed the sac is a conceptual soil moisture accounting model and uses two layers of soil storages in the upper and lower zones to model soil water balance in the vertical surface runoff includes both fast and slow runoffs fast runoff consists of the rainfall intensity dependent surface runoff from the unsaturated area direct runoff from the saturated area and impervious runoff from the impervious area slow runoff processes produce interflow supplemental baseflow and primary baseflow burnash et al 1973 the uh model which inputs the tci and outputs discharge at the catchment outlet is used to route the runoff to simulate streamflow at the outlet of the basin the objective of da in this work is to reduce the hydrologic ic uncertainty as such it is important to reduce other sources of error such as systematic biases in the observed forcings systematic timing errors and model parametric uncertainties in this way one may clearly ascertain the effectiveness of da for reducing the ic uncertainty in this work we used hourly map given the flashiness and relatively short response time of the study basins for mape we used climatological mean values adjusted via calibration before being input to sac typically the observed forcings of map and mape are adjusted for long term biases via multiplicative correction factors in this work we used the adjoint based optimizer ab opt seo et al 2009 to estimate the adjustment factors as well as to derive the empirical uh and to refine the sac parameters the ab opt uses variational assimilation to estimate the adjustment factors and empirical uh and the stepwise line search kuzmin et al 2008 to refine the sac parameters 2 2 data used the observations assimilated are map mape and streamflow the map observations are from the multisensor precipitation estimator fulton et al 1998 seo 1998 seo et al 1999 2010 young et al 2000 produced operationally by the nws west gulf river forecast center wgrfc for mape the monthly climatology of daily estimates was disaggregated to hourly estimates based on the diurnal cycle of solar radiation because the da cycles consist only of the periods of significant flow potential evapotranspiration does not play an important role hence the lack of dynamically varying mape does not impact the outcome in any significant way for assimilation and validation we used the us geological survey s hourly streamflow data at the catchment outlet because our focus is on flood forecasting we identified only the significant events from the observed streamflow data and used the resulting partial duration time series a significant event is defined as a hydrograph whose peak flow exceeds 100 m3 s once an event is identified the beginning and ending hours of the event were determined by subtracting and adding 72 hrs from and to the first and last hours of the partial duration exceeding 100 m3 s respectively the choice of 72 hrs is made to include most of the significant portions of the primary baseflow response in the assimilation process 2 3 basins used a total of 6 basins was used in the wgrfc s service area dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 see fig 1 for location and table 1 for hydroclimatological attributes in table 1 the dryness index di is defined as the ratio of mean mape to mean map budyko 1974 a value of di greater and less than unity indicates the catchment is water and energy limited respectively the study basins are part of the wgrfc da testbed which includes a group of 23 basins identified as particularly challenging for operational streamflow forecasting the testbed has been previously used by the authors and their collaborators for hydrologic da and related research seo et al 2009 liu et al 2011 lee et al 2012 2016 2019 rafieeinasab et al 2014 noh et al 2018 the 6 basins used in this work are located along the longitudinal line of mean annual precipitation of approximately 1 000 mm due to the strong east to west gradient in precipitation climatology and the influence of the gulf of mexico significant hydroclimatological variations exist among the basins ranging from semi arid to humid providing a degree of diversity see fig 1 table 1 streamflow forecasting is generally more challenging for more arid basins due to the quicker catchment response larger uncertainties in the ics generally larger structural uncertainties due to unmodeled processes such as infiltration into dry channel beds and larger parametric uncertainties due to the above factors and the limited number of large events available for calibration alizadeh et al 2020 in addition the large spatio temporal variability of precipitation from convective events adds uncertainty in lumped modelling particularly for large basins smith et al 2004 hence the study basins collectively offer a rather challenging test for streamflow da in addition to the hydroclimatological variations we also considered the size of the basins as explained below given the hydrologic models observations and da method used the potency of da depends primarily on the memory of the hydrologic system alizadeh et al 2020 in general the larger the storage of surface and subsurface water is the larger the streamflow predictability is streams in semi arid basins may be ephemeral due to intermittent soil water in some of the storages resulting in significantly smaller predictability accordingly one may expect the potential gains from da to be relatively small for small urban basins or semi arid basins even though they may be relatively large in size for this reason we chose larger basins in the 23 basin testbed even though they are less likely to satisfy the uh assumptions chow et al 1988 liu et al 2011 3 methods used in this section we describe adaptive cbenkf and how flow dependent marginal information content is assessed using dfs the technical details of cbenkf are not central to the development of this work for a complete mathematical and algorithmic description of cbenkf the reader is referred to lee et al 2019 for a complete derivation of cbpkf the reader is referred to seo et al 2018a 2018b and shen et al 2019 for the simpler and computationally less expensive approximation of cbpkf via variance inflated kf which is used in this work the reader is referred to shen et al 2019 for details on optimization of α using the newton s method the reader is referred to seo et al 2021 3 1 cbenkf and formulation of control vector cbenkf lee et al 2019 is an ensemble extension of cbpkf seo et al 2018a 2018b and is completely analogous to what enkf evensen 1994 lorentzen and naevdal 2011 is to kf kalman 1960 whereas kf minimizes error variance only cbpkf minimizes a linearly weighted sum of error variance and variance of the type ii error 1 σ k e x k x k x k x k t α e x k e x k x k x k e x k x k t where x k denotes the vector of the estimated states the first and second terms represent the error covariance and the cb penalty respectively and α denotes the scalar weight for the latter if α 0 the cbpkf and cbenkf reduce to kf and enkf respectively in the context of linear regression the weight may be considered analogous to the tuning parameter λ in tikhonov regularization tikhonov and arsenin 1977 tikhonov et al 1995 or ridge regression hoerl 1962 hoerl and kennard 1970 or its l 1 version the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator lasso tibshirani 1996 1997 although the nature of the penalty is very different jozaghi et al 2021 the cbenkf and enkf are applied in this work as sequential assimilators but using the fixed lag smoother formulation lee et al 2019 the size of the fixed lag or the assimilation window see fig 2 is chosen to be the same as the length of the uh fig 3 shows the empirical uhs for all 6 basins whose durations are 39 80 67 98 96 and 54 hrs for djct2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 respectively in this way the time lag between the runoff generation at the most upstream areas of the catchment and the resulting flow at the basin outlet is captured in the da process seo et al 2009 rafieeinasab et al 2014 the motivation for the fixed lag smoother approximation as opposed to using an explicit smoother formulation evensen and van leeuwen 2000 is to handle both cold and warm restarts with a clearly identifiable assimilation window for possible human forecaster supervised operation seo et al 2009 as with any models hydrologic prediction using sac uh is subject to various sources of uncertainty because map is a spatially averaged quantity purely random errors tend to cancel out whereas systematic errors do not to address time varying biases in the forcings we include in the control i e state vector x k in eq 1 the multiplicative adjustment factors to map and mape x k p and x k e respectively we assume that l n x k p and l n x k e are normally distributed and autoregressive 1 ar 1 smith and krajewski 1991 anagnostou and krajewski 1999 seo et al 1999 2 lx k p φ p lx k 1 p w p 3 lx k e φ e lx k 1 e w e where lx k p and lx k e denote l n x k p and l n x k e respectively φ p and φ e denote lag 1 autocorrelation for l n x k p and l n x k e respectively and w p and w e denote the white noise for the respective ar 1 models the sac soil moisture states are conceptual quantities which may also be expressed as volumetric soil water contents lee et al 2011 koren et al 2014 in reality soil water is seldom observed at catchment scale as such the sac states are subject to potentially large structural and parametric uncertainties of the soil moisture accounting model in addition to the input uncertainty in observed forcings carpenter et al 2001 yilmaz et al 2008 lee and seo 2014 lee et al 2016 the temporal evolution of the sac states is modelled as 4 x k l 1 s m x k l s w k l s where x k l 1 s denotes the 6 sac states valid at the beginning of the assimilation window at the k th assimilation cycle m denotes the sac and w k l s denotes the zero mean model error for state transition from the k 1 st to the k th assimilation cycle see fig 2 the errors w k l s are assumed to be independent of one another with standard deviation of approximately 4 of the time varying sac states as noted above the study area is hydroclimatologically challenging for streamflow prediction alizadeh et al 2020 it is very possible that the ensemble subspace for streamflow spanned by x k p x k e and x k l 1 s may fail to encompass the observed flow due to a combination of large hydrologic and input uncertainties krzysztofowicz 1999 seo et al 2006 for this reason we include the additive error to tci x k r to the control vector the control variable x k r may be best understood in the context of the uh operation expressed below as a continuous convolution 5 z q t 0 t i τ w τ u t τ d τ i τ w τ 0 where z q t denotes the observed streamflow valid at time t i τ denotes the tci w τ denotes the additive error to tci and u denotes the uh the control variable x k r is a discrete implementation of w in eq 5 and represents the time varying errors in sac uh that cannot be addressed by adjusting the sac states map and mape we assume that x k r is normally distributed and ar 1 6 x k r φ r x k 1 r w r where φ r and w r denote the lag 1 correlation coefficient and the white noise for the ar 1 model respectively with the addition of x k r the control vector in eq 1 for the k th assimilation cycle is given by x k x k l 1 s x k p x k e x k r t the above formulation has proven very effective in numerous previous studies seo et al 2003 lee et al 2011 2012 2016 lee and seo 2014 rafieeinasab et al 2014 noh et al 2018 the observational equation is written as 7 z k h k y k v k in the above z k is the observation vector given by z k z k p z k e z k r z k q t where z k p z k e and z k r are the vectors of hourly observed map climatological mape and additive errors in tci valid over the assimilation window respectively and z k q is the streamflow observation valid at the end of the assimilation window i e the prediction time h k is the observation structure matrix y k is the augmented state vector given by y k x k g x k t where x k is the control vector x k x k l 1 s x k p x k e x k r t and g x k is the the model simulated flow for z k q and v k denotes the observation error vector given by v k v k p v k e v k r v k q t the purpose of the state augmentation in y k to render the observation equation linear while accounting for possible nonlinear relations between the state variables and the observed variables lorentzen and nævdal 2011 in reality z k r is not observed and is assumed to be zero under the assumption that the model simulated tci is unbiased the zero mean observation errors v k are assumed to be uncorrelated temporally among themselves and with x k and have covariance of r k the observation structure matrix h k in eq 7 is made of a zero submatrix associated with the 6 sac states x k l 1 s and a diagonal submatrix associated with x k p x k e x k r g x k the latter pairs the bias adjusted map and mape z k p x k p and z k e x k e with the observed map and climatological mape z k p and z k e respectively the da estimated additive error to tci x k r with z k r and the model simulated streamflow observation g x k with the observed flow z k q note in the above formulation that the observation structure matrix h k uses z k p and z k e so that x k p and x k e are multiplicative adjustment factors although not explicitly expressed as such in the above development for notational brevity the control variables x k p x k e and x k r are applied to the map mape and tci observations over equal duration subperiods within the assimilation window whereas x k l 1 s is applied at the beginning of the window only see fig 2 the subperiod or the time scale of adjustment may range from 1 hr to the entire assimilation window and is chosen via sensitivity analysis the motivation for the adaptable time scale of adjustment is to allow for hydrologic uncertainties with shorter characteristic time scales than the entire assimilation window such as timing errors and time varying biases and errors in radar based map and model simulated runoff respectively for example a temporally uniform x k r over the entire assimilation window implicitly assumes a perfect uh which is not very realistic particularly for large basins receiving highly convective precipitation dooge 1959 chow et al 1988 saghafian 2006 liu et al 2011 note that even a relatively small w τ may significantly alter the adjusted runoff hyetograph due to the nonlinearity in i τ w τ 0 τ t see eq 5 as such the choice for the time scale of adjustment can significantly impact the performance of da for the 6 study basins we chose via sensitivity analysis time scales of adjustment of 2 3 3 12 6 and 3 hrs for dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 respectively in this work we assimilate observed streamflow valid at the prediction time only which adds another control variable to y k there are hence a total of 6 3 n s 1 control variables in the augmented state vector where n s is the number of equal duration subperiods within the assimilation window the 6 sac states for x k l 1 s n s each for x k p x k e and x k r and the model simulated streamflow collectively the control variables employed in this work encompass a very large feasible region for input and hydrologic uncertainties for some basins however the variables may not well represent the actual errors in which case they would only add noise to assess the relative performance of adaptive cbenkf under varying levels of hydrologic uncertainty lee et al 2012 2016 we performed da under three different levels of hydrologic uncertainty modeling in the weakly constrained implementation or wc we invoke the adjustment factors to forcings uncertainty in soil moisture transition dynamics w k l s and uncertainty in runoff depth w τ which results in the control vector of x k x k l 1 s x k p j x k e j x k r j j 1 n s t in the moderately constrained implementation or mc we drop w τ from wc which results in the control vector of x k x k l 1 s x k p j x k e j j 1 n s t the strongly constrained implementation or sc is the same as mc but the variance of w k l s is reduced to zero to emulate the control vector of x k x k p j x k e j j 1 n s t in this way we allow time varying biases in map and mape within the assimilation window for all 3 cases additionally allow in mc and wc uncertain soil moisture at the beginning of the assimilation window and further allow in wc time varying errors in tci within the assimilation window 3 2 flow dependent information content for the adaptive extension of cbenkf it is necessary to quantify the flow dependent marginal information content in the observations for this we use the degrees of freedom for signal dfs rodgers 2000 zupanski et al 2007 the dfs is widely used in atmospheric da for prognostic assessment of the impact of new observations fisher 2003 zupanski et al 2007 zupanski 2009 the dfs is based on the degrees of freedom df of the cost function under the normality assumption for the true state x k and describes the number of useful independent quantities in the observation rodgers 2000 8 e χ k 2 e x k x k k 1 t σ k k 1 1 x k x k k 1 e z k h k x k t r k 1 z k h k x k where χ k 2 denotes the chi square random variable for the k th assimilation cycle x k denotes the optimal solution and x k k 1 is the one step prediction the first term in eq 8 is attributable to the state vector and is referred to as the dfs the second term is attributable to the residuals and is referred to as the degrees of freedom for noise dfn the sum of the two equals the number of observations rodgers 2000 because df exceeding the number of observations n or the number of states m is meaningless the largest possible df is given by min m n in the context of kf or a similar sequential filter one may express dfs for the k th assimilation cycle d s k as 9 d s k t r σ k k 1 σ k k σ k k 1 1 t r i σ k k σ k k 1 1 t r k k h k in the above t r denotes the trace of the matrix bracketed i denotes the identity matrix and σ k k and σ k k 1 denote the updated and forecast error covariance matrices of the state variables respectively and k k denotes the kalman gain in the k th assimilation cycle in the above σ k k and k k are given by 10 σ k k h k t r k 1 h k σ k k 1 1 1 11 k k σ k k h k r k 1 one may also evaluate d s k via singular value decomposition of h k 12 h k r k 1 2 h k σ k k 1 1 2 u k λ k v k t where u k and v k are the unitary matrices and λ k is the diagonal matrix of singular values we then have for dfs rodgers 2000 zupanski 2009 13 d s k t r λ k 2 λ k 2 i 1 σ i 1 m λ k i 2 1 λ k i 2 where λ k i denotes the i th largest singular value for the k th assimilation cycle as seen in eq 9 dfs quantifies the reduction in uncertainty due to da relative to the uncertainty without da if assimilating the observation completely reduces or does not reduce uncertainty at all dfs is given by m i n m n or zero respectively in sequential da one may hence consider dfs a skill score i e when normalized by m i n m n for uncertainty reduction due to the assimilation of new observations given the information content of the model prediction because dfs depends on the relative magnitude of σ k k and σ k k 1 its utility as a skill score for information fusion depends on the goodness of uncertainty modeling it is possible that one may calibrate the uncertainty models to increase dfs but without necessarily improving the forecast skill itself for this reason it is necessary to accompany the information content analysis with verification of the ensemble analysis and forecast lee et al 2019 have shown that ensemble predictions for flood events from cbenkf are more reliable and have larger resolution than those from enkf one may hence expect the adaptive cbenkf to provide more realistic quantification of dfs while improving predictive skill 3 3 adaptive extension in cbenkf prescribing the scalar weight for the cb penalty α is a significant source of uncertainty and potential subjectivity the choice of the value of α depends on whether the state of the uncertain system that manifests the predictor predictand relationship being observed is in a normal or extreme state if the system is at or near its median state α should be set to near zero so that cbenkf reduces to enkf and produces the least squares solution if the system is in an extreme state α should be set to a large value so that cb is reduced as much as possible the basic strategy for the adaptive extension is hence to prescribe a large weight if the true state is in the tail and a small weight if it is near median respectively kim et al 2018 shen et al 2019 because the true state is not known in reality α can only be prescribed suboptimally using synthetic experiments with known truth shen et al 2019 assessed the upper bound of the possible improvement by cbpkf over kf by prescribing α perfectly the results show that with uncertainty in α removed adaptive cbpkf is not only far superior to kf for large truth but also improves over kf in the unconditional sense as well this is because the adaptive extension renders α an implicit function of the uncertain true state which makes adaptive cbpkf a nonlinear filter whereas the upper bound of the performance seen in shen et al 2019 is not attainable in reality it is possible to use real time observations to infer the state of the hydrologic system and prescribe α objectively in the information theoretical sense α should be chosen such that the information content in the available observations chen and oliver 2013 in the current assimilation cycle is maximized for state estimation the dfs serves this purpose well in that maximizing dfs or equivalently minimizing dfn in the k th assimilation cycle maximizes the number of useful independent quantities of information in the observations related to the states in this work we optimize α by minimizing dfn which in a sequential linear filter amounts to minimizing weight averaged measurement post fit residual see eq 8 for the adaptive cbenkf we use the approximate solution for cbpkf referred to in shen et al 2019 as the variance inflated kf the analysis solution is given by 14 x k k x k k 1 k k z k h k x k k 1 in the above the gain given by 15 k k 1 α k σ k k 1 h k t r k h k 1 α k σ k k 1 h k t 1 the analysis error covariance solution is given by 16 σ k k σ 1 α k k k σ 1 α k 2 k k 1 σ 1 α k k k in the above σ β k k is the kf analysis error covariance in which forecast error covariance is inflated by a factor of β β 1 17 σ β k k i k k h k β σ k k 1 note that eqs 14 and 15 are identical to the kf counterparts except that σ k k 1 is inflated by a factor of 1 α k α k 0 because the approximate solution is built on the kf solution it offers an important alternative interpretation of α via analogy a positive α is an indication that due to cb the model prediction is in reality less informative than indicated by the enkf analysis error variance an infinitely large α is an indication that the model prediction is non informative due to infinitely large cb in the latter case state updating via the adaptive cbenkf using eq 14 is equivalent to fisher estimation based on observations only seo et al 2021 an important implication of the above information processing is that unlike enkf the adaptive cbenkf may not necessarily reduce the forecast error variance if cb is sufficiently large while counter intuitive in the context of kf and enkf which do not consider cb the above outcome can easily arise in reality if the model prediction suffers from large cb in which case one may not expect the forecast error variance to be realistic a drawback of the above approximate solution is that it monotonically but nonlinearly scales up α see fig 1 of shen et al 2019 as such one may consider the optimal α from adaptive cbenkf only as an inflated proxy for the actual weight for the cb penalty in eq 1 an overriding advantage of the approximate solution however is that owing to its simplicity eq 14 yields closed form expressions for the derivatives of dfn with respect to α with the first and second order derivatives accurately evaluated one may use the newton s method to optimize α cost effectively on average the resulting adaptive cbenkf is only about 2 to 3 times computationally more expensive than enkf for the study basins algorithmically the adaptive cbenkf can be easily implemented in any existing enkf code with the addition of the α optimization module for further details including a complete algorithmic description of the optimization of α the reader is referred to seo et al 2021 3 4 uncertainty modelling because the accuracy of dfs depends on the goodness of uncertainty modelling it is particularly important to model the dynamical and observational uncertainties as realistically and objectively as possible in this work we model observational errors as heteroscedastic and temporally uncorrelated for heteroscedastic modeling of observation errors for streamflow and map we used the following formulations sorooshian and dracup 1980 carpenter and georgakakos 2004 weerts and el serafy 2006 clark et al 2008 rakovec et al 2012 18 σ p c p z p c po 19 σ q c q z q c qo where z q and z p denote the streamflow and map observations respectively σ q and σ p denote the observation error standard deviations for streamflow and map in mm hr and cms respectively c q and c p denote the multiplicative coefficients for the streamflow and map observation error standard deviation respectively and c qo and c po denote the additive coefficients for the streamflow and map observation error standard deviation respectively the additive coefficients are necessary to keep the variance positive when the observation is zero for hourly mape we used a fixed observational uncertainty of 1 mm hr 2 the coefficients in eqs 18 and 19 should be carefully chosen as inaccurate heteroscedastic modeling may be counter productive compared to homoscedastic modeling rafieeinasab et al 2014 ideally the parameters should be estimated based on statistical analysis using the truth due to lack of such data however the coefficients are prescribed in this work using a combination of the literature review carpenter and georgakakos 2004 weerts and el serafy 2006 clark et al 2008 rakovec et al 2012 and limited sensitivity analysis based on the above we chose 0 15 and 0 25 for c q and c qo respectively and 0 4 and 0 25 for c p and c po respectively because runoff is not directly observed variance of x k r cannot be estimated empirically in this work it is inferred from the observed and simulated streamflow via the following steps assuming stationarity of w τ in eq 5 within the duration of the uh we have for error variance of simulated streamflow 20 σ eq 2 σ rs 2 0 t 0 t u t τ u t s d s d τ where σ eq 2 denotes the error variance of simulated streamflow and σ rs 2 denotes the runoff error variance one may develop an empirical relationship between σ eq 2 and the observed flow and use eq 18 to express σ rs 2 as a function of σ eq 2 and hence of the observed flow rafieeinasab et al 2014 for the relationship between σ eq 2 and observed flow we used linear regression for simplicity though nonlinear modeling is likely to improve accuracy 4 results and discussion in this section we present the comparative evaluation results and offer discussion for each basin the adaptive cbenkf and enkf were run for all events whose peak flow exceeded 100 m3 s within the 12 yr period of record of 1996 through 2007 we then verified ensemble mean and ensemble streamflow analysis and predictions from the twin hindcasting experiments using the adaptive cbenkf and enkf both filters were initialized identically at the beginning of each event and run independently of each other every hour under the identical conditions for the entire event the process was then repeated until all events were exhausted skillful da performance in times of very poor ics is an extremely important consideration for event based flood forecasting kim et al 2020 to reflect performance under wide ranging qualities of the ics we also included the warmup periods for sac in the evaluation as such the base simulation has very large errors in the ics in the early part of the assimilation horizon resulting in severe under simulation for a very tough test for da lee et al 2019 showed that the cbenkf ensembles are generally more reliable and has better resolution than the enkf ensembles and that the continuous ranked probability score crps hersbach 2000 and continuous ranked probability skill score results are qualitatively very similar to root mean square error rmse and mean square error skill score of ensemble mean results respectively as such here we focus mainly on the rmse of ensemble mean results ensemble mean is sensitive to extreme ensemble members whereas crps benefits from the smoothing effects as such rmse tends to be less favorable to ensemble prediction than mean crps in addition rmse of ensemble mean allows the user to assess readily the practical significance of the improvement a large ensemble size of 200 was used for all experiments to reduce sampling uncertainty 4 1 ensemble streamflow analysis and flow dependent information content to provide a visual sense of how the ensemble analysis of the adaptive cbenkf may differ from that of enkf we show in fig 4 examples of the adaptive cbenkf and enkf ensemble analysis results all da results in the figure are based on the weakly constrained implementation or wc see section 3 1 it is reminded that the dfn minimizing α values from the adaptive cbenkf shown at the bottom do not represent the actual weight for the cb penalty but a nonlinearly inflated proxy see subsection 3 3 the dfs evaluated by the adaptive cbenkf and enkf is shown at the top without the y axis to avoid clutter these examples are mostly associated severe underprediction by the base simulation and are chosen to highlight the differences between the two filters in each of fig 4a through 4d the dfs for the adaptive cbenkf bottoms out at the lower bound of zero whereas that for enkf tops out at the upper bounds of 15 7 27 5 22 6 and 8 1 for djct2 lynt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 or 23 31 31 and 26 of the total number of the state variables of 67 88 73 and 31 respectively in the augmented state vector y k in eq 7 fig 4 shows that in general dfs varies inversely with the observed streamflow the dfs values are similar between the adaptive cbenkf and enkf in low flows where the maximum dfs occurs in high flows however they differ significantly because the assimilation of observations in the adaptive cbenkf cannot overcome the loss of information content in the model prediction due to large cb as indicated by large values of α for enkf the decline in dfs is less severe when the hydrograph first begins to rise but drops to minima of 0 6 1 8 1 7 and 0 6 for dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 from the maxima of 15 7 27 5 22 6 and 8 1 respectively the enkf results show that the marginal information content of the observations is strongly flow dependent depleted rather quickly as the hydrograph first rises and regained gradually over the receding limb the above pattern is significantly more pronounced for the adaptive cbenkf results due to the fact that when significant type i i error i e failure to detect is present the model prediction is necessarily less informative than indicated by the forecast error variance it is readily seen in fig 4 that the cbenkf analysis generally tracks the observed hydrographs more closely than the enkf analysis for superior resolution and that the cbenkf ensemble spread tends to capture the observed flow better than the enkf for superior reliability in fig 4a the adaptive cbenkf invokes a large α of about 18 in the 1541st assimilation cycle when the hydrograph rises very rapidly this spike in α is an indication that the model prediction is largely non informative and hence the adaptive cbenkf relies mostly on the observations for state estimation the result is that the adaptive cbenkf analysis is closer the observed and the ensemble spread is much larger than that of the enkf analysis in reflection of the increased uncertainty due to large cb note also that though the cbenkf ensemble mean is still significantly below the observed flow its 99th percentile closely approaches the observed peak whereas the enkf ensembles show little indication of the sharp peak in fig 4b the overall difference between the two da results is not very large the adaptive cbenkf however is able to keep up with the fastest rise in the hydrograph in the upper part of the rising limb whereas enkf falls well short in the early part of the rising limb the adaptive cbenkf is able to recognize large errors and hence lack of information content in the model prediction with a very large α the adaptive cbenkf lifts the analysis close to the observed flow in the 58th assimilation cycle the enkf on the other hand overweights the model prediction which not only delays the rise of the analysis hydrograph but also keeps the ensemble analysis underspread fig 4c shows a relative performance similar to fig 4b the adaptive cbenkf tracks the fast rising limb much better than the enkf though the former is not able to reach the observed peak due to the severe underprediction in the base simulation note also in the rising limb that the adaptive cbenkf analysis has a much larger ensemble spread than enkf in reflection of the increased uncertainty due to cb unlike the first three case the base simulation in fig 4d trails observed flow by a significant margin the adaptive cbenkf recognizes this delayed model response and in the 376th and 377th assimilation cycles invokes very large values of α in reflection of the largely non informative model predictions this cb awareness enables the adaptive cbenkf analysis to track the observed flow very closely whereas enkf overweights the model predictions resulting in a much delayed and suppressed rise in the first peak for the second peak enkf over responds to the rise in the model prediction as may be seen in the base simulation leading to too early a rise and overshooting of the peak flow the adaptive cbenkf on the other hand recognizes that the model prediction has larger errors than indicated by the forecast error variance and invokes a very large α in the 417th assimilation cycle this spike in α results in increased ensemble spread in reflection of the non informative model prediction and allows the adaptive cbenkf to track the observed flow very closely in all 4 cases in fig 4 spikes in α occur near the base of the rising limb where dfs drops rapidly the above pattern arises because the hydrologic system is likely to be most under determined for streamflow prediction when discharge first emerges at the outlet due to the increased number of possible surface and subsurface flow paths one may hence expect the degrees of freedom for the inverse problem to quickly increase near the base of the rising limb the above observations point out the importance of accurately estimating both the timing and magnitude of the cb penalty for cb aware da to be highly effective 4 2 ensemble mean streamflow prediction fig 5 shows the rmse vs lead time for all 6 basins these results include all streamflow observations within the partial duration time series of all events whose peaks exceed 100 cms for wc the reduction in rmse by adaptive cbenkf analysis over enkf is about 38 6 31 0 21 7 42 1 15 2 and 40 4 with sample sizes of 2282 1584 4604 3036 1966 and 2864 for dcjt2 lynt2 mdst2 mtpt2 reft2 and sbmt2 respectively the above reductions in rmse translates into gains of a few to several hours in lead time fig 5 indicates that in general wc and mc perform similarly whereas the performance of sc drops off significantly it suggests that the positive impact of da comes mainly from reducing biases in map and mape and providing the sac with higher quality ics at the beginning of the assimilation window that mtpt2 shows the largest positive impact of da among the 6 basins is a reflection of the large storage of water in this humid basin and the resulting stronger hydrologic memory it is interesting to note that sc performs comparably to wc and mc for mtpt2 for the adaptive cbenkf but not for enkf it points out the importance of accounting for cb even when hydrologic uncertainty is relatively small for sbmt2 wc and mc are superior to sc only for shorter lead times it is suspected that for these basins the performance of da is adversely impacted by timing errors at longer lead times as explained below liu et al 2011 reported that reft2 and sbmt2 have significant timing errors for which the model simulation tends to trail the observed in such cases da is likely to over adjust the control variables when the catchment starts to respond to precipitation such over adjustment makes reducing hydrologic uncertainty particularly challenging and tends to result in phase errors in da aided predictions overall fig 5 shows that the adaptive cbenkf improves over enkf consistently and significantly regardless of the level of hydrologic uncertainty modeled fig 6 is the same as fig 5 but for mean crps in these results no da refers to the base ensemble prediction rather than the base single valued prediction shown in fig 5 the base ensemble predictions in fig 6 show larger mean crps at shorter lead times which gradually decreases asymptotically the above pattern arises because the base ensemble prediction is newly generated in each assimilation cycle by perturbing the base single valued prediction for ensemble da only rather than for actual prediction with little consideration for ensemble quality the mean crps results are generally similar to the rmse results but present a more favorable picture for both adaptive cbenkf and enkf than the rmse results and a somewhat more favorable picture for the adaptive cbenkf than for enkf compared to the rmse results the adaptive cbenkf renders α an implicit function of the uncertain true state to elicit performance of a nonlinear filter if successful one may expect the adaptive cbenkf to improve over the fixed α implementation of cbenkf lee et al 2019 fig 7 tests the above hypothesis by comparing the adaptive cbenkf with the fixed α cbenkf and enkf all da results in fig 7 are based on wc the performance of the fixed α cbenkf necessarily depends on the choice of the α value ideally α should be optimized problem specifically under the user s choice of performance criteria in this work we chose α values based on limited sensitivity analysis similar to lee et al 2019 fig 7 shows that the fix α cbenkf performs comparably to or slightly better than the adaptive cbenkf at short lead times but its performance deteriorates to the level of enkf at longer lead times the overall differences are however relatively small because its performance envelope formed the adaptive cbenkf and enkf is rather narrow qualitatively the above results are not very surprising in that the fixed α cbenkf tends to overfit the observations which provides good performance at short lead times but at the expense of reduced performance at longer lead time we now turn out attention to comparative evaluation of adaptive cbenkf conditioned on α if the adaptive extension prescribes α skillfully we may expect cbenkf to outperform enkf by larger margins than seen above when the dfn minimizing α is large assessment of this conditional performance is particularly important for flood forecasting in that the larger the verifying observed flow is the larger the cb and hence α tends to be see fig 4 fig 8 abc show the rmse vs lead time for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively these basins are least impacted by timing errors and hence are better suited for the conditional evaluation the results in fig 8abc are conditioned on the dfn minimizing α exceeding the mean of such α values over the entire assimilation horizon in these figures the rmse associated with the no da results tends to decrease as the lead time increases this is because larger α tends occur more frequently over the receding limb due to its longer duration than over the rising limb accordingly the verifying observed flow associated with larger α tends to decrease as the lead time increases comparison of fig 8abc with fig 5acd indicates that the margin of improvement by adaptive cbenkf over enkf is on average larger when a large cb penalty is invoked the reduction in rmse by the adaptive cbenkf over enkf in fig 8abc is approximately 42 6 26 4 and 60 4 for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively fig 8def show the rmse vs lead time for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively for the verifying observed flow exceeding 200 cms regardless of α fig 8def are to be compared with fig 5acd respectively which show the unconditional results it is seen that the margin of improvement by adaptive cbenkf over enkf is generally larger when only high flows are considered the relative reduction in rmse for ensemble mean analysis by adaptive cbenkf over enkf is 40 9 24 1 and 26 7 for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 respectively also shown in fig 8 at lead time of 0 are the 95 confidence intervals assessed via bootstrapping which indicate that the improvement by the adaptive cbenkf over enkf is statistically significant finally we examine the comparative performance of adaptive cbenkf for rising vs falling limbs given that the rate of change in streamflow is generally larger in the rising limb than in the falling limb one may hypothesize that cb and hence the positive impact of cb aware da may be larger in the rising limb to assess this we conditioned the predictions on increasing vs decreasing observed flow as a proxy for rising vs falling limbs admittedly this stratification is only approximate in that streamflow may increase and decrease within falling and rising limbs respectively fig 9 shows the rmse vs lead time for dcjt2 mdst2 and mtpt2 conditional on the verifying observation exceeding 150 cms for each pair the upper and lower panels are further conditioned on increasing vs decreasing flows respectively because the magnitude of flow is generally smaller for decreasing flow and the sample size is not the same head to head comparisons are not readily possible nevertheless it may be seen in fig 9 that the marginal improvement by adaptive cbenkf over enkf tends to be somewhat larger over the rising limb than over the falling limb additional research is needed however for more rigorous evaluation based on a large number of basins in diverse hydroclimatological regions 5 conclusions floods are associated with extreme states of the hydrologic system which can only be observed with significant uncertainty as such data assimilation da for flood forecasting is subject to conditional bias cb which adversely impacts optimal information fusion this work describes cb aware da based on an adaptive extension of the conditional bias penalized ensemble kalman filter cbenkf and comparatively evaluates with the ensemble kalman filter enkf for 6 headwater basins in texas using the nws s operational lumped hydrologic models cb aware da and the degrees of freedom for signal are then used to quantify the marginal information content of the observations the main findings and conclusions follow below cb arises very frequently in varying magnitude when assimilating streamflow observations during the catchment s response to precipitation and drainage in general the larger the discharge is the larger the cb is the flow dependent marginal information content in the observations varies with the streamflow response of the catchment and the magnitude of cb and tends to decrease and increase in the rising and falling phases of the hydrograph respectively adaptive cbenkf improves over enkf consistently and significantly regardless of the level of hydrologic uncertainty modeled the improvement is particularly large during sharp rises of the outlet hydrograph with large peak flow or when the model prediction is non informative due to large cb cb aware da is hence likely to have the largest positive impact for forecasting of rising flood flows in fast responding basins as well as for basins for which skillful hydrologic prediction is particularly challenging the overall findings indicate that cb aware da with information content analysis offers an objective framework for dynamically balancing the flow dependent predictive skill of hydrologic models quality and frequency of hydrologic observation and scheduling of the da cycle toward cost

3709,error estimation and data fusion are critical to improving the accuracy of global model and satellite based precipitation products for practical applications however they face challenges over vast areas of the world due to limited ground observations triple collocation tc method can overcome this limitation and provide an efficient way for error estimation without the ground truth and thus also for data fusion by leveraging multi source observations and model outputs which have been increasingly available in recent years in this work we conducted a comprehensive study on error estimation and data fusion of a number of global gridded precipitation products over the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 using tc and multiplicative tc mtc methods we use three satellite based precipitation products such as the imerg final imerg f persiann cdr pcdr and sm2rain ascat sm2r and one reanalysis dataset era5 which contains precipitation estimates they were grouped into two tc triplets based on different combinations imerg f sm2r era5 and pcdr sm2r era5 for performance evaluation the tc based error estimation methods were compared to the traditional method using rain gauge data and the tc based data fusion methods were compared with two widely used data fusion methods bayesian model averaging bma and random forest based merging procedure rf mep results showed that era5 had the best performance with the largest correlation coefficient cc 0 435 while pcdr had the worst accuracy with the smallest cc 0 304 and the largest absolute relative bias rb 0 365 tc tended to underestimate the root mean square error rmse with respect to the traditional gauged based method but mtc showed a consistent result owing to the employment of a multiplicative error model the performance of tc based data fusion methods had no significant difference from bma and rf mep all data fusion results were better than the original triplets as the mean cc value increased from 0 38 to 0 47 and the mean rmse decreased from 15 0 to 13 5 mm day in addition we found that the zero value replacement in mtc had great influence on error estimation while had limited impacts on data fusion keywords triple collocation multiple gridded precipitation estimates error estimation data fusion yangtze river basin 1 introduction precipitation is essential in the studies of global climate change and hydrological cycle kidd and huffman 2011 ashouri et al 2015 accurate precipitation estimates are also critical for hydrological simulation natural disaster prevention and decision makings in economy ecology agriculture and many other fields rogelis and werner 2018 this is particularly important for the yangtze river basin which is vulnerable to heavy rainfall and frequent floods caused by east asian monsoon wang et al 2013 the great flood in 1998 in yangtze river has caused huge losses to national economy and people s life zong and chen 2000 ground based observations rain gauge or gauge corrected ground radar data are generally considered as the most accurate observations of precipitation however the rain gauges are spatially sparse due to limited deployments over complex terrains and harsh natural environment and the ground radar data often contain large errors over complex terrain areas ebrahimi et al 2017 therefore the ground based observations are difficult to obtain detailed precipitation information over the regions where large topographic gradients present such as the yangtze river basin in recent years spatially continuous precipitation estimates from various satellite and reanalysis based products have been increasingly available providing an alternative approach for high resolution precipitation monitoring from global and regional scales ebert et al 2007 satgé et al 2020 the global satellite precipitation products include the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 tropical rainfall measuring mission multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2015 and soil moisture to rain advanced scatterometer sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 however the satellite based precipitation estimates suffer from random and systemic errors owing to insufficient sampling and imperfect retrieval algorithms behrangi and wen 2017 thus different satellite based precipitation products usually have season and location dependent performances because of the variations in data sources and retrieval algorithm s skills the global reanalysis products such as era interim the interim european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis cite and era5 the 5 th generation ecmwf reanalysis cite also contain precipitation fields due to the observation errors of meteorological inputs and the deficiencies of forecast models there are also large errors in the reanalysis based precipitation estimates as a whole these gridded precipitation products are an indirect way to monitor precipitation the embedded errors should be assessed before real world applications based on error estimates different gridded precipitation products can be further integrated via data fusion to fully take advantage of their relative strengths and improve the quality of precipitation estimation plenty of studies have investigated the errors in different precipitation products in recent years e g li et al 2015 yong et al 2015 tang et al 2016 beck et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 tan et al 2018 chen et al 2020 tang et al 2020 however these studies generally considered the rain gauge observations as ground truth error free for validation which may lead to challenges at the regions where reliable and dense gauge data is limited or unavailable li et al 2018 triple collocation tc method was originally developed by stoffelen 1998 to assess the errors of ocean wind speed products but recently it has been applied in many other fields for error estimation such as soil moisture dong and crow 2017 surface albedo wu et al 2019 and land water storage van dijk et al 2014 compared to traditional gauge based verification tc method provides an efficient way to quantify errors using three independent input products without knowing of the true values of target variables alemohammad et al 2015 for the error estimation of gridded precipitation data roebeling et al 2012 firstly employed tc method to evaluate the errors associated with the precipitation estimates from three weather radars in the europe an extended tc etc method was developed by mccoll et al 2014 to estimate the root mean square error rmse as well as the correlation coefficient cc between each collocated variable and the unknown true values both tc and etc methods were established based on the assumption that precipitation estimates can be related to the true values in the form of an additive model however it is generally recognized that the multiplicative model has a better prediction capability and is more suitable for error estimation of daily precipitation tian et al 2013 by replacing the additive error model with a multiplicative error model alemohammad et al 2015 developed a multiplicative tc mtc method to evaluate precipitation products over the united states li et al 2018 adopted mtc to evaluate different precipitation products over china and it was found that mtc could be an appropriate option for error estimation however the applicability and superiority of tc and mtc methods in precipitation error estimation needs further investigations meanwhile the fusion of multi source precipitation data has been implemented in many recent studies data fusion can synthesize multi source information and shows better performance than all or most of the individual precipitation estimate ma et al 2018 a variety of precipitation data fusion methods have been proposed including the optimal interpolation xie and xiong 2011 linearized weighting procedure woldemeskel et al 2013 non parametric kernel smoothing li and shao 2010 bayesian analysis wang et al 2012 ma et al 2018 ma et al 2021 and random forest based merging procedure rf mep baez villanuev et al 2020 however these methods usually require information from rain gauges which are limited or even unavailable in vast areas of the world since tc methods can characterize the errors of three independent measurements it is straightforward to also use them to derive a better precipitation estimate through merging multi source precipitation data so far only a few studies have focused on tc based methods for precipitation merging dong et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 these studies have shown that tc based methods had great potential in data fusion without the requirement of rain gauge data however there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation on the tc based data fusion methods in comparison to other data fusion methods to address the above knowledge gaps this study investigated the error estimation and data fusion of multiple gridded precipitation products over the yangtze river basin using the tc based methods tc and mtc the tc based data fusion methods were also compared with two commonly used data fusion methods bma and rf mep the main objectives of this study are to 1 assess the errors of multiple gridded precipitation products using tc and mtc methods 2 evaluate the performance of the tc based data fusion methods in comparison to other commonly used methods 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin is located within a latitude of 24 30 35 45 n and a longitude of 90 30 124 30 e and is the largest river basin in china the yangtze river originates from the tanggula mountain and flows through 19 provinces from the west to the east china sea with a catchment area of 1 8 million km2 the terrain over the yangtze river basin is extremely complex the elevation is slanted downward from the west 3500 5000 m to the east below 500 m fig 1 a forest grassland and arable land dry land and paddy field are the main land cover types accounting for 91 3 of the total watershed area fig 1b affected by both summer southwest monsoon and southeast monsoon most regions of the yangtze river basin is dominated by a sub tropical monsoon climate and the average annual precipitation is approximately 1100 mm li 2015 2 2 datasets four different daily precipitation products including imerg final persiann cdr sm2rain ascat and era5 were used in this study for the evaluation over yangtze river basin during the period 2015 2018 sm2rain ascat was selected as it is produced based on remotely sensed soil moisture and thus it can be regarded as an independent precipitation estimate relative to reanalysis based precipitation estimates and the other satellite based precipitation estimates e g imerg f and pcdr sm2rain ascat and imerg final data were resampled to 0 25 resolution using linear interpolation to be consistent with persiann cdr and era5 a brief description of each precipitation product is presented in the following subsections 2 2 1 gpm imerg v06 the global precipitation measurement gpm mission was launched on february 27 in 2014 by the united states national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa as the new generation global satellite based precipitation observatory gpm provides precipitation estimates at a 0 1 spatial resolution with spatial coverage from 60 s to 60 n

huffman et al 2015 the latest released imerg final v06b data denoted as imerg f at daily scale were used in this study the product is available at https gpm1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov data gpm l3 2 2 2 persiann cdr persiann is a satellite based precipitation retrieval algorithm to convert the infrared ir information from geostationary satellites into rain rates using an artificial neural network technique ashouri et al 2015 the persiann cdr data denoted as pcdr are derived by adjusting persiann estimates using gpcp monthly precipitation and it provides daily precipitation estimates at 0 25 spatial resolution from 1983 to present with a spatial coverage between 60 s and 60 n the pcdr daily precipitation data which are available at https www ncei noaa gov data precipitation persiann access sorooshian et al 2014 were used in the study 2 2 3 sm2rain ascat the sm2rain ascat denoted as sm2r dataset provides global daily rainfall estimates from 2007 to june 2020 with a spatial resolution of 12 5 km and it is derived from ascat satellite soil moisture sm observations using the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 the sm2rain algorithm uses two successive sm retrievals to estimate rainfall by the calculation of the difference between two successive sm measurements based on the inversion of water balance equation brocca et al 2019 this study uses the version 1 1 sm2rain ascat daily product which is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3405563 2 2 4 era5 era5 is the new generation of global atmospheric reanalysis precipitation estimation developed by the european center for medium range weather forecasts the era5 data has been produced by the numerical weather forecast modeling and data assimilation based on humidity and temperature information hersbach et al 2018 the era5 reanalysis precipitation product at daily scale with a 0 25 resolution is available at https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 and was used in this study 2 2 5 rain gauge data rain gauge data denoted as gauge from 615 gauge stations over the yangtze river basin during 2015 2018 was obtained from the china meteorological administration in this study the dataset provides hourly precipitation records from about 2400 automatic weather stations over china since january 1951 with a series of rigorous quality controls shen et al 2010 in this study the hourly precipitation data was accumulated to daily precipitation 3 methodology 3 1 tc based methods for error estimation and data fusion 3 1 1 triple collocation tc tc can be used to quantify the error variance of geophysical variables using three independent measurements without the requirement of ground truth data dong et al 2020 it should be noted that tc is established based on a fundamental assumption that three collocated variables have zero mean residual errors and are uncorrelated with each other and with the true values alemohammad et al 2015 the standard form of tc is shown as follows 1 p i α i β i p true ε i where p i and ε i i 1 2 3 represent the ith precipitation estimates and the ith observation errors of the unknown true value p true respectively α i and β i represent the intercept and slope respectively in the tc method the observation error ε i is an additive factor based on the solution of the covariance of eq 1 a 3 3 covariance matrix can be obtained as shown in eq 2 the three diagonal elements of the covariance matrix represent the variances of three collocated estimates which can be calculated by eq 3 2 c ij c o v p i p j β i β j σ p true 2 3 σ p i 2 d p i d α i β i p true ε i β i 2 σ p true 2 σ ε i 2 where c ij is the covariance between two different input collocated estimates d and cov represent the variance and covariance respectively σ is the standard variance by the combination of eq 2 and eq 3 we can deduce eq 4 6 details of the derivation process can be found in li et al 2018 it can be found that the rmse σ ε i 2 between each collocated estimate and the true value can be obtained without the known of σ p true 4 σ ε 1 2 σ p 1 2 β 1 2 σ p true 2 c 11 c 13 c 23 c 12 5 σ ε 2 2 σ p 2 2 β 2 2 σ p true 2 c 22 c 12 c 23 c 13 6 σ ε 3 2 σ p 3 2 β 3 2 σ p true 2 c 33 c 13 c 23 c 12 3 1 2 multiplicative triple collocation mtc different from tc the mtc method adopted multiplicative error model to estimate errors of daily precipitation alemohammad et al 2015 in the multiplicative error model the random error e ε i is a multiplicative factor the multiplicative error model is defined as 7 p i α i p true β i e ε i by the logarithmic transformation and the substitutions of α i ln α i r true ln p true and r i ln p i the eq 7 can be simplified to the linear form in eq 8 8 r i α i β i r true ε i similar to the solution of rmse in tc the rmse in mtc was calculated according to eq 4 6 however it is noted that rmse results are in logarithmic scale in the mtc method which makes them meaningless in this study the eq 9 which was proposed by alemohammad et al 2015 was adopted to estimate the real rmse σ p i 9 σ p i μ p i σ r i where σ r i represents the rmse in logarithmic scale μ p i represents the mean of the original precipitation data 3 1 3 least squares based data fusion a least squares based data fusion method proposed by yilmaz et al 2012 was used to calculate the weight of each collocated estimate in this study based on the tc and mtc estimates the basic function of the least squares based data fusion is shown as follows 10 p f ω 1 p 1 ω 2 p 2 ω 3 p 3 s t ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 where ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are the weight of each collocated estimate respectively p f is the desired fused precipitation estimation by calculating the variance of eq 10 the eq 11 is obtained the weights can be calculated by eq 12 14 based on the object of minimizing σ p f 2 11 σ p f 2 ω 1 2 σ p 1 2 ω 2 2 σ p 1 2 1 ω 1 ω 2 2 σ p 3 2 12 ω 1 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 13 ω 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 14 ω 3 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 using the above obtained weights the data fusion results of multi source precipitation data can be achieved by eq 10 without the requirement of rain gauge data it should be noted that the p f results obtained by mtc are in logarithmic scale therefore an inverse transformation must be conducted using eq 15 to obtain the real p f in the mtc method 15 p f exp ω 1 r 1 ω 2 r 2 ω 3 r 3 3 2 experiment design due to the requirement of three independent input precipitation data in the tc based methods tc and mtc four precipitation products at daily scale over yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 imerg f pcdr sm2r and era5 were grouped into two triplets triplet a imerg f sm2r era5 triplet b pcdr sm2r era5 to satisfy the requirement both of era5 and sm2r precipitation products are included in each triplet and the remaining precipitation product in each triplet is the imerg f and pcdr respectively the purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the errors of multiple precipitation datasets by tc and mtc methods without the ground observations the results from tc based methods were then compared with the traditional method the traditional method is to calculate error statistics of products using gauge data that are considered as ground truth in addition the same precipitation product in different triplets may have different results which will influence the stability of tc based methods in this study the variable control method was adopted to analyze the reliability and stability of the tc based methods through the comparison of rmse of sm2r and era5 in two different triplets triple a and triple b since the zero values of precipitation data should be replaced in the mtc method before the implement of logarithmic transformation li et al 2018 seven different replacement values 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 and 10 9 were tested to assess the influence of zero value replacement on error estimation and data fusion using the triple a in this study the tc based data fusion methods were also compared with two commonly used data fusion methods bma and rf mep more details about the bma and rf mep methods can be found in wang et al 2012 and baez villanuev et al 2020 in this study the bma and rf mep data fusion methods also included two triples that were used in tc based data fusion methods triplet a imerg f sm2r era5 triplet b pcdr sm2r era5 all of the four gridded precipitation products and the rain gauge data had daily precipitation data from 2015 to 2018 over yangtze river basin because the bma and rf mep methods require the input of rain gauge data the cross validation method was adopted in this study to ensure independent validation of the data fusion results specifically all 615 gauges data are randomly divided into three equal parts each part includes 205 gauges two parts data from 410 gauges were used to train the bma and rf mep models and the remaining one of the three equal parts was used to evaluate the merged precipitation this process was repeated for three times and then the merged precipitation is validated for all gauges it is noted that the topography related datasets were excluded in the rf mep method to make it comparable with the bma method and the two main parameters the number of regression trees and the node size in the rf regression model mentioned by baez villanuev et al 2020 were set as 200 and 5 respectively by a grid search algorithm in which the parameter sets with the best training result were selected 3 3 evaluation metrics all statistical analysis between grid based precipitation estimates and point based rain gauge data was conducted in a direct comparison way using the nearest neighbor method chen et al 2018 only the grids containing at least one rain gauge were assessed and the other grids with no rain gauges were excluded from the evaluation four commonly used metrics including cc rmse relative rmse rrmse and relative bias rb table 1 were used to evaluate the quality of the gridded precipitation products and the performances of data fusion methods using rain gauge data the csi was also calculated to quantitatively assess the precipitation detection ability by identifying rain no rain events csi represents the overall fraction of precipitation events correctly detected by the gridded precipitation estimates two different rainfall rates 1 and 25 mm day respectively were set to calculate the csi csi 1 and csi 25 respectively because the rainfall rates below 1 mm day and over 25 mm day represent light precipitation and heavy precipitation respectively and the evaluation of light heavy precipitation are prone to large uncertainties tian et al 2009 4 results 4 1 accuracy of multiple gridded precipitation products with the traditional method table 2 shows the accuracy evaluation results of different gridded precipitation products in the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 at daily scale using the traditional method with rain gauge data the cc results of imerg f pcdr sm2r and era5 were 0 394 0 304 0 381 and 0 435 respectively era5 and sm2r had relatively smaller rmse and rrmse than those of imerg f and pcdr all gridded precipitation estimates had negative rb indicating an underestimation of rain gauge data in the yangtze river basin pcdr had poor performance with the smallest cc and largest absolute rb in terms of csi imerg f had the largest csi 25 indicating the best performance for heavy rainfall detection compared with csi 1 and csi 25 it could be found that all gridded precipitation estimates had poor detection ability for heavy rainfall with small csi 25 as a whole era5 had the best performance with relatively small rrmse and relatively large cc as well as csi values fig 2 shows the mean daily rainfall of four gridded precipitation products and rain gauge observations from 2015 to 2018 at each gauge station in the yangtze river basin the spatial patterns of four gridded precipitation products showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest which is consistent with the rain gauge data the large mean daily precipitation approximately 6 0 mm day was mainly distributed in eastern part of the yangtze river basin while the small mean daily precipitation less than 2 0 mm day was mainly distributed in western part when compared to the rain gauge data sm2r and era5 had larger mean daily precipitation in the central parts of the yangtze river basin pcdr had obvious underestimation in the eastern part of the yangtze river basin compared to the other three gridded precipitation products as a whole imerg f had more similar spatial pattern to the rain gauge data fig 3 shows the evaluation metrics cc rmse and rrmse of multiple gridded precipitation products from 2015 to 2018 at each gauge station in the yangtze river basin the cc of four gridded precipitation estimates were large in the eastern parts and small in the western parts of the yangtze river basin in terms of cc pcdr had the worst performance in space the rmse had a consistent trend with the mean daily precipitation showing a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest all gridded precipitation estimates had large rrmse in the sichuan basin where dry land is the main land cover type as shown in fig 1b indicating a poor accuracy in such region 4 2 error assessment by the tc based methods table 3 presents the influence of zero value replacement in the mtc method on error estimation rmse results of imerg f in triple a the rmse values increased when the replacement data varies from 10 3 to 10 9 the rmse value was the smallest 15 62 mm day when the zero value replacement was 10 3 and was the largest 42 06 mm day when the zero value replacement was 10 9 the estimated rmse was close to the traditional method when zero value replacement was 10 3 similar results were also found in the error estimation of pcdr in triple b results are not shown for conciseness therefore 10 3 was finally used as zero value replacement in error estimation of the mtc method fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of rmse derived by tc based error estimation methods tc and mtc table 4 shows the statistic results of rmse of two different triplets a and b by tc based methods and traditional method the spatial distributions of rmse by the tc based methods were consistent with the spatial distributions of mean daily precipitation showing a descending gradient from southeast to northwest the rmse results of imerg f and pcdr by tc were obviously smaller than those by mtc method and traditional method in the entire region from the statistic results of rmse by three different error estimation methods it was found that the mtc method is similar to the traditional method while the tc method had a significant underestimation in terms of two different triplets the rmse of sm2r and era5 had no significant differences between the two different triplets a and b indicating the reliability and stability of tc and mtc methods 4 3 evaluation and comparison of tc based precipitation merging methods table 5 shows the influence of zero value replacement in the mtc method on data fusion results of triple a three statistic metrics cc rmse and rrmse were calculated between rain gauge data and the data fusion results of triplet a three metrics of the data fusion results had no significant difference by using seven different replacement values which indicated the zero value replacement had no substantial influence on the result of precipitation data fusion similar phenomena was also found in the data fusion results of triplet b results are not shown for conciseness therefore the value of 10 3 also used in error estimation was finally used as zero value replacement in the mtc method for precipitation data fusion fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of weights of each collocated estimate used in the tc and mtc data fusion methods in the yangtze river basin for the two triplets in tc sm2r had obviously higher weights than the other collocated precipitation estimates the weights of sm2r and era5 in tc triplet a were similar to those in tc triplet b while the weight of imerg f in tc triplet a was lower than pcdr in tc triplet b for the two triplets in mtc sm2r had relatively high weights in the east of the yangtze river basin while era5 had relatively high weights in the west of the yangtze river basin as a whole the same precipitation product e g sm2r and era5 in different triplets of tc or mtc method had stable results of weight however different data fusion methods e g tc triplet a and mtc triplet a have certain differences in weight because there is a logarithmic transformation of the precipitation data in the mtc method fig 6 presents the data fusion results of mean daily precipitation of two different triplets by tc mtc bma and rf mep methods in the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 for each data fusion method the merged mean daily precipitation showed similar spatial pattern and was consistent with the rain gauge data the data fusion results of mean daily precipitation by mtc method was smaller than those by tc bma and rf mep methods especially in the southeast of the yangtze river basin between triplet a and b it was found that the data fusion results of mean daily precipitation of triplet a were larger than those of triplet b which was relevant to the precipitation amount of imerg f and sm2r table 6 shows the evaluation metrics of data fusion results of two different triplets by tc mtc bma and rf mep methods using rain gauge data compared to the original triplets table 2 the data fusion results were improved in accuracy the mean cc increased from about 0 38 to 0 47 and the mean rmse decreased from about 15 0 to 13 5 mm day between triplet a and b the data fusion results of triplet a had better performances than those of triplet b with smaller rmse larger cc and csi values between different data fusion methods the evaluation metrics of four data fusion methods had no significant difference the data fusion results by tc based methods were sensitive to the accuracy of the original input data and showed negative values of rb as a whole the rf mep method had the largest csi values and the smallest absolute rb indicating the best performance 5 discussion four global gridded precipitation estimates imerg f pcdr sm2r and era5 were selected in this study to test the performances of the tc based methods for error estimation and data fusion the comprehensive assessment on four gridded precipitation products showed that four precipitation estimates decreased from the southeast to the northwest in space which was consistent with the rain gauge data it is typically influenced by the land and sea distance altitude and monsoon climate li et al 2013 era5 had better performances with smaller rmse and larger cc previous studies have reported that the sm2rain method is good at achieving low rmse because it can accurately reproduce the accumulated rainfall over a period of time ciabatta et al 2017 brocca et al 2019 among the four products sm2r had relatively small rmse in the yangtze river basin however the above estimations were all based on the traditional evaluation method which can only assess the performance of the pixel based precipitation products at the rain gauge station the precipitation observation errors over the regions without gauge stations cannot be evaluated in addition it is noted that there is a typical scale mismatch issue between point based rain gauge data and grid based precipitation estimates ebrahimi et al 2017 this could be a source of error in evaluation of gridded precipitation products using the traditional method with rain gauge observations as the ground reference therefore in this study the tc based methods tc and mtc were adopted to estimate errors of the multiple gridded precipitation products without the requirement of rain gauge data compared to the traditional method rmse estimated by tc had an obvious underestimation while rmse estimated by mtc had very small differences indicating the applicability of mtc method for error assessment it is mainly because the multiplicative model adopted in mtc method is more appropriate at daily scale to represent the relationship between precipitation observation errors and the rainfall true values hossain and anagnostou 2006 similar findings are presented in alemohammad et al 2015 and li et al 2018 this consistency demonstrates the superiority of the mtc method for error estimation than tc method in addition since the error statistics of different precipitation products could be obtained by the tc based methods the obtained rmse results have the potential to be incorporated into data fusion algorithms alemohammad et al 2015 dong et al 2020 the data fusion results by tc and mtc methods were similar and both showed better performances than the original triplets in addition the data fusion results showed that the tc based methods are approximate to the commonly used bma and rf mep methods particularly the tc based data fusion methods do not need the rain gauge data this indicates the effectiveness and generality of the tc based data fusion methods however the performance of the data fusion results is sensitive to the accuracy of the original input data lyu et al 2020 pointed out that this issue can be addressed by estimating the weights using cc rather than rmse since cc is not affected by the original input data however this approach may not be appropriate for mtc method as the real cc in the mtc method cannot be obtained dong et al 2020 demonstrated that the problem could be solved by eliminating false precipitation events using a reference product nevertheless it is difficult to find a reliable reference product especially over the remote mountainous areas notably this is a common defect for all data fusion methods and the most effective solution to reducing this error is the adoption of more reliable inputs in addition as shown in eq 12 14 the merged weights in the tc based methods are determined by the variance of each collocated estimate in this study we used four years 2015 2018 of daily precipitation data to obtain the variance of each collocated estimate and thus the value of variance is relatively stable it is noted that the quantitative influence of time series length of input data on weight and data fusion results should be further studied in the future it should be highlighted that the presence of zero value precipitation in time series must be preprocessed in the mtc method since the mtc method requires a logarithmic transformation of the precipitation data alemohammad et al 2015 and massari et al 2017 simply removed the zero values in rainfall time series however this approach faces the challenge of shortening the time series of rainfall massari et al 2017 the challenge is particularly acute for daily precipitation because daily precipitation contains a significant number of zero values especially in dry areas to overcome the shortcomings a very small constant was generally used to replace the zero value roebeling et al 2012 and li et al 2018 replaced zero values with 10 3 and 10 9 to estimate rmse respectively however a systematic analysis is still lacking for zero value replacement in error estimation and data fusion this study compared seven different values 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 and 10 9 to investigate the influence of zero value replacement on error estimation and data fusion based on triple a it was shown that the error estimation results of rmse increased when the replacement data varies from 10 3 to 10 9 because the mean value of precipitation logarithmic transformation results was close to 0 the logarithmic transformation results of the small replacement value would lead to large deviation to the mean value for example the logarithmic transformation result of the small replacement value of 10 9 was 9 this could be the reason why rmse increased when the replacement data varies from 10 3 to 10 9 in particular there was no significant difference of zero value replacement on precipitation data fusion results which may be caused by the inverse transformation of precipitation data the main limitation for the application of tc based methods is the requirement of three independent inputs although there are many available multi source precipitation products in recent years they are difficult to mutually meet the independence requirement because of the same data sources among them lyu et al 2020 dong et al 2019 proposed a double instrumental variable algorithm to overcome the limitation of tc methods by using the lag time series of both two datasets since it is challenging to acquire three independent precipitation datasets more efforts should be paid to develop a robust two variable algorithm for precipitation error estimation and data fusion in future studies 6 conclusions a comprehensive study on error estimation and data fusion of multi source precipitation products by tc and mtc methods was conducted over the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 era5 had the best performance over the yangtze river basin while the pcdr had the worst accuracy all gridded precipitation estimates had an underestimation of rain gauge data and poor detection capability of heavy precipitation tc method tended to underestimate rmse of daily precipitation when compared to the traditional method while mtc method had consistent performance for precipitation error estimation owing to the employment of multiplicative error model in mtc and using the reasonable replacement of zero values the data fusion results by both tc and mtc methods showed consistency with rain gauge data and had obvious improvement compared to the original triplets moreover the performance of tc based precipitation data fusion methods were similar to the other two widely used data fusion methods bayesian model averaging bma and random forest based merging procedure rf mep both bma and re mep require the rain gauge data as inputs but the tc based methods do not require the rain gauge data which makes the tc based methods have better potential particularly for regions with sparse rain gauges or even no gauges this study demonstrated the effectiveness and generality of the tc based methods in data fusion of multi source precipitation products to achieve improved data with better accuracy credit authorship contribution statement cheng chen conceptualization methodology writing

3709,error estimation and data fusion are critical to improving the accuracy of global model and satellite based precipitation products for practical applications however they face challenges over vast areas of the world due to limited ground observations triple collocation tc method can overcome this limitation and provide an efficient way for error estimation without the ground truth and thus also for data fusion by leveraging multi source observations and model outputs which have been increasingly available in recent years in this work we conducted a comprehensive study on error estimation and data fusion of a number of global gridded precipitation products over the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 using tc and multiplicative tc mtc methods we use three satellite based precipitation products such as the imerg final imerg f persiann cdr pcdr and sm2rain ascat sm2r and one reanalysis dataset era5 which contains precipitation estimates they were grouped into two tc triplets based on different combinations imerg f sm2r era5 and pcdr sm2r era5 for performance evaluation the tc based error estimation methods were compared to the traditional method using rain gauge data and the tc based data fusion methods were compared with two widely used data fusion methods bayesian model averaging bma and random forest based merging procedure rf mep results showed that era5 had the best performance with the largest correlation coefficient cc 0 435 while pcdr had the worst accuracy with the smallest cc 0 304 and the largest absolute relative bias rb 0 365 tc tended to underestimate the root mean square error rmse with respect to the traditional gauged based method but mtc showed a consistent result owing to the employment of a multiplicative error model the performance of tc based data fusion methods had no significant difference from bma and rf mep all data fusion results were better than the original triplets as the mean cc value increased from 0 38 to 0 47 and the mean rmse decreased from 15 0 to 13 5 mm day in addition we found that the zero value replacement in mtc had great influence on error estimation while had limited impacts on data fusion keywords triple collocation multiple gridded precipitation estimates error estimation data fusion yangtze river basin 1 introduction precipitation is essential in the studies of global climate change and hydrological cycle kidd and huffman 2011 ashouri et al 2015 accurate precipitation estimates are also critical for hydrological simulation natural disaster prevention and decision makings in economy ecology agriculture and many other fields rogelis and werner 2018 this is particularly important for the yangtze river basin which is vulnerable to heavy rainfall and frequent floods caused by east asian monsoon wang et al 2013 the great flood in 1998 in yangtze river has caused huge losses to national economy and people s life zong and chen 2000 ground based observations rain gauge or gauge corrected ground radar data are generally considered as the most accurate observations of precipitation however the rain gauges are spatially sparse due to limited deployments over complex terrains and harsh natural environment and the ground radar data often contain large errors over complex terrain areas ebrahimi et al 2017 therefore the ground based observations are difficult to obtain detailed precipitation information over the regions where large topographic gradients present such as the yangtze river basin in recent years spatially continuous precipitation estimates from various satellite and reanalysis based products have been increasingly available providing an alternative approach for high resolution precipitation monitoring from global and regional scales ebert et al 2007 satgé et al 2020 the global satellite precipitation products include the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 tropical rainfall measuring mission multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2015 and soil moisture to rain advanced scatterometer sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 however the satellite based precipitation estimates suffer from random and systemic errors owing to insufficient sampling and imperfect retrieval algorithms behrangi and wen 2017 thus different satellite based precipitation products usually have season and location dependent performances because of the variations in data sources and retrieval algorithm s skills the global reanalysis products such as era interim the interim european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis cite and era5 the 5 th generation ecmwf reanalysis cite also contain precipitation fields due to the observation errors of meteorological inputs and the deficiencies of forecast models there are also large errors in the reanalysis based precipitation estimates as a whole these gridded precipitation products are an indirect way to monitor precipitation the embedded errors should be assessed before real world applications based on error estimates different gridded precipitation products can be further integrated via data fusion to fully take advantage of their relative strengths and improve the quality of precipitation estimation plenty of studies have investigated the errors in different precipitation products in recent years e g li et al 2015 yong et al 2015 tang et al 2016 beck et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 tan et al 2018 chen et al 2020 tang et al 2020 however these studies generally considered the rain gauge observations as ground truth error free for validation which may lead to challenges at the regions where reliable and dense gauge data is limited or unavailable li et al 2018 triple collocation tc method was originally developed by stoffelen 1998 to assess the errors of ocean wind speed products but recently it has been applied in many other fields for error estimation such as soil moisture dong and crow 2017 surface albedo wu et al 2019 and land water storage van dijk et al 2014 compared to traditional gauge based verification tc method provides an efficient way to quantify errors using three independent input products without knowing of the true values of target variables alemohammad et al 2015 for the error estimation of gridded precipitation data roebeling et al 2012 firstly employed tc method to evaluate the errors associated with the precipitation estimates from three weather radars in the europe an extended tc etc method was developed by mccoll et al 2014 to estimate the root mean square error rmse as well as the correlation coefficient cc between each collocated variable and the unknown true values both tc and etc methods were established based on the assumption that precipitation estimates can be related to the true values in the form of an additive model however it is generally recognized that the multiplicative model has a better prediction capability and is more suitable for error estimation of daily precipitation tian et al 2013 by replacing the additive error model with a multiplicative error model alemohammad et al 2015 developed a multiplicative tc mtc method to evaluate precipitation products over the united states li et al 2018 adopted mtc to evaluate different precipitation products over china and it was found that mtc could be an appropriate option for error estimation however the applicability and superiority of tc and mtc methods in precipitation error estimation needs further investigations meanwhile the fusion of multi source precipitation data has been implemented in many recent studies data fusion can synthesize multi source information and shows better performance than all or most of the individual precipitation estimate ma et al 2018 a variety of precipitation data fusion methods have been proposed including the optimal interpolation xie and xiong 2011 linearized weighting procedure woldemeskel et al 2013 non parametric kernel smoothing li and shao 2010 bayesian analysis wang et al 2012 ma et al 2018 ma et al 2021 and random forest based merging procedure rf mep baez villanuev et al 2020 however these methods usually require information from rain gauges which are limited or even unavailable in vast areas of the world since tc methods can characterize the errors of three independent measurements it is straightforward to also use them to derive a better precipitation estimate through merging multi source precipitation data so far only a few studies have focused on tc based methods for precipitation merging dong et al 2020 lyu et al 2020 these studies have shown that tc based methods had great potential in data fusion without the requirement of rain gauge data however there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation on the tc based data fusion methods in comparison to other data fusion methods to address the above knowledge gaps this study investigated the error estimation and data fusion of multiple gridded precipitation products over the yangtze river basin using the tc based methods tc and mtc the tc based data fusion methods were also compared with two commonly used data fusion methods bma and rf mep the main objectives of this study are to 1 assess the errors of multiple gridded precipitation products using tc and mtc methods 2 evaluate the performance of the tc based data fusion methods in comparison to other commonly used methods 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin is located within a latitude of 24 30 35 45 n and a longitude of 90 30 124 30 e and is the largest river basin in china the yangtze river originates from the tanggula mountain and flows through 19 provinces from the west to the east china sea with a catchment area of 1 8 million km2 the terrain over the yangtze river basin is extremely complex the elevation is slanted downward from the west 3500 5000 m to the east below 500 m fig 1 a forest grassland and arable land dry land and paddy field are the main land cover types accounting for 91 3 of the total watershed area fig 1b affected by both summer southwest monsoon and southeast monsoon most regions of the yangtze river basin is dominated by a sub tropical monsoon climate and the average annual precipitation is approximately 1100 mm li 2015 2 2 datasets four different daily precipitation products including imerg final persiann cdr sm2rain ascat and era5 were used in this study for the evaluation over yangtze river basin during the period 2015 2018 sm2rain ascat was selected as it is produced based on remotely sensed soil moisture and thus it can be regarded as an independent precipitation estimate relative to reanalysis based precipitation estimates and the other satellite based precipitation estimates e g imerg f and pcdr sm2rain ascat and imerg final data were resampled to 0 25 resolution using linear interpolation to be consistent with persiann cdr and era5 a brief description of each precipitation product is presented in the following subsections 2 2 1 gpm imerg v06 the global precipitation measurement gpm mission was launched on february 27 in 2014 by the united states national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa as the new generation global satellite based precipitation observatory gpm provides precipitation estimates at a 0 1 spatial resolution with spatial coverage from 60 s to 60 n

huffman et al 2015 the latest released imerg final v06b data denoted as imerg f at daily scale were used in this study the product is available at https gpm1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov data gpm l3 2 2 2 persiann cdr persiann is a satellite based precipitation retrieval algorithm to convert the infrared ir information from geostationary satellites into rain rates using an artificial neural network technique ashouri et al 2015 the persiann cdr data denoted as pcdr are derived by adjusting persiann estimates using gpcp monthly precipitation and it provides daily precipitation estimates at 0 25 spatial resolution from 1983 to present with a spatial coverage between 60 s and 60 n the pcdr daily precipitation data which are available at https www ncei noaa gov data precipitation persiann access sorooshian et al 2014 were used in the study 2 2 3 sm2rain ascat the sm2rain ascat denoted as sm2r dataset provides global daily rainfall estimates from 2007 to june 2020 with a spatial resolution of 12 5 km and it is derived from ascat satellite soil moisture sm observations using the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2014 the sm2rain algorithm uses two successive sm retrievals to estimate rainfall by the calculation of the difference between two successive sm measurements based on the inversion of water balance equation brocca et al 2019 this study uses the version 1 1 sm2rain ascat daily product which is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3405563 2 2 4 era5 era5 is the new generation of global atmospheric reanalysis precipitation estimation developed by the european center for medium range weather forecasts the era5 data has been produced by the numerical weather forecast modeling and data assimilation based on humidity and temperature information hersbach et al 2018 the era5 reanalysis precipitation product at daily scale with a 0 25 resolution is available at https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets reanalysis datasets era5 and was used in this study 2 2 5 rain gauge data rain gauge data denoted as gauge from 615 gauge stations over the yangtze river basin during 2015 2018 was obtained from the china meteorological administration in this study the dataset provides hourly precipitation records from about 2400 automatic weather stations over china since january 1951 with a series of rigorous quality controls shen et al 2010 in this study the hourly precipitation data was accumulated to daily precipitation 3 methodology 3 1 tc based methods for error estimation and data fusion 3 1 1 triple collocation tc tc can be used to quantify the error variance of geophysical variables using three independent measurements without the requirement of ground truth data dong et al 2020 it should be noted that tc is established based on a fundamental assumption that three collocated variables have zero mean residual errors and are uncorrelated with each other and with the true values alemohammad et al 2015 the standard form of tc is shown as follows 1 p i α i β i p true ε i where p i and ε i i 1 2 3 represent the ith precipitation estimates and the ith observation errors of the unknown true value p true respectively α i and β i represent the intercept and slope respectively in the tc method the observation error ε i is an additive factor based on the solution of the covariance of eq 1 a 3 3 covariance matrix can be obtained as shown in eq 2 the three diagonal elements of the covariance matrix represent the variances of three collocated estimates which can be calculated by eq 3 2 c ij c o v p i p j β i β j σ p true 2 3 σ p i 2 d p i d α i β i p true ε i β i 2 σ p true 2 σ ε i 2 where c ij is the covariance between two different input collocated estimates d and cov represent the variance and covariance respectively σ is the standard variance by the combination of eq 2 and eq 3 we can deduce eq 4 6 details of the derivation process can be found in li et al 2018 it can be found that the rmse σ ε i 2 between each collocated estimate and the true value can be obtained without the known of σ p true 4 σ ε 1 2 σ p 1 2 β 1 2 σ p true 2 c 11 c 13 c 23 c 12 5 σ ε 2 2 σ p 2 2 β 2 2 σ p true 2 c 22 c 12 c 23 c 13 6 σ ε 3 2 σ p 3 2 β 3 2 σ p true 2 c 33 c 13 c 23 c 12 3 1 2 multiplicative triple collocation mtc different from tc the mtc method adopted multiplicative error model to estimate errors of daily precipitation alemohammad et al 2015 in the multiplicative error model the random error e ε i is a multiplicative factor the multiplicative error model is defined as 7 p i α i p true β i e ε i by the logarithmic transformation and the substitutions of α i ln α i r true ln p true and r i ln p i the eq 7 can be simplified to the linear form in eq 8 8 r i α i β i r true ε i similar to the solution of rmse in tc the rmse in mtc was calculated according to eq 4 6 however it is noted that rmse results are in logarithmic scale in the mtc method which makes them meaningless in this study the eq 9 which was proposed by alemohammad et al 2015 was adopted to estimate the real rmse σ p i 9 σ p i μ p i σ r i where σ r i represents the rmse in logarithmic scale μ p i represents the mean of the original precipitation data 3 1 3 least squares based data fusion a least squares based data fusion method proposed by yilmaz et al 2012 was used to calculate the weight of each collocated estimate in this study based on the tc and mtc estimates the basic function of the least squares based data fusion is shown as follows 10 p f ω 1 p 1 ω 2 p 2 ω 3 p 3 s t ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 where ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are the weight of each collocated estimate respectively p f is the desired fused precipitation estimation by calculating the variance of eq 10 the eq 11 is obtained the weights can be calculated by eq 12 14 based on the object of minimizing σ p f 2 11 σ p f 2 ω 1 2 σ p 1 2 ω 2 2 σ p 1 2 1 ω 1 ω 2 2 σ p 3 2 12 ω 1 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 13 ω 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 14 ω 3 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 1 2 σ p 3 2 σ p 2 2 σ p 3 2 using the above obtained weights the data fusion results of multi source precipitation data can be achieved by eq 10 without the requirement of rain gauge data it should be noted that the p f results obtained by mtc are in logarithmic scale therefore an inverse transformation must be conducted using eq 15 to obtain the real p f in the mtc method 15 p f exp ω 1 r 1 ω 2 r 2 ω 3 r 3 3 2 experiment design due to the requirement of three independent input precipitation data in the tc based methods tc and mtc four precipitation products at daily scale over yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 imerg f pcdr sm2r and era5 were grouped into two triplets triplet a imerg f sm2r era5 triplet b pcdr sm2r era5 to satisfy the requirement both of era5 and sm2r precipitation products are included in each triplet and the remaining precipitation product in each triplet is the imerg f and pcdr respectively the purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the errors of multiple precipitation datasets by tc and mtc methods without the ground observations the results from tc based methods were then compared with the traditional method the traditional method is to calculate error statistics of products using gauge data that are considered as ground truth in addition the same precipitation product in different triplets may have different results which will influence the stability of tc based methods in this study the variable control method was adopted to analyze the reliability and stability of the tc based methods through the comparison of rmse of sm2r and era5 in two different triplets triple a and triple b since the zero values of precipitation data should be replaced in the mtc method before the implement of logarithmic transformation li et al 2018 seven different replacement values 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 and 10 9 were tested to assess the influence of zero value replacement on error estimation and data fusion using the triple a in this study the tc based data fusion methods were also compared with two commonly used data fusion methods bma and rf mep more details about the bma and rf mep methods can be found in wang et al 2012 and baez villanuev et al 2020 in this study the bma and rf mep data fusion methods also included two triples that were used in tc based data fusion methods triplet a imerg f sm2r era5 triplet b pcdr sm2r era5 all of the four gridded precipitation products and the rain gauge data had daily precipitation data from 2015 to 2018 over yangtze river basin because the bma and rf mep methods require the input of rain gauge data the cross validation method was adopted in this study to ensure independent validation of the data fusion results specifically all 615 gauges data are randomly divided into three equal parts each part includes 205 gauges two parts data from 410 gauges were used to train the bma and rf mep models and the remaining one of the three equal parts was used to evaluate the merged precipitation this process was repeated for three times and then the merged precipitation is validated for all gauges it is noted that the topography related datasets were excluded in the rf mep method to make it comparable with the bma method and the two main parameters the number of regression trees and the node size in the rf regression model mentioned by baez villanuev et al 2020 were set as 200 and 5 respectively by a grid search algorithm in which the parameter sets with the best training result were selected 3 3 evaluation metrics all statistical analysis between grid based precipitation estimates and point based rain gauge data was conducted in a direct comparison way using the nearest neighbor method chen et al 2018 only the grids containing at least one rain gauge were assessed and the other grids with no rain gauges were excluded from the evaluation four commonly used metrics including cc rmse relative rmse rrmse and relative bias rb table 1 were used to evaluate the quality of the gridded precipitation products and the performances of data fusion methods using rain gauge data the csi was also calculated to quantitatively assess the precipitation detection ability by identifying rain no rain events csi represents the overall fraction of precipitation events correctly detected by the gridded precipitation estimates two different rainfall rates 1 and 25 mm day respectively were set to calculate the csi csi 1 and csi 25 respectively because the rainfall rates below 1 mm day and over 25 mm day represent light precipitation and heavy precipitation respectively and the evaluation of light heavy precipitation are prone to large uncertainties tian et al 2009 4 results 4 1 accuracy of multiple gridded precipitation products with the traditional method table 2 shows the accuracy evaluation results of different gridded precipitation products in the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 at daily scale using the traditional method with rain gauge data the cc results of imerg f pcdr sm2r and era5 were 0 394 0 304 0 381 and 0 435 respectively era5 and sm2r had relatively smaller rmse and rrmse than those of imerg f and pcdr all gridded precipitation estimates had negative rb indicating an underestimation of rain gauge data in the yangtze river basin pcdr had poor performance with the smallest cc and largest absolute rb in terms of csi imerg f had the largest csi 25 indicating the best performance for heavy rainfall detection compared with csi 1 and csi 25 it could be found that all gridded precipitation estimates had poor detection ability for heavy rainfall with small csi 25 as a whole era5 had the best performance with relatively small rrmse and relatively large cc as well as csi values fig 2 shows the mean daily rainfall of four gridded precipitation products and rain gauge observations from 2015 to 2018 at each gauge station in the yangtze river basin the spatial patterns of four gridded precipitation products showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest which is consistent with the rain gauge data the large mean daily precipitation approximately 6 0 mm day was mainly distributed in eastern part of the yangtze river basin while the small mean daily precipitation less than 2 0 mm day was mainly distributed in western part when compared to the rain gauge data sm2r and era5 had larger mean daily precipitation in the central parts of the yangtze river basin pcdr had obvious underestimation in the eastern part of the yangtze river basin compared to the other three gridded precipitation products as a whole imerg f had more similar spatial pattern to the rain gauge data fig 3 shows the evaluation metrics cc rmse and rrmse of multiple gridded precipitation products from 2015 to 2018 at each gauge station in the yangtze river basin the cc of four gridded precipitation estimates were large in the eastern parts and small in the western parts of the yangtze river basin in terms of cc pcdr had the worst performance in space the rmse had a consistent trend with the mean daily precipitation showing a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest all gridded precipitation estimates had large rrmse in the sichuan basin where dry land is the main land cover type as shown in fig 1b indicating a poor accuracy in such region 4 2 error assessment by the tc based methods table 3 presents the influence of zero value replacement in the mtc method on error estimation rmse results of imerg f in triple a the rmse values increased when the replacement data varies from 10 3 to 10 9 the rmse value was the smallest 15 62 mm day when the zero value replacement was 10 3 and was the largest 42 06 mm day when the zero value replacement was 10 9 the estimated rmse was close to the traditional method when zero value replacement was 10 3 similar results were also found in the error estimation of pcdr in triple b results are not shown for conciseness therefore 10 3 was finally used as zero value replacement in error estimation of the mtc method fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of rmse derived by tc based error estimation methods tc and mtc table 4 shows the statistic results of rmse of two different triplets a and b by tc based methods and traditional method the spatial distributions of rmse by the tc based methods were consistent with the spatial distributions of mean daily precipitation showing a descending gradient from southeast to northwest the rmse results of imerg f and pcdr by tc were obviously smaller than those by mtc method and traditional method in the entire region from the statistic results of rmse by three different error estimation methods it was found that the mtc method is similar to the traditional method while the tc method had a significant underestimation in terms of two different triplets the rmse of sm2r and era5 had no significant differences between the two different triplets a and b indicating the reliability and stability of tc and mtc methods 4 3 evaluation and comparison of tc based precipitation merging methods table 5 shows the influence of zero value replacement in the mtc method on data fusion results of triple a three statistic metrics cc rmse and rrmse were calculated between rain gauge data and the data fusion results of triplet a three metrics of the data fusion results had no significant difference by using seven different replacement values which indicated the zero value replacement had no substantial influence on the result of precipitation data fusion similar phenomena was also found in the data fusion results of triplet b results are not shown for conciseness therefore the value of 10 3 also used in error estimation was finally used as zero value replacement in the mtc method for precipitation data fusion fig 5 presents the spatial distribution of weights of each collocated estimate used in the tc and mtc data fusion methods in the yangtze river basin for the two triplets in tc sm2r had obviously higher weights than the other collocated precipitation estimates the weights of sm2r and era5 in tc triplet a were similar to those in tc triplet b while the weight of imerg f in tc triplet a was lower than pcdr in tc triplet b for the two triplets in mtc sm2r had relatively high weights in the east of the yangtze river basin while era5 had relatively high weights in the west of the yangtze river basin as a whole the same precipitation product e g sm2r and era5 in different triplets of tc or mtc method had stable results of weight however different data fusion methods e g tc triplet a and mtc triplet a have certain differences in weight because there is a logarithmic transformation of the precipitation data in the mtc method fig 6 presents the data fusion results of mean daily precipitation of two different triplets by tc mtc bma and rf mep methods in the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 for each data fusion method the merged mean daily precipitation showed similar spatial pattern and was consistent with the rain gauge data the data fusion results of mean daily precipitation by mtc method was smaller than those by tc bma and rf mep methods especially in the southeast of the yangtze river basin between triplet a and b it was found that the data fusion results of mean daily precipitation of triplet a were larger than those of triplet b which was relevant to the precipitation amount of imerg f and sm2r table 6 shows the evaluation metrics of data fusion results of two different triplets by tc mtc bma and rf mep methods using rain gauge data compared to the original triplets table 2 the data fusion results were improved in accuracy the mean cc increased from about 0 38 to 0 47 and the mean rmse decreased from about 15 0 to 13 5 mm day between triplet a and b the data fusion results of triplet a had better performances than those of triplet b with smaller rmse larger cc and csi values between different data fusion methods the evaluation metrics of four data fusion methods had no significant difference the data fusion results by tc based methods were sensitive to the accuracy of the original input data and showed negative values of rb as a whole the rf mep method had the largest csi values and the smallest absolute rb indicating the best performance 5 discussion four global gridded precipitation estimates imerg f pcdr sm2r and era5 were selected in this study to test the performances of the tc based methods for error estimation and data fusion the comprehensive assessment on four gridded precipitation products showed that four precipitation estimates decreased from the southeast to the northwest in space which was consistent with the rain gauge data it is typically influenced by the land and sea distance altitude and monsoon climate li et al 2013 era5 had better performances with smaller rmse and larger cc previous studies have reported that the sm2rain method is good at achieving low rmse because it can accurately reproduce the accumulated rainfall over a period of time ciabatta et al 2017 brocca et al 2019 among the four products sm2r had relatively small rmse in the yangtze river basin however the above estimations were all based on the traditional evaluation method which can only assess the performance of the pixel based precipitation products at the rain gauge station the precipitation observation errors over the regions without gauge stations cannot be evaluated in addition it is noted that there is a typical scale mismatch issue between point based rain gauge data and grid based precipitation estimates ebrahimi et al 2017 this could be a source of error in evaluation of gridded precipitation products using the traditional method with rain gauge observations as the ground reference therefore in this study the tc based methods tc and mtc were adopted to estimate errors of the multiple gridded precipitation products without the requirement of rain gauge data compared to the traditional method rmse estimated by tc had an obvious underestimation while rmse estimated by mtc had very small differences indicating the applicability of mtc method for error assessment it is mainly because the multiplicative model adopted in mtc method is more appropriate at daily scale to represent the relationship between precipitation observation errors and the rainfall true values hossain and anagnostou 2006 similar findings are presented in alemohammad et al 2015 and li et al 2018 this consistency demonstrates the superiority of the mtc method for error estimation than tc method in addition since the error statistics of different precipitation products could be obtained by the tc based methods the obtained rmse results have the potential to be incorporated into data fusion algorithms alemohammad et al 2015 dong et al 2020 the data fusion results by tc and mtc methods were similar and both showed better performances than the original triplets in addition the data fusion results showed that the tc based methods are approximate to the commonly used bma and rf mep methods particularly the tc based data fusion methods do not need the rain gauge data this indicates the effectiveness and generality of the tc based data fusion methods however the performance of the data fusion results is sensitive to the accuracy of the original input data lyu et al 2020 pointed out that this issue can be addressed by estimating the weights using cc rather than rmse since cc is not affected by the original input data however this approach may not be appropriate for mtc method as the real cc in the mtc method cannot be obtained dong et al 2020 demonstrated that the problem could be solved by eliminating false precipitation events using a reference product nevertheless it is difficult to find a reliable reference product especially over the remote mountainous areas notably this is a common defect for all data fusion methods and the most effective solution to reducing this error is the adoption of more reliable inputs in addition as shown in eq 12 14 the merged weights in the tc based methods are determined by the variance of each collocated estimate in this study we used four years 2015 2018 of daily precipitation data to obtain the variance of each collocated estimate and thus the value of variance is relatively stable it is noted that the quantitative influence of time series length of input data on weight and data fusion results should be further studied in the future it should be highlighted that the presence of zero value precipitation in time series must be preprocessed in the mtc method since the mtc method requires a logarithmic transformation of the precipitation data alemohammad et al 2015 and massari et al 2017 simply removed the zero values in rainfall time series however this approach faces the challenge of shortening the time series of rainfall massari et al 2017 the challenge is particularly acute for daily precipitation because daily precipitation contains a significant number of zero values especially in dry areas to overcome the shortcomings a very small constant was generally used to replace the zero value roebeling et al 2012 and li et al 2018 replaced zero values with 10 3 and 10 9 to estimate rmse respectively however a systematic analysis is still lacking for zero value replacement in error estimation and data fusion this study compared seven different values 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 and 10 9 to investigate the influence of zero value replacement on error estimation and data fusion based on triple a it was shown that the error estimation results of rmse increased when the replacement data varies from 10 3 to 10 9 because the mean value of precipitation logarithmic transformation results was close to 0 the logarithmic transformation results of the small replacement value would lead to large deviation to the mean value for example the logarithmic transformation result of the small replacement value of 10 9 was 9 this could be the reason why rmse increased when the replacement data varies from 10 3 to 10 9 in particular there was no significant difference of zero value replacement on precipitation data fusion results which may be caused by the inverse transformation of precipitation data the main limitation for the application of tc based methods is the requirement of three independent inputs although there are many available multi source precipitation products in recent years they are difficult to mutually meet the independence requirement because of the same data sources among them lyu et al 2020 dong et al 2019 proposed a double instrumental variable algorithm to overcome the limitation of tc methods by using the lag time series of both two datasets since it is challenging to acquire three independent precipitation datasets more efforts should be paid to develop a robust two variable algorithm for precipitation error estimation and data fusion in future studies 6 conclusions a comprehensive study on error estimation and data fusion of multi source precipitation products by tc and mtc methods was conducted over the yangtze river basin from 2015 to 2018 era5 had the best performance over the yangtze river basin while the pcdr had the worst accuracy all gridded precipitation estimates had an underestimation of rain gauge data and poor detection capability of heavy precipitation tc method tended to underestimate rmse of daily precipitation when compared to the traditional method while mtc method had consistent performance for precipitation error estimation owing to the employment of multiplicative error model in mtc and using the reasonable replacement of zero values the data fusion results by both tc and mtc methods showed consistency with rain gauge data and had obvious improvement compared to the original triplets moreover the performance of tc based precipitation data fusion methods were similar to the other two widely used data fusion methods bayesian model averaging bma and random forest based merging procedure rf mep both bma and re mep require the rain gauge data as inputs but the tc based methods do not require the rain gauge data which makes the tc based methods have better potential particularly for regions with sparse rain gauges or even no gauges this study demonstrated the effectiveness and generality of the tc based methods in data fusion of multi source precipitation products to achieve improved data with better accuracy credit authorship contribution statement cheng chen conceptualization methodology writing
